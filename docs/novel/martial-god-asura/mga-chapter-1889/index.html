 <p><strong> Chapter 1889 - Beautifully Done</strong></p>
 <p>What sort of situation was this? Chu Feng actually vomited out the Black Lotus Goo?</p>
 <p>At that moment, not to mention Xian Yushi and the others, even Princess Lingyue was stunned.</p>
 <p>Compared to the others, Princess Lingyue knew the reason why Chu Feng was able to vomit the Black Lotus Goo. Merely, she did not expect that not only was Chu Feng able to eat it, he was even able to vomit it out.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, this…” Princess Lingyue was also at a loss as for what to say.</p>
 <p>“Cough, cough…”</p>
 <p>“Everyone, please don’t misunderstand. This bowl of Black Lotus Goo before everyone was indeed vomited from my mouth.”</p>
 <p>“I believe that everyone must be thinking that this bowl of Black Lotus Goo is extremely filthy and no longer edible. However, this is precisely the misunderstanding.”</p>
 <p>“Although this bowl of Black Lotus Goo was indeed vomited from my mouth, it is actually not dirty at all. Why is it not dirty you ask? It’s because even though it has passed through my mouth, my esophagus and my stomach, it was not yet digested.”</p>
 <p>“Why is that?”</p>
 <p>“It’s because I sealed it with a spirit formation. It is the equivalent of me storing this bowl of Black Lotus Goo within my stomach without actually causing any damage to it. Thus, it is completely clean, as clean as it was before it entered my mouth.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, everyone, please do not think that just because it’s been vomited from my mouth that it’s something that I ate.”</p>
 <p>“Strictly speaking, I did not eat it. Instead, I merely stored it,” Chu Feng explained to the crowd with a beaming smile. His appearance could be described with a single word -- lowly.</p>
 <p>“Bullshit! You actually want me to eat your vomit? Don’t think you can do that!!!” Xian Yushi was so extremely angered by Chu Feng that he started to jump around angrily. He was simply on the verge of being driven mad.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng actually wanted him to eat his vomit? This was simply an insult, an enormous humiliation.</p>
 <p>“I have a question: Chu Feng, why did you eat this Black Lotus Goo?” Princess Lingyue asked. As for this question… it was most definitely a question that she already knew the answer to.</p>
 <p>Hearing that question, Chu Feng felt delight in his heart. At this moment, he had realized Princess Lingyue’s intentions.</p>
 <p>“I was forced to eat it by Young Master Yushi. However, I felt that this thing would not be tasty. Yet, I found it improper for me to refuse him. Thus, I could only use my spirit formation to seal it and then store it temporarily in my stomach. Originally, I had planned to vomit it out later.”</p>
 <p>“However, as Young Master Yushi needs it right now, and I just so happen to have it with me, I decided that I might as well take it out,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>At that moment, a woman who possessed a youthful appearance but was actually not of the younger generation asked, “Forced you? Why did he force you? Furthermore, even if he forced you, why would you give in to him? Your cultivation is clearly above his. I do not understand what about him you would fear.”</p>
 <p>This woman’s age was close to that of Princess Lingyue, she was also roughly two thousand years old. However, her cultivation was inferior to Princess Lingyue’s. That being said, her cultivation wasn’t weak either. She was a rank two Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>“Princess Lingyue understands this matter. I have come to the Elf Kingdom to request a single Ten Thousand Leaves Sparrowtail Flower.”</p>
 <p>“Young Master Yushi said that he would hand me a Ten Thousand Leaves Sparrowtail Flower should I eat the Black Lotus Goo. Merely… I never expected that Young Master Yushi would actually go back on his word. I had already eaten the Black Lotus Goo, yet he did not present to me any Ten Thousand Leaves Sparrowtail Flower,” When speaking those words, Chu Feng had a disappointed and sad expression on his face. It was as if he had been greatly deceived.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the crowd were all emotionally moved by Chu Feng’s pitiful appearance. When they looked to Xian Yushi again, their gazes revealed a trace of disgust. They all felt Xian Yushi’s conduct to be extremely disgraceful.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, don’t you spout rubbish. I merely said that you would have the chance to obtain a Ten Thousand Leaves Sparrowtail Flower, and never said that I would definitely get you one,” Xian Yushi hurriedly explained.</p>
 <p>“Impudent! Based on what you said, you really did use the Ten Thousand Leaves Sparrowtail Flower to force Chu Feng to eat the Black Lotus Goo?” At that moment, Princess Lingyue was deeply enraged. The reason for that was because Xian Yushi had indirectly admitted to Chu Feng’s story being true by providing that explanation.</p>
 <p>“Big sis Lingyue, I have not, please… please listen to my explanation,” At that moment, Xian Yushi realized that he had misspoken.</p>
 <p>“Do not bother explaining. I told you to receive Chu Feng. Yet you treated him in such a manner. You have truly disappointed me,” As Princess Lingyue spoke, she seized the bowl of Black Lotus Goo from Chu Feng’s hand and handed it to Xian Yushi. She said, “Eat it. This is your punishment.”</p>
 <p>“Ah? Big sis Lingyue, that is something that Chu Feng vomited up. How could I eat his vomit?” Xian Yushi shook his head repeatedly. If he were to eat the bowl of Black Lotus Goo, how could he possibly face anyone anymore should this matter be spread?</p>
 <p>“Young Master Yushi, you can eat it without worry. This bowl of Black Lotus Goo is exactly the same as when you had me eat it,” Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.</p>
 <p>Xian Yushi was so angry that he shouted, “Don’t give me that bullshit! You’ve clearly eaten it. How could it still be the same?!” If it wasn’t for the fact that Chu Feng had incited disharmony among the crowd, how could his big sis Lingyue possibly treat him like this?</p>
 <p>“Are you going to eat it or not?” Princess Lingyue’s long, shapely eyebrows narrowed. The gentleness in her eyes was no longer present, but was instead replaced with endless anger.</p>
 <p>Seeing that angry expression, Xian Yushi’s body shivered, and his complexion turned pale with fright. For the past couple years, he had followed Princess Lingyue and trained with her. Thus, he knew her personality much better than others.</p>
 <p>While Princess Lingyue might generally be very amiable, if she was to be angered, she would be extremely frightening.</p>
 <p>“I, I’ll eat, eat it,” At that moment, Xian Yushi accepted the bowl. As he looked at the Black Lotus Goo in the bowl, he grimaced, and his expression began to twist. He had the appearance of wanting to vomit.</p>
 <p>At that moment, he suddenly turned his gaze to Chu Feng. He had an extremely ferocious appearance. It was as if he wanted to kill Chu Feng on the spot. In fact, if Xian Yushi was capable, he would definitely kill Chu Feng. Merely, Chu Feng felt that Xian Yushi would not have that opportunity. Thus, Chu Feng was not worried about him. Instead, he raised his hand and said, “Young Master Yushi, you don’t have to thank me. You can go ahead and eat it.”</p>
 <p>“You!!!” Seeing Chu Feng acting like that, Xian Yushi was truly about to die from excessive anger. He had never expected that he would be forced into such a state by a human in his own territory.</p>
 <p>However, in the end, he clenched his teeth, closed his eyes, opened his mouth and directly poured that bowl of Black Lotus Goo into his mouth.</p>
 <p>He was actually really eating the Black Lotus Goo that Chu Feng had vomited up.</p>
 <p>The Black Lotus Goo was extremely sticky. After it entered his mouth, Xian Yushi was unable to swallow it, and began to use his teeth to chew it nonstop. In the end, the stickiness covered his entire mouth.</p>
 <p>“Eeeh…” Seeing this scene, many of the people present did not wish to look anymore. It was not because of the Black Lotus Goo itself. Rather, it was because this Black Lotus Goo was something that Chu Feng vomited. For Xian Yushi to eat it in such a manner, the crowd all felt a sort of disgust.</p>
 <p>“Truly disgusting,” Not to mention the others, even Her Lady Queen was unable to continue watching it.</p>
 <p>“Why is it disgusting? I didn’t eat that Black Lotus Goo, and only stored it in my stomach for a while. This is pretty much the same as storing it in a Cosmos Sack. Why would it suddenly become disgusting?” Chu Feng defended himself.</p>
 <p>“It’s not whether or not the Black Lotus Goo itself is disgusting or not. Instead, it’s just that looking at him eating it like that is extremely disgusting. After all, that came from your mouth. That is a fact that you cannot refuse to admit.”</p>
 <p>“If someone vomited something and wanted you to eat it by telling you it was clean, would you eat it?” Eggy asked.</p>
 <p>“Ehh… of course not,” Chu Feng said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“There you go! With your ability, you are totally capable of getting that Black Lotus Goo out from your stomach without making a scene. Yet, you insisted on vomiting it out before the crowd. Furthermore, you deliberately made the sound of vomiting.”</p>
 <p>“You were simply deliberately making that Xian Yushi feel disgusted. Thus, stop pretending to be innocent,” Her Lady Queen had already seen through Chu Feng’s scheme.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, it’s still Milady Queen that knows me best. That’s right, I was deliberately making that Xian Yushi feel disgusted. This is the price that he shall pay for making things difficult for me,” Chu Feng said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Humph, that’s to be expected. How could you hide anything from this Queen?” Eggy raised her little chin proudly. Then, she said, “Although it is very disgusting, I must admit that you’ve done this beautifully.”</p>
