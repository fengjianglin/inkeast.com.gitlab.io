 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng was brought to an isolated space within the Ice Summit by Wuming Xingyun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a place constructed by the World Spiritist Immortal King. The grand formation through which one could obtain the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was also located there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For the sake of helping Bai Liluo unseal the inverse seal, Wuming Xingyun borrowed the power of a grand formation within that region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That grand formation had not been constructed for a long time. It was the creation of a Saint-cloak World Spiritist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, the auras of several individuals were present within that grand formation. Chu Feng felt that it was very likely that it was constructed by Wuming Xingyun, Queen Mother Fox Immortal, Liangqiu Chengfeng and Grandmaster Long Xuan together.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their creation was completely sealed off. Looking from outside, it resembled a simple palace. However, without the spirit formation key, one would not be able to enter the palace at all, and would be unable to see the situation inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Chu Feng was not worried that Wuming Xingyun would harm Bai Liluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Wuming Xingyun’s strength, if he had wanted to harm Bai Liluo, Chu Feng would simply not be able to stop him at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, Chu Feng stood on the mountain peak outside the spirit formation. He was observing a mountain range in the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One could not see the place Chu Feng was inspecting with one’s naked eye. Even someone of Chu Feng’s cultivation could not see that place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though the space that they were in was created through world spirit techniques, it was simply enormous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, using his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng was able to see the things that he wanted to see.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a majestic grand formation there. Within that grand formation was a completely separate isolated space. No one knew exactly what the interior of that isolated space was like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One could only see that there was a gown on the topmost part of the grand formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That gown was white. It looked very plain and ordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Chu Feng knew that that ordinary-looking gown was none other than the legendary Nine Dragons Saint Cloak created by the World Spiritist Immortal King using the power of the Nine Dragons Upper Realm’s Nine Dragons Aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Reportedly, should one be able to breach that grand formation, one would be able to obtain the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, that Nine Dragons Saint Cloak was being guarded by a very powerful invisible spirit formation. Unless that grand formation was breached… no one would be able to obtain the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were twelve chinese zodiacs arranged at the entrance of the grand formation. Each zodiac measured over a thousand meters tall. They all had enormous mouths. As for those enormous mouths, they were the entrances to the grand formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In other words, there were a total of twelve entrances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inside the Fire Prison, Chu Feng had not only learned the structure of the grand formation, but he had also memorized it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng knew that the grand formation was very complicated. The different entrances led to different checkpoints. The checkpoints all possessed different levels of difficulty. However, the clues that one would obtain would also be determined by the difficulty of the checkpoints.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, only a single person could enter an entrance at a time. Unless that person was to successfully enter the grand formation or leave, no one else would be able to use that entrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When judging from the surface, the dragon zodiac’s entrance was the most difficult, whereas the rat zodiac’s entrance was the easiest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, according to the contents of the spirit formation in the Fire Prison, Chu Feng knew that there was a hidden path within the rat zodiac’s entrance. That hidden path could only be opened using a special method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, that hidden path within the rat zodiac’s entrance was actually the most difficult path among all of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brat, what’s wrong? Could you be interested in that Nine Dragons Saint Cloak?” A voice sounded from behind Chu Feng. It was Queen Mother Fox Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had soundlessly appeared behind Chu Feng. Her eyes were exceptionally beautiful, and simply capable of seizing one’s soul. If one’s tolerance was weak, one would likely be bewitched by her from a single glance. However, Chu Feng was not affected much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, I am also a world spiritist. Thus, how could I not be interested?” Chu Feng smiled faintly. Then, he said, “Senior Fox Immortal, is that grand formation really so difficult that not even you are able to breach it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Aiyo. Little brat, I seem to recall that it’s the first time that we’ve met. How did you know who I am?” Queen Mother Fox Immortal looked to Chu Feng with surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior is extremely renowned. How could junior not know about senior?” Chu Feng said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It would appear that your Chu Heavenly Clan’s seniors have deliberately shown you my portrait and warned you to keep your distance from me, right?” Queen Mother Fox Immortal complained. It would appear that she was not fond of people being on guard against her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, there’s no such thing. Besides, this junior has no intention to be afraid of senior. This junior only has respect for senior,” Chu Feng was not trying to flatter Queen Mother Fox Immortal. As a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, Queen Mother Fox Immortal was indeed worthy of Chu Feng’s respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh my, that little mouth of yours is quite sweet,” Queen Mother Fox Immortal smiled. Then, she said, “I’ve heard that an exceptional brat has appeared in the Chu Heavenly Clan. That brat is Chu Xuanyuan’s son, and is called Chu Feng.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It would appear that you’re him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This junior is indeed Chu Feng,” Chu Feng nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was not surprised by Queen Mother Fox Immortal knowing about him. After all, Liangqiu Chengfeng had arrived on the Ice Summit, and what he had done in the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Ancient Era’s remnant was also witnessed by many people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whilst very few people of the Ancestral Martial Starfield knew about his accomplishments thus far, there were definitely people that knew of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Feng, let me tell you a secret. Actually, the Nine Dragons Saint Cloak is not the only treasure left behind in that grand formation. There’s also power that will provide enormous assistance to world spiritists.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If one is able to reach the deepest region, one will be able to obtain that power. That power… might even be able to allow you to become a Saint-cloak World Spiritist,” Queen Mother Fox Immortal said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng revealed a pleasantly surprised expression upon hearing those words. However, he was actually not feeling that surprised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason for that was because Chu Feng had already learned about it from the spirit formation within the Fire Prison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the spirit formation within the Fire Prison had also mentioned that it was very difficult to obtain that power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whilst the grand formation was extremely difficult to breach, it would, at the very most, only cause harm, and would not endanger one's life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, attempting to obtain the power capable of allowing world spiritists to make a breakthrough from the grand formation would pose fatal dangers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spirit formation in the Fire Prison warned that one must not attempt to touch that power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Normally, if people of the younger generation like yourself are to enter the spirit formation, it would be very difficult to obtain anything. Apart from you, others would not even be able to pass that checkpoint to successfully enter the grand formation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, this time around, myself and those three have jointly activated the formation core. With this, the power of the grand formation has been decreased. Thus, as long as one passes the evaluation, one will most likely be able to enter the grand formation.”</span></p>

This is a very rare opportunity. Chu Feng, do you wish to give it a try?” Queen Mother Fox Immortal asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But, aren’t only those that pass the evaluation qualified to enter it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Judging from the time, the evaluation should have already begun. I am destined to not be able to enter it,” Chu Feng said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That evaluation is prepared by the four of us. If we say that you’re qualified, who would dare to say that you’re not?” Queen Mother Fox Immortal said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng smiled upon hearing those words. Whilst his smile appeared to be one of gratefulness, he was actually thinking something else in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Had Chu Feng not entered the Fire Prison and seen that rock mountain with the unsealing formation, he would’ve most definitely felt grateful toward Queen Mother Fox Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, as he had entered the Fire Prison and seen the unsealing formation, Chu Feng was not feeling appreciative.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason for that was because he knew too much about the secret of that grand formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, he knew very well that Queen Mother Fox Immortal and the other three had held this evaluation with a different purpose in mind.</span></p>
