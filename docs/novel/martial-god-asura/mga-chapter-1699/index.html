 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1699 - Misjudged</strong></p>
 <p>“Ahhh~~~”</p>
 <p>“My hand!!!”</p>
 <p>The pain of having his fist crushed came too suddenly and caught Beitang Zimo completely off guard. Immediately, his expression changed enormously, and he began to take several steps back in succession. Then, he grabbed onto his broken fist and stared at Chu Feng with overflowing hatred while shouting in pain.</p>
 <p>This could not be blamed on Beitang Zimo being too useless. Rather, Chu Feng’s palm was no ordinary palm. The pain of having his fist crushed was more than ten times more painful than normal. Not to mention Beitang Zimo, there was practically no one who could endure this sort of pain.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you actually possess a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation?”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Beitang Zhiqiang who was standing in the sky started to narrow his brows. His expression also changed greatly. The gaze that he looked to Chu Feng with became even more complicated and ice-cold.</p>
 <p>He had discovered that Chu Feng possessed a battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation. Otherwise, it would be impossible for Chu Feng to defeat Beitang Zimo, who was at the same level of cultivation as him and had activated his Imperial Bloodline, this easily.</p>
 <p>However, a battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation was something that, as of right now, only the Elf Kingdom’s little princess possessed in the entire Holy Land of Martialism.</p>
 <p>Yet, at this moment, Chu Feng had actually revealed he had this sort of battle power. This was truly too frightening. Beitang Zhiqiang had truly never expected for the unremarkable brat on the Immortal Island to possess this frightening potential.</p>
 <p>“Yoh, you actually discovered it,” Chu Feng laughed. He was not modest in the slightest. Instead, he was emitting mockery all over.</p>
 <p>“It seems that today, no matter what, you cannot be left alive,” As Beitang Zhiqiang spoke, the killing intent in his eyes grew even denser. He was planning to personally eliminate Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>If Chu Feng had possessed a slight chance of being kept alive earlier, then at this moment, Beitang Zhiqiang was determined that Chu Feng could not be left alive no matter what.</p>
 <p>He knew very well that an enemy like Chu Feng must be eliminated as quickly as possible. Otherwise, once he matured, he would become an enormous worry in the future.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha…” However, faced with those words from Beitang Zhiqiang, Chu Feng burst into loud laughter. His laughter completely puzzled the crowd.</p>
 <p>“Kill me? Did you think you had the strength to do so?” After laughing wildly, coldness suddenly shone through Chu Feng’s eyes. He actually threatened Beitang Zhiqiang.</p>
 <p>“Truly arrogant! Regardless of how exceptional your talent might be, you are only a mere Half Martial Emperor. If I wished to kill you, do you really think that you could escape?”</p>
 <p>Hearing what Chu Feng said, Beitang Zhiqiang sneered. As he spoke, he planned to attack and eliminate Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Stop,” However, right at this moment, Evildoer Tie suddenly stood in front of Beitang Zhiqiang and stopped him from attacking Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Evildoer Tie, what are you doing?” Beitang Zhiqiang asked in a slightly angered manner. He did not understand why Evildoer Tie would be helping Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Beitang Zhiqiang, that child must not be touched. He possesses a rank three Martial Emperor behind him. If you are to attack him, that rank three Half Martial Emperor will definitely act and take our lives. Neither one of us will be able to survive,” Evildoer Tie said frightenedly.</p>
 <p>“What?” Hearing those words, Beitang Zhiqiang was startled. Upon thinking about what Evildoer Tie said and then looking at Chu Feng’s confident appearance, Beitang Zhiqiang retrieved his killing intent and asked Evildoer Tie through voice transmission, “How do you know about this?”</p>
 <p>“That is a long story. However, what happened today has happened to me before. Back then, Chu Feng was right between my hands. With a thought, I would have been able to take his life.”</p>
 <p>“However, right at the moment when I was about to take his life, a mysterious man suddenly attacked me. His aura was truly too powerful. It was many times more powerful than mine. It is impossible for rank two Martial Emperors to make me feel that sort of oppressive sensation. At the very least, that person is a rank three Martial Emperor.”</p>
 <p>“That man had been protecting Chu Feng from the shadows the entire time. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for Chu Feng to be this confident. The way I see it, we should forget about what happened today. If we are to force that person to act, the people who will be out of luck will be us,” Evildoer Tie said with a very low voice.</p>
 <p>“Are you for real?” Beitang Zhiqiang asked.</p>
 <p>“Why would I deceive you with something like that? If you don’t trust me, go and attack him. However, you must by all means not involve me in it,” After Evildoer Tie finished saying those words, he turned around and looked to Chu Feng. With a beaming smile on his face, he said, “Little friend Chu Feng, there has been some misunderstandings between us before. I would like to apologize to you.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, I did not know that you were friends with this Luo Family. If I'd known that, even if I were beaten to death, I would not have helped the Black and White Skulls to take care of the Luo Family. As the saying goes, those who don’t know are not in the wrong. Please, do not take this matter to heart.”</p>
 <p>“......”</p>
 <p>This scene completely stunned everyone. Especially the people from the Black Fiend; they were all stupefied.</p>
 <p>To them, Evildoer Tie was their idol, one of the Five Great Evildoers.</p>
 <p>Yet, at this moment, their idol that feared nothing in heaven or earth, their idol who had committed all imaginable crimes, was actually begging forgiveness from such a brat. Exactly what was going on?</p>
 <p>“Rest assured, if I were one to take things to heart, you would not have been able to live till now; you would’ve already died outside of the Heavenly Law Auction,” Chu Feng said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Evildoer Tie’s body shivered. Chu Feng’s words had stabbed him where he feared the most, causing him to become even more afraid.</p>
 <p>“In that case, I’ll take my leave,” As Evildoer Tie said those words, he turned around and planned to leave. He wanted to escape from this place as quickly as possible, escape from the nightmare called Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Wait a moment,” However, right at this moment, Beitang Zhiqiang suddenly stopped Evildoer Tie, “Don’t be so anxious to leave. I still want to test whether this Chu Feng really possesses an expert protecting him from behind.”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s expression remained unchanged. However, his heart became alarmed.</p>
 <p>What he meant by when he said ‘go for broke’ earlier was to use Evildoer Tie to scare away Beitang Zhiqiang and the others.</p>
 <p>However, it would appear now that even though Beitang Zhiqiang had become somewhat timid, he was still skeptical, and was preparing to use his body to test the dangers, to test Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng knew very well in his heart that there was no one protecting him from the shadows now. If Beitang Zhiqiang were to really attack him, he would suffer a calamity.</p>
 <p>“Don’t! You must not! While you might not fear death, I do fear death! Even if you wish to try, wait until I get away from here first! Can’t you do that?!” Evildoer Tie hurriedly spoke to stop Beitang Zhiqiang.</p>
 <p>“Evildoer Tie, no matter what, you are still one of the Five Great Evildoers. How could you allow yourself to fear ropes for ten years because you were bitten by a snake one morning?”</p>
 <p>“To be afraid of a brat, if this were to spread out in the future, how could you continue to stand tall in the Holy Land of Martialism? Not to mention our Beitang Imperial Clan, do you think that the other four Evildoers would be willing to let you live? Would they allow you to disgrace the reputation of the Five Great Evildoers?” Beitang Zhiqiang said.</p>
 <p>“This…” Hearing those words, Evildoer Tie started to hesitate. Evidently, Beitang Zhiqiang’s incitement worked on him.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be scared. I dare to guarantee that this brat is bluffing.”</p>
 <p>“Let alone, if there really is someone protecting him from the shadows, we have already had killing intentions toward him. Do you really think that person will let us go?”</p>
 <p>“Think about it logically. Since both the left and right paths lead to death, we must die honorably. In addition, I have never misjudged. I dare to guarantee that there is absolutely no one protecting Chu Feng, I am sure that he is bluffing.”</p>
 <p>After Beitang Zhiqiang said those words, he suddenly opened his palm, and a Royal Armament appeared in his hand.</p>
 <p>In his hand, the Royal Armament started to rapidly spin and glisten with light. Even though it was only a Royal Armament, it possessed a frightening destructive power. If he wished it, with only this Royal Armament, he would be able to eliminate the entire Luo Family and turn this place into a bottomless ravine.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Beitang Zhiqiang pointed this Royal Armament at Chu Feng. However, Chu Feng appeared to be completely unafraid, and even had a faint smile on his face.</p>
 <p>“You are truly able to keep your composure. However, while you can deceive others, you will not be able to deceive me. Drop dead, bluffing brat!!!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the Royal Armament Beitang Zhiqiang had aimed toward Chu Feng turned into a ray of light and shot toward Chu Feng’s dantian area explosively.</p>
 <p>As Beitang Zhiqiang’s sword strike fell from the heavens, the entire earth started to violently tremble and collapse.</p>
 <p>Many people from the Luo Family were unable to withstand the oppressive might from Beitang Zhiqiang’s attack. Their bodies started to rip apart, and they began to vomit blood from their mouths. They were screaming and howling in grief.</p>
 <p>Beitang Zhiqiang’s sword strike was truly too powerful. It was simply indescribable. If Chu Feng were struck by it, he would not only lose his cultivation. Instead, he would definitely be destroyed both body and soul. He would be utterly dead.</p>
 <p>“Paa~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right when the Royal Armament was about to pierce into Chu Feng, a palm suddenly appeared out of thin air and grabbed onto the Royal Armament.</p>
 <p>Then, that palm suddenly exerted strength. “Bang,” that Royal Armament that contained an Emperor’s might was shattered to pieces.</p>
 <p>“It would appear that you have misjudged,” Following that, a laugh sounded.</p>
