 <p><strong>&nbsp;MGA: Chapter 1805 - The Overbearing Snow-hair</strong></p>
 <p>A magnificent army with thousands of men appeared from deep underground. They were all wearing armor, and were all the elite of the Four Great Imperial Clans.</p>
 <p>However, what shocked the crowd were the four aged old men. Their auras were extremely powerful. The four of them possessed auras that were much superior to those of the Four Great Imperial Clans’ Clan Chiefs. They were four Rank Four Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>As for these four old men, they were naturally the four Supreme Elders from the Four Great Imperial Clans.</p>
 <p>“Even the Four Great Imperial Clans’ Supreme Elders have appeared! Didn’t they say that the Supreme Elders are all nearing ten thousand years old? They’re actually still alive?”</p>
 <p>Many people exclaimed in admiration. It was one thing for the Four Great Imperial Clans’ Clan Chiefs to appear. However, even the Four Great Imperial Clan’s Supreme Elders had appeared. This was sufficient to signify how much importance the Four Great Imperial Clans placed on eliminating Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Wuuu~~~”</p>
 <p>Being suppressed by the four Supreme Elders, Baili Xuankong no longer possessed the ability to continue fighting. Like Hong Qiang, he was also captured.</p>
 <p>“Eaahh~~~”</p>
 <p>At this moment, the Ximen Imperial Clan’s Supreme Elder spread open his hands. Like eagle claws, he grabbed at Hong Qiang and Baili Xuankong. Even though they were several meters away from him, Baili Xuankong and Hong Qiang both uttered a scream of pain.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, I will not bother with superfluous words. I will count to three. You will either show yourself, or I’ll sever these two men’s heads,” The Ximen Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief said in a very fierce manner.</p>
 <p>Due to the fact that Ximen Feixue had suffered a miserable defeat at Chu Feng’s hands, the hatred the Ximen Imperial Clan had for Chu Feng was greater than even that of the Nangong Imperial Clan.</p>
 <p>“Stop!” Seeing this scene, Chu Feng would naturally not do nothing. He soared into the sky and appeared before the crowd.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, it’s really Chu Feng!” Upon seeing Chu Feng, the crowd were all startled. They had truly never expected for Chu Feng to be daring enough to reveal himself in this sort of situation.</p>
 <p>“I will take responsibility for the things I’ve done myself. The person your Four Clans should view as their enemy is me. Aim your spearheads at me. Release them,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Huuu~~~”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, the expressions of many of the people present changed. Furthermore, they were unable to help themselves from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.</p>
 <p>However, the gaze that all of the crowd was looking to Chu Feng with revealed a trace of admiration.</p>
 <p>Who said that Chu Feng was unrighteousness and disloyal? Who said that Chu Feng was a coward that feared death?</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng clearly knew that he would be killed. Yet, he had still revealed himself to his friends. His camaraderie was truly bottomless. It was something that ordinary people did not possess.</p>
 <p>“With how righteous and loyal this Chu Feng is, he is most definitely not the despicable person that the Four Great Imperial Clans have described him to me. For someone like him to die, it is truly unfortunate.”</p>
 <p>“Indeed. Unfortunately, he is only a member of the younger generation, yet he offended the Four Great Imperial Clans that possess powerful backing!!!” At this moment, many people were sighing. They were feeling regret for Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had gained the crowd’s respect with his appearance. However, the crowd also knew that his appearance meant that he would undoubtedly be killed.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you’ve finally shown yourself,” When the Ximen Imperial Clan’s Supreme Elder saw Chu Feng, his sword-like brows narrowed. He was torn between joy and anger. Without bothering to say any superfluous words, he waved his sleeve and caused space to become distorted. As martial power surged, several golden rays turned into a myriad of blades that shot toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>The speed of those blades formed with martial power were not very fast. He was deliberately letting the crowd see how he would kill Chu Feng. He was planning to slice Chu Feng to pieces, leaving him to die without an intact corpse.</p>
 <p>However, there was nothing that Chu Feng could do. Even though he was facing such a slow attack, he could only wait for death. The reason for that was because the Ximen Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief had already used his oppressive might to restrict Chu Feng’s movements. It was simply impossible for Chu Feng to escape.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right when the myriad of blades were about to reach Chu Feng, the space before Chu Feng started to suddenly distort. As if they were stones thrown into the sea, the myriad of blades all disappeared into the space before Chu Feng. They failed to injure Chu Feng in the slightest.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on?” Seeing this scene, the expressions of the crowd all changed.</p>
 <p>“A bunch of shameless old bastards. With your status, do you all not feel ashamed that you’re attacking a member of the younger generation that has not even cultivated for twenty years?”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, the space before Chu Feng started to distort again. Then, a beautiful figure stepped out from the space and appeared before the crowd.</p>
 <p>It was a woman with an alluring stature and an exceptional appearance. However, not only did she possess a head of snow-white hair, she was also emitting overwhelming murderous intent. Her gaze was filled with killing intent.</p>
 <p>“Snow-haired Immortal?” At this moment, not to mention the Four Great Imperial Clans’ four Supreme Elders, practically all the experts present that possessed status and strength started to frown. They all recognized the person that had appeared. She was none other than one of the Ten Immortals, the Snow-haired Immortal.</p>
 <p>“Snow-haired Immortal? That person is the renowned Snow-haired Immortal?” After hearing the dialogue of the crowd, many people that had not recognized the Snow-haired Immortal were also shocked with their mouths wide open. They began to seriously inspect the Snow-haired Immortal.</p>
 <p>After all, the Snow-haired Immortal’s fame was much superior to that of the White-browed Immortal. She was a true expert that possessed exceptionally powerful killing techniques capable of bringing fear to countless powers.</p>
 <p>Merely, the Snow-haired Immortal was a person that would appear and disappear unpredictably. Very few people had ever seen her true appearance. Today, the opportunity to see her had presented itself. Naturally, they would have to properly look at her and remember her appearance so that they could brag about this experience to others in the future.</p>
 <p>“Snow-hair, there are no grievances or hatred between you and our Four Great Imperial Clans. Why are you preventing us from killing Chu Feng today?” The Ximen Imperial Clan’s Supreme Elder asked. Even though he was overflowing with anger, he still had to exercise restraint and act calm when facing the Snow-haired Immortal.</p>
 <p>It was not that he was scared. After all, he was a grand Supreme Elder of the Ximen Imperial Clan. Merely, the Snow-haired Immortal was truly too infamous. Even though the Four Great Imperial Clans possessed the ability to contend against the Snow-haired Immortal, they were unwilling to make her their enemy.</p>
 <p>“Why? You’re actually asking me why? Hahaha…” The Snow-haired Immortal suddenly burst into loud laughter. Her laughter was extremely crazed and terrifying, like the howling of wolves and weeping of ghosts.</p>
 <p>=</p>
 <p>Hearing her laughter, many people started to feel their hair standing upright, and their bodies trembling. The reason for that was because her laughter was truly too frightening.</p>
 <p>“All of you, listen carefully. Chu Feng is my, the Snow-haired Immortal’s, disciple. If anyone dares to kill him, I will eliminate their entire clan.”</p>
 <p>As the Snow-haired Immortal said those words, her snow-white hair started to flutter wildly and a boundless killing intent instantly enveloped this entire region. Everyone began to tremble with fear.</p>
 <p>“What? Chu Feng is actually the Snow-haired Immortal’s disciple?” Hearing those words, not to mention the Four Great Imperial Clans, even those that did not understand what was going on were shocked.</p>
 <p>In fact, not to mention others, even Chu Feng himself was surprised.</p>
 <p>He thought to himself, ‘When did I become that devil woman’s disciple?’</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng then thought, ‘Well, it doesn’t matter. As long as that devil woman is willing to help me, what harm is there in being her disciple?’</p>
 <p>“Snow-hair, since when did Chu Feng become your disciple? I have never heard of this before,” the Beitang Imperial Clan’s Supreme Elder asked. He was actually probing. The reason for that was because he really did not wish to make the Snow-haired Immortal their Beitang Imperial Clan’s enemy.</p>
 <p>“Right now,” The Snow-haired Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“You… you’re simply blabbing nonsense here! You’re simply finding a pretext to save Chu Feng!” The Ximen Imperial Clan’s Supreme Elder was furious with rage.</p>
 <p>“Humph,” The Snow-haired Immoral snorted disdainfully. Then, she said, “I said he’s my disciple so he’s my disciple. If there is anyone that dares to touch him, it will be equivalent to making me, Snow-hair, their enemy.”</p>
 <p>“Snow-hair, I advise that you leave some leeway for yourself in times of need. Do not act this excessively insolent. You must know that our Four Great Imperial Clans are not that easily humiliated!” The Ximen Imperial Clan’s Supreme Elder shouted angrily.</p>
 <p>As the Snow-haired Immortal was not planning to give them face, he too was not going to give her face. Today, they would likely face one another with weapons drawn.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha…” The Snow-haired Immortal burst into loud laughter. Then, with a flip of her palm, she waved toward her surroundings.</p>
 <p>“Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom~~~”</p>
 <p>In an instant, explosions were heard in succession like a string of firecrackers.</p>
 <p>Merely, those were not firecrackers. Instead, it was people that were exploding. Furthermore, all of them were the elites from the Four Great Imperial Clans.</p>
 <p>In an instant, close to a thousand elites from the Four Great Imperial Clans were killed by the Snow-haired Immortal.</p>
 <p>“Go ahead, give it a try. See what kind of end you will get for making me, Snow-hair, your enemy,” After killing those people, the Snow-haired Immortal smiled lightly.</p>
 <p>That appearance of hers, not only was she not feeling any remorse for the close to a thousand lives she had just taken, she was instead… feeling extremely excited.</p>
