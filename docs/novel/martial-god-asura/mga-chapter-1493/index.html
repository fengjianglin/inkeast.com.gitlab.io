 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1493 - God And Demon</strong></p>
 <p>At this moment, the crowd was surprised to discover that even though Chu Feng had been submerged by the crimson gaseous substance emitted by Qin Wentian, he was still as calm and collected as before.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was incomparably calm. It was as if there were nothing for him to fear at all.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that this child does not understand what fear is?” Chu Feng’s calmness shocked and frightened the crowd.</p>
 <p>Even though the headmasters had realized that Chu Feng was very strong, they felt that Chu Feng was strong not because of his strength but rather because of his wisdom.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the headmasters finally discovered how frightening this young man called Chu Feng really was.</p>
 <p>Not to mention his strength, his wisdom was something rarely seen among his generation.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that Chu Feng truly possesses absolute certainty in winning?” At this moment, many of the crowd’s hearts were so tense that they had reached the pits of their stomachs and were beating violently. None of them were certain as to whether or not Chu Feng would be able to win. However, they all hoped that Chu Feng would win.</p>
 <p>Even though the Nine Powers were powers that competed with one another, where a powerful individual’s emergence in a single power could possibly affect the equilibrium of the Nine Powers...</p>
 <p>...but, the Eight Powers present, from their headmasters to their ordinary disciples, all wished for Chu Feng’s victory.</p>
 <p>That was because Qin Wentian had trained in a demonic technique, a taboo, and should be killed. At this moment, Qin Wentian was the evil party.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he was the representative of the Nine Powers. Thus, he represented the righteous party.</p>
 <p>Other than the Cursed Soil Sect, the Nine Powers were very prestigious for their righteousness. They believed themselves to be the incarnations of justice, and viewed the extermination of demons that had strayed from the path of justice as their job. Thus, all of them supported Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Aaaooouuu~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the strange roars coming from the crimson gaseous substance became more and more ear-piercing. The frightening creatures within the gaseous substance actually began to fuse with one another. They were transforming.</p>
 <p>Before, they seemed to be very pitiful, and looked like homeless souls and ghosts.</p>
 <p>Now, they appeared extremely frightening, and seemed like evil spirits that could snatch away one’s soul.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, at this moment, each and every one of them were baring their fangs and brandishing their claws as they scrambled toward Chu Feng. They looked like they wanted to tear Chu Feng to pieces.</p>
 <p>“Pa, pa, pa~~~”</p>
 <p>Seeing that, Chu Feng, who had been motionless this entire time, began to rapidly form hand seals. Following that, a golden spirit formation turned into an enormous bell and covered Chu Feng within it.</p>
 <p>“Aouuu~~~”</p>
 <p>A crimson monster managed to reach Chu Feng. Its claw that was ten times bigger than Chu Feng’s head turned into a crimson flash as it swiped toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>If Chu Feng were to be struck by its attack without any defense, his body would not be intact anymore and his head would definitely be ripped off from the rest of his body.</p>
 <p>“Clank~~~”</p>
 <p>However, while the claw managed to hit, it had landed on the golden bell. At the instant the claw landed, it left an ear-piercing noise as well as a golden energy ripple.</p>
 <p>Like a vortex, the golden energy ripple swept past. Anywhere it passed, the monsters of that region would begin to scream nonstop. Their bodies were torn apart by the energy ripple, and their bones were crushed into pieces. In the end, not even the slightest bit of them remained.</p>
 <p>However, those monsters appeared to be endless. With each wave that Chu Feng eliminated, another wave would come and take its place. They were charging toward Chu Feng unceasingly.</p>
 <p>However, no matter how numerous the monsters might be, they were unable to break through Chu Feng’s golden bell. Standing within his golden bell, Chu Feng was completely unscathed. It was as if, even if the wave of monsters continued for his entire lifetime, Chu Feng would still remain completely uninjured.</p>
 <p>“I want you dead! Thus, you must die!” Qin Wentian snarled. The crimson monsters began to rapidly move backward; they were running toward Qin Wentian’s body.</p>
 <p>In this sort of situation, Qin Wentian’s body began to transform again. Not only did his entire body become crimson in color, he even started to increase in size.</p>
 <p>One meter, two meters, three meters, ten meters, a hundred meters...</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, Qin Wentian had turned into a crimson giant towering over a hundred meters tall.</p>
 <p>His head was able to touch the sky with his feet on the ground. His demonic aura was soaring. At this moment, he was neither human nor monstrous beast. Instead, he was a demon.</p>
 <p>Without trying to conceal anything, Qin Wentian unleashed his killing intent. This killing intent caused many of the disciples present to tremble with fear. For some timid female disciples, they were so frightened that they fainted.</p>
 <p>This killing intent was something that Qin Wentian had obtained after killing countless souls. He had treated lives as if they were grass. He was truly a demon.</p>
 <p>“That child is truly an animal. We must eliminate him,” The Ten Thousand Flowers Garden’s headmaster was gnashing her teeth in anger. She was extremely impatient, and wanted to eliminate Qin Wentian right away.</p>
 <p>She knew that Qin Wentian’s killing intent was not something that he hd obtained from killing powerful experts. It was most likely obtained by killing countless innocent lives.</p>
 <p>Even if a powerful expert refused to protect the weak, they should not bring harm upon them. However, for his own personal gain, Qin Wentian had taken countless innocent lives. This was truly excessive, an action lower than low, an action going against the heavenly law. Qin Wentian was a sinner who no one in the entire world would allow to continue living.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be so anxious, Chu Feng should have a way to handle him. If Chu Feng cannot handle him, without you all doing anything, I will personally eliminate this child,” Dugu Xingfeng said.</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, Qin Wentian raised his leg and stomped it down onto Chu Feng’s golden bell spirit formation.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the difference in the sizes of the two was enormous. Without using any strength and merely by relying on its size, Qin Wentian’s foot was like a small mountain crashing down upon Chu Feng. As such, how could Chu Feng possibly be able to withstand it?</p>
 <p>Moreover, Qin Wentian’s stomp was done with a very great deal of force. Not to mention it hitting the target, even if it didn’t hit the target, merely its aftermath would have devastating destructive power. If it weren’t for the fact that there were many experts present who blocked the aftermath, merely the aftermath of his stomp would have caused the death of countless of the disciples who were present.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, he……”</p>
 <p>At this moment, many people were extremely nervous. That was because Qin Wentian’s stomp left an enormous crater in the ground. As for Chu Feng, he was nowhere to be seen. They all feared that Chu Feng had been stomped to death by Qin Wentian.</p>
 <p>“I have trained in demonic techniques all for this day. Now that I have transformed into a giant demon, you humans are unable to withstand a single blow from me.”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, before me, Qin Wentian, you are nothing more than an ant. With a single stomp, I am able to stamp you to death. Fight against me? What did you think you could possibly rely on?”</p>
 <p>“Hahahahahaha….”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qin Wentian burst into loud laughter. His body had become so enormous that even his voice had changed. His voice no longer sounded like the speech of a human, but rather, like the roar of a mountain god. That voice of his was extremely deafening, extremely ear-piercing.</p>
 <p>“Is that so?” However, not long after Qin Wentian’s words left his mouth, Chu Feng’s voice suddenly sounded from below his foot.</p>
 <p>“Rumble, rumble, rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>Immediately afterward, the entire plaza started to tremble violently. As for the source of the trembling, it was coming from under Qin Wentian’s foot.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a dazzling golden light spread forth from under Qin Wentian’s foot. It was so stunning that the crowd immediately opened their eyes wide.</p>
 <p>Even Qin Wentian moved his enormous body back several steps.</p>
 <p>It was not that he decided to move back on his own. Rather, the power under his foot was so enormous that it forced him backwards.</p>
 <p>As the dazzling light gradually dissipated, the crowd finally managed to clearly see the source of the golden radiance.</p>
 <p>“Heavens! What is that?!!!”</p>
 <p>After the crowd saw the thing that was emitting the dazzling golden light, their expressions all took changed greatly. This was especially true of the disciples; they all had expressions of extreme shock, as if they had been petrified by terror.</p>
 <p>At this moment, in the center of the vast plaza, across from Qin Wentian, was a ten thousand-plus-meter tall giant.</p>
 <p>This giant was covered with golden light, and was translucent in appearance. It was as if it was formed by golden light. Its foot was on the ground, and its head was above the clouds. At a glance, it looked like the Buddha himself.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, this giant possessed eight arms and eight large hands. However, even though its appearance was very strange, no one felt fear from it. Instead… the crowd felt a deep sense of sacredness from it.</p>
 <p>If Qin Wentian brought forth fear to the crowd, then this giant brought forth awe from the crowd.</p>
 <p>If Qin Wentian was like a demon, then this giant was like a god.</p>
 <p>Standing above this giant was a single figure. This figure was none other than Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>。</p>
 <p>Suddenly, with a thought from Chu Feng, one of the golden giant’s arms suddenly dropped downward. With a speed several times faster than lightning, it captured Qin Wentian in its hand.</p>
 <p>Even though Qin Wentian’s size was enormous, he was, nevertheless, akin to a rat being captured by this golden giant. He could do nothing but struggle in vain. He appeared utterly small and weak.</p>
 <p>“Qin Wentian, even if you trained in demonic techniques and transformed yourself into a demon, if I, Chu Feng, want to kill you, it would be as simple as choking a rat to death,” Chu Feng said.</p>
