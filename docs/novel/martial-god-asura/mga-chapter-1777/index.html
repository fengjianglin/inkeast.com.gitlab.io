 <p><strong>&nbsp;MGA: Chapter 1777 - He Really Came</strong></p>
 <p>Inside the fort, the hearts of the crowd were wavering back and forth. Outside the fort, the crowd was also very restless.</p>
 <p>At this moment, a ray of light appeared above the fort. The light formed twenty numbers in an orderly fashion.</p>
 <p>Starting from number twenty, the names of the Eastern Divine Deer, the Sea Alligator Clan, the Golden Peng Clan, the King Monstrous Dragon Beast, Ximen Feixue, Feng Sanmei, Feng Erhong, Baili Xinghe, along with the others that had made it to the fort, were starting to appear.</p>
 <p>“Amazing. They’re practically all people on the invitation list, the most impactful members of the younger generation in the Holy Land of Martialism.”</p>
 <p>“Even Ximen Feixue has come? I wonder, will Chu Feng show up too?” Someone asked with an expression filled with anticipation.</p>
 <p>“Humph, the Four Great Imperial Clans have sent out so many people, and surrounded the entire fort. If Chu Feng dares to show his face, he will only be courting death,” Another person spoke. As he spoke, he took a look at his surroundings.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, the Four Great Imperial Clans’ magnificent army of tens of thousands was standing there orderly columns, blockading the entire fort. The ones leading this magnificent army of tens of thousands of men were the Four Great Imperial Clans’ four Clan Chiefs.</p>
 <p>In addition to the troops from the Four Great Imperial Clans, the subsidiary powers of the Four Great Imperial Clans had also dispatched many of their elite troops. Adding them all together, the number of troops the Four Great Imperial Clans had under their control right now numbered in the millions.</p>
 <p>However, this was only the strength that they were showing to the public. Their creme de la creme were actually hidden deep underground and led by the four Supreme Elders.</p>
 <p>Someone in the crowd sighed. “Never would I have expected that the Four Great Imperial Clans would loathe Chu Feng to this extent. In order to capture him, they have sent out this many of their elites. Even the four Clan Chiefs have personally come here for him.”</p>
 <p>“That Chu Feng is merely a kid from the younger generation. Exactly how enormous are his abilities?” Seeing that the Four Great Imperial Clans had mustered such a large force for Chu Feng, many of the people present realized the importance the Four Great Imperial Clans had placed on Chu Feng, as well as how enormous their hatred for him was.</p>
 <p>The Beitang Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief was standing in the sky as he asked Nangong Beidou, who was standing beside him, “Brother Nangong, do you think that Chu Feng will appear?”</p>
 <p>“I think he will,” Nangong Beidou said.</p>
 <p>“He will? Heh… I think that he simply will not show up. Last time around, the reason why he dared to go to Mooncloud City was because he knew that we were not on guard against him.”</p>
 <p>“However, this time around, practically everyone knew that we would squat in this place and wait for Chu Feng’s arrival. That Chu Feng is no fool. How could he possibly show up in such a place?” The Beitang Imperial Clan Chief said with a light laugh. Although they had mustered such an enormous amount of strength, he did not think that Chu Feng would show up. The way he saw it, they had all come here for nothing.</p>
 <p>“I also don’t think Chu Feng will come. Even if he did, he must’ve run away by now,” The Dongfang Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief said. Then, he looked to the Ximen Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief and asked, “Clan Chief Ximen, what do you think?”</p>
 <p>“It would be best for him if he doesn’t show up. If he does, I’ll definitely make it so that he cannot return after coming here,” the Ximen Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief said with a cold voice.</p>
 <p>“I also hope that he has come. Merely, I’m afraid that he would not dare to come,” The Beitang Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief sighed.</p>
 <p>“I think that he will definitely have come,” Nangong Beidou said resolutely. “You all do not know that Chu Feng’s character still. However, after experiencing what happened before, I already have somewhat of an understanding of his character. That child is extremely courageous. His courage surpasses your imaginations.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, the backers he has might not only be limited to that one mysterious man with the Death Kill Brush from that day. Thus, we must absolutely not become careless,” After saying those words, seriousness and unease flashed through Nangong Beidou’s eyes.</p>
 <p>He knew very well that the battle power their Four Great Imperial Clans had dispatched for Chu Feng was already extremely dreadful. There had even dispatched four of their Four Great Imperial Clans’ Supreme Elders for Chu Feng. It would not be excessive to say that the Four Great Imperial Clans had sent out their strongest battle power.</p>
 <p>However, even with this being the case, he still did not have absolute certainty in being able to kill Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because...</p>
 <p>The scene of Chu Feng’s release of the Asura Evil Spirit in his Nangong Imperial Clan was still vivid in his mind.</p>
 <p>The scene of Chu Feng defeating all of the Four Great Imperial Clans’ younger generation in Mooncloud City was still vivid in his mind.</p>
 <p>During those times, he was only able to watch as he suffered at Chu Feng’s hands, as he was humiliated by Chu Feng while being unable to do anything to him.</p>
 <p>As matters stood, he did not dare to lower his guard against Chu Feng in the slightest.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha…”</p>
 <p>“Brother Nangong, the way I see it, you’ve been too frightened by that Chu Feng. Regardless of how exceptional his talent might be, he is still only a member of the younger generation. Is it really proper to regard him this highly?” The Dongfang Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief said with a light laugh.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. This is unlike the Nangong Beidou that we know,” The Beitang Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief also had a teasing smile on his face.</p>
 <p>“If possible, I also hope that my worries are unnecessary. Otherwise…” Nangong Beidou said no more. The reason for that was because he also didn’t wish for the possibility of that ‘otherwise’ to happen.</p>
 <p>“Quickly, look, the seventh individual’s name has been announced. The remaining spots seem to all be occupied by people from the Three Palaces. The Three Palaces are truly worthy of being the Three Palaces. Amazing, truly amazing,” The Beitang Imperial Clan looked to the names that were appearing on the horizon nonstop and gasped with admiration.</p>
 <p>“The younger generation from the monstrous beasts and humans have pretty much all been announced. In that case, the ones that’ll be announced now should be the Ancient Era’s Elves, right?” The Dongfang Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief’s gaze also became serious.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, a flash of light shone. Then, the name ‘Little Radish,’ appeared in the sky underneath the sixth place spot.</p>
 <p>“What?!!!”</p>
 <p>“Little Radish? What the fuck is this?”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing the words ‘Little Radish,’ not to mention the Four Great Imperial Clans’ Clan Chiefs, practically everyone present was so shocked by those words that their mouths fell wide open, and they had expressions of being completely baffled on their faces.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Following that, another flash of light shone. Then, the name ‘Big Radish,’ appeared underneath the fifth place spot.</p>
 <p>“What?! Big Radish?! It’s a pair of radishes?!!!”</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>At the moment when the crowd was still shocked, the name ‘Chili Pepper’ appeared underneath the fourth place spot.</p>
 <p>“What the fuck! Is this a collection of vegetables?! Radishes and chili pepper? This is enough to make a dish!”</p>
 <p>The crowd was completely speechless. Exactly what was going on? The spots were being shown according to the order in which those people had arrived at the fort. The higher one was ranked, the faster they had passed through the hurdles, which in turn meant the greater their strength.</p>
 <p>The disciples of the Three Palaces and the representatives from the monstrous beasts were pretty much all present. The crowd had thought that the names that would appear afterwards would be the younger generation from the Ancient Era’s Elves or some sort of grand character. Yet, what has appeared before them were radishes and chili pepper. Exactly what was going on?!</p>
 <p>“Could it be that the Ancient Era’s Elves’ younger generation did not wish to use their real names, and instead used aliases?” At this moment, this was the only thing the crowd could think of.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, the words ‘Flame Emperor’s successor’ appeared underneath the third place spot.</p>
 <p>“Flame Emperor’s successor? Could it be the Flame Emperor from ten thousand years ago that brought the Yan Clan to the apex of humanity, and later fought against Emperor Qing?”</p>
 <p>“Didn’t the Yan Clan end up being chased by their enemies after the death of the Flame Emperor, and were wiped out because of that? Why would there be a Flame Emperor’s successor? Could it be that the Yan Clan is still in existence?”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing the words ‘Flame Emperor’s successor,’ the crowd was both excited and astonished. Compared to the Radishes and Chili Pepper, the ‘Flame Emperor’s successor’ was the sort of pleasant surprise that they wanted.</p>
 <p>“Even the Flame Emperor’s successor has appeared. Sure enough, this is an unprecedented era. The younger generation of this era is truly frightening,” The Beitang Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief gasped with admiration.</p>
 <p>“That’s true. Even the strongest of the younger generation from our Four Great Imperial Clan's, little friend Ximen Feixue, is only able to be ranked sixteenth. From this, it can be seen how powerful those members of the younger generation ranked above him are,” The Dongfang Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief said.</p>
 <p>“Humph, the strength of my son is definitely not as obvious as what is present. It is not absolutely certain that the disciples from the Three Palaces will be a match for him,” The Ximen Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief said.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, that does seem like little friend Ximen Feixue’s character,” The Dongfang Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief smiled an indifferent smile. Then, he said, “If Chu Feng had come, he should only have been ranked below the top ten. After all, even the personal disciple of the Weaponry Refinement Immortal is only ranked thirteenth.”</p>
 <p>“The list of names has already been announced to the third place now. The way I see it, Chu Feng truly did not come. Brother Nangong, what do you think?” After saying those words, the Dongfang Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief looked to Nangong Beidou.</p>
 <p>“That might be the case,” As matters stood, Nangong Beidou also began to doubt his own guess. After all, the third ranked individual had been announced. How could Chu Feng possibly be among the remaining two individuals? No matter how strong Chu Feng might be, it should still be unrealistic for him to be first or second.</p>
 <p>After all, back then, Chu Feng had only barely defeated Ximen Feixue. As for the names of people who appeared afterwards, their strength all greatly surpassed Ximen Feixue’s.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>In fact, it was not only the Four Great Imperial Clan’s Clan Chiefs who were thinking like this. Many of the people present also felt that Chu Feng had not come.</p>
 <p>Upon thinking that Chu Feng had not come, many of the people present revealed expressions of disappointment in their eyes.</p>
 <p>No matter how much the Four Great Imperial Clans wanted to arrest and kill Chu Feng, they had all wished for Chu Feng to appear. They all wished to have a look at exactly how heaven-defying that rumored heaven-defying child was.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, it would appear that they would not have the opportunity to do so.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Yet, right at this moment, light began to flicker underneath the second place spot. Two large words appeared in the sky.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng!!!!!!!!!</p>
 <p>…………………………</p>
 <p>…………………</p>
 <p>…………</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng?”</p>
 <p>“It’s actually Chu Feng?”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng actually came?”</p>
 <p>“Not only that, he’s actually ranked second?”</p>
 <p>“But, that Ximen Feixue that fought against Chu Feng is only ranked sixteenth. Yet, Chu Feng is ranked second. So the gap between Chu Feng and Ximen Feixue was actually that enormous!!!”</p>
 <p>“Could it be that Chu Feng’s strength is even more powerful than it was rumored to be?”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, this is great, truly great. I have not traveled here from far away in vain. This time around, there’ll be a show for me to enjoy.”</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, the people in the sky and on the ground outside of the fort all started to boil with excitement. Practically everyone began to discuss Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, he actually came,” At this moment, the Four Great Imperial Clan’s Clan Chiefs all started frowning.</p>
 <p>The relaxed sensations that they had had before completely disappeared, and were replaced with seriousness.</p>
