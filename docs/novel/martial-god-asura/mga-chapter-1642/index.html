 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1642 - Surpassing One’s Imagination</strong></p>
 <p>At the moment when the Nangong Imperial Clan was suffering from the devastation brought about by the Asura Evil Spirit, Chu Feng was being protected by Aunt Lian and taking advantage of the chaos to escape.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, take these.”</p>
 <p>Aunt Lian took out a cloak and two Cosmos Sacks and handed them to Chu Feng. The cloak was the same cloak that they had worn in the Heavenly Law Auction. It was capable of completely concealing one’s aura and preventing others from seeing through one’s appearance and cultivation.</p>
 <p>As for those two Cosmos Sacks, they were filled with extremely valuable treasures.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng did not refuse Aunt Lian’s gifts. During this moment of crisis, he needed money to travel as well as treasures to protect himself.</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng accepted Aunt Lian’s gifts, he asked, “Aunt Lian, are you going to return?”</p>
 <p>“I am a member of the Nangong Imperial Clan. Naturally, I will have to return,” Aunt Lian said.</p>
 <p>“But you’ve brought me out. If they are to find out, they will not necessarily let you get away with it,” Chu Feng said worriedly.</p>
 <p>Even though Chu Feng had left the Nangong Imperial Clan with a disguise, the Nangong Imperial Clan was not filled with fools. If they were to truly investigate this matter, they would still be able to obtain clues and suspect that Nangong Lian had brought him out.</p>
 <p>“You do not have to worry about that. No matter what, they will not do anything to me,” Aunt Lian said.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, get going. The further you go, the better off you’ll be,” After Aunt Lian finished saying these words, she turned around and began to return to the Nangong Imperial Clan. Evidently, regardless of how much in the wrong the Nangong Imperial Clan was, she, as a member of the Nangong Imperial Clan, was still extremely worried about them.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Feng asked, “Aunt Lian, can the Nangong Imperial Clan still persist?” Not only was there an expression of worry on his face, there was also shame and guilt.</p>
 <p>“It will. Regardless of how powerful that Evil Spirit you released is, it will still not be able to destroy our Nangong Imperial Clan,” Aunt Lian was filled with confidence when she said this.</p>
 <p>“Really?” Chu Feng was skeptical.</p>
 <p>“Really. There is one thing about the Nangong Imperial Clan that the other Three Imperial Clans cannot compare with. That is my older brother.”</p>
 <p>“Although my older brother does not concern himself with matters of the clan, he will definitely act during this moment of life and death crisis,” Aunt Lian said.</p>
 <p>“Who is your older brother?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Nangong Longjian,” After Aunt Lian left these words, she leapt forward and disappeared from Chu Feng’s line of sight.</p>
 <p>“Nangong Longjian is actually Aunt Lian’s older brother?” Chu Feng was shocked to hear this. He had wanted to ask more about Nangong Longjian. However, Aunt Lian had already completely disappeared.</p>
 <p>After seeing that Aunt Lian had left, Chu Feng changed his appearance again. He had changed himself to look like a very unremarkable-looking middle-aged man. He did not leave right away because he was worried about the Nangong Imperial Clan too.</p>
 <p>Even though Chu Feng wished to kill those from the Nangong Imperial Clan that wanted to kill him, he did not wish for the destruction of the entire Nangong Imperial Clan.</p>
 <p>After all, there were also good people in the Nangong Imperial Clan. For example, there were Aunt Lian, Nangong Ya, Nangong Baihe and Nangong Moli.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng firmly believed that the good people in the Nangong Imperial Clan were definitely not limited to only them. There were definitely even more good people.</p>
 <p>As for those people, they did not possess malicious intentions against Chu Feng. If they were to be killed by the Asura Evil Spirit, they would be innocents.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng did not wish to cause the deaths of innocents. However, there was nothing he could do.</p>
 <p>Even though he had released the Asura Evil Spirit from within his body, he had simply been unable to control it. At the very least, the current him was unable to control the Asura Evil Spirit.</p>
 <p>If possible, Chu Feng truly hoped that the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan would be able to stop the Asura Evil Spirit.</p>
 <p>After all, if even the Nangong Imperial Clan could not stop that Asura Evil Spirit, then it would likely not only be the Nangong Imperial Clan that would suffer a calamity. The entire Holy Land of Martialism would end up suffering a calamity. With the murderous nature of that Asura Evil Spirit, it would definitely not stop at this, and would kill even more people.</p>
 <p>Even though Chu Feng was unable to do anything, he did not want to leave like this. The reason for that was because he would be left feeling restless should he leave like this.</p>
 <p>He had to wait for news, news of the Nangong Imperial Clan defeating the Asura Evil Spirit. This was the news that Chu Feng wanted to hear.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>At this moment, within the Nangong Imperial Clan, the Asura Evil Spirit’s gaseous flames were as overflowing as ever. This precious Nangong Imperial Clan had become a paradise of destruction.</p>
 <p>White-browed Immortal and the others had already escaped. When even the Evil Suppression Talismans were unable to take care of the Asura Evil Spirit, they no longer had any means to take care of it.</p>
 <p>At this moment, there was only a single person stopping the Asura Evil Spirit. As for this person, he was the Nangong Imperial Clan’s Clan Chief, Nangong Beidou.</p>
 <p>At this moment, a dazzling bright ‘Imperial’ character was flashing on Nangong Beidou’s forehead, and his entire body was shining with golden light. Even though he appeared to be extremely imposing, he was actually gasping for breath.</p>
 <p>He had already unleashed all of his most powerful abilities. Yet, he was still unable to stop the Asura Evil Spirit. The Asura Evil Spirit had already flattened a fifth of all of their Nangong Imperial Clan’s land.</p>
 <p>As for the people who had died at the Asura Evil Spirit’s hands, they were too many to count. There were even Martial Emperors, a total of three, who had died at its hands. As for Half Martial Emperors, their death count numbered at over a thousand. As for those below Half Martial Emperor, the number of casualties was simply incapable of being estimated.</p>
 <p>This made Nangong Beidou feel extremely helpless and worried. He felt that he was a sinner, a sinner who was soon going to ruin the foundation of the Nangong Imperial Clan that had continued on for several tens of thousands of years.</p>
 <p>“Huuaoouuu~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, a roar sounded from outside the city. When that roar sounded, the entire Nangong Imperial Clan started to tremble. It was not the roar of a normal beast. Rather, it was a dragon’s roar.</p>
 <p>This dragon roar was completely different from the dragon roars from before. If all dragon roars were capable of intimidation, then this roar was the most intimidating.</p>
 <p>“Huuaaouuu~~~”</p>
 <p>The dragon roar sounded once again. Following that, a dazzling golden dragon surged forth from the distant mountain. It actually broke through the Nangong Imperial Clan’s spirit formation and charged into the vast city toward the direction of Nangong Beidou.</p>
 <p>Everyone who saw this golden dragon was overjoyed. Even Nangong Beidou revealed an expression of relief.</p>
 <p>That golden dragon was no ordinary golden dragon. It was extremely vivid and lifelike. It was as if that golden dragon was an actual dragon.</p>
 <p>Not only did it look like an actual dragon, its aura also resembled that of an actual dragon. It was immensely powerful. Its aura had already surpassed the grand Clan Chief of the Nangong Imperial Clan, Nangong Beidou.</p>
 <p>“Wuuaouuu~~~”</p>
 <p>When that dragon appeared, the Asura Evil Spirit also unleashed a roar. Afterward, from an enormous skull that reached the clouds, it turned into dark black gaseous flames again. As the black gaseous flames hovered, they instantly formed an enormous black dragon. The black dragon collided with the golden dragon.</p>
 <p>“Rumble, rumble, rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>In an instant, space began to rip apart. The sky and the earth were being turned upside down. The battle between the two was extremely frightening. Even Nangong Beidou hurriedly escaped from the range of their battle.</p>
 <p>After distancing himself, Nangong Beidou arrived at a location that had yet to be destroyed, and began to use his strength to stop the energy ripples resulting from their battle to prevent the deaths of even more people from the Nangong Imperial Clan.</p>
 <p>The battle between the two lasted for an entire hour. After the one hour mark, the two dragon claws from the enormous black dragon ruthlessly pierced into the body of the golden dragon like a pair of sharp blades.</p>
 <p>Afterward, it opened its ferocious mouth and bit down on the golden dragon’s head.</p>
 <p>The golden dragon began to scream and struggle nonstop. However, it was simply unable to break away from the black dragon. The black dragon became more and more vicious, and actually began to tear at the golden dragon’s body.</p>
 <p>Whenever a piece of the golden dragon’s body was torn out, it would turn into a stream of golden gaseous flames that drifted into the skies.</p>
 <p>Finally, the golden dragon was unable to resist anymore. After a final miserable shriek, it fell to the ground with a loud crash.</p>
 <p>Seeing this scene, the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan all had ashen complexions and dejected expressions.</p>
 <p>The strength of the Asura Evil Spirit had already surpassed their imaginations.</p>
