 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 867 - Chu Feng's Attack</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng? It’s Chu Feng!” After they saw his person, everyone was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The famous people within the peak of the palace all stood up, as if they were facing a huge enemy. The disciples on the plaza all rose into the air, quickly backing away, creating some distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At present, his name was too ferocious. And, since everyone here was a part of the Immortal Execution Archipelago, they were enemies to the Crippling Night Demon Sect. So, to them, Chu Feng was definitely an extremely dangerous person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at that instant, the person who felt the most alarmed was none other than the head of the Stone Sword Sect. He was the only person here who had seen Chu Feng’s strength and techniques.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew very well what sort of person he was. Not only was his strength unbelievably strong, as a person, he was ruthless and cruel. He would never forget how Chu Feng and Eggy tortured him when he was receiving the backlash of the Forbidden Medicine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the Third Immortal hadn’t arrived, who knew how much more pain he would have felt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, when he saw Chu Feng again, he felt very afraid. His fear towards Chu Feng was already imbued into his bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, no matter how afraid he was, he could not display any of it, and when he thought of the Third Immortal’s subordinate, Lord Yan, he felt quite a bit more at ease.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, the head of the Stone Sword Sect coldly snorted, and said domineeringly, “Chu Feng, you truly have quite the nerves! Back then, I spared your life, yet you still dare to stir up trouble in my Stone Sword Sect? Do you truly think I won’t kill you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, what a joke! Spared my life? You are quite shameless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you forgotten the torture you felt back then in the Arctic Killing Formation?” Chu Feng laughed loudly. His laughter was very ridiculing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Arctic Killing Formation? Torture? What happened?” The crowd was taken aback by those words. As they looked at each other, they felt confused. Then, they cast their gazes, pleading for answers, at the head of the Stone Sword Sect, asking, “Sect Head Shi, what does that Chu Feng mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t listen to his rubbish! When have I been tortured by him?” The head of the Stone Sword Sect had quite an unsightly face as he heard the crowd’s question. But, he still refuted Chu Feng’s accusation. He couldn’t, after all, admit that he was nearly killed by Chu Feng’s torture in the Arctic Killing Formation, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was planning to rule over the people here! If he admitted to such a thing, where would his face go? Where would his dignity go? So, even if he were beaten to death, he would not speak the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right! Back then, I had personally seen Sect Head Shi chase after Chu Feng as he was escaping. I didn’t think he would dare to so brazenly claim he tortured Sect Head Shi in the Arctic Killing Formation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sect Head Shi, this person doesn’t want any face, so there’s no need to give him any mercy! Just do the same before and give him a good lesson!” someone shouted suddenly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right! He’s right! This Chu Feng killed the Stone Sword Sect’s six seniors! That is a capital offense! Sect Head Shi, you don’t need to be kindhearted and spare him. You must kill him and avenge your six elders!” At that moment, even more people spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill him, kill him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The recollection of the six supreme elders being killed incited the fury of the elders and disciples from the Stone Sword Sect. In an instant, various shouts exploded and like thunder, resounded within the Stone Sword Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, the head of the Stone Sword Sect tightly furrowed his brows. He felt his heart beating as though his heart were a drum. He knew very well he could not defeat Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong? Without Forbidden Medicine, you’re afraid?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Or perhaps, you know you’re no match for me, yet you’re afraid of your lies being revealed, thus you don’t dare to fight me?” Just at that moment, Chu Feng calmly smiled and spoke with ridicule.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nonsense! You think I’m afraid of you?” Although he was indeed afraid of Chu Feng, his words still enraged the head of the Stone Sword Sect. Chu Feng was humiliating him in front of the many elders and disciples of the Stone Sword Sect, as well as all peak experts in the Winter Plains</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he didn’t counterattack, it would mean he admitted Chu Feng’s words to be fact. It would be akin to using his face to sweep the ground! He wouldn’t hold any more power then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amidst his helplessness, he cast his gaze at Lord Yan behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeming to understand what he was worried about, Lord Yan calmly smiled and sent a mental message to him. “Go. With me here, I won’t give him any chance to humiliate you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Lord Yan spoke, the head of the Stone Sword Sect rejoiced. Although Chu Feng’s fighting strength was quite powerful and he had a Royal Armament, he knew Chu Feng wasn’t so strong as to defeat a rank eight Martial Lord. If Lord Yan made his move, Chu Feng was undoubtedly dead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Lord Yan supporting him, the head of the Stone Sword Sect wasn’t as afraid as before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, just in case, he still said, “Chu Feng, the reason you’re so arrogant is only because of you have a Royal Armament. If you don’t, do you think you’re worth anything?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoh, it seems that you’re just afraid I will use this Royal Armament. No problem, I’ll satisfy your wish. I won’t use the Royal Armament.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come, I don’t need a Royal Armament to litter the ground with your teeth and make you into a cripple,” Chu Feng said confidently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Quite the words you have there! Today, I’ll show you the distance between us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The head of the Stone Sword Sect gained much more confidence seeing Chu Feng truly didn’t plan to use his Royal Armament. He leapt into the air, and soon after, with his palms waving about, bursts of violent Martial power surged forth. They became glowing huge hands which slammed down at Chu Feng like a meteor shower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a rank eight martial skill, and its power was very frightening. As such, one could see that the head of the Stone Sword Sect truly feared Chu Feng. Even though he didn’t use a Royal Armament, that didn’t mean the sect head could be careless. His first attack was a killing blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, against all expectations, Chu Feng stood on the spot and didn’t even move while such a horrifying attack came towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is that Chu Feng doing? He’s not attacking, nor is he dodging! Is he looking to die?” Chu Feng’s action spread bewilderment amongst the crowd. All of their eyes glittered as they were clueless to Chu Feng’s action.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*boom boom boom boom boom*</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amidst the confusion, the sect head’s attack had struck their target. In an instant, not only did shock waves burst outward, explosions endlessly rang out. The plaza Chu Feng stood in was being bombarded. The ground was even violently shaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the chaos stirred up by the horrifying shock waves, everyone revealed joyous expressions because the sect head’s attacks were very terrifying. Very few people on scene could block them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, such a powerful martial skill had blown on Chu Feng’s body. Regardless of Chu Feng’s strength, he was most likely dead—that was everyone’s feelings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*huuu—*</span></p>
 <p><span style>But just at that moment, a gale suddenly swept out and instantly blew away the turbulent shock waves. At the same time, Chu Feng once again appeared within the crowd’s line of sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heavens! This… How is this possible?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After seeing Chu Feng, everyone was dumbfounded. A single word was written across their faces: astonishment. There were even some cowardly people who backed away, quite frightened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Lord Yan from the Immortal Execution Archipelago had a great change in expression. He too felt disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because at that very instant, the plaza Chu Feng stood on was filled with pits and holes. It was horrifically blown up, yet Chu Feng was still standing on the spot, his hand behind his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only were his clothes undamaged, he was uninjured in any way. There was even a mocking smile on his face.</span></p>
