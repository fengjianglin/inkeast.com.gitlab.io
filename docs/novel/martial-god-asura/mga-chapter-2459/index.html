 <p><strong> Chapter 2459 - Two Years In The Blink Of An Eye</strong></p>
 <p>Chu Feng stood at the edge of the third level and looked downward. Emotions filled his eyes.</p>
 <p>Down below, Zhan Lingling and Zhan Lingtong were able to faintly see Chu Feng’s silhouette. Admiration filled their eyes.</p>
 <p>To them, Chu Feng was already no longer an ordinary individual. Rather, he resembled a god.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Feng clenched his right hand. Golden strands of light began to faintly spill out of his fingers.</p>
 <p>At the moment when Chu Feng opened his hand, a circular title plate appeared on his palm.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng tossed away the title plate. The title plate began to roll down the flight of steps all the way to the second level.</p>
 <p>“That is?” Zhan Lingtong picked up the title plate and revealed a puzzled expression.</p>
 <p>“Lingtong, keep that title plate. If the Monstrous Clan is to come in the future, you merely need to pinch apart that title plate. Regardless of what cultivation I might have at that time, I will definitely come to your assistance,” After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he smiled at Zhan Lingling and Zhan Lingtong before turning around to leave.</p>
 <p>Zhan Lingling and Zhan Lingtong were no longer able to see Chu Feng’s silhouette, as Chu Feng had entered the third level.</p>
 <p>After arriving in the third level, Chu Feng chose a place adjacent to where Zhan Haichuan had trained to sit down.</p>
 <p>“Senior Zhan Haichuan, allow this junior to experience what you have experienced.”</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he closed his eyes and began to wholeheartedly concentrate on comprehending everything there.</p>
 <p>As for the third level of the Martial Comprehension Ground, it did not disappoint Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, that place contained extremely powerful martial comprehension.</p>
 <p>Since the martial comprehension contained on the third level was hidden very deep, Chu Feng made a decision to train there. Until he managed to reach a cultivation that was to his satisfaction, he did not plan to leave that place.</p>
 <p>After the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Clan Chief finished his emergency meeting, he immediately came to find out that Zhan Lingling and Zhan Lingtong had lured away the guards in charge of watching Chu Feng and stolen the keys to Chu Feng’s prison cell.</p>
 <p>Originally, the Clan Chief was overwhelmed with anger, and planned to punish his children. However, upon rushing to the prison cell and discovering that Chu Feng was still inside the prison cell, his anger instantly vanished.</p>
 <p>After all, with Chu Feng still inside the prison cell, it meant that his children had not overstepped their bounds. At the very most, they had held the intention to help Chu Feng, but had not dared to do so.</p>
 <p>Of course, he had no idea that inside the prison cell was not Chu Feng, but rather his clone. Chu Feng’s actual body was currently training in the third level of their Martial Comprehension Ground.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>Time flew past. In the blink of an eye, two years had passed.</p>
 <p>Over the course of those two years, from time to time, people from the Ancient Era’s War Clan would go and urge Chu Feng to return the Ancient Era’s War Sword to them.</p>
 <p>Merely, as Chu Feng always refused them, they also came less and less frequently to visit Chu Feng and urge him to return the Ancient Era’s War Sword.</p>
 <p>One thing worthy of mentioning was that the Ancient Era’s War Clan never planned to kill Chu Feng during that period of time.</p>
 <p>They felt that if Chu Feng were to truly refuse to return the Ancient Era’s War Sword to them, they would, at the very most, place Chu Feng under house arrest the entire time.</p>
 <p>Of course, they had no idea that the Chu Feng that they had imprisoned the entire time was merely Chu Feng’s clone.</p>
 <p>That said, the battle between the Ancient Era’s War Clan and the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan had grown fiercer and fiercer within those two years</p>
 <p>At that moment, the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan had gathered all of their battle power to unleash a final offensive against the Ancient Era’s War Clan.</p>
 <p>They intended to completely destroy the Ancient Era’s War Clan.</p>
 <p>“Rumble!!!”</p>
 <p>Under the darkened sky, flames of war scattered everywhere. The final battle between the Ancient Era’s War Clan and the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan had finally begun.</p>
 <p>Not only were there thunderous explosions, but the sounds of the earth sinking and the bitter screams from the crowd could also be heard.</p>
 <p>The Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan’s army was led personally by the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief. With their Clan Chief at the vanguard, the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan broke through the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s grand formation. Like a hot knife through butter, the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan began to slaughter their way to the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s headquarters.</p>
 <p>At that moment, a monstrous beast emitting the aura of a rank five Martial Ancestor emerged from among the Monstrous Clan’s troops. With an enormous black ax in hand, a robust build and a height greater than three meters, he faced toward the sky and shouted, “Today is the doomsday of your Ancient Era’s War Clan!”</p>
 <p>As he shouted, he was unrestrainedly killing the Ancient Era’s War Clansmen. That man was too powerful, so powerful that there was not a single person in the Ancient Era’s War Clan capable of contending against him.</p>
 <p>As for that person, he was naturally none other than the Clan Chief of the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan.</p>
 <p>“Puu~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a splash of blood splattered forth. It caused everyone from the War Clan to tense up.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because that blood was from their Clan Chief; their War Clan’s Clan Chief had been injured. His chest has been pierced through, and blood was flowing steadily from his chest.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the person that had defeated him was actually not the Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief. Rather, it was another person from the Monstrous Clan, an expert that possessed the cultivation of a rank four Martial Ancestor like the War Clan’s Clan Chief.</p>
 <p>“Truly trash. You are unable to even defeat my subordinate. It would seem that there is simply no need for me to act personally today in order to exterminate your War Clan,” The Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief mocked.</p>
 <p>“Monstrous Clan’s younger generation, don’t you dare act savage here!!!”</p>
 <p>A shout was heard. That shout shook everyone present.</p>
 <p>Then, an elderly man appeared before the Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief out of thin air. Then, that old man waved his sleeve, and a strong wind immediately swept forth. The wind forcibly smashed away the Monstrous Clan’s expert that had injured the War Clan’s Clan Chief.</p>
 <p>“Grandfather!!!”</p>
 <p>“Milord!!!”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing that individual, the Ancient Era’s War Clansmen all reacted as if they had seen their savior.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because that old man was the person who had been in closed-door training for a very long time, the person that the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan was afraid of the entire time.</p>
 <p>He was the father of the War Clan’s Clan Chief, the grandfather of Zhan Lingtong and Zhan Lingling, the existence that had grasped one of the Three Great Secret Skills, the Ancient Era’s War Axe.</p>
 <p>He was… Zhan Yuanmo.</p>
 <p>“Zhan Yuanmo, you are truly useless. I have given you this much time, yet you actually still haven’t managed to reach a breakthrough, you are still a rank four Martial Ancestor.”</p>
 <p>After seeing Zhan Yuanmo, the Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief was only surprised for a split second. Soon, only contempt remained in his eyes.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because he had discovered that even though Zhan Yuanmo had been in closed-door training for so long, he was still only a rank four Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>Before, the War Clan had let out news stating that Zhan Yuanmo had long since broken through to rank five Martial Ancestor. That was why the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan had not dared to attack the Ancient Era’s War Clan for a final life and death battle for so long. That fear had caused them to delay their attack for two entire years.</p>
 <p>However, in the past two years, they had not discovered Zhan Yuanmo, and the War Clan had also not shown any signs of a counterattack.</p>
 <p>Thus, they grew suspicious. In the end, they determined that Zhan Yuanmo had simply not reached a breakthrough. Thus, they decided to attack the War Clan for a final battle.</p>
 <p>And now, the appearance of Zhan Yuanmo had proven that their guess was correct. As such, it inevitably caused the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief, as well as his entire army, to feel complacent.</p>
 <p>They felt that as long as Zhan Yuanmo was still a rank four Martial Ancestor, the battle might very likely be the final battle between their Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan and the Ancient Era’s War Clan.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, there was an enormous chance that they would win the battle.</p>
 <p>“As long as this old man is here, don’t you all dare behave atrociously in our Ancient Era’s War Clan.”</p>
 <p>Zhan Yuanmo flipped his wrist, and a large axe appeared in his hand.</p>
 <p>The axe was copper in color, and seemed to be made of brass. Yet, the enormous might and aura it emitted could not be affected by its color and appearance.</p>
 <p>It was a weapon, an actual Ancestral Armament. Being held in Zhan Yuanmo’s hand, that Ancestral Armament was emitting an extremely frightening power.</p>
 <p>“Yoh, you’re but a rank four Martial Ancestor, what makes you think that you can contend against me? Today… even if you are to join hands with your son, you will still meet your death by my hands.”</p>
 <p>However, when faced with such a powerful Zhan Yuanmo, the Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief did not fear in the slightest.</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~”</p>
 <p>The enormous black axe the Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief held in his hand was suddenly swept forth. Immediately, a black ray of light slashed across, straight towards Zhan Yuanmo.</p>
 <p>Once that black ray of light appeared, everyone in the Ancient Era’s War Clan revealed ashen looks.</p>
 <p>As the saying goes, one will know the ability of an expert the moment they reveal themselves.</p>
 <p>When the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief unleashed that slash, they realized that even their Ancient Era’s War Clan’s strongest Zhan Yuanmo would not be a match for him.</p>
 <p>After all, the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief was a rank five Martial Ancestor, an entire level of cultivation above Zhan Yuanmo.</p>
