 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1276 - Provocation</strong></p>
 <p>At that moment, the crowd all revolved around Chu Feng and viewed him as their hero.</p>
 <p>However, Bai Yunxiao and the others were extremely dejected and depressed as they walked away from the battlefield. As the Monstrous Dragon Beast king had been killed, the cage that had imprisoned them naturally disappeared, restoring their freedom.</p>
 <p>However, at that very moment, they who had escaped with their lives were incapable of being happy at all. In fact, their expressions were even uglier than those of the Punishment Department’s management elders.</p>
 <p>Each and every one of them knew that they had truly disgraced themselves this time around. Not only had their limelight been snatched away from them, they had only narrowly avoided slandering the Cyanwood Mountain’s reputation. In other words, they had caused a great deal of trouble.</p>
 <p>In fact, both the Cyanwood Mountain’s elders and disciples were very disappointed with Bai Yunxiao and the others. This could be seen from the fact that no one came to welcome them when they returned to the master viewing platform.</p>
 <p>However, due to their special status and high potential, no one criticized them either. Merely, everyone had decided to just ignore them.</p>
 <p>“Aiyoyoyo.”</p>
 <p>“Aren’t these the geniuses of the Cyanwood Mountain? You all are actually shameless enough to return?”</p>
 <p>“When you were massacring the little Monstrous Dragon Beast pawns, it seemed that you were enjoying it immensely. Weren’t you all boasting about being able to kill them all? I had even thought that you all were extraordinarily amazing individuals too.”</p>
 <p>“However, who would’ve thought that once the Monstrous Dragon Beast king appeared, you all would be instantly done for and captured in a cage like six little turtles that did not dare to even move at all.”</p>
 <p>“Sigh, and here I was having such high hopes for you all, you’ve truly disappointed me. I am truly, truly, truly, truly disappointed.”</p>
 <p>While the people from the Cyanwood Mountain did not criticize them, it did not mean that others would not. As a matter of fact, the bold and audacious Sima Ying actually walked over to Bai Yunxiao and the others and began to ridicule them with an expression of extreme disdain on her smiling face.</p>
 <p>“Sima Ying, a loose tongue may cause a lot of trouble. I urge you to control your mouth so that no future disaster will fall upon you.”</p>
 <p>Bai Yunxiao and the others were filled with rage to begin with. And now, after being publicly humiliated by Sima Ying, they were so angry that their hearts, livers and lungs were about to explode. However, Bai Yunxiao still knew about the situation they were in. Thus, he controlled his fury and spoke threatening words to Sima Ying.</p>
 <p>“Aiyo, I’m so scared. A loose tongue may cause a lot of trouble, was it? Could it be that you’re planning to kill me?”</p>
 <p>“What’s with your moral quality? You’ve lost face yourself, yet you still insist on not allowing others to speak?”</p>
 <p>“If you’re this amazing and possess this much ability, then why didn’t you show it to the Monstrous Dragon Beasts? What could you possibly prove by bullying a weak little girl like myself?”</p>
 <p>“Damned girl, have I not beat you up enough or what?” At this moment, Tao Xiangyu, who had violently beaten Sima Ying up before, jumped out, extended her hand and pointed at Sima Ying. In an instant, her invisible oppressive might came crushing down on Sima Ying. She was trying to suppress Sima Ying by displaying her strength in secret.</p>
 <p>“I shall see who among you all dares to touch a single finger of hers.”</p>
 <p>However, right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly stood before Sima Ying. Furthermore, Bai Suyan, Bai Ruochen and the many management elders also followed Chu Feng over.</p>
 <p>“You…” Seeing these people, even Tao Xiangyu was immensely frightened. She immediately took back the finger that she was pointing at Sima Ying and stepped back one step.</p>
 <p>While she might not fear Chu Feng a lot, she did not dare to act imprudently in front of Bai Suyan and the many management elders. As such, she was forced to curb her arrogance.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you only won by relying on that world spirit of yours, do you truly think you’re amazing and possess real skills?” However, at the moment when Tao Xiangyu was stepping back, Bai Yunxiao actually stood forward.</p>
 <p>The gaze with which he looked to Chu Feng was filled with hostility. He had not bothered to hide the malevolence in his gaze at all.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had snatched away his limelight. As such, he greatly detested Chu Feng. He hated Chu Feng so much that he was itching to skin him alive and pull out his tendons before eating his flesh one bite at a time.</p>
 <p>However, before Chu Feng could say anything, Sima Ying spoke once again. “Why, it seems to me that you’re unconvinced? It is Chu Feng’s ability to be able to possess a powerful world spirit. If you have the ability, why don’t you go and get a powerful world spirit too? Humph, can you even get one? Would a powerful world spirit follow you? Are you qualified to be its master?”</p>
 <p>“There’s no chance in your entire life that you’ll be able to get an Asura Spirit World’s world spirit. Hell, with your talent, not to mention this life, in your next life, your next next life and the next life after that, you’ll still be hopeless in obtaining an Asura World Spirit. That is because your talent is so limited that they would never think that you would qualified to be their master. In your entire life and entire being, you will only be able to possess second-rate world spirits.”</p>
 <p>Her words were very crafty and her tone was extremely sharp. Even Chu Feng felt a great deal of admiration for her. This girl was truly daring and her ability to insult others was truly skillful. Not only did she not show any quarter, she immediately stabbed at their sore spot.</p>
 <p>After hearing that, Bai Yunxiao’s entire face turned green. That was because Sima Ying had really managed to hit his sore spot. He was naturally envious and jealous of Chu Feng. He envied that Chu Feng was able to contract an Asura World Spirit and was able to obtain such a powerful world spirit.</p>
 <p>But he, on the other hand, did not have a world spirit that powerful. No matter how much he wished for one, he would still have no chance to obtain one. It was not something that could be accomplished with only effort. No, it was something based on talent, one’s natural talent.</p>
 <p>No matter whether he was willing to accept it or not, he had no choice but to admit that his talent in world spirit techniques was much inferior to Chu Feng’s. This was his heart’s sorest spot, the place that he had tried his hardest to hide. Yet, at this moment, Sima Ying was precisely attacking that place.</p>
 <p>“Humph, even if he hadn’t butted in, we would have been able to break out from the Dragon Bloodline Formation and behead that Monstrous Dragon Beast king anyways,” Right at this moment, Ben Leihu jumped out with these words. He actually shamelessly declared that Chu Feng was meddling in their business.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, Chu Feng did not even qualify to do the dragon grade mission. What makes him think that he could meddle in our mission? Even without his interference, we would still have been able to exterminate that bunch of animals.”</p>
 <p>“From the way I see it, he is merely stealing our limelight,” Immediately following Ben Leihu, Qi Yanyu and Zhao Jingang also spoke to attack Chu Feng. They turned the situation of Chu Feng saving them into Chu Feng shamelessly stealing from them.</p>
 <p>“Heavens, I have seen shameless before. However, never have I seen people as shameless as you all. Your skins are simply so unimaginably thick.”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng has kindly saved you all, yet you actually attack him instead of expressing gratitude? Do you all have any bit of conscience left?”</p>
 <p>“Fortunately, there are a lot of people present here today. If there weren’t this many people, then were you all planning to attack your savior, Chu Feng, so that you could appease the anger of having your limelight stolen?” Sima Ying spoke with a shocked expression. She acted as if she was stunned by their shameless behavior.</p>
 <p>“Bullshit! Savior? Someone like him is qualified to be our savior?” Zhao Jingang and the others immediately denied the fact that Chu Feng had saved them.</p>
 <p>“Xuuuu~~~~” Once those words were spoken, hushing sounds filled the place. These sounds were not from the people of the Cyanwood Mountain. Instead, it was from the surrounding crowd.</p>
 <p>“Xuuuuu~~~~~” Immediately after, more and more hushing sounds began to be heard. Everyone was using this sort of method to ridicule Zhao Jingang and the others.</p>
 <p>After all, all of them had seen what had happened earlier with their own eyes.</p>
 <p>If it wasn’t for Chu Feng, then perhaps Bai Yunxiao, Zhao Jingang and the others would truly have lost their lives at the hands of the Monstrous Dragon Beast king.</p>
 <p>Yet, at this time, they actually spoke of Chu Feng in such a manner. Thus, even the surrounding crowd was unable to continue to watch and do nothing.</p>
 <p>“You, you all…” Zhao Jingang and the others did not realize that they had attracted the hatred of everyone present. Faced with this sort of situation, not only did they not surrender, they instead began to gnash their teeth and clench their fists in anger. Even blue veins were popping out on their skins.</p>
 <p>“Heh…” Faced with these clowns before him, Chu Feng laughed lightly. He patted Sima Ying’s shoulder and said, “Let’s go, why lower yourself to their level?”</p>
 <p>“True, why must I bother with trash like them?” Sima Ying seized the opportunity and began to leave. However, before she left, she did not forget to insult them again.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, do you dare to fight against me?” However, right after Chu Feng and the others turned around and prepared to leave, an angry voice suddenly echoed from behind him.</p>
