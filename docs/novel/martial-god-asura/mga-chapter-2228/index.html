 <p><strong> Chapter 2228 - Cold Shine</strong></p>
 <p>“Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Once the Golden Crane True Immortal’s words were said, the crowd present immediately charged toward those teleportation formations. They all wanted to be the first choose the islands which they felt contained treasures.</p>
 <p>This was especially true for the Four World Spiritist Emperors. They were the fastest among everyone. At that moment, the four of them had already entered two respective floating islands.</p>
 <p>After the two of them entered the teleportation formations, those teleportation formations disappeared. In other words, only two individuals were allowed to enter a teleportation formation. After two individuals entered a teleportation formation, the teleportation formation would disappear, and others would not be able to enter.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Chu Feng noticed that the two islands chosen by the Four World Spiritist Emperors indeed contained treasures. This meant that their perceptions were very decent.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, they had not managed to choose the island that the Exalted had trained on.</p>
 <p>“Brother Chu Feng, let us meet again on the summit of Mount Cloud Crane,” Daoist Three Swords clasped his fist at Chu Feng. Then, he and another world spiritist from the Immortal Sword School set foot into a teleportation formation. The island corresponding to the teleportation formation they entered was also an island that contained treasures.</p>
 <p>“Almsgiver Chu Feng, til we meet again,” Grandmaster Pocket bid his farewell to Chu Feng courteously. Then, he entered a teleportation formation by himself. Seeing him enter the teleportation formation, a world spiritist from the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple also entered that teleportation formation.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng noticed that the island Grandmaster Pocket chose was one without treasures.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng did not feel that Grandmaster Pocket did not possess the perceptive ability to determine which islands possessed treasures. Perhaps, he had deliberately chosen an island without treasures because he did not wish to compete with others.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, that world spiritist that had followed him was destined to not be able to obtain any treasures .</p>
 <p>“Let us go too,” Chu Feng said to Liu Xiaoli.</p>
 <p>“Mn,” Liu Xiaoli nodded.</p>
 <p>“Brother Chu Feng, please wait,” Right at that moment, Li Rui grabbed Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Brother Li Rui, do you need anything?” Chu Feng asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“Brother Chu Feng, my world spirit techniques are relatively weak. I fear that if I am to journey with Elder Ning Shuang, both of us will fail in breaking through that spirit formation on the floating island.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, I hope to be able to journey with you. Might it be possible for you to bring me instead?” Li Rui asked.</p>
 <p>“......” Chu Feng did not answer. Instead, he looked to Liu Xiaoli beside him.</p>
 <p>“If that’s the case, I can go with Elder Ning Shuang,” Liu Xiaoli said.</p>
 <p>“That would be good too,” Elder Ning Shuang nodded with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Very well then,” Seeing this, Chu Feng naturally did not refuse. Instead, he secretly sent a voice transmission to Elder Ning Shuang to tell them which island they should choose.</p>
 <p>The island Chu Feng chose for them not only contained treasures, it also possessed a spirit formation that was not too difficult to pass. With the abilities the two of them possessed, they should be able to break through that spirit formation easily.</p>
 <p>“My thanks,” Elder Ning Shuang trusted Chu Feng’s judgment enormously. After receiving Chu Feng’s recommendation, he revealed an overjoyed expression. Then, together with Liu Xiaoli, he entered the teleportation formation to that island.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go too,” Then, Chu Feng brought Li Rui and arrived before a teleportation formation. That teleportation formation was precisely the one that led to the floating island where that Exalted had trained.</p>
 <p>Merely, no one was able to tell what was special about that island. As such, no one had thought about choosing that floating island.</p>
 <p>“Brother Chu Feng, are we to choose this island?” At that moment, Li Rui revealed a puzzled expression.</p>
 <p>“Indeed,” Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he stepped into the teleportation formation.</p>
 <p>Seeing Chu Feng enter, Li Rui revealed a slight hesitation. The reason for that was because he felt that the island was too ordinary. Else, why would no one think about choosing that island?</p>
 <p>However, in the end, he clenched his teeth and entered the teleportation formation after Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“He actually chose correctly? Is that a coincidence?” The Golden Crane True Immortal noticed that scene. His gaze grew complicated.</p>
 <p>“The way I see it, it’s the embodiment of his strength. Could it be that you didn’t notice that boy’s gaze had turned slightly unusual earlier?” The old monk said.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, it was unusual. It seems that he possesses an observation method that surpasses those of ordinary individuals,” The Golden Crane True Immortal nodded in agreement. However, he then sighed.</p>
 <p>“Why are you sighing?” The old monk asked.</p>
 <p>“A clever person may become the victim of his own ingenuity,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“What do you mean?” The old monk asked.</p>
 <p>“That island is indeed the island where that Exalted trained before. Merely, the cliff that he had trained in was already sealed. With that brat’s world spirit techniques, it is simply impossible for him to undo the seal.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, even if he has chosen correctly, he will still wind up empty-handed. As such, it would be better had he chosen another island,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“You old codger. You’re truly too selfish. You actually went out of your way to seal the location where the Exalted trained.” The old monk said with an expression of contempt.</p>
 <p>“No, it was not me who sealed it. Instead, it was personally sealed by that Exalted,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“Oh?” Hearing those words, the old monk’s expression changed slightly. Then, he said, “It would seem that that brat is truly unfortunate then.”</p>
 <p>………...</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng and Li Rui had already set foot onto that island.</p>
 <p>After arriving on the island, Chu Feng and Li Rui were surprised to discover that the island was a place of charm and beauty.</p>
 <p>Compared to when looking from the outside, this island was much more vast.</p>
 <p>It was very large, extremely large. The surface area of this island simply surpassed one’s imagination.</p>
 <p>Although the island was enormous, Chu Feng and Li Rui were immediately blocked by a layer of spirit formation right after walking several steps inward.</p>
 <p>In other words, if they failed to remove the spirit formation, they would not be able to enter the depths of the island.</p>
 <p>However, something like that would naturally not be able to stop Chu Feng. Using merely a short moment of time, Chu Feng completely undid the spirit formation.</p>
 <p>“Wow! Brother Chu Feng, your world spirit techniques are truly amazing.”</p>
 <p>“If it wasn’t for the fact that your spirit power still remains Royal-level spirit power, I would truly be skeptical as to whether you were an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist,” Li Rui exclaimed in admiration. He was praising Chu Feng nonstop.</p>
 <p>After all, he was also a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. However, when he saw the spirit formation, he felt as if he had seen an enormous mountain. It would simply be impossible for him to pass through the spirit formation in twenty hours’ time.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng had actually managed to undo that spirit formation in only a short period of time. This showed him that even though the two of them were both Royal-cloak World Spiritists, there was an enormous difference in strength between their world spirit techniques.</p>
 <p>“Brother Li Rui, you are flattering me. Let’s go,” Chu Feng said with a light smile.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Li Rui asked, “Brother Chu Feng, do you sense that this place contains a special sort of power?”</p>
 <p>“Indeed, there’s a special power here. It seems to be binding world spirit gates,” Chu Feng also noticed the strangeness of the place.</p>
 <p>“You are truly clever. While that power does not possess much usefulness, it is able to make world spiritists unable to open their world spirit gates here.”</p>
 <p>“In other words, they will not be able to summon their world spirits,” Li Rui said.</p>
 <p>“That is indeed the case. This power is very ancient. It is very likely the doing of that Exalted. Merely, why would he set up such a power here? Could it be that he dislikes world spiritists?” Chu Feng asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“I do not know about that. However, there is one thing that I do know,” Li Rui said.</p>
 <p>“What is it?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“You will die,” Li Rui suddenly narrowed his eyebrows. Coldness shone in his previously smiling eyes. His killing intent was overflowing.</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~”</p>
 <p>At that time, he flipped his palm. Then, a burst of martial power surged toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>That surging martial power was extremely strong. If Chu Feng were to be struck by it, he would undoubtedly be killed.</p>
 <p>Li Rui was planning to kill Chu Feng!!!</p>
