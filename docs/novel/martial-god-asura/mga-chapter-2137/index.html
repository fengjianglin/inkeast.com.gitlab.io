 <p><strong> Chapter 2137 - A Mission</strong></p>
 <p>“The Natural Energies contained in your dantian right now are sufficient enough for you to reach rank three Half Martial Ancestor.”</p>
 <p>“However, you are unable to even reach rank two Half Martial Ancestor. And that is you… being bottlenecked. You will need to rely on your own comprehension of the way of martial cultivation and think of a way to use your Inherited Bloodline to break through that bottleneck.”</p>
 <p>“However, after you reach a breakthrough, you will not be able to directly reach a breakthrough in cultivation like you did before.”</p>
 <p>“You will bring forth the arrival of a catastrophe, Divine Lightnings capable of causing massive destruction will descend from the sky to strike at your body.”</p>
 <p>“Only by withstanding them will you be able to truly reach a breakthrough. The reason for that is because… you have successfully learned the highest level Self-punishing Mysterious Technique -- the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique!!!”</p>
 <p>“That said, there is also an extremely important matter that I must remind you of. Although it will be much more difficult for you to reach a breakthrough in cultivation after learning the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, the Natural Energies you need to reach a breakthrough in cultivation will continue to be more and more frightening.”</p>
 <p>“I will not continue to provide you with cultivation resources. I have already given you all that I can. You must go and search, scramble for and seize the remaining cultivation resources yourself.”</p>
 <p>“That can be considered the special sort of nurturing method of our family. That is also what your grandfather had me do back then,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“Father, I understand. I will absolutely not disappoint you,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng knew very well that while the cultivation path for the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique would be very difficult, the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique was most definitely a rare treasure. He was only able to train in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique because of his father.</p>
 <p>This could be considered a blessing, a blessing from his father.</p>
 <p>However, more than that, it was a sort of expectation, an expectation that his father had toward him.</p>
 <p>What Chu Feng must do was not disappoint the expectations his father held toward him. He planned to obtain his father’s acknowledgement with the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. At the same time, he must obtain acknowledgement from everyone else.</p>
 <p>However, if he truly wished to be acknowledged, he couldn’t rely on his father alone. Thus, Chu Feng had already made the decision that he would work hard by himself to make each and every following breakthrough.</p>
 <p>“Very well. You are worthy of being my, Chu Xuanyuan’s, son,” Seeing that Chu Feng did not cower in the slightest when faced with such a difficult path for cultivation, Chu Xuanyuan smiled with joy and pride.</p>
 <p>“I already know that you plan to go to the Outer World. Thus, there are some things that I must tell you first.”</p>
 <p>“While the Chu Heavenly Clan are heartless toward us father and son, we father and son cannot be disloyal to the Chu Heavenly Clan.”</p>
 <p>“Everything cannot be generalized. While there were indeed people from the Chu Clan that secretly attacked us father and son, it does not mean that all the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan wish to bring harm upon us.”</p>
 <p>“In fact, when the Chu Clan’s Clan Chief decided to imprison us father and son in the Chu Clan’s forbidden area, there were many people in the Chu Clan that pleaded for us.”</p>
 <p>“Thus… upon entering the Outer World, should you encounter people from the Chu Heavenly Clan, it would be best that you not treat them with hostility.”</p>
 <p>“However… if there are people from the Chu Heavenly Clan that wish to cause you harm, you must not be benevolent toward them either,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“Father, please rest assured, I understand your intentions. What I am going to do is not to take revenge against the Chu Heavenly Clan. Instead, I am going to make them realize that their decision back then was mistaken.”</p>
 <p>“However, if there are people from the Chu Heavenly Clan that wish to cause me harm, I will absolutely not be lenient toward them. Regardless of whether they might be people that might attack me in the future, or people that secretly attacked father before, I will definitely not spare any of them,” Chu Feng said earnestly. As he spoke those words, a faint coldness flashed through his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Very good. To be able to distinguish between gratitude and grudges, that is what my, Chu Xuanyuan’s, son should be like.”</p>
 <p>Seeing Chu Feng’s reaction, Chu Xuanyuan nodded his head in satisfaction. Then, he said, “After you exit this place, the place that you will arrive in will not be the Upper Realm where our Chu Heavenly Clan is located. Instead, it will be the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.”</p>
 <p>“The Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm is a place that all of the people from the Lower Realms under the administration of our Chu Heavenly Clan must reach.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, every year, there will always be countless people from the Lower Realms entering the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to start tempering themselves anew.”</p>
 <p>“The implication behind the name Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm precisely means to refine and temper oneself hundreds and thousands of times over. If one cannot pass through the trials in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, one will not be able to enter the Upper Realm, and will end up staying in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm for the rest of their lives. At the very most, they will be able to enter the other Ordinary Realms. However, even if they do, they will remain unable to enter the Upper Realm without sufficient qualifications.”</p>
 <p>“Precisely because of that, the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm has set up a Hundred Refinements Stage. The Hundred Refinements Stage is the place that practically all the people entering from the Lower Realms must reach.”</p>
 <p>“The Hundred Refinements Stage is normally closed, and will only be open once every year. In other words, all the people from the Lower Realm that reach the Hundred Refinements Stage within that year will end up cultivating together in the Hundred Refinements Stage.”</p>
 <p>“After the gate of the Hundred Refinements Stage is opened, the people from the Lower Realm will be ranked according to their strength.”</p>
 <p>“Every year, the various powers outside of the Hundred Refinement Ordinary Realm will wait outside of the Hundred Refinements Stage for that ranking.”</p>
 <p>“They will choose their disciples according to that ranking list. Without a doubt, the people from the Lower Realm with a higher ranking will be more highly sought after.”</p>
 <p>“If you are to directly enter the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm through the Stairway to Heaven from the Realm of Gods, you will be able to directly reach the Hundred Refinements Stage.”</p>
 <p>“However, I do not suggest that you go and strive for a high place on the ranking. After all, you do not belong to the Lower Realm. Instead, you belong to the Upper Realm. Thus, there is no significance in you competing with a bunch of people from the Lower Realm.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, I’m going to give you this,” As Chu Xuanyuan spoke, he hand a world spirit key to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Father, this is?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“This world spirit key is capable of helping you create an opening through the spirit formation around the Hundred Refinements Stage. After entering the Hundred Refinements Stage, you do not have to stay there. Using this key, you can leave that place and experience the outside world,” Chu Xuanyuan explained.</p>
 <p>“Got it,” Chu Feng carefully put the key away. However, he suddenly thought of something, and asked, “Then, what about the Eastern Sea Region’s Stairway to Heaven?”</p>
 <p>“The Eastern Sea Region also possesses a Stairway to Heaven?” Chu Xuanyuan asked in astonishment. He evidently did not know about that.</p>
 <p>“There is indeed one in the Eastern Sea Region,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“The track of the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm’s Stairway to Heaven’s teleportation has already been changed. Unless the Stairway to Heaven that you mentioned was set up by an extremely powerful person, unless that Stairway to Heaven was able to conceal itself from everything, it would still lead to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“Father, in that case, can you give me another world spirit key? I have a friend here. If she is to enter the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, and decide to not stay in the Hundred Refinements Stage, I hope…”</p>
 <p>“That’s no issue,” Before Chu Feng could finish, Chu Xuanyuan took out another world spirit key and handed it to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Thank you father,” Chu Feng received the world spirit key and expressed his thanks emotionally.</p>
 <p>As a world spiritist, Chu Feng was able to tell how powerful that world spirit key was merely by looking at it. If his father had not handed him a world spirit key, he would likely also be unable to leave the Hundred Refinements Stage.</p>
 <p>As for the second world spirit key, he had requested it for Xian Miaomiao.</p>
 <p>“Feng’er, although the Ordinary Realm cannot compare to the Upper Realm, it is still definitely not something that the Lower Realm can compare with.”</p>
 <p>“Entering the Ordinary Realm from the Lower Realm means entering a new world. Before you obtain a certain amount of strength, it would be best that you not provoke powers that are extremely strong.”</p>
 <p>“Among them, you must pay attention to a power called the Infant Soul Sect. It is the most dangerous among all the powers in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. When you encounter them, you must be extra careful. You absolutely cannot afford to be careless toward them,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“Infant Soul Sect?” Chu Feng felt a burst of cold upon hearing that name. He felt that that sect was most definitely not a righteous sect. Thus, Chu Feng said, “Father, please rest assured. I will definitely be careful.”</p>
 <p>“Mn,” Chu Xuanyuan nodded. Then, he said, “Although you will have to be low-key after entering the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, father will still hand you a mission.”</p>
 <p>“What is the mission? Father, please tell me,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Eliminate the Infant Soul Sect,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“Ahh?!!!” Chu Feng was immediately stunned by those words.</p>
