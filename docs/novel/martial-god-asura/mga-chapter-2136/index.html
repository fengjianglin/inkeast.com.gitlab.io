 <p><strong> Chapter 2136 - Rank One Half Martial Ancestor</strong></p>
 <p>As Chu Xuanyuan spoke, he flipped his palm. Then, a jadeite-like gem appeared on his palm.</p>
 <p>“Refine this, and you’ll be able to directly become a Half Martial Ancestor,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“Father, this gem…” Chu Feng received the gem. Excitement filled his heart.</p>
 <p>Over the years, he had refined countless Natural Oddities and cultivation resources. However, this was his first time seeing something that contained such a dense amount of Natural Energy.</p>
 <p>Truth be told, with Chu Feng’s current cultivation, it would most likely be impossible for him to find any cultivation resources appropriate for him in the Holy Land of Martialism.</p>
 <p>However, the gem that Chu Xuanyuan had just handed him was actually capable of helping Chu Feng reach rank one Half Martial Ancestor directly from rank seven Martial Emperor. To be able to reach three breakthroughs at once was something that Chu Feng had not even dared to imagine before.</p>
 <p>“All these years, your father has never helped you with your cultivation. The reason why I did that is because I wanted you to be able to personally experience things for yourself so that you can temper your heart.”</p>
 <p>“This time around, you can consider this compensation from your father.,” Chu Xuanyuan said with a light smile.</p>
 <p>“Thank you father,” Chu Feng stood up and courteously bowed.</p>
 <p>“Didn’t I say that there’s no need to be so overly courteous, as we are father and son? Go ahead and refine it.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng tossed the gem he held in his hand, opened his mouth and bit onto the gem. Then, he sat down in a cross-legged position and began to refine the gem.</p>
 <p>Soon, surging Natural Energies began to flow through Chu Feng’s body. They began to pour into Chu Feng’s dantian nonstop; they, were all being refined by Chu Feng’s Divine Lightnings.</p>
 <p>Under such circumstances, Chu Feng’s cultivation began to increase nonstop. Rank eight Martial Emperor, rank nine Martial Emperor...</p>
 <p>At the moment when a total of eight lightnings were surging out from Chu Feng’s body before entering his body again, Chu Feng’s cultivation reached rank one Half Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>Everything was as Chu Xuanyuan had said. The Natural Energies contained in that gem were truly capable of allowing Chu Feng to directly reach rank one Half Martial Ancestor from rank seven Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>Without using his Thunder Armor or Thunder Wings, or any other method to increase his cultivation, Chu Feng currently gave off the aura of a rank one Half Martial Ancestor. He had become an actual Half Martial Ancestor-level expert in one go.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, it was not only Chu Feng’s cultivation that had increased to rank one Half Martial Ancestor. He had also obtained another level of heaven-defying battle power. In other words, his heaven-defying battle power was now capable of surmounting six levels of cultivation.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Feng waved his hand. Immediately, the surrounding Ancestral-level martial power surged forth and entered Chu Feng’s body, waiting to be used by him.</p>
 <p>“How do you feel?” Chu Xuanyuan asked.</p>
 <p>“I am finally able to grasp Ancestral-level martial power. As expected from Half Martial Ancestor, they are truly incomparable to Martial Emperors.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, my battle power is currently capable of surmounting six levels of cultivation. I am not just only a bit stronger than before. This sort of sensation is truly fabulous,” Chu Feng said excitedly.</p>
 <p>“Half Martial Ancestors are naturally more powerful than Martial Emperors. As for your heaven-defying battle power, while it is correct to say that it is capable of surmounting six levels of cultivation, it would be more reasonable to say that it is capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“Capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation?” Chu Feng was puzzled.</p>
 <p>“Those capable of becoming Martial Emperors all possess heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. Not to mention the Upper Realm, even in the Ordinary Realm, Martial Emperors are countless.”</p>
 <p>“In the Outer World, the Martial Emperor realm is a dividing line. Only those capable of becoming Martial Emperors are considered to be qualified to be considered martial cultivators. All those that fail to step into Martial Emperor realm are known to be extremely inferior in the Outer World. They are people that are looked upon with disdain by others.”</p>
 <p>“As for Martial Emperors, since they all possess at least a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation, your heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting six levels of cultivation is only capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation when compared to even the most ordinary Martial Emperors.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, the opponents that you will face in the future will definitely not be Martial Emperors or those below them. They will all be people with cultivations surpassing Martial Emperor. Thus, from this point on, you must remember this. Even if your opponent is only ordinary, your dominance would only be a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“Never would I have expected that the Martial Emperors that were capable of covering the sky with their hands in the Holy Land of Martialism are only people that have just become qualified as martial cultivators in the Outer Realm.”</p>
 <p>After hearing his father’s words, Chu Feng came to realize even more why the Holy Land of Martialism, the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm, was the weakest among the countless Lower Realms. It turned out that the cultivators there were utterly inferior when compared to cultivators in the vast Outer World.</p>
 <p>“Feng’er, you are still young. After you enter the Outer World, you will discover that… even though you possess three additional levels of heaven-defying battle power when compared to ordinary Half Martial Ancestors, you are not the strongest among those of your generation.”</p>
 <p>“Not only are there many Heavenly Clans in the Outer World, there are also, in addition to the humans that possess Heavenly Bloodlines, monstrous beasts that possess powerful Inherited Bloodlines.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, when you reach the Outer World, you will discover that the actual Divine Bodies there are also extremely powerful,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that Divine Bodies in the Outer World are so powerful that they can contend against our Heavenly Bloodlines?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had encountered many Divine Bodies in the Holy Land of Martialism. Although they were very powerful, Chu Feng only felt them to be powers on par with Imperial Bloodlines. When compared to his Inherited Bloodline, they were much inferior. In fact, they were simply not on the same level.</p>
 <p>“That differs from individual to individual. The weak Divine Bodies would be the same as the ones you met here. They are only comparable to Imperial Bloodlines. In fact, some of them are inferior to even Imperial Bloodlines.”</p>
 <p>“However, by the same account, there are Divine Bodies that are extremely powerful. Not to mention those that are capable of contending against our Heavenly Bloodline, some Divine Bodies have grasped powers that surpass even ordinary wielders of Heavenly Bloodlines.”</p>
 <p>“In the Outer World, there are a relatively large amount of such Divine Bodies,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Feng took a long sigh.</p>
 <p>“Feng’er, what’s wrong?” Chu Xuanyuan asked.</p>
 <p>“Having lived in this world for so long, although I always knew how small and ignorant I was every time I looked to the vast starry sky, when the truth is verified, when it is determined that I am truly small and ignorant, that sensation is truly unpleasant,” Chu Feng said with a wry smile.</p>
 <p>He was able to realize that while he remained an exceptional genius in this place, he would become an ordinary person upon entering the Outer World.</p>
 <p>Even though he had a Heavenly Bloodline, there were many people that could contend against him in the Outer World.</p>
 <p>In fact, there were many people much more powerful than him. It would be extremely difficult for him to become the strongest among the younger generation.</p>
 <p>What awaited him was destined to be a challenging journey.</p>
 <p>“Feng’er, there is also a difference between the strengths of one’s Heavenly Bloodline. As the Self-punishment Mysterious Technique that you trained in is the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, you will obtain a Divine Mark when you become a Martial Ancestor and obtain the Nine Lightnings Fusion.”</p>
 <p>“At that time, even in the Outer World, you will still be a brilliant nova.”</p>
 <p>“Merely… even though you are only nine levels of cultivation away from becoming a Martial Ancestor, it is an extremely difficult cultivation journey.”</p>
 <p>As Chu Xuanyuan spoke, he took out another twenty gems that contained a dense amount of Natural Energy. He tossed those gems to Chu Feng and said, “Refine all of them at once.”</p>
 <p>“Yes,” Chu Feng did not hesitate and directly refined all twenty gems completely. However… he did not manage to successfully reach a single breakthrough. His cultivation… remained that of a rank one Half Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>He was able to sense that the dense amount of Natural Energies were gathered in his dantian. Originally, those Natural Energies would have been enough for him to reach a breakthrough.</p>
 <p>Merely, there was an invisible wall separating the Natural Energies from his Inherited Bloodline. If that wall was not broken through, his Inherited Bloodline would not be able to refine the boundless Natural Energies. In turn, Chu Feng would not be able to reach a breakthrough in his cultivation.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng realized that Natural Energies no longer remained the most crucial aspect to him reaching a breakthrough in cultivation.</p>
 <p>From this point forward, his cultivation journey would become completely different.</p>
