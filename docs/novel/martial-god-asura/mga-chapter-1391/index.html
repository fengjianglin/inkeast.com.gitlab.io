 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1391 - Explaining Everything</strong></p>
 <p>“Indeed, it’s different from before. In such a short period of time, you’ve actually managed to achieve such enormous progress. Girl, you are truly marvelous.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng smiled lightly. He had noticed the changes to Sima Ying the moment he had seen her. From the bottom of his heart, Chu Feng felt joy for Sima Ying.</p>
 <p>While Chu Feng worried about his enemies becoming stronger than himself due to the fact that it was detrimental to him, he was never displeased by his friends becoming stronger than himself. On the contrary, he would feel joy over it.</p>
 <p>This was Chu Feng’s character. He was a person who emphasized friendship. When one truly cared about someone else, they would only wish for that person to become even stronger, and would definitely not wish illness to befall that person, nor would they become envious that the person who they cared about was better off than themselves.</p>
 <p>“You’re over-complimenting me. I have only managed to obtain my accomplishments today with the help of a formation, it is not all because of my own talent,” After being praised by Chu Feng, Sima Ying felt a sense of embarrassment and decided to confess.</p>
 <p>“Formation? What sort of formation?” Hearing what Sima Ying said, Chu Feng became curious.</p>
 <p>“A very powerful formation called the Royal Metamorphosis Formation,” Sima Ying smiled sweetly. Then, she began to tell Chu Feng about the matter of her entering the Royal Metamorphosis Formation, as well as the reason why she had entered it.</p>
 <p>“To become a royal-cloak world spiritist at such a young age, that woman is truly remarkable. In that case, when will she be returning to the World Spiritist Alliance to challenge you all again?”</p>
 <p>After learning of that girl by the name of Lil Mei defeating all the geniuses of the World Spiritist Alliance with her deeply profound world spirit techniques, Chu Feng also felt a great amount of shock.</p>
 <p>That was because although his world spirit techniques were very powerful, he was still only a gold-cloak world spiritist.</p>
 <p>Yet, such a young royal-cloak world spiritist actually appeared. Naturally, this piqued Chu Feng’s interest. He was also very curious to know exactly what sort of woman that Lil Mei might be for her to be this powerful.</p>
 <p>“Soon. Judging by the time, it should be soon. As long as she doesn’t miss the appointment, I believe she will be here very soon,” Sima Ying said.</p>
 <p>“In that case, it would appear that the matter that senior Miao brought me here for is this matter?”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng suddenly recalled how Miao Renlong had invited him to the World Spiritist Alliance as a guest because something was supposedly going to happen in the World Spiritist Alliance.</p>
 <p>At that time, Chu Feng had decided to go to the World Spiritist Alliance because he had wanted to see Sima Ying. Thus, he had not really been interested in what the matter that Miao Renlong had spoken of might have been. As such, he had not asked about what was going to happen in the World Spiritist Alliance.</p>
 <p>And now, Chu Feng felt that it was very likely that the matter that Miao Renlong had spoken of was this matter with that woman by the name of Lil Mei.</p>
 <p>“Mn, Grandpa Miao went to the Sealing Ancient Village for the sake of asking the Sealing Ancient Village for guidance about a certain sealing formation so that he could teach it to senior brother Lin and senior brother Fu to use when they compete against that woman.”</p>
 <p>“After all, we cannot afford to be defeated again this time around,” Sima Ying said.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng already knew about the miraculousness of the Royal Metamorphosis Formation. Thus, he was unable to contain his curiosity and asked, “Those two senior brothers that you’ve mentioned, could it be that they’ve managed to become royal-cloak world spiritists after going through the Royal Metamorphosis Formation?”</p>
 <p>“Mn, there are a total of ten people who entered the Royal Metamorphosis Formation this time around. However, only the two of them managed to successfully become royal-cloak world spiritists.”</p>
 <p>“However, that is already sufficient. After all, the two strongest members of the younger generation in our World Spiritist Alliance are those two,” When mentioning those two senior brothers, Sima Ying had a lot of confidence in them.</p>
 <p>“To be able to produce two royal-cloak world spiritists at once, that formation is truly amazing. Tsk tsk, if I had also been able to enter that formation, oh how great would that have been,” Chu Feng said in a joking manner.</p>
 <p>“If you had joined our World Spiritist Alliance, you might have been able to enter the Royal Metamorphosis Formation too. It’s your own fault for refusing,” Sima Ying said.</p>
 <p>“Sigh, if I knew that there would be such a good thing, I would’ve joined back then,” Chu Feng said jokingly.</p>
 <p>“Oh you, you only know how to joke around. If we were to ask you to join again, you’d refuse again.”</p>
 <p>Sima Ying was able to tell that Chu Feng was joking around. In a slightly angered manner, she curled her lips. After all, she was very hopeful for Chu Feng to join their World Spiritist Alliance.</p>
 <p>Seeing Sima Ying becoming a bit angry, Chu Feng smiled and began to try to appease her, “Don’t be angry. If the opportunity comes in the future, I might join your World Spiritist Alliance,”</p>
 <p>“Really?” Hearing those words, Sima Ying’s mood improved slightly.</p>
 <p>“Of course!” Chu Feng nodded his head. However, he soon added, “However, it will also depend on the situation.”</p>
 <p>“Okay then. However, even if you were to join in the future, you have already missed the opportunity.”</p>
 <p>“The amount of resources the Royal Metamorphosis Formation requires is truly enormous. The activation of the Royal Metamorphosis Formation this time around caused both the Lord Alliance Master and Grandpa Miao to exhaust a great amount of their vitality. Even the two lords who they invited from the World Spiritist Sacred Assembly exhausted their vitality.”</p>
 <p>“The way I see it, unless there’s a special circumstance, this Royal Metamorphosis Formation will not be activated again for a very long time.” Sima Ying seemed to be feeling regret for Chu Feng. As she mentioned this matter, she began to hang her head dispiritedly.</p>
 <p>“Hey, don’t be like this. I was merely joking around. Don’t take it seriously.”</p>
 <p>“Let alone, even if I were to enter the Royal Metamorphosis Formation, it is not guaranteed that I would be able to become a royal-cloak world spiritist.”</p>
 <p>“That said, even if I do not have the help of the Royal Metamorphosis Formation, it does not necessarily mean that I will not become a royal-cloak world spiritist in the future.”</p>
 <p>“While becoming a royal-cloak world spiritist requires both talent and chance, I have a premonition that both you and I will become royal-cloak world spiritists in the future,” Chu Feng said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Oh you, all you know is talking your way out of things. Oh, that’s right, did you really come here for the purpose of visiting me?” Sima Ying fixed her pair of large eyes on Chu Feng. It was as if she could see through him if he tried to lie.</p>
 <p>“Of course it’s true. I’ve come here to find you. Furthermore, it’s because of an urgent matter that I need to inform you about,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“What is it?” Sima Ying asked curiously.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng did not want to conceal anything. Thus, he began to tell Sima Ying, truthfully and in detail, about all that had happened in the Sealing Ancient Village, as well as the matter regarding Han Helai.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, is what you said the truth? We’ll be able to find out where Han Helai is through that Sealing Ancient Village’s formation?” Sure enough, after finding out about this matter, Sima Ying immediately became emotional.</p>
 <p>However, this could not be blamed on her. After all, there was an enormous hatred between her and Han Helai. Likely, even in her dreams, she would dream about killing Han Helai.</p>
 <p>“That is what senior Ma said. As for whether that formation truly possesses that power, that I do not know for sure.”</p>
 <p>“However, I feel like it is something that is worthy of trying. However, we must still determine first whether that person who stole the Sealing Glacier was Han Helai or not.”</p>
 <p>“And before that, we must find an item that contains Han Helai’s aura,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“That’s easy to do. Han Helai had been in the World Spiritist Alliance for a very long time. The items that he had touched are numerous. There are definitely a lot of items here that contain his aura.”</p>
 <p>“However, Han Helai is very powerful and cunning. I fear that the Sealing Ancient Village’s Village Chief Ma might not be a match for him.”</p>
 <p>“We must inform Grandpa Miao about this matter. If he were to personally set off to take care of it, we would be able to obtain twice the effect with half the work. As long as we can find him, Han Helai is definitely going to die,” Sima Ying said.</p>
 <p>“Mn, that would be best,” Chu Feng nodded. Miao Renlong was extremely powerful. If he were to set out after Han Helai, then there would be no way for Han Helai to escape.</p>
 <p>“This matter should not be delayed, let’s go and find Grandpa Miao right away,” Sima Ying was very impatient. She pulled Chu Feng and ran out to find Miao Renlong and inform him about this matter.</p>
