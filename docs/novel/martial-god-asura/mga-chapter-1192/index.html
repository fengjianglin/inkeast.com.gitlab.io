 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1192 - Rank Three Martial King</strong></p>
 <p>At the most mysterious and respected region of the Cyanwood Mountain were several ancient towers that reached towards the heavens.</p>
 <p>These ancient towers were extremely tall. Even though the skies and the earth of the Holy Land of Martialism were extremely far apart, these ancient towers were able to pass through the clouds.</p>
 <p>If one was to carefully count them, then one would notice that there was a total of one thousand eight hundred and ninety-nine ancient towers. These towers were all placed in a very orderly manner and in a delicate arrangement. At a glance, they appeared like palaces above the clouds. Yet, more than that, they appeared more like a mysterious formation array.</p>
 <p>Among the ancient towers, a cyan-colored ancient tower was the tallest. This ancient tower was very plain and simple-looking. Yet, it was extremely imposing, appearing as it had been constructed by immortals, and possessed the demeanor of the king of all towers.</p>
 <p>At this moment, two figures were standing on top of this cyan-colored ancient tower. They were an old man and a middle-aged man.</p>
 <p>The old man was wearing form-fitting clothes and possessed a very fierce and malicious appearance. Especially his eyes were extremely frightening. They were unable to contain his killing intent at all. Or, perhaps it should be said that he did not wish to contain his killing intent.</p>
 <p>This killing intent of his was not there because he was angry or wanted to kill people. Instead, it was a killing intent that originated from his bones[1. The deepest level] because he had killed too many people.</p>
 <p>To be exact, this killing intent should be said to be hostility, an innate hostility. However, even when this frightening hostility was not mentioned, this old man’s aura was still unfathomably deep, even more profound than the two management elders from the Weaponry Refinement Department and the Medicine Concocting Department. As for him, he was one of the management elders of the Punishment Department, Crazed Killer Tuoba.[1. His name could also be Tuoba Shakuang. Tuoba is a surname for certain. Shakuang literally means crazed killer. I highly doubt that anyone would name their child crazed killer. I think it’s his title instead.]</p>
 <p>Crazed Killer Tuoba possessed an enormous reputation and very powerful strength. Among the numerous management elders of the Cyanwood Mountain, his reputation was on par with the Half Martial Emperor White Ape. The two of them were known to be the Cyanwood Mountain headmaster’s left and right hand men. From this, one could tell how powerful this person was.</p>
 <p>However, even such a powerful Crazed Killer Tuoba was displaying a humble expression and looking at the middle-aged man before him with reverence.</p>
 <p>This middle-aged man was not very tall. His appearance was not extraordinary either. Even his outfit was very ordinary and plain, being just coarse cotton clothes that common people wore.</p>
 <p>However, this set of cotton clothes was incomparably clean, untainted by even a speck of dust. Most importantly, the aura displayed by this man was truly incomparable.</p>
 <p>He was standing there without displaying the slightest bit of his might. Yet, the surrounding space was actually trembling as if it feared him. This man was truly frightening to the extreme.</p>
 <p>He was standing with his hands behind his back on the summit of the ancient tower like a monarch that had conquered the world. His eyes were filled with vigor, as if they had seen a myriad of things, an endless amount of rises and falls. The experience of this man surpassed that of the Crazed Killer Tuoba by several times.</p>
 <p>As for him, he was the current headmaster of the Cyanwood Mountain, Dugu Xingfeng.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Dugu Xingfeng was using his pair of sharp eyes to look toward a distant place. As for the direction of his gaze, it was precisely the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.</p>
 <p>“Lord Headmaster, why have you been looking in that direction this entire time? Could it be that something has happened?” After being silent for a long time, Crazed Killer Tuoba asked. That was because his Lord Headmaster had been looking in that direction for an entire day now.</p>
 <p>However, due to his limited strength, at this sort of distance, even he was incapable of knowing what exactly was happening in the direction that his Lord Headmaster was looking at.</p>
 <p>“Isn’t your news here already? Why don’t you check it out?” Dugu Xingfeng said with a light laugh.</p>
 <p>“Woosh.” Once he finished saying those words, a flying bird directly flew over, stopped before Crazed Killer Tuoba and then started to hover around him.</p>
 <p>This was a crystal bird, something that world spiritists condensed with their power. With a thought from Crazed Killer Tuoba, the crystal bird turned into a body of light before entering directly into his mind.</p>
 <p>It turned out that Crazed Killer Tuoba knew that Dugu Xingfeng was looking at the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. In order to know what exactly was happening there, he had used a special method to condense a spirit formation that utilized the crystal bird to order his Punishment Department’s subordinates to scout out what was happening over there.</p>
 <p>Now, with the return of his crystal bird, he also obtained news of the situation. After learning what had happened, Crazed Killer Tuoba’s eyes shone.</p>
 <p>He did not react this way because he found out that Chu Feng was planning to trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle. Instead, he reacted this way due to the premise of Chu Feng’s triggering of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle, a gamble of his own and several other elder’s lives. To the Crazed Killer Tuoba, this was a major offense, conduct that he was not fond of.</p>
 <p>However, because he was in the presence of his Lord Headmaster, Crazed Killer Tuoba did not dare to say much about this matter. Instead, with a humble expression, he said, “Since ancient times, countless geniuses have challenged the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle only to return in failure. This Chu Feng is actually challenging the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle at a time when the energy within the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond is the most ferocious. Instead of calling it courage, it should be said to be arrogance.”</p>
 <p>“Crazed Killer, it seems that you do not believe that this Chu Feng will be able to succeed?” asked Dugu Xingfeng. However, as he said those words, his gaze was still focused in the direction of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.</p>
 <p>“So many seniors of mine have failed. Even Lord Headmaster yourself failed back then. I do not think that this Chu Feng will succeed.” Crazed Killer Tuoba shook his head. He firmly believed that Chu Feng would fail.</p>
 <p>“Crazed Killer, it would seem that you are mistaken this time around.” A rare joyous smile emerged on Dugu Xingfeng’s face.</p>
 <p>“That is?” Originally, Crazed Killer Tuoba was confused by Dugu Xingfeng’s words. However, his expression suddenly changed.</p>
 <p>He was shocked to discover that a golden light had emerged from the direction of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. Upon close inspection, he discovered that golden lightning serpents had covered the sky.</p>
 <p>“Rumble, rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>With the appearance of the lightning came the noise of thunder. Not only did the golden lightning serpents cover the entire sky, they also brought forth continuous thunder that made heaven and earth tremble, alarming the entire Cyanwood Mountain.</p>
 <p>“Heavens, could this be the lightning released by the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle? That boy by the name of Chu Feng managed to successfully trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle?” At this moment, Crazed Killer Tuoba was stupefied. While he had lived for a very long time, it was also the first time that he had seen such a magnificent scene.</p>
 <p>In fact, it was not only they who saw this scene, as all corners of the Cyanwood Mountain, and the experts in those regions, also beheld this scene. Deep into the night, countless figures soared into the sky and began to fly toward the direction of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. They wished to know what exactly had happened.</p>
 <p>The lightning was very dazzling. As for the origin of the lightning, it was so dazzling that it was blinding. The sky above the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond had been completely dyed in gold.</p>
 <p>Golden-colored lightning filled the sky. It was changing unceasingly, truly splendid and magnificent. At the same time, it was also extremely awe-inspiring.</p>
 <p>“Success, Chu Feng has succeeded! He really triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle!” After being silent for a very long time, someone finally shouted in surprise with a tone of disbelief.</p>
 <p>Once this voice was heard, all of the people present managed to react. In an instant, cheers resounded throughout heaven and earth, spreading out for several miles.</p>
 <p>The triggering of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle was a moment worthy of the greatest admiration, a moment destined to be recorded in history. As for the people who presently witnessed this scene, they all felt honored from the bottoms of their hearts.</p>
 <p>“How could this be, how could this be, how could this be…”</p>
 <p>However, there were always exceptions. While the majority of the people were overjoyed, the people of the Orion Monastery were flabbergasted. Especially those several elders who, like Huang Hai, had sworn an oath; their current expressions were ashen, like dying embers.</p>
 <p>There were even some among them whose legs had grown weak, and who directly knelt in mid-air. Their current frame of mind was likely something that only they could understand.</p>
 <p>“Elders, I, Chu Feng, have triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle. It is time for you all to honor your oaths, no?”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, a figure shot out from the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond like a dragon.</p>
 <p>It was Chu Feng. He was not wearing is Thunder Armor, nor was he using his Thunder Wings. However, his aura was no longer that of a rank two Martial King. Instead, he was now a rank three Martial King. Chu Feng had actually managed to achieve a breakthrough as he triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle.</p>
