 <p><strong> Chapter 2007 - Compensation</strong></p>
 <p>“You all truly have enormous nerves. Speak honestly, are you all colluding with the Dark Hall?” Lord Lianghua asked coldly.</p>
 <p>Earlier, the Heavenly Law Palace’s Palace Master and the Mortal King Palace’s Palace Master were really trying to kill him. Thus, the fury in Lord Lianghua’s heart was not something that would decrease with merely their fake apologies.</p>
 <p>“Milord, we truly haven’t colluded with the Dark Hall. Although we were momentarily foolish, we truly did not collude with the Dark Hall.”</p>
 <p>“Lord Luokong, Lord Lianghua, please give us another chance,” The Heavenly Law Palace’s Palace Master and the Mortal King Palace’s Palace Master said in unison.</p>
 <p>Even though the two of them were Palace Masters, they were actually cowards who were afraid of dying. Furthermore, they knew that if they were to die, their Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace would be ruined too. Thus, even while at death’s door, they still had to struggle to survive.</p>
 <p>As long as they survived, there would still be hope. In the end, people would only remember your glories, and not your shameful past.</p>
 <p>“We Ancient Era’s Elves are a benevolent race. We will not eradicate you.”</p>
 <p>“However, today, you all were trying to kill little friend Chu Feng and eradicate the Cyanwood Mountain. As such, whether or not you all will be spared should not be determined by we Ancient Era’s Elves. Instead, it should be up for little friend Chu Feng to determine it,” Lord Luokong said.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, I apologize for how I wronged you earlier. Moreover, I truly did not know that you were Lord Qing Xuantian’s successor.”</p>
 <p>“If I knew that you were Lord Qing Xuantian’s successor, I would have taken Lord Qing Xuantian’s contributions to our human race into consideration, and would absolutely not have attacked you.”</p>
 <p>“But, regardless of what I say now, it’s already too late. I am the one in the wrong. Little friend Chu Feng, you can punish or kill me. However, little friend Chu Feng, please spare my Heavenly Law Palace’s elders and disciples. They have only come here on my orders. It is not because they wanted to come and attack you,” The Heavenly Law Palace’s Palace Master said.</p>
 <p>Afterwards, the Mortal King Palace’s Palace Master also said similar words to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>They were very smart. In front of the Ancient Era’s Elves, they acted in an absolutely petty and inferior manner because they were afraid of the Ancient Era’s Elves.</p>
 <p>However, when before Chu Feng, although they were apologizing to Chu Feng, they still acted with the boldness and integrity that Palace Masters should possess.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was very simple. Even though they had been humiliated, they could not allow themselves to be utterly humiliated. Before the Ancient Era’s Elves, they had no choice but to act low and petty. However, Chu Feng remained a member of the younger generation. As such, they could not achieve the same sort of pettiness and lowness when facing Chu Feng. Else, if this matter were to spread, they would have no face to face the people of the world.</p>
 <p>In fact, the words spoken by the Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace’s Palace Masters managed to obtain some sympathy from the crowd. This was especially true because the two of them were seriously injured right now. But, although they were injured, they did not try to tend to their wounds. This caused the crowd to have some sympathy for them.</p>
 <p>After all, the two of them were the strongest experts among the humans. If they were to truly die, it would be a loss for all of humanity.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he knew very well what sort of character the Heavenly Law Palace’s Palace Master and the Mortal King Palace’s Palace Master have. If he had the choice, he would have definitely killed them without the slightest hesitation.</p>
 <p>However, Lord Luokong had spoken to Chu Feng earlier through voice transmission because he didn’t want Chu Feng to act too excessively and kill them. As for Chu Feng, he had to give Lord Luokong and the Ancient Era’s Elves face.</p>
 <p>“Even if there are ten thousand reasons why you all have attacked our Cyanwood Mountain, the people from our Cyanwood Mountain that died in battle were all innocent,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, your intention is?” The two men looked to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“While you can be spared death, you must be punished for your crimes. As such, your Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace must compensate our Cyanwood Mountain,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“That’s no issue. We will definitely compensate your Cyanwood Mountain for its losses in double,” The Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace’s Palace Masters nodded and accepted Chu Feng’s condition without any hesitation.</p>
 <p>This was the best resolution for them. As their Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace had existed for thousands of years, they possessed robust foundations. If it was only compensation, it would be extremely easy for them to do.</p>
 <p>“I will be the one to determine the compensation,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, both the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace’s Palace Masters started to frown. However, the two of them still accepted without the slightest hesitation, “No problem, tell us what you want.”</p>
 <p>“Firstly, if it hadn’t been for the Underworld Palace, the King Monstrous Dragon Race and the Four Great Imperial Clans’ arrival today, our Cyanwood Mountain might really have ended up being trampled to the ground by your Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace. All the people in our Cyanwood Mountain would have ended up being killed by you all.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, their appearance has not only saved our Cyanwood Mountain, they have also saved the lives of countless innocents.”</p>
 <p>“However, for the sake of helping our Cyanwood Mountain, those powers have paid bitterly.”</p>
 <p>“As such, while you all can refuse to compensate us our Cyanwood Mountain’s losses, you must compensate them for their losses.”</p>
 <p>“As such, I demand that your Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace compensate the Underworld Palace, the King Monstrous Dragon Race and Four Great Imperial Clans in the form of an Imperial Armament and twenty Incomplete Imperial Armaments each,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, the nerves of the crowd from the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace all tightened.</p>
 <p>It was one thing to compensate with Incomplete Imperial Armaments. But, Imperial Armaments were extremely precious. Not even all of the Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace’s management elders possessed an Imperial Armament. From that, it could be seen how sparse their Imperial Armaments were.</p>
 <p>Yet now, Chu Feng demanded that they compensate the Underworld Palace, the King Monstrous Dragon Race and the Four Great Imperial Clans, a total of six powers, with an Imperial Armament each. In other words, Chu Feng wanted the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace to hand over six Imperial Armaments as compensation. This was most definitely an extravagant demand.</p>
 <p>“Very well. Little friend Chu Feng’s demand is reasonable and fair. We are willing to compensate,” Even though the Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace’s Palace Masters were also very unwilling, they still accepted Chu Feng’s demand without the slightest hesitation.</p>
 <p>“Remember, the compensation that I demand is for both the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace. It is not to be made jointly,” Chu Feng added.</p>
 <p>“What?” Hearing those words, both the Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace’s Palace Masters were startled.</p>
 <p>Respectively? Not to be compensated jointly? In other words, both the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace must hand over six Imperial Armaments and a hundred and twenty Incomplete Imperial Armaments. When added together, this was a staggering amount of twelve Imperial Armaments and two hundred and forty Incomplete Imperial Armaments.</p>
 <p>At that moment, it was not only the people from the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace who were stunned. Even the bystanders were stunned. Their eyes were wide open and their tongues tied. Their current expressions were truly marvelous. They had truly never expected Chu Feng to be this ruthless.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because after surveying the entire battlefield and adding the Imperial Armament that their Palace Master held, it seemed the Mortal King Palace only possessed six Imperial Armaments in total.</p>
 <p>As for the Heavenly Law Palace, they were a bit better. Adding the Imperial Armament that their Heavenly Law Palace’s Palace Master held, they totaled seven.</p>
 <p>However, if they were to hand over six Imperial Armaments each, the Heavenly Law Palace would only have a single Imperial Armament left, and the Mortal King Palace would not have a single Imperial Armament.</p>
 <p>How could this possibly be considered to be an extravagant demand anymore? Chu Feng was simply planning to bite the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace to their deaths.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, you’ll be forcing us to our deaths here. In that case, it is better that you kill us,” The Mortal King Palace’s Palace Master smiled wryly.</p>
 <p>“You’re the one who said that. If you’re unwilling to hand over the Imperial Armaments and Incomplete Imperial Armaments, I will extinguish your Mortal King Palace,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Very well. I am the one who made this decision today. You can kill me. However, please spare my Mortal King Palace’s elders and disciples, for they are innocent,” The Mortal King Palace’s Palace Master suddenly spoke with a loud voice.</p>
 <p>Was he truly not afraid of death? No, not at all. He was merely trying to use the will of the people to force Chu Feng to be lenient toward them.</p>
