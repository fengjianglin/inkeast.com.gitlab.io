 <p><strong>&nbsp;Chapter 2431 - Exterminating The Kong Heavenly Clan</strong></p>
 <p>Inside the Kong Heavenly Clan. The Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was still inside that palace hall. There were still a lot of Kong Heavenly Clan elders gathered in the palace hall.</p>
 <p>“Lord Clan Chief, could it be that some sort of accident has occurred?” Someone asked worriedly.</p>
 <p>After all, the life and death of Chu Feng concerned their Kong Heavenly Clan’s continued existence. Thus, they were very scared of failure.</p>
 <p>“You all can rest assured. I believe that Elder Kong Shunlian will definitely not betray our Kong Heavenly Clan.”</p>
 <p>“Even if he really cannot steel his heart to kill Chu Feng, Kong Moyu, Kong Yuehua and the others will definitely not show any mercy. Chu Feng is but a member of the younger generation, he is but someone with a cultivation of Half Martial Ancestor. With our Kong Heavenly Clan’s five Supreme Elders after him, he will definitely die,” The Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was confident that Chu Feng would be killed.</p>
 <p>After all, for one insignificant member of the younger generation, they had dispatched all five of their Kong Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elders to deal with him.</p>
 <p>One should know that they were five True Immortal-level experts!!!</p>
 <p>However, it could also be determined from those words that it was actually the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief who had ordered Kong Moyu and the others to secretly follow Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>This Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was truly an astute and circumspect individual. Even though he kept saying that he trusted Kong Shunlian, he actually did not trust Kong Shunlian at all. If he did, why would he dispatch four other Supreme Elders to tail him?</p>
 <p>“What Lord Clan Chief says is correct,” After hearing what their Lord Clan Chief said, the Kong Heavenly Clan’s elders present all revealed relaxed smiles.</p>
 <p>“Rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right at that moment, ear-piercing rumbles sounded from outside the palace hall.</p>
 <p>“Rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>“Rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>………...</p>
 <p>The rumbles echoed nonstop. Even the palace hall itself started to tremble violently.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on?”</p>
 <p>Sensing that the situation was amiss, the Kong Heavenly Clan’s elders, led by their Clan Chief, all flew out of the palace hall to inspect the situation outside.</p>
 <p>When they arrived outside of the palace hall, they all revealed stunned expressions.</p>
 <p>The Kong Heavenly Clan, that vast and boundless colossus, already had countless palaces destroyed, and countless clansmen killed.</p>
 <p>The sounds of the collapse of the palaces, the sounds of the flattening of mountains and the screams of their dying clansmen filled the entire Kong Heavenly Clan.</p>
 <p>It was a truly appalling scene of devastation!!!</p>
 <p>As for all this, it was caused by a person standing in the sky.</p>
 <p>That person was holding a crimson sword in his hand. With each wave of the sword, a crimson slash shot forth.</p>
 <p>When the crimson slashes descended from the sky, no one was able to stop them. With each slash, a path of utter destruction was left behind.</p>
 <p>Countless buildings and palaces were destroyed with each slash. Countless Kong Heavenly Clan clansmen were killed with each slash.</p>
 <p>“Who dares come attack our Kong Heavenly Clan?! You’re courting death!!!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that scene, the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief raised his hand and shot forth a punch. His rank two True Immortal-level martial power carried with it a might of absolute destruction as it was shot forth toward the figure in the sky.</p>
 <p>His punch was extremely powerful; it was absolutely destructive.</p>
 <p>As that individual standing in the sky was already attacking the Kong Heavenly Clan, the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief did not care about who that person might be, and sent forth a fatal attack from the get-go. He planned to directly kill his opponent.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>However, facing the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, this rank two True Immortal’s attack, the individual standing in the sky only waved the red sword in his hand and easily neutralized the incoming attack.</p>
 <p>“How could this be?” Seeing his own attack neutralized, the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief immediately had a change in expression.</p>
 <p>“That guy?!” When even the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was shocked, the elders had even greater astonishment on their faces.</p>
 <p>One should know that the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was a rank two True Immortal. Not only was he the strongest existence in the Kong Heavenly Clan, he was also one of the strongest existences in the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p>
 <p>Exactly who was it that was able to easily block the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s attack?</p>
 <p>“You’ve finally decided to show yourself?”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, the person standing in the sky turned his gaze to the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. There was a slight bit of mockery in his voice.</p>
 <p>As the person standing in the sky stopped his attacks, the energy ripples started to gradually vanish. As such, the people of the Kong Heavenly Clan were able to clearly see the appearance of the man in the sky.</p>
 <p>“It’s him?!!!!”</p>
 <p>However, upon seeing the appearance of the man in the sky, the expressions of the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and the others of the Kong Heavenly Clan all changed enormously.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because they had seen that the person in the sky was Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>They had thought about many possibilities for who that individual in the sky might be...</p>
 <p>They had felt that it might be an expert of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p>
 <p>They had felt that it might be someone from the Infant Soul Sect who came to attack their Kong Heavenly Clan.</p>
 <p>They had even felt that it might be an expert from an Upper Realm.</p>
 <p>Yet, they never thought that the person that was bringing about such destruction and devastation to their Kong Heavenly Clan, the person that was able to easily block their Lord Clan Chief’s attack, was actually Chu Feng, that person of the younger generation, Chu Feng!!!</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng was standing in the sky and holding a crimson sword in his right hand.</p>
 <p>That sword was truly dazzling and extremely domineering. Together with the frightening crimson sea of clouds in the sky, they were reflecting one another.</p>
 <p>Even though the people of the Kong Heavenly Clan were very shocked, they had to admit that the current Chu Feng brought forth an enormous sense of oppression and unease within them.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng is actually alive? Could it be that Lord Supreme Elders failed?”</p>
 <p>There were people among the Kong Heavenly Clansmen that started to worry about the safety of their five Supreme Elders. After all, those five were the strongest battle power of their Kong Heavenly Clan apart from their Lord Clan Chief.</p>
 <p>“Heavens! In his hand are…!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, many Kong Heavenly Clansmen let out a cry of surprise. They just discovered that Chu Feng was carrying three heads in his left hand.</p>
 <p>After seeing those three heads, countless Kong Heavenly Clansmen started to cry bitterly. There were even people who were so frightened that they sat powerlessly on the ground. Some even lost consciousness on the spot.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because they managed to clearly discern those three heads. Those three heads belonged to their Kong Heavenly Clan’s three Supreme Elders.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you killed our Kong Heavenly Clan’s three elders?!” The Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked furiously.</p>
 <p>Not only was his voice filled with anger, it was also filled with overwhelming killing intent. His voice echoed for a very long time.</p>
 <p>Although it was merely a single sentence, it was sufficient to show how furious the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was.</p>
 <p>“You ordered them to kill me, why can’t I kill them?”</p>
 <p>“Truth be told, not only will I kill them today, I will also kill everyone in your Kong Heavenly Clan. This is the consequence of making an enemy of me,” Chu Feng said in an emphatic manner. He had a smile on his face the entire time. It was a very frightening smile.</p>
 <p>“In that case, you really did kill them?!” The Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s expression turned increasingly furious. Even his body started to tremble.</p>
 <p>He was not trembling out of fear. Rather, it was out of anger. His anger had already reached its limit. He was on the verge of losing control.</p>
 <p>Originally, he did not believe that Chu Feng had been the one to kill the three Supreme Elders. After all, they were only three heads. Those were not sufficient to prove that the three Supreme Elders were already dead.</p>
 <p>Yet, Chu Feng made the declaration that he had killed the three Supreme Elders. As such, the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had no choice but to believe they had really been killed.</p>
 <p>After all, Chu Feng was able to easily block his attack earlier. This signified that Chu Feng… possessed the strength to kill the three Supreme Elders.</p>
 <p>“I’ve said it already. Today, I will exterminate everyone in your Kong Heavenly Clan.”</p>
 <p>“And you… you will only be able to look on helplessly.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, I will also tell you this. This was all brought on by you yourself,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“What arrogant boasting!!!”</p>
 <p>“I will dismember you into ten thousand pieces!!!” The Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief shouted furiously. Then, he soared into the sky.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was holding a curved blade in each hand. His curved blades were each one and half meters long. They were both blue, and seemed to have been made from gemstones.</p>
 <p>They were two Ancestral Armaments. Furthermore, their quality was superb.</p>
 <p>After those two Ancestral Armaments appeared, the aura of the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief grew even more powerful!!!</p>
 <p>He looked down upon all others, and considered everything to be beneath him. It was as if he was the ruler of this region.</p>
