 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1704 - Meticulous Planning</strong></p>
 <p>“That’s right, I know all that you have experienced in your journey. Not only did you not use your status as a disciple of the Cyanwood Mountain to create troubles, you instead concealed your identity. I believe you likely did so in order to prevent causing troubles for our Cyanwood Mountain.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, you are very low-profile to begin with, and do not go out of your way to provoke others. Even when you reveal your strength, you only do so when there is no other option.”</p>
 <p>“However, regardless of all that, the Nangong Imperial Clan and the Beitang Imperial Clan viewed you as a thorn. They were jealous of your talent, and decided to eliminate you without justification.”</p>
 <p>“While others might be willing to tolerate this sort of thing, we will absolutely not tolerate this sort of thing. If we are to tolerate it, it will only make them more arrogant. We must properly fix them up,” Baili Xuankong said.</p>
 <p>“Ancestor, your intention is?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“I think that the Nangong Imperial Clan head already knows that you were pushed into the Extremely Poisonous Sea of Clouds by the Snow-haired Immortal. Otherwise, they would not have been removing your wanted posters without restraint and declaring that you died in the recent days. Furthermore, they have even deliberately announced their thanks to the Snow-haired Immortal for helping the Holy Land of Martialism get rid of evil.”</p>
 <p>“Even though they did not say it out loud, their intention was very clear. They are dragging the Snow-haired Immortal downstream and declaring to the public that it was the Snow-haired Immortal who killed you. Likely, they did so in fear that we would retaliate against them, so that we will go and vent our anger on the Snow-haired Immortal.”</p>
 <p>“However, they have truly underestimated us to think that this would work. Since the Nangong Imperial Clan thinks that you have died, we’ll allow them to know that you’re still alive,” Baili Xuankong said.</p>
 <p>“Never would I have expected the Nangong Imperial clan’s sources of information to be this fast and abundant. Furthermore, they are this cunning. Ancestor, what should we do?”</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng left the Poison Demon’s Valley, he directly rushed over to this place. Thus, he did not know much about what had happened outside. As such, he was very surprised after hearing what Baili Xuankong said.</p>
 <p>Logically, it should be a good thing that the Nangong Imperial Clan had thought that he had died. However, with the way Baili Xuankong was acting, it was evident that he was not planning to leave the matter at that. Instead, he had something else in mind.</p>
 <p>Let alone, Chu Feng himself was also not someone who would be willing to be taken advantage of without doing anything. Thus, he wanted to know very much what his Lord Ancestor planned to do.</p>
 <p>“What should we do? Naturally, we must strike them in the head and let them know how powerful you are.”</p>
 <p>“Right now, there is a great opportunity for that,” As Baili Xuankong said those words, he subconsciously revealed an expression of anticipation.</p>
 <p>“A great opportunity?” Chu Feng’s heart moved upon hearing those words. Even his blood started to faintly boil over. He knew that Baili Xuankong had not said those words so simply. It seemed that there was an opportunity for him to reveal his strength.</p>
 <p>“Do you know why the Beitang Imperial Clan would appear here? Do you know why Dugu Xingfeng and Yin Chengkong would join up with me here?”</p>
 <p>“The reason for all this is because the Four Great Imperial Clans are holding an assembly for the younger generation to swap pointers with one another. This sparring assembly is something concerning the Four Great Imperial Clans. However, in order to put up a front of being ‘fair,’ they have deliberately invited the younger generations from the Nine Powers to participate as well.”</p>
 <p>“Actually, the true intention in why they invited the younger generation from the Nine Powers to participate is so that they can set themselves against the Nine Powers’ younger generation, to show how strong their Four Great Imperial Clan’s younger generation are. Their intentions could be said to be extremely despicable.”</p>
 <p>“However, because of face, it is unsuitable for the Nine Powers to refuse their invitation. Thus, they can only all hurry over to this place.”</p>
 <p>“As for the location of the Four Great Imperial Clan’s younger generation’s spar, it is Mooncloud City.”</p>
 <p>“They have already sent the invitations to the Nine Powers. Furthermore, all the people from the Four Great Imperial Clans who are supposed to come have already come. Therefore, this sparing of the Four Great Imperial Clan’s younger generation will begin tomorrow,” Baili Xuankong said.</p>
 <p>“There’s actually such a thing? This will truly be great. Ancestor, could it be that you want me to sneak into the sparring assembly and then attack the Four Great Imperial Clan’s younger generation?”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was pleasantly shocked to hear those words. His blood that was boiling over started to boil even more intensely.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Other than the younger generation from the Four Great Imperial Clans, the Nine Powers’ young generations also possess a spot, an opportunity to participate in this Mooncloud City’s sparring.”</p>
 <p>“This spot must be fought for. Not only are the younger generations from the Nine Powers allowed to fight for that spot, as long as they’re someone from the Holy Land of Martialism, all members of the younger generation are allowed to participate.”</p>
 <p>“This just so happens to provide an opportunity for you. You can disguise yourself and then participate in the competition under an alias. Then, after obtaining the spot, you can challenge the Four Clan’s younger generations, mainly, the Nangong Imperial Clan’s younger generation and the Beitang Imperial Clan’s younger generation.”</p>
 <p>“After you completely defeat all of the younger generation from the Nangong Imperial Clan and the Beitang Imperial Clan, you will then reveal your true appearance.”</p>
 <p>“At that time, you will let everyone know exactly who you are, that you, Chu Feng, did not die, and that all of the younger generation from the Nangong Imperial Clan and the Beitang Imperial Clan are inferior to you.”</p>
 <p>“After you reveal your true appearance, I will think of a way to bring you away,” Baili Xuankong told his plan to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“This is truly an opportunity bestowed to me by the heavens. By pure coincidence, I actually arrived at Mooncloud City,” After hearing about Baili Xuankong’s meticulous planning, Chu Feng revealed a smile of anticipation.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Baili Xuankong asked, “Chu Feng, even though the people from the Four Clans are stationed in the Mooncloud City, they believe that no one will dare to cause trouble. Thus, their guard is rather low. However, the Four Great Imperial Clans have invited a lot of experts to watch. It is said that at least three of the Ten Immortals have shown up.”</p>
 <p>“As we are going to create troubles openly, I cannot guarantee that I will be able to bring you away from the Mooncloud City. It could be said that this will still be a very dangerous task.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, I still wish to seek your opinion. Are you really willing to take the risk and enter Mooncloud City just to humiliate the Nangong Imperial Clan and the Beitang Imperial Clan?”</p>
 <p>“When riches and honor are sought among dangers, bearing dangers for retaliation will be without question.”</p>
 <p>“Lord Ancestor, you clearly know that it is dangerous, yet you are still willing to bear the dangers to help me. If I, Chu Feng, am to cower now, I will be a man in vain. Even if they bully and insult me, I would deserve it,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Good, you have spirit. As expected from someone that I thought highly of,” Baili Xuankong nodded in a very appreciative manner. He understood Chu Feng’s intentions. Chu Feng was determined to go to Mooncloud City.</p>
 <p>“However, Chu Feng, this matter is very important. We cannot let anyone know of this. I know that you possess some friendship with the Luo Family. However, to speak the truth, I cannot trust them,” As Baili Xuankong spoke, he looked to the people of the Luo Family.</p>
 <p>“Milord, please spare us, please spare us! We will definitely keep our mouths shut and lips tight. We will not mention what has happened here today to anyone,” Seeing this, the people of the Luo Family immediately kneeled onto the ground and started begging for forgiveness while kowtowing. They all thought that Baili Xuankong was planning to silence them by killing them.</p>
 <p>“Rest assured, I will not kill you all. However, I am going to remove your memories of us,” Baili Xuankong said.</p>
 <p>“We are willing to do that. As long as you do not kill us, we are willing to do anything,” The people of the Luo Family agreed in unison. As long as they were allowed to live, they were willing to do anything. Compared to one’s life, what could a bit of memory possibly be worth?</p>
 <p>“Lord Ancestor, the two of them are my friends. I trust them. Is it possible for you to not remove their memories?”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng looked to Du Wanwu and Goudan’er who stood not far from them. He felt that having one’s memory forcibly removed was a kind of humiliation. Thus, he did not wish for this sort of humiliation to be done to his friends.</p>
