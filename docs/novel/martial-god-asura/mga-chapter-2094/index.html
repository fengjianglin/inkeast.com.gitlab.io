 <p><strong> Chapter 2094 - Enormous Change In Expression</strong></p>
 <p>The reason for that was because a grand formation sparkling with light had appeared before Chu Feng’s eyes.</p>
 <p>That spirit formation was enormous. Like a sun placed on the seabed, it brightly illuminated the deep sea.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, there were five giant monsters contained within that grand spirit formation.</p>
 <p>Among them, four were several hundred meters tall. They were, respectively, the physical bodies of the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird and Black Tortoise.</p>
 <p>However, there was another huge monster contained in the center of the four Divine Beasts. That huge monster was actually several thousands of meters tall, many times larger than even the physical bodies of the Four Great Divine Beasts.</p>
 <p>Even if the four Divine Beasts combined, they would only amount to half the size of that giant monster. That monster possessed a humanoid appearance. Its entire body was blazing red in color. It possessed a very fierce appearance like that of a demon. It was truly frightening.</p>
 <p>It was different from how monstrous beasts appeared to be frightening. Instead, it caused one to feel fear from the bottoms of their hearts.</p>
 <p>“That is the body of the Magma Emperor.”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, the Four Great Divine Beasts flew out from Chu Feng’s body and stood to either side of Chu Feng. They were staring at the scene below.</p>
 <p>“Is that the Magma Emperor? It’s actually that enormous,” Chu Feng had actually managed to guess that that huge monster was the Magma Emperor the moment he saw it. However, he was still astonished by it.</p>
 <p>Even though it was only the corpse of the Magma Emperor, Chu Feng was able to imagine how frightening the Magma Emperor was when it had wreaked havoc in the Holy Land of Martialism. It was most definitely a true disaster.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be afraid. After this much time has passed, it is most definitely dead now. Right now, it is nothing more than a corpse. It poses absolutely no threat,” The Azure Dragon said.</p>
 <p>“Then, if I am to undo the spirit formation, will you all be able to fuse with your physical bodies and regain your cultivations?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“That is the case,” The Four Great Divine Beasts nodded.</p>
 <p>“Since that’s the case, let’s begin,” After verifying it, Chu Feng started to undo the spirit formation. He was more impatient than anyone else to have the Four Great Divine Beasts regain their bodies.</p>
 <p>After all, they were Divine Beasts, beings above monstrous beasts. They were existences not present in the current Holy Land of Martialism.</p>
 <p>The spirit formation here was very exceptional. Even though ten thousand years had passed, it remained very difficult for Chu Feng to unseal it even with his current level of world spirit techniques.</p>
 <p>As such, it took Chu Feng three entire days to set up the unsealing formation. After that spirit formation was activated, it took him two entire days to disable the grand sealing formation.</p>
 <p>Logically, the spirit formation should have weakened by a lot after ten thousand years had passed. However, even with that being the case, Chu Feng still needed such an enormous amount of effort to undo it. From that, it could be seen how exceptionally powerful that sealing spirit formation was.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Feng clasped his hands together and shouted, “Condense blade!!!”</p>
 <p>Dazzling light emitted from his clasped hands. When Chu Feng extended his fingers, the dazzling light began to overflow from Chu Feng’s two fingers. The light formed into a two thousand meter-long blade of light. [1. If I’m not mistaken, he clasped his hands together, formed light, held two fingers out from one hand and then the light went out top of his fingers forming an enormous blade of light…]</p>
 <p>Chu Feng waved the blade of light and sliced it at the grand sealing formation down below.</p>
 <p>“Rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>In an instant, rumbling sprung up everywhere. Violent wind erupted. The seawater started flaring up.</p>
 <p>“Scatter!”</p>
 <p>Under that sort of frightening situation, Chu Feng’s sleeve waved lightly. Then, all of the abnormal signs happening in his surroundings disappeared. He had returned this place to its former tranquility.</p>
 <p>When the flaring seawater returned to normal, Chu Feng’s line of sight was no longer blocked. At that moment, the Four Great Divine Beasts were so excited that their souls were trembling. To be separated from their physical bodies for so many years and having to survive as Secret Skills, that sort of depression and misery was something that only they understood.</p>
 <p>And now, they were finally able to regain their physical bodies and live in their original forms again. Naturally, they would be filled with endless excitement and joy.</p>
 <p>“Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, four rays of light flew past. The Four Great Divine Beasts flew toward their respective bodies.</p>
 <p>Due to the fact that the speed of the Four Great Divine Beasts was extremely fast, they raised violent waves in the seawater.</p>
 <p>After the Four Great Divine Beasts entered their respective bodies, everything grew silent. When the violent waves in the seawater faded away, there was no sound in that region of water at all. It was frighteningly quiet.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng was staring at the Four Great Divine Beasts’ bodies the entire time. Furthermore, he was emitting an aura, the aura of nervousness, from all over him.</p>
 <p>He was using his Heaven’s Eyes to look. Thus, he was able to tell that the Four Great Divine Beasts were fusing with their bodies. However, it remained that they had been separated from their bodies for ten thousand years, and that they were no longer ordinary souls but instead survived as souls to Secret Skills. Thus, the fusion process was not that simple.</p>
 <p>That was why Chu Feng was worried; he was worried that the Four Great Divine Beasts would fail.</p>
 <p>“Seems like it’s a success.”</p>
 <p>Finally, the nervousness that Chu Feng was emitting fade away. In its place was an unconcealable joy.</p>
 <p>“Roar~~~”</p>
 <p>The very next moment, an ear-piercing roar was heard and the seawater started to rapidly boil.</p>
 <p>It was the White Tiger. The White Tiger was the first to resurrect. After it resurrected, it flew toward Chu Feng. Pushing Chu Feng with its head, it rushed out from the seawater instantly.</p>
 <p>“Haha, I’ve revived, I have finally been revived!”</p>
 <p>After the White Tiger rushed out from the waters, it began to gallop in the air and roar nonstop. It was celebrating its rebirth.</p>
 <p>“Half Martial Ancestor. That is an actual Half Martial Ancestor.”</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, the smile on his face grew even wider. Standing on top of the White Tiger, he was able to clearly sense how powerful a Half Martial Ancestor was.</p>
 <p>In fact, he was even able to sense the legendary Ancestor-level martial power appearing in thin air and following the White Tiger’s galloping with an inconceivable speed. It was as if it was ready to be used by the White Tiger at any moment.</p>
 <p>This sort of sensation was simply wondrous. After all… it was a power above that of Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>Even though Chu Feng’s battle power would also reach that level after using his various abilities, it remained that it was only his battle power, and not his actual cultivation. There was still… a difference between them.</p>
 <p>“Pulalala~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, another wave of water soared into the sky and pierced through the clouds.</p>
 <p>“Roar~~~”</p>
 <p>Soon, another roar could be heard. That roar was actually even more ear-piercing than the White Tiger’s roar.</p>
 <p>When the waves of water faded away, Chu Feng was able to see that an enormous cyan dragon was flying toward him. It was the Azure Dragon.</p>
 <p>Immediately following the Azure Dragon, the Vermilion Bird and the Black Tortoise also flew out of the water.</p>
 <p>Merely, when compared to the White Tiger and the Azure Dragon, their emergence was a lot more low-key; they did not let out intimidating roars.</p>
 <p>However, even though they had emerged from the waters in a low-key manner, their excitement and joy were still uncontainable. After all, to be able to successfully fuse with their physical bodies was something extremely significant for them.</p>
 <p>Rebirth. To them, it was simply a rebirth, a rebirth after ten thousand years.</p>
 <p>The Four Great Divine Beasts, led by the Azure Dragon, suddenly said to Chu Feng in an extremely grateful manner, “Chu Feng, thank you, thank you for giving us this opportunity to be reborn.”</p>
 <p>“Heavens, the four of you are my seniors. Yet, you’re expressing your thanks to me, a junior. Wouldn’t this simply be akin to cursing my lifespan?” Chu Feng complained with a smile on his face.</p>
 <p>“Haha. Boy, you don’t have to pretend. You’re feeling extremely pleased that we are expressing our thanks to you, right?” The White Tiger said with a beaming smile.</p>
 <p>Although its body was enormous, and it possessed an extremely ferocious appearance, its current appearance was truly quite adorable. It was like a giant white cat.</p>
 <p>“Speaking of it, I am feeling extremely pleased. Seniors, how about you thank me some more?” Chu Feng started to joke around.</p>
 <p>“Haha, you wish. I have only ever thanked others once in my lifetime. There’s no twice to it,” The White Tiger laughed heartily. Even though the White Tiger was fond of laughter to begin with, Chu Feng had never seen it laughing this heartily. It could be seen that it was truly happy.</p>
 <p>In fact, it was not only the White Tiger that was feeling very joyous. The Vermilion Bird and the Azure Dragon were also very happy. Furthermore, even the Black Tortoise, the individual who was always calm and unflustered, had an unconcealable smile on its face.</p>
 <p>“Crap!” However, right at that moment when everyone was smiling and laughing happily, Chu Feng started to frown. His expression changed enormously. Then, he turned his alert gaze toward the sea.</p>
