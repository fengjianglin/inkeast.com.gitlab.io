 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 447 - Forward to the Sword God Valley</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s the ancestor?” As the crowd heartily surrounded them and after chatting for a while, only then did Chu Feng notice that the Azure Dragon Founder was not there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh. He’s strengthening the power of the Sealing Spirit Formation. Recently, the situation of Su Rou and Su Mei is getting more and more unstable.” As that matter was mentioned, a touch of worry and helplessness appeared onto Zhuge Liuyun’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After knowing that, Chu Feng’s face instantly changed and he hurriedly brought Zi Ling towards the formation that sealed Su Rou and Su Mei. Seeing that, the others also hurriedly followed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After arriving in front of the formation, Chu Feng discovered that the Azure Dragon Founder was indeed guarding at that place. He was currently channeling power at the formation, but perhaps because he was a consciousness, no matter how much stronger he was when he was alive, currently, his power didn’t really follow command of his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, let me help you.” Seeing that, Zi Ling who was also a Blue-cloak World Spiritist went up without even thinking and used practiced Spirit Formation methods to help the Azure Dragon Founder strengthen the power of the formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm?” After seeing Zi Ling, a hint of astonishment also passed through the Azure Dragon Founder’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was because Zi Ling was very young, yet she already became a Blue-cloak World Spiritist at that age. It was simply something that hadn’t appeared before in the Azure Dragon Founder’s era.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Besides, Zi Ling’s cultivation was very overwhelming as well. She entered the 1st level of the Heaven realm at that age. It was something that similarly never happened before in his era.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, that was why the Azure Dragon Founder was astonished because he felt like he saw an extremely outstanding genius. That genius would surpass his generation, and far surpass him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ancestor, she is called Zi Ling. She is my fiancée.” Just at that time, Chu Feng walked up. From his Cosmos Sack, he took out a large amount of Spirit Formation Rocks. Those things could make the Spirit Formation even stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? Such an excellent girl is actually your fiancée? Boy, your luck is truly not shallow! Haha, much better than mine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only after seeing Chu Feng did the Azure Dragon Founder know who Zi Ling was. He first satisfiedly nodded his head, then quickly after, looked at Chu Feng. Immediately, a hint of amazement flashed into his eyes as he said with shock,</span></p>
 <p><span style>“With the time of one year, you stepped into the 6th level of the Profound realm? Your speed of breaking through simply exceeds my predictions!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, luck.” Chu Feng smilingly scratched his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boy, you’re just being modest right? But I like it very much. This means that I wasn’t mistaken.” The Azure Dragon Founder satisfiedly smiled and after meaningfully looking at Chu Feng and Zi Ling who was next to him, a touch of yearning had actually emerged into his eyes, as if the day to his own revival was already not far.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, the Azure Dragon Founder did not say anymore useless words. Like Zi Ling, he concentrated on strengthening the formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that time, Chu Feng who was a Grey-cloak World Spiritist could really not help much. He could only look through the gaps of the chains formations inwards at Su Rou and Su Mei who were greatly suffering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, Su Rou and Su Mei’s situation got even worse than a year ago. One had skin that was like ice with layers of frost covering it, whereas the other had fiery red skin that gave off bursts of heat. Their faces and figures could no longer be seen, and they simply didn’t look like a human anymore. More or less, it was a bit scary</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the current Su Rou and Su Mei, then recalling and connecting them with their former beautiful appearances, Chu Feng’s heart felt pain as if it was being stirred around with a knife. If it wasn’t to save himself, there was no need for the two of them to be feeling the pain right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, the formation strengthening was finished. The people from the Azure Dragon School, Chu Feng’s family, as well as Su Rou and Su Mei’s father and elder brother got closer to one another. They could truly be said to be happily gathered together and ecstatic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Zhang Tianyi saw the Azure Dragon Founder, he was extremely excited and ceaselessly expressed emotions of admiration at the Azure Dragon Founder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And the Azure Dragon Founder also liked Zhang Tianyi a lot. He gave him a very high rating. It was that Zhang Tianyi’s future achievements would definitely far surpass him in his own peak moments.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, at the same time, he also gave ratings to Chu Feng and Zi Ling. Similarly, they were very high. In short, the continent would undoubtedly be unable to contain Chu Feng, Zi Ling, and Zhang Tianyi. The three of them would step onto the even vaster stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After hearing the Azure Dragon Founder’s appraisals, almost everyone on scene widened their mouths from amazement because his appraisals were really high.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, Zhang Tianyi and the Azure Dragon Founder chatted alone for a while, then afterwards, got together with the crowd and started to talk about the stories that happened to the Azure Province recently. He first talked about his own heroic deeds, then talked about what Chu Feng did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For every single thing, the crowd kept on shouting out in surprise, and from excitement, their hairs uncontrollably stood up straight. Many people even strongly gulped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>More and more, they felt that Chu Feng and Zhang Tianyi were too strong. They simply surpassed their imaginations and did things that they didn’t even dare to dream of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But as the crowd learnt about those things, the ones most proud and excited were none other than Chu Guyu, Chu Yue, Chu Cheng, Chu Zhen, and the other Chu family members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking back at first, how many of them looked down on Chu Feng and felt that he was too trash-like, that he lost their Chu family’s face, and also lost their faces?</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now, they were proud because of Chu Feng. Not only was it because Chu Feng was so strong, even their strengths greatly increased because of Chu Feng. If it was before, they could simply not imagine that they would have their current cultivations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In reality, in one year, everyone had very huge improvements. By cultivating in the Essence Pool for a year, their cultivations had extremely great advancements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It could be said that everyone improved with rapid speeds. Even the dull people before, in terms of martial cultivation, became a lot smarter now. It also meant that with the assistance of the Essence Pool, their martial cultivation talents had actually been raised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But as they were indulged in joy, Chu Feng, from start to finish, was unable to raise his spirits because there was always one thing packed in his heart. Especially after seeing Su Rou and Su Mei’s present appearances, the thing in his heart became incomparably heavy, even to the point of suffocation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, Chu Feng went up to the formation alone again. He guarded that place, and silently looked at Su Rou and Su Mei who were in the formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry. Within one year, I will definitely save you. If I, Chu Feng, cannot save you, I will die with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the beautiful sisters in the Spirit Formation, the eyes of the usually strong-minded Chu Feng was actually a bit moist. He couldn’t help making that decision in his heart. If he could not save Su Rou and Su Mei, he, Chu Feng, would absolutely not force himself to continue living.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can tell they were very beautiful when they were healthy.” Suddenly, a voice as pleasant to listen to as a silver bell rang out behind Chu Feng. Turning his head around to look, Zi Ling already appeared behind Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After seeing Chu Feng, Zi Ling sweetly smiled, then quickly after, cutely sat next to Chu Feng, together with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not only were the beautiful, they treated me very well. They only became how they are right now because of me.” Chu Feng said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it was me, I would do that as well, and if it was you, for us, you would do the same thing.” Zi Ling sweetly smilingly said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing such an understanding Zi Ling, Chu Feng really did not know what to say. So, he didn’t say anything at all. He brought the outstanding little beauty into his embrace. Zi Ling, like a little bird relying on a person, leaned in Chu Feng’s embrace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like that, for a night, Chu Feng and Zi Ling guarded the outside of Su Rou and Su Mei’s sealing formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Tianyi, on the other hand, chatted with laughters for a night with the disciples and elders of the Azure Dragon School as well as with Chu Feng’s family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the second morning, after Chu Feng, Zi Ling, and Zhang Tianyi ate breakfast with his family members in the Thousand Bone Graveyard, they said their farewells to the crowd, sat on the Exquisite Chariot, and hurried towards the Sui Province.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because, the Sui Province was where the Sword God Valley was located in.</span></p>
