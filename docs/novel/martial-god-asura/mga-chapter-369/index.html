 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 369 - Play a Game</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng, it’s you?” After seeing Chu Feng, although those people were already a prisoner, they still expressed their hatred towards Chu Feng. Especially Song Qingfeng, Bai Yunfei, and Liu Xiaoyao. The expressions in their eyes could simply kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this?” And after seeing Chu Feng being brought in, the Black Toad King also asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My king, this human brat just now intruded into our territory so we caught him. Looking at his appearance, he should also be from the Prestigious Villa.” One of the Heaven realm Monstrous Beast explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh?” After hearing those words, the Black Toad King’s blood-red big eyes spun around wildly as it started to assess Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, you misunderstand. I’m not part of the Prestigious Villa. Actually, I just passed by and I truly didn’t have any intentions to offend.” Chu Feng had a light smile on his face, and he who knew that Zi Xuanyuan was possibly hiding in the dark was not afraid of those Monstrous Beasts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how much more stronger the Black Toad King was, from Chu Feng’s estimations, Zi Xuanyuan’s strength would not necessarily lose to the Black Toad King’s, and the two of them should be able to fight fairly equally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And to be truthful, although the number of Monstrous Beasts were a lot, the ones with strength that was actually significant was only the Black Toad King. If the Black Toad King was being held back, Zi Ling and the others could absolutely be able to handle the remaining Monstrous Beasts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng, you’re here to save us right?” But just at that time, Liu Xiaoyao expression changed. His face was touched, his tone had gratitude, and with incomparable passion, he called out Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they faced Liu Xiaoyao’s change, at first, Song Qingfeng and Bai Yunfei didn’t understand, but very quickly, they reacted to his words. With a strange smile, they also said to Chu Feng,</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng, I knew that you would put importance in brotherhood and you wouldn’t abandon us! So how about it? You’ve already notified the elders right? They should be quickly coming to save us right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng, it’s still you who’s the impressive one. On the road, you’re the one who killed the most Monstrous Beasts, and after this event is finished, I’m sure that Villa Head Qin Lei will grant you with a huge reward.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“God damn, your schemes in harming others are too ridiculous aren’t they? Do you think that everyone is as idiotic as you?” Chu Feng coldly snorted and his eyes were full of disdain. He knew that Liu Xiaoyao and the others wanted to borrow a knife to kill. They wanted to make some lies to stir up the anger of the Monstrous Beasts, and borrowing the hands of the Monstrous Beasts, to kill Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm?” However, the Black Toad King was obviously very intelligent and he saw that Chu Feng had some past incidents with Liu Xiaoyao and the others. So, on his ugly face, a hint&nbsp;of strangeness emerged and he said, “So it seems that you know each other!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We know, of course we know. He’s our good brother and I advise you to not touch him, or else his father will certainly stamp over your Thousand Monster Mountain.” Liu Xiaoyao did not leave it as that and he continued to fabricate lies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right. Chu Feng’s father hates Monstrous Beasts the most. Every day, his father eats Monstrous Beasts and the bedding in Chu Feng’s home is made out of the fur of Monstrous Beasts.” Bai Yunfei also added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you dare to be anymore shameless? You don’t need to be so obvious in framing others right? Do you truly think that everyone has the same intelligence as all of you?” Chu Feng refuted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha, interesting, interesting! So it seems that there’s a story between all of you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Cow, what actually happened? Tell me the story.” The Black Toad King first loudly laughed, then afterwards, he waved his hand towards a cow-headed Monstrous Beast nearby.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That Monstrous Beast was different from the others, as it was wearing the clothes of humans. It walked to the side of the Black Toad King and narrated with a face filled with respect,</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So it’s like this, my king. This boy is called Chu Feng, and before all of you made your move, he wanted to go violent on that female over there, but he was discovered by this group of humans. So, the human were furious and wanted to kill Chu Feng, yet they could do nothing as Chu Feng escaped. But I never would have thought that he actually ran back to us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, Chu Feng also finally knew that the cow-headed Monstrous Beast was the spy who snuck within them, or else it would not be possible for it to know these kinds of things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, so it’s like this. There are indeed grudges. Humans are humans, and every single one are ruthless and despicable organisms. You want to use me to kill your enemy? But you’re underestimating me a bit too much aren’t you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After knowing the truth, the Black Toad King looked at Liu Xiaoyao and the others with contempt, then after that, pointed at Chu Feng and ordered,</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Throw the one called Chu Feng over with them. Also, bring the other group of human brats over. Tonight, I want to play an interesting game.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the Black Toad King ordered, Chu Feng was thrown within Liu Zhizun and the others. Although Liu Zhizun and the others wished to kill Chu Feng at that very instant, they were helpless as they were also prisoners so they could only use their gazes to threaten Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But sadly, Chu Feng completely ignored their gazes and because he was comparatively close to Zi Ling, Chu Feng nimbly twisted his body and without caring about face, he neared Zi Ling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zi Ling, I’m here to save you.” Chu Feng went close to Zi Ling’s ear and said in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zi Ling first looked at Chu Feng, then looked at Xia Le’r who was within the group. After that, she fiercely glared at Chu Feng before coldly snorting, turning her little face away, and didn’t pay any more attention to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? You’re jealous?” Seeing that, Chu Feng first chuckled, but when he saw that Zi Ling still didn’t pay attention to him, he explained himself, “You wouldn’t truly believe the words that Xia Le’r said right? With your intelligence and wisdom, can you not see that I was wrongfully accused?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng you brat, stay farther away from Junior Zi Ling or else I’ll kill you!” And seeing that Chu Feng was disturbing Zi Ling with misconduct, Liu Zhizun who was afar burned with anger and loudly yelled at Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come come! Let me see how you are going to kill me!” Seeing that, not only did Chu Feng not leave Zi Ling, he instead endlessly rubbed against Zi Ling’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for Zi Ling, no matter how she evaded, she could not evade away, and it was as if Chu Feng stained herself, so at the end, she could only powerlessly give up and allow Chu Feng to get close to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng, you better not leave this place alive or else I will make you regret it!” At that instant, Liu Zhizun grinded his teeth and smoke came out of his seven facial orifices. Even his eyes rolled back and it seemed that he was not lightly angered by Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up! If you dare to make so much noise again, I’ll cut off your tongue.” Just at that time, the Heaven realm Monstrous Beast didn’t like how Liu Zhizun made such a huge racket. It walked over and stepped onto Liu Zhizun’s body, then stepped his face to the ground and even his forehead cracked and his gums bled. That appearance was called miserable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And as they saw that scene, everyone shut their mouths and didn’t dare to speak to threaten Chu Feng anymore. They could only look at Chu Feng as he endlessly rubbed against Zi Ling’s body and gained some small advantages from her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Short after that, a group of people surged into the big palace from another side. Focusing his gaze to look over, Chu Feng couldn’t help but be shocked because within the group, he saw many familiar figures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within them, there was Gu Bo, Xu Zhongyu, and the others from the World Spirit Guild. There were also the people from the Jie clan such as Jie Qingming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even they were caught, and looking at their appearances, they seemed to have been caught before Chu Feng and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng, even all of you were...” And after seeing Chu Feng and the others, the faces of Gu Bo and the others were filled with shock because that meant that their situation wasn’t looking too good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, Jie Qingming and the others were like Chu Feng and the others. They were pushed into the middle of the palace and they sat in a circle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, the Black Toad King stood up, strode with airs of extravagance and arrived in front of Chu Feng and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very instant, on its ugly toad face, it revealed a standard toad light smile and said, “Everyone, shameless humans, how about we...play an interesting game?”</span></p>
