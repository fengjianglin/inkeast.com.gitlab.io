 <p><strong> Chapter 2076 - Chu Feng’s Fury</strong></p>
 <p>“This is the end of the Immortalization Road?”</p>
 <p>While the name Stairway To Heaven did sound very domineering, after Chu Feng inspected it carefully, he was unable to discover anything special about this Stairway To Heaven.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng felt a bit disappointed. Originally, he had thought that there would be something extraordinary at the end of the Immortalization Road. However, this altar by the name of ‘Stairway To Heaven’ that appeared before him did not satisfy Chu Feng’s anticipation at all.</p>
 <p>“Exactly where have Ya Fei and the others gone to?”</p>
 <p>“Or, could it be that this place is not the end of the Immortalization Road?”</p>
 <p>Although Chu Feng was disappointed after reaching the end of the Immortalization Road, he was also very worried for Ya Fei and the others.</p>
 <p>If Chu Feng was really at the end of the Immortalization Road, then why was he unable to find Ya Fei and the others?</p>
 <p>It should be impossible for them to have disappeared like this.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, a stream of a special sort of energy was suddenly emitted from the center of the altar.</p>
 <p>Sensing that energy, Chu Feng hurriedly moved back. The reason for that was because that energy was extremely powerful, and simply something that Chu Feng had never sensed before.</p>
 <p>“Rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, a golden ray of light shot forth straight from the center of the altar and toward the sky. In an instant, it pierced through layers of clouds and reached deep into the heavens.</p>
 <p>“Heavens!!!”</p>
 <p>At that moment, even Chu Feng was stunned. Deep shock filled his eyes.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because not only was that golden ray of light piercing the skies. Chu Feng felt that it was also penetrating space itself, breaking through the boundaries and entering a new world.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, through using his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng was able to clearly see what was within the golden light. They were crystal stairs.</p>
 <p>That’s right, they were stairs. The stairs extended all the way into the depths of the skies.</p>
 <p>The name Stairway To Heaven was not an undeserved reputation. It was truly a stairway to heaven.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that these stairs lead to the Outer World?”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng felt extremely excited. He could sense that his blood was racing. It was as if his blood had been ignited.</p>
 <p>Where was the place that Chu Feng had always wanted to go? It was the Outer World.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because the Outer World was where his clan was from. Chu Feng always felt that the Outer World was his actual battlefield.</p>
 <p>He must retrieve his father’s honor. He must retrieve his lost dignity. He must let his clan know that their decision to abandon his father and him was their greatest mistake.</p>
 <p>Merely, the Outer World was only a legend even in the Holy Land of Martialism. The people that knew of the Outer World were extremely few. As for a method to enter the Outer World, no one knew about it.</p>
 <p>However, the place which the Stairway To Heaven lead was a place which Chu Feng could not see. Chu Feng felt that it was very possible for this Stairway To Heaven to be a divine artifact that lead to the Outer World.</p>
 <p>After all, this place was known as the Immortalization Road. What was an Immortal? If one were to leave this world and enter a better world, wouldn’t one enter a world of Immortals?</p>
 <p>To ordinary people, wouldn’t the so-called Outer World be a world of Immortals?</p>
 <p>“Ya Fei, Yan Ruyu and Murong Wan, they couldn’t have possible ascended the Stairway To Heaven, right?”</p>
 <p>At that moment, a speculation appeared in Chu Feng’s mind. Ya Fei and the others had disappeared for no reason at all. Furthermore, there was no trace of them on the Immortalization Road. Thus, the only explanation available right now was that the three of them had entered the Outer World through the Stairway To Heaven.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng did not dare to ascertain his speculation. After all, if Ya Fei and the others had truly arrived here, there would be no reason for them to directly step onto the Stairway To Heaven. Instead, they should have returned to inform Qiushui Fuyan and the others about it.</p>
 <p>Even if they were afraid of the vines and felt that they would not be able to return safely, they should have left a letter or some sort of indication before ascending the Stairway To Heaven.</p>
 <p>There was no reason why the three of them would leave like this without leaving any hint behind, for this would only cause everyone to be worried for them.</p>
 <p>“Perhaps the answer to all this can only be discovered at the end of the Stairway To Heaven.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng truly had an urge to ascend the Stairway To Heaven. He wanted to investigate the Stairway To Heaven. It was not only because he wanted to search for Ya Fei and the others. It was also for the sake of entering the Outer World.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng did not do that. Instead, he turned around to leave. The reason for that was because there was still a lot of things that he had to do. Even if he would enter the Outer World, he must first take care of the Dark Hall’s Hall Master.</p>
 <p>As such, Chu Feng could only end his investigation of what has happened to Ya Fei and the others here.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at the moment when Chu Feng moved a certain distance away from the Stairway To Heaven, the light that lead directly to the Outer World completely disappeared.</p>
 <p>“Truly miraculous.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng was certain that the Stairway To Heaven had only been triggered after he had approached it.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, when the Stairway To Heaven was not triggered, it looked just like an ordinary stone altar. Even Chu Feng was unable to detect any peculiarity. However, that altar was actually a divine artifact that lead to the Outer World.</p>
 <p>Even though Chu Feng was currently a person capable of calling upon the wind and summoning the rain in the Holy Land of Martialism, Chu Feng still felt himself to be extremely small when standing before the Stairway To Heaven.</p>
 <p>Afterwards, Chu Feng began to return using the same route he had used to get here. As Chu Feng no longer needed to carefully inspect his surroundings with his spirit power, the speed at which Chu Feng traveled to return became much faster.</p>
 <p>However, at the moment when Chu Feng walked out of the Immortalization Road, his eyes shone.</p>
 <p>With Chu Feng’s current level of cultivation, his perception was extremely sharp. Thus, even though there was a spirit formation in the way, he was able to clearly hear all of the war cries, energy ripples wreaking havoc, and the explosions emitted by martial skills outside of the Misty Peak.</p>
 <p>Then, upon using his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng saw that there were energy ripples and surging smoke all over. The outside of the Misty Peak had turned into a battlefield.</p>
 <p>Qiu Canfeng, Taikou, Xue Xiyue and many of his familiar seniors were all fighting outside.</p>
 <p>As for their opponents, it should be a monstrous beast race.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had never seen that race of monstrous beast before. Their entire bodies were blood-red in color, and covered in scales. They should be a sort of sea monstrous beast.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, their number was not a lot; they numbered less than the experts from the Misty peak and the Crippling Night Demon Sect.</p>
 <p>However, the overall strength of this group of monstrous beasts was very strong. At that moment, they were suppressing the Misty Peak and the Crippling Night Demon Sect’s armies.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, one of those monstrous beasts had taken on human form. Even though he had taken human form, his body was still covered with crimson scales. He looked extremely disgusting.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, that monstrous beast actually possessed the cultivation of a rank one Half Martial Emperor. In the Eastern Sea Region, that cultivation was most definitely capable of ruling above everyone else.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, he was pinned down by Huangfu Haoyue, a fellow rank one Half Martial Emperor. Else, the casualties for the Misty Peak would likely be even more severe.</p>
 <p>However, regardless of how powerful Huangfu Haoyue might be, regardless of how he was deemed to be the strongest in the Eastern Sea Region back then, he was still in a disadvantaged position when fighting against the monstrous beast.</p>
 <p>“They actually came here to create trouble?! Truly courting death!”</p>
 <p>After discovering the situation outside, fury erupted in Chu Feng’s heart. He did not care about where those monstrous beasts came from. However, the fact that they actually dared to bring harm to those that were close to him meant that Chu Feng would absolutely not forgive them.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng,” Right at the moment when Chu Feng was prepared to go out, a figure suddenly arrived before him and stopped him.</p>
 <p>It was Qiushui Fuyan. After she appeared, she immediately grabbed Chu Feng’s wrist and said to him with a joyous smile on her face, “Chu Feng, quickly, come with me. I managed to find Ya Fei and the others.”</p>
 <p>After saying those words, Qiushui Fuyan began to pull Chu Feng toward the teleportation formation in the Misty Peak.</p>
 <p>However, she was simply unable to even move Chu Feng. Confused, Qiushui Fuyan turned around and asked, “Chu Feng, what’s wrong?”</p>
 <p>“Big sister Fuyan, that is what I should be asking you. Someone is attacking our Misty Peak. Yet, not only did you not tell me that, you instead tried to deceive me and lead me away, saying that you had found out out where Ya Fei and the others were. Exactly what is it that you’re planning?” Chu Feng narrowed his eyebrows and asked in a somewhat angry manner.</p>
