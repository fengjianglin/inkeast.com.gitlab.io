 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 3556 - Secretly Delighted</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that the situation was amiss, Chu Feng did not rashly approach. Instead, he took out a captured Blood-devouring Demon Clansman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is going on here? What happened to the people you all captured?” Chu Feng asked sternly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I… I also have no idea what’s going on. I truly do not know. They were here before,” the Blood-devouring Demon Clansman started to shiver in fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That Blood-devouring Demon Clansman had completely crumbled after Chu Feng’s torture, and had revealed a lot of their secrets to him. Thus, Chu Feng was rather trusting of his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Strange. Why would they suddenly all be hidden? Could it be that the Blood-devouring Demon Clan has realized something?’ Chu Feng began to ponder in his heart. However, he was unable to determine what the reason might be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, even when using his Heaven’s Eyes to observe his surroundings, he was unable to detect any clues from the empty and spacious region with the giant gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, Chu Feng had wanted to release some Blood-devouring Clansmen and have them go investigate things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he soon rejected that notion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He absolutely could not release those Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen as they would only expose him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘It would appear that I can only risk it myself,’ Suddenly, Chu Feng took a leap forward. Upon landing on the vacant land, he took another jump, and landed on top of the giant gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, when he landed on the giant gate, the giant gate and the surroundings did not have any reaction at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Chu Feng raised his foot and stomped down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bang~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Rumble~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his stomp, the giant gate composed of branches instantly shattered. Dust immediately soared into the sky. This caused quite a bit of commotion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, even with that being the case, no Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen showed up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, after stomping on the gate, Chu Feng discovered that the gate was purely a gate composed of branches woven together. There was nothing else special about the gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘It would appear that they’ve truly changed locations,’ Chu Feng started to frown. He felt that the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen must’ve discovered something, and thus transferred all their captives elsewhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With that being the case, not only had Chu Feng journeyed there in vain, but he also didn’t know how to handle the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Which little bastard dared to destroy another’s possession at will?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a furious shout was heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sudden voice caused Chu Feng’s heart to tense up. The reason for that was because even though he heard that voice, he was still unable to sense the aura of the person who had spoken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This made Chu Feng realize that the person who had spoken was extremely powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, after looking over in the direction of the voice, Chu Feng stood stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were two people at the location where the voice sounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were one male and one female. They were both sitting on a large tree branch far away and looking at Chu Feng like they were looking at a show. There were half-eaten Sacred Tree Fruits in their hands. Their appearances were truly carefree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That said, the two of them were wearing the same sort of black cloak as the other Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was those Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen’s black cloaks. They were special. Not only were they capable of hiding their faces, but they were also capable of hiding their auras. If they did not intend to reveal themselves, Chu Feng would not be able to see through them either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why Chu Feng was able to determine that they were a man and a woman was because the two of them were not wearing their hoods, and had revealed their facial appearances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Judging from the way they looked, they should not be very old. The man had a similar age to Chu Feng, whereas the woman seemed to be a bit younger than him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them both looked pretty good. In fact, one could even describe their looks as stunning. They were truly a handsome man and a beautiful woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That said, the man was somewhat strange. Although he was clearly a man, his face was covered in makeup.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, that makeup was rather strange. It did not resemble a woman’s makeup.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was especially true for the intensely thick eyeliner. It appeared so very strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘They couldn’t possibly be Zhang Boyi and Zhang Shirui of the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Three Geniuses, right?’ Chu Feng wondered in his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That said, he was uncertain that the two of them were Zhang Boyi and Zhang Shirui. The reason for that was because the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen had blue skin and crimson vein lines all over their skin, making them look like monsters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, those two people looked very normal. Especially that woman, her skin was fair like jade, and was even giving off a luminescent shine. That skin was truly rarely-seen good skin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the man, although his face was somewhat distinctive, Chu Feng was able to tell from a glance that it was merely makeup.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was said that the people from the Blood-devouring Demon Clan all had blue skin and crimson vein lines because of the side effects caused by the Blood-devouring Demonic Technique that they trained in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, it made sense that if one was a Blood-devouring Demon Clansman, then one should possess blue skin and crimson vein lines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, I’m speaking to you. Are you deaf?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whilst Chu Feng was thinking, that woman spoke again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her tone was very sharp, harsh, cutting, mocking and shaming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In short, whenever she spoke, one would feel very displeased hearing her voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng could be said to be someone who had a lot of experience. He had seen all sorts of people. However, this was the first time he had met someone where he felt this displeased after hearing them speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of that, Chu Feng felt that she must be that Zhang Shirui.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, it was said that Zhang Shirui had a naturally vicious mouth, and was able to curse people to death, forcing them to explode, using her mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wait, he seems to be Chu Feng.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at that moment, that man suddenly spoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah? Chu Feng?” That woman revealed a shocked look upon hearing those words. Then, she began to carefully size Chu Feng up again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Woah! That really is Chu Feng!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, that woman stood up. An incomparably excited expression appeared on her beautiful little face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Never would I have imagined that I’d encounter the renowned Chu Xuanyuan’s son, Chu Feng.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve heard that you are said to be the strongest of the younger generations in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. Today… allow me, Zhang Shirui, to have experience how strong you are,” that woman cracked her knuckles and did some stretching, causing the rest of her bones to pop. She looked like she was planning to give Chu Feng a beating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I, Zhang Boyi, also wish to experience the renowned Chu Feng,” the man also stood up eagerly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the two of them spoke, Chu Feng was finally able to confirm their identities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sure enough, they were Zhang Boyi and Zhang Shirui of the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s Three Geniuses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he didn’t know why their skin wasn’t blue like the rest of the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen and how they knew about him, he knew that the two of them seemed to be very determined to defeat him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, that was indeed the case.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That said, Zhang Boyi and Zhang Shirui had no idea that Chu Feng was actually much more excited than the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘And here I was thinking that I would have to return empty-handed. Truly, never did I expect that I would run into the two of you,’ Chu Feng was secretly delighted.</span></p>
