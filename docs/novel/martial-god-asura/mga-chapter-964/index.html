 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 964 - The Battle Begins</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Finish this battle? You’re quite courageous to dare and say that. You truly think you can defeat us alone?” Murong Mingtian sneered. Although Chu Feng was a rank four Martial King, any person who had some experience with battles could see that Chu Feng had obtained this cultivation with some sort of special method.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Mingtian, who had cultivated on the Misty Peak, knew quite well how Chu Feng obtained his current cultivation. But even though Chu Feng was a rank four Martial King, he wasn’t afraid because he didn’t think Chu Feng was any match for Jiang Qisha. Besides, Chu Feng was alone, while they still had an army of dozens of millions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoh. Murong Mingtian, if you truly think I’m alone, you are absolutely wrong.” Chu Feng lightly smiled, then rumbles starting resounding from the distant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Very soon, over ten million people wearing long black robes appeared within their line of sight, where they then quickly arrived on the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those people were naturally the Crippling Night Demon Sect’s army. Not only them, Qiushui Fuyan and Taikou were within their ranks as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Crippling Night Demon Sect? Their members have truly gathered, and they’re truly coming to attack this place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many people felt astonished when they saw such a scene. Everyone knew who of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. So, even though the formation, in terms of strength, was the exact same as the mysterious army that came in waves before, the deterrence brought forth by the one now was completely different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was especially so for the Four Protectors of the Crippling Night Demon Sect—Qiu Canfeng, Fu Liansheng, Xue Xiyue, and You Mingdeng. Which one of them wasn’t an infamous great demon in the Eastern Sea Region?</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for the Five Elemental Kings—Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—they too were more than they seemed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The formation they made was tantamount to the gathering of the Crippling Night Demon Sect’s peak experts. Other than the lack of sect head, all the true experts were present.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“WE GREET LORD SECT HEAD!” But just at that moment, an even more astounding scene occurred: the entire army of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, including the Four Protectors, all half-knelt orderly and paid their respects to Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Sect head? Chu Feng’s the head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The already stunned crowd were now all dumbfounded. They were stupefied. No matter what, they would not have expected that Chu Feng had become the head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But after a bit more thinking… the Demon Sealing Sword in his hand was the sect’s most valuable treasure, and in addition, Chu Feng’s cultivation aptitude had always been immensely powerful. Now, his cultivation had soared, so, really, he </span><i><span style>was</span></i><span style> qualified to become the head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoh, so the ones who used the formation before were all of you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Although you are merely useless soldiers in my eyes, you are all still willing to die just for Chu Feng. This is quite unexpected.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Mingtian sneered. No matter how they appeared in the eyes of others, in his own eyes, they were a group of trash he could kill himself. Numbers? That was meaningless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoh, you’re looking down on the Crippling Night Demon Sect? If you and Jiang Qisha don’t do anything, do you think your Immortal Execution Archipelago is any match for us?” Chu Feng coldly asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This…” Many people’s hearts felt like drums beating. Although the Immortal Execution Archipelago’s experts were as common as clouds, the Crippling Night Demon Sect was not weak at all. Moreover, the crowd knew the Crippling Night Demon Sect was the former overlord of the Eastern Sea Region. Even though it had been split up for many years, the legend they left behind made others feel they were terrifying powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without Murong Mingtian, this rank seven Martial King old monster, not to mention the Immortal Execution Archipelago alone, even if the Three Great Monstrous Clans joined up with them, they still might not necessarily defeat the Crippling Night Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a joke. Do you truly think your Crippling Night Demon Sect is invincible? Even if I don’t do anything, your Crippling Night Demon Sect is no match for the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Mingtian sneered. He was not afraid. Putting aside the fact that they, the union of four forces, were in an advantage in terms of battle formation, they were in a huge advantage in terms of numbers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since you’ve said that, I don’t mind letting you see whether your alliance army is stronger, or my Crippling Night Demon Sect’s experts are stronger.” As Chu Feng spoke, the Demon Sealing Sword in his hand shone with light. An invisible ripple then swept out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*hmm* When it passed through the Crippling Night Demon Sect, their auras rapidly soared. Although their cultivation levels were unchanged, the feeling they exuded was completely different from before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Crippling Night Demon Sect’s Slaughtering Formation?” Murong Mingtian frowned slightly. He knew the Crippling Night Demon Sect had something that raised everyone’s strength—the Demon Bestowal Slaughtering Formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was a very complicated formation. Only in their territory would such a formation exist, yet right now, this was within his Immortal Execution Archipelago’s borders. How could there possibly be a formation like that? Moreover, judging by the increase in their strength, he could tell that the power from the formation was extremely strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could it be… the Demon Sealing Sword? This brat laid the formation on his body?” Murong Mingtian thought. However, when he imagined such a possibility, even he couldn’t help but feel shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My brothers, attention! Today, I will have the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans annihilated! No matter who it is, those who block me die!” Chu Feng suddenly pointed his sword down—towards the Immortal Execution Archipelago’s army.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“KILL—” The Crippling Night Demon Sect were like awakened demons after Chu Feng’s words. All of them burst with bloodlust. They used all sorts of ferocious skills, and slaughtered their way towards their enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“KILL—” Of course, the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans would not show any cowardice. Amidst furious roars, they fought the Crippling Night Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*boom boom boom boom*</span></p>
 <p><span style>When two armies of millions clashed, shock waves instantly arose. The might was truly shocking, and extremely frightening. This time, it was not only an army of ten million fighting, it was an army of ten million actual lives fighting. Every fall of a body represented the disappearance of a life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But there had to be one victor from the confrontation of two armies. &nbsp;The battle formation of both sides was roughly the same—the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Three Great Monstrous Clans’ side was actually in an enormous advantage in terms of numbers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But when they truly battled, the one with the edge instantly surfaced—it was the Crippling Night Demon Sect’s army. With absolute strength and perfect coordination, they overcame their disadvantage in numbers and gained the upper hand!</span></p>
