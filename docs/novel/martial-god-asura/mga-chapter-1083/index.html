 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1083 - Elf Princess</strong></p>
 <p>“Senior brother Yuan Qing, could it be that you still didn’t know? You have successfully triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle. The Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle had emitted a golden lightning that covered the entire sky above the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.”</p>
 <p>“It’s not merely that. Other than the legendary golden lightning, five lightnings that were not recorded in the legends also appeared. Those lightnings appeared to be living and actually galloped to the heavens, creating a magnificent sight.” Said the disciples of the Orion Monastery in excitement.</p>
 <p>“The Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle has really been triggered?” Hearing those words, Yuan Qing started to frown. His heart began to boil.</p>
 <p>That was because Qin Guang had gone to chase after Chu Feng but never returned. He feared that something might’ve happened to Qin Guang, so he decided to wait for Qin Guang in the Immortal Pond the entire time. While he was waiting, he had closed his eyes as he trained.</p>
 <p>During the time when the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle was triggered, he also felt the motion of the waters. At that time, he knew that something had happened. However, upon thinking that even the Ancient Era’s Elves that were training at the deepest region of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond had left and only Qin Guang and Chu Feng hadn’t appeared, Yuan Qing began to feel unease and did not dare to rashly come out from the waters.</p>
 <p>Thus, he decided to wait a bit longer. However, the longer he waited, the more unease he felt. He did not know if something had happened to Qin Guang or if he had already left. However, upon thinking that the three days’ time limit had arrived, he decided to appear from within the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.</p>
 <p>However, never did he expect the reaction of the people after he emerged from the waters. It turned out that the movement he felt before was precisely the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle being triggered. Moreover, it appeared to be a human who triggered it.</p>
 <p>And now, seeing the excited appearances of the people surrounding him and their gazes of reverence, it was clear that he had been deemed as the person who triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle.</p>
 <p>Although he knew that the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle was not triggered by him because he simply did not manage to reach the bottom of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond, upon recalling how triggering the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle was his dream and the honor and benefits that would come alongside triggering it, he truly wanted to be the one to trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle.</p>
 <p>And now, since everyone believed that it was him who triggered it, he would naturally not deny it.</p>
 <p>Thus, he calmed his frame of mind and displayed a smile on his previously confused face. Then, in an extremely proud manner, he nodded and said, “That’s right, I have triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle.”</p>
 <p>“Clamor~~~~~~~~”</p>
 <p>Right after he said those words, the crowd burst into an uproar. Although the crowd had already determined that it was Yuan Qing that triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle, it was still not as stimulating as hearing Yuan Qing declaring that it was him.</p>
 <p>Evidently, at this moment, Yuan Qing had become the hero in the eyes of all these people. Not only were the people from the Orion Monastery loudly cheering for him, even the people who were not from the Orion Monastery began to applaud and cheer for him.</p>
 <p>However, right at the moment when everyone determined that it was Yuan Qing who triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle, the Ancient Era’s Elves that had entered into the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond had a different view.</p>
 <p>“It’s him? How is that possible? I saw that guy in the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. He simply did not even manage to reach the level of water that we reached, much less the bottom of the Immortal Pond. For the entire time, he had been lingering around the middle region of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.”</p>
 <p>“Although he did not manage to reach the bottom of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond, it remains true that he was the human who managed to reach the deepest depth in the Immortal Pond. If it must be said who triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle, it is true that he would have the greatest possibility.”</p>
 <p>“That’s impossible. The Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle could only be triggered by those who reach the bottom. He was so far away from the bottom of the Immortal Pond; how could it possibly be him who triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle?”</p>
 <p>“The Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle being triggered this time was different from the past to begin with. Moreover, could you ascertain that the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle required a person to be at the bottom to trigger it?” Could you guarantee that the requirements that the humans have in triggering the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle would be the same as us?”</p>
 <p>“This…”</p>
 <p>Those Ancient Era’s Elves that had encountered Yuan Qing began to debate among themselves. However, none of them could ascertain that it was not Yuan Qing who triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle. In this helpless situation, the Ancient Era’s Elves had no choice but to admit that it was Yuan Qing that triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle. That was because, other than Yuan Qing, there was no other candidate.</p>
 <p>“Truly unfair. I have been at the bottom of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond for so long but did not manage to trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle. Yet he, who was merely in that depth, was able to trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle and even give birth to lightnings that never before appeared. This is truly unfair!”</p>
 <p>“This man simply does not qualify to embrace the honor that he receives now. That’s because he simply does not qualify to trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle.” Compared to the others, Xian Kun was furious. He felt that it was truly too unfair, so unfair that killing intent rose in his heart. The more time passed, the denser his killing intent became. In the end, he blurted out, “I’ll kill him!”</p>
 <p>“I’m afraid that won’t do.” However, right at the moment when Xian Kun prepared to attack, a young and gentle voice sounded from behind him and the others.</p>
 <p>Turning their heads to look, everyone was shocked. Immediately after, they all kneeled down and said, “We pay our respects to Lady Princess.”</p>
 <p>It turned out that the person who had come was precisely the Ancient Era’s Elves’ Kingdom’s princess. As for this so-called princess, she was the little girl who had stolen the medicinal pellets from the Orion Monastery’s disciple and later saved by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“You can all rise. Get up. To kneel for no reason at all, are you people not tired of it?” At this moment, the Elf Princess was walking and jumping in the air. With her hands behind her back, she had a naughty appearance as she walked over to the Southern Elf Lord, Xian Kun and the other management elders.</p>
 <p>“Lady Princess, that trash by the name of Yuan Qing is simply unqualified to trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle. For him to trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle is an insult to us Ancient Era’s Elves. We cannot let him live, please allow me to go and eliminate this stain.” Xian Kun requested.</p>
 <p>“Oh? Southern Elf Lord, what do you think about this matter?” The Elf Princess blinked her large eyes and, with an expression as if she had no idea what should be done, looked to the Southern Elf Lord. Her appearance seemed like that of a child asking for help from an adult after not knowing what to do.</p>
 <p>“Eh…”</p>
 <p>“Lady Princess, what Lord Xian Kun said is not without justification. We cannot allow such a stain to exist.” After hesitating for a moment, the Southern Elf Lord said.</p>
 <p>“Oh? In that case, do you all plan to exterminate all those people, a total of several hundred millions, in the Southern Domain?” Asked the Elf Princess with a smile on her face and her eyes squinted. “What do you all consider our Ancient Era’s Elves to be? Are we slaughterers or are we butchers?”</p>
 <p>“This…” After being asked by the Elf Princess in such a manner, everyone was speechless.</p>
 <p>“There are certain things that you people ought to know too. It is not that our Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle have never been triggered by humans before. Ten thousand years ago, the human Qing Xuantian had triggered the kingdom’s Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle. Moreover, that is not an ordinary Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle; instead, it was our kingdom’s golden needle.”</p>
 <p>“Xian Kun, I believe you know how difficult it is to trigger that golden needle, right?’ Suddenly, the Elf Princess looked to Xian Kun with a smile on her face.</p>
 <p>Being looked by the Elf Princess in such a manner, Xian Kun’s expression instantly became unsightly. However, in the end, he nodded and said, “This subordinate knows very well.”</p>
 <p>“There’s no need to feel ashamed. Since the ancient times, the number of Ancient Era’s Elves that managed to trigger the golden needle cannot be counted with one’s fingers. That is because triggering the golden needle is simply not something that anyone ordinary could achieve.” The Elf Princess smiled profoundly. Then, with a slicky satire-tone, she continued. “However, the human Qing Xuantian managed to accomplish that.”</p>
 <p>“If it is said that as long as it would be a humiliation to us if any other race triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle, then we have already felt this humiliation ten thousand years ago.”</p>
 <p>“If you all wish to remove the stain, then I’m afraid killing the several hundred millions of people here would not be enough. Instead, you’ll have to kill all of the people in the Holy Land of Martialism. Because, regardless of whether it might be the humans or the monstrous beasts, elderly or children, everyone knows that Qing Xuantian had defeated us Ancient Era’s Elves ten thousand years ago.”</p>
 <p>Said the Elf Princess with a child’s voice. Regardless of what she was saying, her voice was still that of a child’s. However, after she finished speaking, all of the Ancient Era’s Elves present lowered their heads and didn’t say anything. Not only were they speechless, embarrassment also covered their faces.</p>
