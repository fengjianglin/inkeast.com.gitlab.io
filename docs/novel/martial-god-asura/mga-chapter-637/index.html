 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 637 - Lying to Others and Lying to Oneself</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandfather, you’re finally willing to see me! I even thought you’d forgotten about me.” When she saw her grandfather, Ya Fei was very happy. In a cute manner, she leaped into Ya Zongyun’s embrace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, I only have one cute granddaughter, so how could I forget about you? I just came out of secluded cultivation. Before even seeing the archipelago master, I came to see you.” Ya Zongyun laughed, his eyes were full of love. His doting and spoiling on Ya Fei was infamous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandfather, you’ve made a breakthrough?” Hearing that her grandfather just came out of seclusion, Ya Fei widened her eyes, her face full of yearning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When has your grandfather ever failed in secluded cultivation?” Ya Zongyun chuckled, but gave Ya Fei a definite answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s great! Grandfather has made a breakthrough again! Grandfather, then with your current cultivation, are you able to be on par with the archipelago master?!” Knowing the answer, the smile on Ya Fei’s face was even stronger. Her grandfather was her greatest backing. The stronger her grandfather became, the more unruly she could be.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Foolish girl, how is the realm of the archipelago master something that I can compare to? But now, my position as the third strongest in the Immortal Execution Archipelago is definitely unshakeable now.” Ya Zongyun’s face was full of smiles. It could be seen that he was also truly happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the proverbs say: “One feels refreshed upon meeting joyous occasions”, let alone a cultivation expert making a breakthrough?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Third strongest? Wasn’t Grandfather always the second strongest in the Immortal Execution Archipelago? Could it be that other than the archipelago master, there’s a person even stronger than Grandfather?” Ya Fei lightly furrowed her brows. She seemed to not be too satisfied with that result. She also didn’t feel that there was anyone, other than the archipelago master, who had the qualifications to stand above her prided grandfather.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Silly&nbsp;girl, have you forgotten my Immortal Execution Archipelago’s former master, the current Supreme Elder?” asked Ya Zongyun with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme Elder? You mean Murong Yun’s grandfather? Hasn’t he already reached his final days? Is he not dead yet?” Ya Fei’s face was full of shock because since she was young, she had seen the so-called Supreme Elder, but at that time, he was already like a dead person. Every day, he had to consume large amounts of precious medicine to prologue his life in order to continue surviving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So many days had passed and she hadn’t seen that Supreme Elder again, nor had anyone mentioned him. The current glory of the Immortal Execution Archipelago was all built up by the current archipelago master alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, Ya Fei even thought that the Supreme Elder died. After all, he was already so feeble back then, not to mention that so many years had passed now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh, my child, don’t say those words everywhere arbitrarily. The Supreme Elder has always been living well.” Hearing her words, Ya Zongyun hurriedly reminded solemnly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could it be… Could it be that he has made a breakthrough again? So he obtained the chance to lengthen his life?” Ya Fei thought of the only possibility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm. The Supreme Elder already made a breakthrough a long time ago. Right now, the old man is constantly in secluded cultivation, and he is already on a completely new path.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If he can, once again, successfully break through, even if the head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect or that Burning Heaven Church’s Huangfu Haoyue were here, they would absolutely not be able to defeat the Supreme Elder. He will truly be invincible in this world,” said Ya Zongyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandfather, I’ve always heard you talk about the Crippling Night Demon Sect and the Burning Heaven Church. Are those two powers that no longer exist truly that powerful?” asked Ya Fei curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although, when she was young, the Crippling Night Demon Sect and the Burning Heaven Church were still there, she was really too young back then. All day, she cared only about playing and was completely ignorant to things such as the powers. Her grandfather and parents also never told her about those things, so she had never seen the glory of the Crippling Night Demon Sect and Burning Heaven Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ho, thinking back then, those two powers truly pressed my Immortal Execution Archipelago to the point we could not even breathe. But, those days of suffering have already passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As long as the Supreme Elder can successfully make a breakthrough, then even if the Crippling Night Demon Sect and the Burning Heaven Church are still here, they will still be stepped upon by my Immortal Execution Archipelago,” said Ya Zongyun very confidently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, Grandfather, is there great hope for him to make a breakthrough?” asked Ya Fei excitedly. As a person of the Immortal Execution Archipelago, although she hoped, even more, that her grandfather would become stronger, she also hoped that the Immortal Execution Archipelago would become stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is, of course, hope, but the further one is in the realm of Martial Kings, the harder it is to make breakthroughs. The Supreme Elder’s rank is already in a very difficult to overcome bottleneck. Back then, the head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect and Huangfu Haoyue, who shocked the world, also stopped on this realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But, right now, the Immortal Execution Archipelago is safely in control over the Eastern Sea Region. As long as an ample amount of resources is collected, the chance that the Supreme Elder has to make a breakthrough is still very great,” said Ya Zongyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandfather, if the head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect and Huangfu Haoyue were still here, do you think they would have broke past the realm you talked about just now?” asked Ya Fei curiously. She had always heard her grandfather mention those two people, so Ya Fei knew, in her heart, that those two were definitely very powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This...” Ya Zongyun found it very difficult to respond to that question. After all, the two of them staying in that realm was already something over ten years ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Judging by their talent, especially Huangfu Haoyue’s talent, it was very hard to estimate what realm they would be in over ten years later. He, at present, was only comparing the Supreme Elder’s current cultivation with their former achievements. Actually, that kind of comparison was both lying to others, and lying to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m guessing that the two of them would definitely be unable to break through as well. Besides, they are no longer here. Right now, my Immortal Execution Archipelago is the strongest in this world. That is an undeniable fact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Back then, the Crippling Night Demon Sect and Burning Heaven Church split the world in half; but now, my Immortal Execution Archipelago monopolizes the world. Just on that point, they are inferior to my Immortal Execution Archipelago,” said Ya Fei smartly as she quickly giggled, upon seemingly noticing her grandfather put in a difficult situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, that’s right. My Fei’er is correct. The current achievements that the Immortal Execution Archipelago has isn’t something that can be compared by the Crippling Night Demon Sect and Burning Heaven Church.” Hearing Ya Fei’s words, Ya Zongyun also happily laughed loudly again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, but sadly, no matter how much stronger my Immortal Execution Archipelago is, there is always some people who think that they know it all and don’t put the Immortal Execution Archipelago in their eyes.” Just at that moment, Ya Fei suddenly turned strangely downcast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm? Fei’er, what do you mean?!” Seeing that, Ya Zongyun’s brows instantly slanted inwards, a hint of displeasure emerging into his eyes because he could tell that surely, her obedient granddaughter was bullied by someone again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grandfather, have you heard of Daoist Qiushui of the Lovers Terrace?” replied Ya Fei with a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I do know of the Lovers Terrace. It’s a place where a group of conceited trash live hiddenly in. As for that Daoist Qiushui, I have not heard of her.” Ya Zongyun shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph. Is a nameless person. Grandfather, let me tell you. That person called Daoist Qiushui is so arrogant! Not only does she not put the Immortal Execution Archipelago in her eyes, she doesn’t even put Grandfather in her eyes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Ya Fei hurried took the chance to aggravate the situation. Not only did she speak her grievances, she even “added oil and vinegar”, exaggerating Daoist Qiushui’s arrogance. She wanted her grandfather to stand up and take revenge for her.</span></p>
