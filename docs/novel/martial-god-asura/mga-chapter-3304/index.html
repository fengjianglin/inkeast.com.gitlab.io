Merely, this time around, his tone was rather strict.</span></p>

The grand unsealing formation was activated once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following that, the formation controlled by Liangqiu Hongyue was also activated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The younger generations within that formation were all exerting all their might to assist with the activation of the formation.</span></p>

At that moment, the defensive formation that protected the Ancient Era’s remnant began to tremble violently again, as if it were receiving an enormous impact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the blink of an eye, another hour passed. However, the grand defensive formation was still present. Even the crack had only expanded slightly.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Liangqiu Chengfeng shouted angrily, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief smiled profoundly.</span></p>

Seeing his behavior at this moment, it would appear that that was indeed the case.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior brother, that defensive formation is simply too strong. You cannot blame us for our failure,” Liangqiu Hongyue said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although she had refuted Liangqiu Chengfeng, her tone was very lacking in terms of confidence. Instead, it was a tone of grievance. It would appear that even though Liangqiu Hongyue was very haughty and conceited, she was still deeply afraid of Liangqiu Chengfeng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This is the only feasible method to destroy that defensive formation. Furthermore… the spirit formation that I had you all set up is able to coordinate with my spirit formation from the inside. It is most definitely capable of destroying that defensive formation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“However, you two sisters are actually unable to control that spirit formation. The two of you have wasted the spirit power of these various young friends. You are utter disappointments,” Liangqiu Chengfeng said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior brother, it is clearly that defensive formation that is too powerful; how could you say that it’s us sisters who do not possess sufficient control over the formation?” Liangqiu Lanyue asked. Evidently, she disapproved of Liangqiu Chengfeng’s interpretation of events.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The two of you need not say anymore. I will report this matter to master as it is,” Liangqiu Chengfeng was truly angered. There was no longer any leeway in his tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Faced with such a Liangqiu Chengfeng, even Liangqiu Hongyue and Liangqiu Lanyue did not dare to talk back. As for the others, they would naturally be completely quiet too. They were all afraid of offending Liangqiu Chengfeng, that grand individual.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Liangqiu Chengfeng, who was extremely furious changed his voice to that of a friendly tone again. However, his voice was not aimed at the Liangqiu Sisters. Instead, it was aimed at Wuma Shengjie. He asked, “Young friend Wuma Shengjie, are you capable of controlling that formation?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crowd was actually not surprised by Liangqiu Chengfeng’s words. They had already anticipated such a thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason for that was because, of all the people from the younger generation present, it was not only the Liangqiu Sisters that were Insect Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritists. Wuma Shengjie was actually also an Insect Mark Exalted-cloak World Spiritist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sure,” Wuma Shengjie directly accepted Liangqiu Chengfeng’s request. She stepped forth and replaced Liangqiu Hongyue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Following that, Liangqiu Chengfeng began the activation of his grand unsealing formation again. Wuma Shengjie also began to activate the spirit formation within the crack to coordinate with Liangqiu Chengfeng to attack the defensive formation from both inside and out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Another hour passed. Unfortunately, it was another failure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was worth mentioning that the size of the crack had actually increased twofold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, it was not only the people from the younger generation that were astonished; even the grand experts present revealed an astonished look. At the same time as they were astonished, they were also feeling joyous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, the crowd all had the same thought in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘Wuma Shengjie is truly worthy of being the prophesied child. His talent is truly exceptional. He is already a rank four Martial Immortal at such a young age. That strength is simply something that very few people among the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm’s younger generation could compare to.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘Furthermore, his talent in terms of world spirit techniques is actually superior to Grandmaster Liangqiu’s two personal disciples.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘His talent has been fully revealed. Perhaps, if he is given more time, he will really be able to compete against the current number one genius of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, Linghu Hongfei.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While the others were astonished by Wuma Shengjie, the Liangqiu Sisters revealed unsightly looks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being the youngest disciples of Grandmaster Liangqiu, the twin sisters had enjoyed being revered by others regardless of where they went.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them naturally received such treatment even after arriving here. However, the two of them were no longer the main characters. Because of that prophecy, Wuma Shengjie was the actual main character.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That sort of sensation had brought great discomfort upon the two sisters to begin with. And now, they were actually defeated by Wuma Shengjie in terms of world spirit techniques. This caused the two sisters to feel even more uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Feeling extremely displeased, Liangqiu Hongyue turned her body around in a weird and unexplained manner. She looked to the grand formation that Liangqiu Chengfeng was in and spoke loudly, "Senior brother, perhaps there's a person here that's capable of breaching that defensive formation."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her words caused many people to feel confused.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If one were to ask who amongst the people here could possibly breach that defensive formation, then it would naturally be Liangqiu Chengfeng among those of the older generation, and Wuma Shengjie among those of the younger generation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was something that was known to everyone. As such, why would Liangqiu Hongyue suddenly say that?</span></p>
