 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1664 - Poison Demon’s Descendants</strong></p>
 <p>“It’s alright. God, you have already removed our poison for us. We already cannot thank you enough.”</p>
 <p>“That’s right, if it wasn’t for you, god, we would have died already.”</p>
 <p>“Right, right, right. We have been like this for generations. We have already grown used to it. It’s actually not that bad either. Hahaha…”</p>
 <p>The villagers began to laugh. They had the appearance of indifference. However, Chu Feng was able to tell that they still deeply longed to be able to break away from the binding of the Poison Demon’s descendants. The reason why they were pretending to be indifferent was because they did not wish to make things difficult for Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“While I am unable to help you all take care of the Poison Demon’s descendants, I am able to talk to them for you all and help speak up for you all.”</p>
 <p>“As an outsider, if speaking of it in a pleasant manner, I could also be considered to be a guest of this Poison Demon’s Valley. Perhaps they might listen to my words,” Chu Feng said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Really? That would truly be great. God, you are truly a living Buddha,” The villagers were immediately overjoyed upon hearing those words.</p>
 <p>The reason why Chu Feng wanted to help them even though he did not possess the certainty of being able to do so was because he felt that they were very pitiful.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, as he had arrived here, Chu Feng was in no hurry to leave. After all, when the Poison Demon disappeared, he had taken an item with him, one of the Five Elements Secret Skills, the Fire Immortal Profound Technique.</p>
 <p>With how the descendants of the Poison Demon treated the villagers, it was likely that they were not good people either. There was no need for Chu Feng to be compassionate toward this sort of people.</p>
 <p>If Chu Feng were truly capable of taking care of the Poison Demon’s descendants, then, as he rooted out evil and brought peace to the villagers, he would naturally also seize that Fire Immortal Profound Technique for himself.</p>
 <p>Not to mention that obtaining all the Five Elements Secret Skills would present to one a secret, just the power of the Fire Immortal Profound Technique was something that Chu Feng wanted to obtain very much. After all, the Water Immortal Profound Technique was already this powerful. If he obtained the Fire Immortal Profound Technique, Chu Feng would become even more powerful.</p>
 <p>If the Fire Immortal Profound Technique could be summoned like the Water Immortal Profound Technique and was capable of fighting on its own, then Chu Feng would no longer be fighting alone when fighting against others. Instead, he would be fighting three against one.</p>
 <p>Upon thinking of that, Chu Feng planned to set off for the location of the Poison Demon’s descendants and meet with them.</p>
 <p>The Poison Demon was, after all, a very grand character in the Holy Land of Martialism back then. Even though he had died long ago and it was impossible for Chu Feng to experience his grace, the descendants of the Poison Demon should possess some of the Poison Demon’s skills.</p>
 <p>Thus, to be able to meet up with his descendants would be a pretty decent thing too.</p>
 <p>However, before Chu Feng could go to find the Poison Demon’s descendants, the Poison Demon’s descendants had arrived at the village.</p>
 <p>When they saw that the Poison Demon’s descendants had come, the villagers were so scared that their complexions turned pale. From happily chatting before, they now started to involuntarily shiver all over.</p>
 <p>From the old to the young, none of the villagers dared to continue to stay in their houses. All of them ran out of the village to welcome the Poison Demon’s descendants.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng did not go out immediately. Instead, he first observed the cultivations of these Poison Demon’s descendants.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng discovered that it was three men and two women who had come. Even though they had the appearance of middle-aged people, they were not middle-aged people at all. Instead, they were old people who had already lived for hundreds of years.</p>
 <p>Even though the lifespan of the villagers were quite short, the lifespans of the Poison Demon’s descendants were not short at all. Although these three men and two women all possessed cultivations superior to the villagers’, none of them were Half Martial Emperors. Among them, the person with the strongest cultivation was merely a rank eight Martial King.</p>
 <p>When they saw Goudan’er’s father and the others, they were immediately enraged. They threw fists and directly knocked Goudan’er’s father and the others onto the ground. One by one, Goudan’er’s father and the others all became covered with blood; they were all suffering from serious injuries.</p>
 <p>“How did the poison in your bodies go away?” The Poison Demon’s descendants asked with cold voices. At this moment, dense killing intent was present within their eyes.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because the villagers removing the poison without permission was going against their rules. This was something that they would not tolerate.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was able to tell that regardless of how Goudan’er’s father and the others answered the Poison Demon’s descendants, they would likely not be able to escape death.</p>
 <p>These Poison Demon’s descendants were truly ruthless. Chu Feng was unable to tolerate people like them. He felt that he had to teach them a lesson.</p>
 <p>“I am the one who removed their poison,” Chu Feng walked out from the house and stood before Goudan’er’s father and the others.</p>
 <p>“Who are you?” Upon seeing Chu Feng, the expressions on the three men and the two women’s faces changed enormously. They were both shocked and frightened. They were feeling extremely uneasy.</p>
 <p>Their reactions were understandable. After all, no matter how big the Poison Demon’s Valley might be, there were only so many people.</p>
 <p>The people from the village and them, the descendants of the Poison Demon, all knew one another.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he was someone that they did not recognize.</p>
 <p>In all the years that the Poison Demon’s Valley had been sealed by that Poison Mist Formation, the people inside were unable to leave, and the people outside were unable to enter.</p>
 <p>However, suddenly, a stranger appeared. It would be strange if they were not afraid.</p>
 <p>Goudan’er’s father pointed at Chu Feng and said, “Humph, you’re afraid, no? This person here is a god. He’s from the Holy Land of Martialism,”</p>
 <p>“Holy Land of Martialism? Impossible! Over the years, there have been a lot of people from the Holy Land of Martialism who wanted to pass through the Poison Mist Formation. However, when they fell down here, they were all corroded by the Poison Mist. Not a single person has managed to successfully pass through the Poison Mist alive,” The Poison Demon’s descendants did not wish to believe this fact.</p>
 <p>“You’re believing your own lies,” Chu Feng shook his head. He felt that the Poison Demon’s descendants were a bit laughable.</p>
 <p>“Regardless of where he came from, he must still be captured and handed to the clan chief to handle,” One of the men said.</p>
 <p>“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, a layer of boundless martial power surged forth. It turned into an enormous net and came toward Chu Feng. He was trying to use this net of martial power to capture Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng only smiled at the incoming net of martial power. He did not even move his body, and allowed that net of martial power to land onto him and tightly bind him.</p>
 <p>“Heh…” Seeing that he had successfully captured Chu Feng, that man revealed a complacent smile. Then, he hooked his finger at Chu Feng and wanted to pull him toward his side.</p>
 <p>“This…”</p>
 <p>However, after he hooked his finger, his expression immediately changed. He was shocked to discover that he seemed to have lost control his net of martial power, and it was not moving at all.</p>
 <p>“With merely this bit of ability, you want to capture me?” Chu Feng smiled again. As he spoke, his body trembled, and that net of martial power shattered.</p>
 <p>“You’re a Half Martial Emperor?” At this moment, the three men and two women were extremely terrified. They had managed to sense Chu Feng’s aura, and realized that his aura greatly surpassed their own, that it was the aura of a Half Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong, you all do not dare to capture me because I’m a Half Martial Emperor?”</p>
 <p>“Turns out that the Poison Demon’s descendants are actually nothing more than a bunch who bully the weak and fear the strong,” Chu Feng sneered.</p>
 <p>“Run away,” At this moment, the three men and two women did not dare to stay. They turned around and immediately started escaping.</p>
 <p>“Run? Where do you all plan to run to?” Chu Feng smiled coldly. He extended his palm and grabbed at the five people. Then, a frantic power surged forth and sucked the five people over to him.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>At the moment when the five of them were around ten meters from Chu Feng, the five of them all opened their mouths simultaneously. Five streams of purple poisonous gas shot toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>The poisonous gases were not ordinary poisons. The poison contained within them was very powerful. With their cultivation, they knew that they would be no match for a Half Martial Emperor by relying on martial power. However, if the purple poison that they had just shot out from their mouths landed on an ordinary rank one Half Martial Emperor, it would be able to kill that rank one Half Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>“Insignificant talent,” However, the person that they were facing right now was not an ordinary rank one Half Martial Emperor. Instead, it was Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>With a thought, golden-bright and dazzling world spirit power surged forth from Chu Feng. His spirit power turned into a defensive wall and completely blocked the poisonous gases shot forth by the five people.</p>
 <p>After stopping them, the spirit formation wall turned into five chains and bound the five people.</p>
 <p>“Wow! God is truly worthy to be called god. So amazing!’</p>
 <p>All of this was seen by the villagers. They had seen with their own eyes how the people who bullied them all the time were taken care of by Chu Feng and forced into submission in an instant. At this time, their eyes were filled with adoration.</p>
 <p>In fact, there were some excessive villagers who directly kneeled onto the ground and began to worship Chu Feng.</p>
