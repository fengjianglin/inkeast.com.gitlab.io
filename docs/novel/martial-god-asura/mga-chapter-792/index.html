 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 792 - Collecting Debts</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Crap, we were tricked!” At that instant, the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers all cursed in their hearts because they discovered that Murong Xun’s attack wasn’t meant for them, but for the people within the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when they noticed something was wrong, it was already too late. The ray of light had already burst deep into the palace, and made a huge boom</span><i><span style>.</span></i><span style> When the ray of light exploded, a destructive shock wave spread everywhere. Everyone who stood before the Demon Bestowal Slaughtering Formation were in absolute chaos by the strike.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In an instant, cries of pain rang out, and the wailing went on endlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those who suffered light injuries lost their arms or legs, and received serious wounds. Those who suffered heavy injuries had become a mash of flesh and blood. Some even became a large puddle of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, all of the Crippling Night Demon Sect experts within the underground palace, with the exception of the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers, were defeated!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ten old things, bring your lives over!” When the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers were stunned by that scene, Murong Xun trembled the spear in his hand and once again threw out a fierce attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The silver-coloured spear in his hand was akin to a swimming dragon. It was several times more ferocious than before, and in an instant, the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers were suppressed as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*swish swish* Just at that moment, Ya Fei and Murong Wan, who were initially hiding behind Murong Xun, both used quick bodily martial skills to circle around the battlefield of the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers, and entered the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dammit!” At that instant, the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers finally understood what Murong Xun’s intentions were.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, not a single one could be excluded from their formation. So, no one could leave. They could only stare as Ya Fei and Murong Wan, after simply taking care of the Ninth Immortal’s injuries, leapt one after the other into the tunnel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same moment, Chu Feng had already went down the vertical tunnel and arrived at another palace. Moreover, his eyes were attracted by everything inside the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that place, there was also a formation, and within that formation, there was a pitch-black sword as well. However, there was a different projection it gave. The pitch-black sword had might even more powerful than typical Martial Kings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Being placed there caused one’s soul to be deterred. One did not dare to desecrate it, and one would not even dare to go near it, as if it were your master, as if it could rule your destiny.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A Royal Armament! This is a true Royal Armament!” Chu Feng was extremely excited because he discovered that the one before him was completely different from the one Murong Xun had.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although they were both Royal Armaments, the two were on an absolutely different level. Perhaps it was as Old Liu said: the intelligence that a Royal Armament possessed varied, and its quality would thus vary as well. Quite evidently, this Royal Armament, as Old Liu said, was a top-quality one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Demon Sealing Sword… Is that your name?” Chu Feng took two steps forward, and saw the three words written on the pitch-black hilt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That font was very wild. It showed unruliness. It showed disdain, as if it looked down on everything in the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just by the three words alone, Chu Feng was able to determine that the person who made the Royal Armament was most definitely extremely outstanding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, Wuqing, you must have never thought you would land in my hands again, right?” But just at that moment, a mellifluous voice yet full of ridicule suddenly rang out behind Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Turning his head around, Chu Feng’s pupils abruptly shrank. In his eyes, unsuppressable fury rose, but soon, a hint of an evil smile subconsciously rose on Chu Feng’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very instant, the ones who appeared in front of Chu Feng were Ya Fei and Murong Wan who chased after him, the two wicked women who almost tortured him to death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ya Fei, Murong Wan, you actually dare to show yourselves before me again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Feng indifferently spoke, but as he did, he was gritting his teeth because he would never forget how those two women tortured him. Ya Fei especially. She had forcibly cut of one of his arms, and turned his body into a sieve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what if we show ourselves before you? Do you think we would be afraid?” Ya Fei smiled. Her alluring red lips showed her disdain towards Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ya Fei, don’t waste your breath. Behind him should be that Demon Bestowal Slaughtering Formation. We absolutely cannot let him activate it,” reminded Murong Wan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even without your reminder, I know what it is. However, rather than the Demon Bestowal Slaughtering Formation, I’m more interested in that Demon Sealing Sword. That is the Royal Armament of the head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect back then, titled as the strongest Royal Armament in the Eastern Sea Region.” Ya Fei cast her greedy gaze onto the Demon Sealing Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But soon after, she looked back at Chu Feng and said, “However, before that, I must torture this piece of garbage well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>*whoosh*</span></p>
 <p><span style>After speaking, Ya Fei abruptly took a step forward. As her two snow-white legs rebounded, she had dashed towards Chu Feng like light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*swish*</span></p>
 <p><span style>Simultaneously, as if afraid Ya Fei would be first, Murong Wan also leapt forward and directly went straight for Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, as he faced the two women who shot straight for him, Chu Feng was not only fearless, he even made a faint cold smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*swish* Just as they two neared him, a Spirit Formation Gate suddenly appeared in front of him. At the same time, a beautiful person also burst out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*whoosh whoosh* After that person appeared, she first extended two white hands, grabbing both Ya Fei’s and Murong Wan’s neck, then after a boom, slammed the two bewitching beauties onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Such an unexpected change caught Ya Fei and Murong Wan completely off guard. They were a bit stupefied. When they came to their senses and actually saw who the person behind them was, their eyes were widened and an indescribable expression of fear emerged onto their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You! It’s you! How is this possible?! Didn’t you already—”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had recognized the person who currently pressed them onto the floor and tightly gripped their necks. She was none other than the horrifying World Spirit who made a contract with Chu Feng and had extremely illogical fighting strength—Eggy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, they had clearly personally seen Eggy die. How could she possibly appear before themselves?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, two brats, I’m sure you didn’t expect I would still be alive, right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eggy lightly squinted her eyes and spoke with a sweet smile. In the past few days, she not only recuperated her body well, she even recovered her strength. That was also why Chu Feng had no fear as he faced Ya Fei and Murong Wan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wha-wha-what are you doing? If you dare harm me, my brother will not forgive you, nor will my father forgive you! Both you and Wuqing will die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Wan was truly afraid. Even as she spoke, her voice trembled. But, in a place like this, she had no choice but to use her brother’s and father’s name to scare Eggy, because she felt that was the only thing she could do for a chance to survive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After hearing those words, Eggy’s face with lightly knitted brows changed slightly, and she gradually released the hand which she used to grip Ya Fei’s and Murong Wan’s neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, both of them couldn’t help celebrating inside. A hint of a pleased smile rose on their faces—they thought that Eggy was afraid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, just at that moment, an extremely cold and fierce expression flashed onto Eggy’s beautiful face. Her arms suddenly waved, and with two bams, two extraordinarily loud slaps landed on their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You two bitches, what the hell are you asking that for? I am here to collect past debts!”</span></p>
