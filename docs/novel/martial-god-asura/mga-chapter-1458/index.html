 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1458 - The Truth Revealed</strong></p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng is a genius world spiritist and also a world spiritist who has contracted an Asura World Spirit. His potential in the field of world spirit techniques could be said to be unbounded.”</p>
 <p>“However, the thing I am thinking is, regardless of how talented one might be, if one’s moral quality is not good, then even if one were to become a grand world spiritist in the future, one would only cause harm and not benefit to the people.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, little friend Chu Feng, I am going to advise you here. One must behave with moral integrity. You must not, for the purpose of obtaining your goal, do anything foul and claim it to be fair,” Lin Kuxing said to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Senior, Chu Feng does not understand what you mean by those words,” Chu Feng had a calm expression. Even though he knew that Lin Kuxing had come to mock him, he still asked in a manner that was neither servile nor overbearing .</p>
 <p>“What I mean? Shouldn’t you know better than anyone else?”</p>
 <p>“Back in the Sealing Ancient Village, for the sake of winning against others in world spirit techniques, you engaged in cheating. This sort of behavior is completely shameless.”</p>
 <p>Lin Kuxing suddenly pointed to Chu Feng with his finger. With an extremely loud and clear voice, he shouted those words. He wanted everyone to know the matter of Chu Feng cheating in the Sealing Ancient Village.</p>
 <p>“Is this for real? With how powerful Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques are, he still cheated?”</p>
 <p>“That must be a misunderstanding. How could the younger generation of the Sealing Ancient Village be more powerful than Chu Feng?”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, the crowd immediately burst into an uproar and began to spiritedly discuss this matter. Even though it was Lin Kuxing who had said these words, they still did not believe it completely.</p>
 <p>After all, Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques were powerful to the point where even Lin Yezhou was no match for him. Thus, how could he possibly engage in cheating when competing against the people from the Sealing Ancient Village? This was truly unreasonable.</p>
 <p>Although the majority of the people didn’t believe this, Chu Feng’s gaze still flashed, and his pupils shrunk. He cursed in his heart, ‘This old fart is truly vile. He actually used this matter to smear my name. In order to attack me, he has used everything he can find. He is truly unworthy of his noble status.’</p>
 <p>“Lord Elder, could this be a misunderstanding?” The World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master spoke. It was evident that he did not believe in this matter.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Lord Elder, could this be a misunderstanding?” Following him, many other elders spoke too. They also did not believe in this matter.</p>
 <p>“I, Lin, am never one to speak without thinking. Nor am I someone who would wrongly accuse another. This matter truly happened. There are a lot of people who witnessed this happening in the Sealing Ancient Village.”</p>
 <p>“Coincidentally, the Sealing Ancient Village’s Village Chief Ma is also present in our World Spiritist Alliance as a guest today. We will know whether this matter is true or not if we are to ask him,” Lin Kuxing looked to Village Chief Ma that was in sitting in the guest seat.</p>
 <p>At this moment, everyone turned their gaze to Village Chief Ma. They all knew that Village Chief Ma was a world spiritist with high seniority and was very famous for his good moral quality. Thus, they did not think that Village Chief Ma would lie.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Village Chief Ma had a rather calm appearance. He first picked up a tea cup from the honored guests table and lightly took a sip of the tea within it. Then, he stood up and said, “This matter has indeed happened.”</p>
 <p>“Heavens! This is actually real?” Hearing those words, the crowd once again burst into an uproar. Everyone displayed expressions of extreme shock.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Lin Kuxing had a brimming smile of complacence on his face. He also turned his gaze to Chu Feng. He wanted to see Chu Feng’s ugly and shameful expression.</p>
 <p>However, to his disappointment, Chu Feng still had a very calm expression on his face. He was not at all affected by this matter.</p>
 <p>‘This brat, could it be that he doesn’t know what fear is?’</p>
 <p>‘Or could it be that he’s truly so thick-skinned and shameless that nothing scares him?’</p>
 <p>Seeing Chu Feng’s calm appearance, Lin Kuxing started to mutter in his heart. If what he had done was unable to affect Chu Feng, he would have done all of this in vain.</p>
 <p>However, upon thinking, he managed to calm himself again. No matter how thick-skinned Chu Feng might be, no matter how unaffected he was by the viewpoints of others, Chu Feng’s popularity in the World Spiritist Alliance would most definitely be badly affected by this matter. As such, he would have, at the very least, managed to successfully defame Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, not only was this a blow to Chu Feng, this would also indirectly help his grandson Lin Yezhou. After all, there was no scandal regarding his grandson. Thus, this would be killing two birds with one stone. The more Lin Kuxing thought about it, the more pleased he became. He was so overly happy that he wished that he could laugh out loud right now.</p>
 <p>‘You damned little bastard, you are truly too inexperienced. If this old man wishes to ruin you, I can ruin you at any time.’ After feeling extremely good because of the deed he had just performed, Lin Kuxing sneered in his heart.</p>
 <p>However, the very next moment, Village Chief Ma said the following words, which completely shattered all the feeling of superiority, all of the feeling of joy, that Lin Kuxing was experiencing right now. And in their place was a feeling of extreme displeasure.</p>
 <p>“Everyone, please listen to me. It was me who declared that little friend Chu Feng had cheated to obtain victory in our Sealing Ancient Village that day.”</p>
 <p>“This matter is absolutely true and was witnessed by many people. This old man had indeed declared that.”</p>
 <p>“However, today, I wish to use this opportunity to announce the truth to everyone. That is… I had wrongly accused little friend Chu Feng that day.”</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng had not cheated at all. It was I who had wrongly accused him in order to preserve our Sealing Ancient Village’s honor,” Old Village Chief Ma said with a loud voice.</p>
 <p>“Village Chief Ma had wrongly accused Chu Feng?” Once Village Chief Ma said those words, the crowd once again burst into an uproar. This news was truly too explosively shocking. It came like a thunderclap and exploded in the minds of the crowd, leaving them unable to remain calm.</p>
 <p>However, as for the person that was feeling the most complicated right now, it would naturally be Lin Yezhou. No matter what, he had never thought that Village Chief Ma would say this sort of thing.</p>
 <p>“Village Chief Ma, you are a chief of a village. You must not, by any means, lie through your teeth,” Feeling extremely displeased, Lin Yezhou spoke coldly. Within his words were traces of a threat.</p>
 <p>“I, Ma, have always been a straightforward and upright individual. In my entire life, I have only told a single lie. As for that, it was the time when I wrongly accused little friend Chu Feng.” Village Chief Ma did not fear Lin Kuxing’s threat. As he said these words, he turned to Chu Feng and said, “Little friend Chu Feng, I’m sorry. It is this old man who was seeking selfish profit and wrongly accused you.”</p>
 <p>“I know that I am not qualified to ask for your forgiveness. However, I must still apologize to you.”</p>
 <p>“Today, I must return justice to you, return to you your innocence.”</p>
 <p>After Village Chief Ma said those words, with a ‘putt,’ he knelt onto the ground. Before all these people, he kneeled to apologize to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Village Chief Ma, what are you doing? This is merely a trivial matter. Chu Feng truly did not take it to heart. Village Chief Ma, there is no need for you to do this,” Seeing that, Chu Feng immediately hurried to Old Village Chief Ma and helped support him up.</p>
 <p>Back then, Chu Feng had indeed blamed Old Village Chief Ma. However, after he had gotten to know him, Chu Feng had already come to know what sort of person he was. He knew that Old Village Chief Ma was not a bad person. Instead, he was an extremely good person with high moral quality. Thus, Chu Feng had wholeheartedly considered him to be a senior.</p>
 <p>As matters stood, it no longer mattered to Chu Feng whether or not Old Village Chief Ma cleared his name. After all, if Old Village Chief Ma were to clear his name, then Old Village Chief Ma’s great reputation that he had preserved through his entire life would be ruined. Chu Feng had not wished for this to happen.</p>
 <p>However, never had he thought that Old Village Chief Ma would still do it for the sake of his reputation. Not only that, he had even publicly acknowledged his mistake. While this had deeply moved Chu Feng, it had also caused him to feel extremely bad for Old Village Chief Ma; so much so that he didn’t know what to do.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, I know that you are a magnanimous person and will not bicker with this old man about that matter. However, I must still return your innocence to you. This is what I had promised you back then. I am a person that will always keep my word. Else, this old man would not be able to live the rest of his life in peace.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, aged tears rolled down Old Village Chief Ma’s face. It was evident that this matter had been a stone in his heart the entire time, that it had been causing him extreme suffocation and pain the entire time. And now, he was finally able to let go of it.</p>
 <p>Although the revealing of the truth would preserve Chu Feng’s reputation, it would also ruin his. However, even with this being the case, he still had no regrets.</p>
 <p>That was because, to Old Village Chief Ma, only by revealing the truth could he free himself. Otherwise, this matter would continue to press down on his heart and cause him to be unable to lift his head for the rest of his life.</p>
 <p>“This…”</p>
 <p>When Old Village Chief Ma said those words, he stunned everyone present. Not only did they get to know the truth, they also got to know about Chu Feng’s personal charisma.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng possessed a charisma that was able to make the Village Chief of the Sealing Ancient Village willingly renounce his own reputation, to publicly apologize and admit his mistake.</p>
 <p>Perhaps this sort of charisma was something that he had been born with. Perhaps it was something that he had acquired. However, undoubtedly, it was something that many people present did not possess. Yet, Chu Feng possessed this sort of charisma.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the gazes with which the crowd looked to Chu Feng had all changed. Not only did they not start to have a bad impression of Chu Feng because of this matter, they instead had a whole new level of respect for him. The favorable impression that they had toward Chu Feng increased by many times over.</p>
 <p>They all knew that the World Spiritist Alliance had truly picked up a treasure this time around. Chu Feng joining them was most definitely an extremely fortunate matter for the World Spiritist Alliance.</p>
