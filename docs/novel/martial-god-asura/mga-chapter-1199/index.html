 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1199 - Definitely Related</strong></p>
 <p>After hearing what Elder Shi said, Chu Feng was even more shocked and his heartbeat that was already rapidly beating started to beat even more intensely.</p>
 <p>The Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield resembled the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash so greatly. As long as one had some brains, one should be able to tell that there was some sort of connection between the two Earthen Taboo Martial Skills.</p>
 <p>If the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield was an incomplete fragment, then could the completed version be related to the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash? Or could it be that both the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield and the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash were incomplete fragments and could only be considered to be complete should one unite them both?</p>
 <p>“Never would I have imagined that this Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield would have such an origin. However, I still wish to attempt it,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, I urge you to consider it again. This Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield, even if you are to master it, it would not be of much use. Rather than wasting time on it, it is better for you to learn another Martial Skill that is more suited for you,” Elder Shi patiently advised Chu Feng against it. He was really thinking for Chu Feng’s sake. He feared that Chu Feng would follow the footsteps of those seniors.</p>
 <p>“Elder Shi, I thank you for your good intentions. However, I truly wish to give it a try. Elder Shi, I wish you could allow me to attempt it.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng firmly believed that this Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield was definitely related to his Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash. Thus, he would not allow himself to miss this opportunity.</p>
 <p>A might comparable to that of Heaven Taboo Martial Skills, it was something that anyone would wish to obtain. Thus, Chu Feng was naturally not an exception.</p>
 <p>“Sigh. Since this is the case, I’ll allow you to do it.” Faced with Chu Feng’s determination, Elder Shi sighed. However, he immediately took out the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield afterwards. But, he did not hand it directly to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Instead, he began to set up a special unsealing formation and placed it onto the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield. Only after he unsealed the concealment formation on the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield did he hand it over to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng received the Taboo Martial Skill from Elder Shi, he inspected it with his thoughts. Immediately, an enormous amount of information flowed out from the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield and entered his mind.</p>
 <p>“This Martial Skill…” After all of the contents of this Martial Skill entered into Chu Feng’s mind, even someone like Chu Feng started to frown.</p>
 <p>That was because he discovered that the cultivation method for this Martial Skill was truly strange; it was as if it was indeed lacking something. In short, it’s difficulty was actually greatly superior than the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash. It was definitely the most difficult Taboo Martial Skill that Chu Feng had ever seen.</p>
 <p>No wonder the countless seniors of the Cyanwood Mountain who had attempted to learn this Martial Skill had either failed or exhausted a great deal of time in order to learn it.</p>
 <p>This Martial Skill was very difficult for even Chu Feng and it would require a lot of effort and time from him in order to learn it.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, it is truly difficult to learn this Martial Skill. However, since you insisted on learning it, it is unbefitting for me to try to stop you. Instead, I am able to give you some advice that might help you.”</p>
 <p>“Actually, after all those past seniors of ours have tried to learn this Martial Skill, they have managed to come up with a cultivation method for it. This Martial Skill is actually related to one item in our Cyanwood Mountain. If you wish to learn this Martial Skill, you must do it through that item. As for that item, it is something that you’ve come in contact with before,” Elder Shi advised.</p>
 <p>“I’ve come in contact with before? This junior is slow-witted, I do not know what item Elder Shi is speaking of. Elder, please tell me what exactly it is,” Chu Feng was truly unable to think of what the item might be. When had he ever came in contact with something related to the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield?</p>
 <p>“Firmament Medicinal Herb,” Elder Shi said.</p>
 <p>“Firmament Medicinal Herb?” Chu Feng was shocked by those words.</p>
 <p>He naturally knew about the Firmament Medicinal Herbs. In fact, Chu Feng had thought before that the Firmament Medicinal Herbs might have a special relationship with his Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash. After all, their names resembled each other so much.</p>
 <p>However, after close examination, Chu Feng did not discover anything special about the Firmament Medicinal Herbs, much less any relation to his Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash.</p>
 <p>“Hah, I’m certain you’ve only thought that the Firmament Medicinal Herb is an ordinary medicinal herb.”</p>
 <p>“However, it’s most definitely not what it is. The Firmament Medicinal Herbs contain Firmament Energy. While the Firmament Energy is extremely useful for concocting medicine, it could even be used to craft weapons. Merely, the Firmament Energy needs to be extracted and refined in order to be used. If it is not extracted and refined, it is simply impossible for one to discover it.”</p>
 <p>“Aren’t you very familiar with Elder Wei of the Medicine Concocting Department? His Medicine Concocting Department is a place that specializes in extracting the Firmament Energy from the Firmament Medicinal Herbs. If you wish to learn this Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield, you could try to go to the Medicine Concocting Department,” Elder Shi said.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Elder Shi, for your advice. You have truly helped me greatly.” Chu Feng said these words from the bottom of his heart. Had it not been for Elder Shi’s advice, he would never have known that the Firmament Medicinal Herbs were related to the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, at this moment, Chu Feng believed even more firmly that this Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield should have an enormous relationship with his Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash.</p>
 <p>That was because, while he didn’t know about other things, he knew quite a bit about Firmament Energy.</p>
 <p>For it was in the introduction of the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash:</p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">EARTHEN TABOO—FIRMAMENT SLASH.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">CREATED BY EMPEROR FIRMAMENT AT THE AGE OF TWO THOUSAND.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">CONJURING ENERGY OF THE FIRMAMENTS, GRANTING POWER TO BRING RUIN TO THE WORLD.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">IT IS WORK OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY WITHIN EARTHEN TABOO MARTIAL SKILLS.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Not only did the introduction of the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash clearly state its origins, it also stated the method to train it. As for the Firmament Energy, it was the essence of the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash.</p>
 <p>However, the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield was different. While the method to learn it was present, the concept behind it was extremely vague. Even the contents of the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield were very vague.</p>
 <p>However, after he heard what Elder Shi said, Chu Feng realized that this Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield was the same as his Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash, requiring Firmament Energy.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, although the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield’s origin was unknown, the description of its might was extremely terrifying.</p>
 <p>In the contents of the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield, there was a sentence that was precisely the same as the introduction given by Elder Shi.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">EARTHEN TABOO—FIRMAMENT SHIELD</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">WITH DEFENSE AS OFFENSE AND OFFENSE AS DEFENSE</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">WHEN MASTERED, GRANTS THE POWER TO BRING RUIN TO THE WORLD</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">COMPARABLE TO HEAVEN TABOO MARTIAL SKILLS</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Although the introductions for the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield and the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash were different, there were identical similarities. From this, Chu Feng felt even more that these two Martial Skills might have been created by the same person, the so-called Emperor Firmament.</p>
 <p>However, whether the complement of these two Martial Skills could really match that of a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill was something that Chu Feng would only know after he mastered this Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng did not linger around; after he bid farewell to Elder Shi, he directly left the place. The reason for this was because the outside of his Asura Division was packed with people. As the head of the Asura Division, Chu Feng could not linger around without doing anything about it. In fact, the reason why he had come to accept his rewards was also for his Asura Division.</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng left, another elder of the Martial Skills Department asked Elder Shi, “Lord Elder, why didn’t you have Chu Feng join our Martial Skills Department? This child already possesses astonishing talent at his young age. Furthermore, his character is very calm and unflustered, he is truly a rare sapling,”</p>
 <p>“It is true that this child possesses astonishing talent. Unfortunately, I’ve discovered him too late.”</p>
 <p>“Old Wei’s luck is better than mine. He discovered this good sapling before me. Furthermore, during Chu Feng’s moment of crisis, he stood forward and helped him greatly.”</p>
 <p>“I am able to tell that Chu Feng is not someone who seeks personal gain before everything else. Instead, he is someone who would repay kindnesses shown to him. This is something that could be seen by his rejection of the Punishment Department.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, it is not by chance that the Punishment Department has been rejected by him. Rather, it is within reason.”</p>
 <p>“If I am to invite Chu Feng to join our Martial Skills Department, all I would do is make things difficult for him. Instead of that, it is better for me to do what I just did. Perhaps in the future, we might even be able to gain an intimate relationship with him,” said Elder Shi.</p>
 <p>“It is truly Lord Elder who is wise.” After hearing those words, the other elder finally came to a realization. As Chu Feng was a person who repaid kindness shown to him, inviting Chu Feng to join them was no easy task, as his heart was already affiliated with Elder Wei, and he had already planned to join the Medicine Concocting Department.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng did not know of the discussion between the two elders. After he received his final reward, he returned to his own residence.</p>
 <p>Merely, this was his new residence, an extremely luxurious territory. This territory could be considered to be a top-notch territory in the entire core region of the Cyanwood Mountain. At the very least, among the disciples, there were not many people who possessed a territory like this.</p>
 <p>After he arrived at his new residence, Chu Feng personally hung the signboard of the Asura Division over the entrance gates. This place was going to become the new headquarters of the Asura Division.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Chu Feng spread the news that he would be opening the gates of the Asura Division to recruit new members in two days’ time. Anyone who wanted to join the Asura Division were allowed to participate in the evaluation. As long as one passed the evaluation, then, regardless of age or where one might be from, they would be given the chance to become a member of the Asura Division.</p>
 <p>Of course, there was an exception to this -- the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s disciples. They were not required to undergo any evaluation. As long as they were willing, they could immediately become members of the Asura Division.</p>
 <p>The protection of his Southern Cyanwood Forest’s disciples was Chu Feng’s second mission in the Cyanwood Mountain.</p>
 <p>As for his first mission, that was even more important.</p>
 <p>Strictly speaking, it was not a mission. Instead, it should be said to be a purpose, Chu Feng’s true purpose in coming to the Cyanwood Mountain was the treasure that contained a large amount of cultivation resources that was hidden within the Cyanwood Mountain.</p>
 <p>If this treasure were to truly exist, if it was truly the same as what it was recorded to be, and if it was truly possible for Chu Feng to obtain it, then Chu Feng’s cultivation would definitely advance by leaps and bounds in an instant.</p>
