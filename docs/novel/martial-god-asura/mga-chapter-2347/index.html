 <p><strong> Chapter 2347 - Must Take Revenge</strong></p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at the moment when the crystal giant was about to approach the World Spiritist Saintess, the key that Xiaoshi had turned into emitted a layer of light that covered the World Spiritist Saintess.</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~”</p>
 <p>Following closely after that, the four crystal giant’s powerful fists ferociously smashed onto that layer of light.</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~”</p>
 <p>In an instant, surging energy ripples began to scatter in all directions. The might of the attack was so powerful that it seemed to be capable of devouring everything.</p>
 <p>The energy ripples were so powerful that they were capable of instantly killing Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, there were many powerful experts present. Before the energy ripples could approach, they were blocked by peak Martial Ancestor-level experts.</p>
 <p>However, to the crowd’s surprise, even after a series of attacks from the Martial Ancestor-level crystal giants, that layer of light remained completely undamaged.</p>
 <p>Not only did that layer of light protect the World Spiritist Saintess, it had also managed to block the attacks from peak Martial Ancestors.</p>
 <p>“Damn it!”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong were tightly clenching their fists.</p>
 <p>They were already able to tell that layer of light was no small matter. Unless there was a True Immortal-level expert present, it was likely no one would be able to breach it.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha. Chu Feng, oh Chu Feng, regardless of how powerful your methods might be, you still can't kill me.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, that’s right. I nearly forgot, it seems that this Gate Opening Key possessed quite a relationship with you. For you to be unwilling to kill him, it would seem that he should be your friend, right?”</p>
 <p>“Unfortunately for you, your friend is currently helping me. Hahahaha.”</p>
 <p>“You grew furious because your friend was killed. However, that friend of yours instead decided to help me. I truly wonder, how are you feeling right now?” The World Spiritist Saintess laughed mockingly. Her appearance was truly one of someone lost in joy, someone utterly shameless.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, catch,” Right at that moment, Zhao Hong tossed the sack she carried behind her back to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Upon receiving that sack, the corner of Chu Feng’s mouth lifted into a strange curve. He said to the World Spiritist Saintess, “Did you really think that there’s nothing I can do about you?”</p>
 <p>“You’re implying that you can do something?” The World Spiritist Saintess laughed with contempt. She did not believe that Chu Feng would be able to do anything to her.</p>
 <p>“Get the hell out here!!!”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng opened the sack and tossed it onto the ground. Immediately, four fat sphere-like giants rolled out from the sack.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing those four, the expression on the World Spiritist Saintess’ face immediately changed. The pride that she had displayed earlier disappeared completely, and was instead replaced with astonishment.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because those four sphere-like things were her sons, the Four World Spiritist Emperors.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing their mother, the Four World Spiritist Emperors reacted as if they had seen their savior. Immediately, they shouted, “Lady Mother, save us!”</p>
 <p>“Lay on the ground!” Right at that moment, Chu Feng shouted. Then, the four crystal giants emitted overwhelming oppressive might, and forced the Four World Spiritist Emperors onto the ground like four dying dogs.</p>
 <p>In response, the World Spiritist Saintess shouted, “Stop!”</p>
 <p>“That is not up to you to decide,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, exactly what do you want?” The World Spiritist Saintess asked anxiously.</p>
 <p>“Hand over the Gate Opening Key. Else, I will take the dog lives of your sons.”</p>
 <p>“You dare?!!!” The World Spiritist Saintess said.</p>
 <p>“Kill them,” Chu Feng declared.</p>
 <p>Once those words were said, the four crystal giants immediately unleashed overwhelming killing intent.</p>
 <p>“Stop!” The World Spiritist Saintess shouted. At the same time, she tossed out the Gate Opening Key that she held.</p>
 <p>“Paa~~~”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng extended his hand and grabbed the Gate Opening Key.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the World Spiritist Saintess lost the layer of defensive power that had previously covered her.</p>
 <p>However, compared to her own safety, the World Spiritist Saintess was more worried about the safety of her four sons. Her body shifted, and she arrived before the Four World Spiritist Emperors, shielding them behind her.</p>
 <p>Seeing that scene, Chu Feng’s heart was moved.</p>
 <p>Even though the World Spiritist Saintess was a shameless and despicable individual that would not shrink from any crime, what she displayed right now was the appearance of a mother who was willing to give up everything to protect her children.</p>
 <p>Motherly love. Regardless of what sort of individual the World Spiritist Saintess might be, she revealed the greatness of a mother to her four sons.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng was touched. After all, what he wanted to feel the most in his entire life was motherly love.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng recalled the mother that he did not know of.</p>
 <p>“Lady Mother, quickly, avenge us and kill those three animals!”</p>
 <p>“Those crystal giants were supposed to be ours. It was them who snatched them from us,” Ignorant of the situation, the Four World Spiritist Emperors began to cry with weeping tears toward their mother, demanding that she avenge them.</p>
 <p>“Shut up!” The World Spiritist Saintess shouted in a disappointed manner. However, she did not punish her sons too excessively. Instead, she said to Chu Feng, “Chu Feng, if you want to kill someone, then go ahead and kill me. This matter is unrelated to them. Please spare them.”</p>
 <p>“As you wish,” said Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong. As they spoke, they planned to order their crystal giants to attack.</p>
 <p>However, right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly shouted, “Wait!”</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang were confused.</p>
 <p>“Let it pass. We can settle this debt in the future. Let’s spare their lives today,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Mn?” Chu Feng’s words shocked not only Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang, but even the bystanders.</p>
 <p>They were all able to tell that Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong had thoroughly set up grudges with the World Spiritist Saintess.</p>
 <p>If Chu Feng did not seize this opportunity to kill the World Spiritist Saintess, she would become a danger in the future.</p>
 <p>The people present were all shrewd and ruthless individuals. If they were Chu Feng, they would definitely not leave the World Spiritist Saintess alive either. Thus, they were confused as to why Chu Feng, who was overwhelming with killing intent, would decide to not kill the World Spiritist Saintess now.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, what are you doing? You cannot become soft-hearted at a time like this,” Her Lady Queen’s voice sounded in Chu Feng’s ears.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, give me a reason why I shouldn’t kill her,” Zhao Hong said.</p>
 <p>“There are two reasons why I will spare her today.”</p>
 <p>“Firstly, we only managed to make her hand over the Gate Opening Key and lose the ability to protect herself because she was eager to protect her sons.”</p>
 <p>“Secondly, we only managed to obtain the crystal giants that are capable of killing her this quickly because we utilized the spirit formation that she set up.”</p>
 <p>“I do not want to kill her today because I do not want to take advantage of her,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“B-brother, s-since that’s the case, I’ll do as you say,” Wang Qiang said frankly. At that moment, Zhao Hong did not bother to say anymore.</p>
 <p>However, the hearts of the people present were all moved. They finally realized that Chu Feng was sparing the World Spiritist Saintess not because he was being lenient. Rather, it was because he was someone who possessed a baseline and principles.</p>
 <p>Thus, at that moment, the crowd came to understand Chu Feng’s reason for releasing the tiger back into the mountain. At that moment, they felt more admiration toward Chu Feng. This admiration that they felt was unrelated to Chu Feng’s talent. Rather, it was toward Chu Feng’s courage.</p>
 <p>After all, compared to killing an enemy, sparing one’s enemy at the time when one could kill them was something even more courageous.</p>
 <p>That was something that not even the grand characters present might be able to accomplish.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, don’t you think that I will be grateful toward you just because you’ve decided not to kill me.”</p>
 <p>“Those crystal giants are merely spirit formations. Sooner or later, they will disappear. While they are able to protect you for now, they are unable to protect you forever. The next time we meet, I will definitely not spare you,” The World Spiritist Saintess threatened with a cold voice. She displayed the hatred that she felt toward Chu Feng without hiding anything.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he started to smile lightly. He said to her, “Rest assured, just because I spared you today does not mean that I will spare you forever. I will definitely avenge Xiaoshi!!!”</p>
