 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1580 - Ancient Era’s Scroll</strong></p>
 <p>“Little bastard, I’m going to exterminate you!!!”</p>
 <p>Once Chu Feng said those words, he was immediately met with overflowing killing intent from Old Daoist Ghost Face.</p>
 <p>“Heh…”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had a smile on his face, and completely ignored Old Daoist Ghost Face’s threat. He waved his sleeve again, and the concealment formation disappeared completely.</p>
 <p>Merely, after that concealment formation disappeared, another golden-bright and dazzling spirit formation appeared before Chu Feng’s sight.</p>
 <p>Merely, compared to the concealment formation earlier, this spirit formation was a lot stronger. Even Chu Feng’s eyes shone upon seeing it.</p>
 <p>That was because this spirit formation was an unsealing formation, an extremely powerful unsealing formation. It was not only powerful because it had been set up by a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. Rather, this spirit formation itself was already extremely powerful. It was simply impossible for ordinary world spiritists to be able to grasp this spirit formation. Even if they did, it would be extremely hard for them to set it up.</p>
 <p>Merely through seeing this world spirit formation, Chu Feng realized how extraordinary that Old Daoist Ghost Face was. He could be said to be an elite existence among all the world spiritists present in the Holy Land of Martialism. If given sufficient time, it would not be impossible for him to become a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist in the future.</p>
 <p>The reason why this unsealing formation was here was because it was currently unraveling a protection formation. Inside that protection formation was an item. It was an ancient scroll.</p>
 <p>The ancient aura being emitted by the scroll was very extraordinary. From a glance, Chu Feng could immediately tell that this scroll was likely something from the Ancient Era. It was most likely placed here by the Weaponry Refinement Immortal as a reward to the crowd.</p>
 <p>However, it was clear that this reward was not that easily attainable. That was because there was a very powerful spirit formation protecting the scroll.</p>
 <p>Everything that Old Daoist Ghost Face had done was for the sake of breaking that protection formation and obtaining the scroll. Furthermore, at this moment, he had managed to make some headway.</p>
 <p>“That Old Daoist Ghost Face’s spirit formation is very powerful. However, it will still take some time for it to break open the protective formation. Allow me to lend you a helping hand.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, his arms began to move about. Layer upon layer of spirit power turned into numerous runes and symbols as they entered the Old Daoist Ghost Face’s unsealing formation.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was planning to take over Old Daoist Ghost Face’s spirit formation, and then use it to rapidly open the Weaponry Refinement Immortal’s protective formation.</p>
 <p>“Little bastard, you’re actually planning to take over my spirit formation for your own usage? You’re truly shameless to the extreme!”</p>
 <p>That Old Daoist Ghost Face’s reaction was very sharp. He was immediately aware that Chu Feng was trying to take over his spirit formation. He flew into a violent rage and began shouting angrily at Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Shameless? I couldn’t possibly compare with you in that,” Chu Feng sneered and then continued on with trying to take over that unsealing formation.</p>
 <p>“Ji, ji, ji, ji ~~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, snarls sounded from the spirit formation. Then, snake-like substances shot out explosively from it. Their speed was so fast that they landed on Chu Feng’s body in an instant, and wrapped themselves around him completely. Furthermore, they also began to bite Chu Feng. Their strength was extremely strong. They were simply planning to tear Chu Feng to shreds.</p>
 <p>The spirit formation set up by that Old Daoist Ghost Face actually contained this sort of function, a trap to prevent others from taking over.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, little bastard, did you really think that this old man’s spirit formation was something that you could touch? This is what you get for doing that,” That Old Daoist Ghost Face ridiculed.</p>
 <p>It turned out that he had deliberately been pretending to be nervous earlier. His intention had been for Chu Feng to lower his guard so that he would fall for his trap.</p>
 <p>“Heh… insignificant talent.”</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng merely sneered. Then, without even moving, countless blades formed by spirit formations shot out from his body.</p>
 <p>“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>The blades shone, and looked like flower blossoms. The trap of snakes was sliced apart by the golden blades. One by one, they fell from Chu Feng’s body.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng increased the strength of the spirit power that he was instilling into Old Daoist Ghost Face’s spirit formation. Soon, he had completely severed it from Old Daoist Ghost Face’s control. Then, he replaced the severed control with his own spirit power, and took over the spirit formation completely.</p>
 <p>“How could this be? Your world spirit techniques have actually reached this high of a level?”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Old Daoist Ghost Face was in utter disbelief. Never did he expect that Chu Feng, someone with only the cultivation of rank eight Martial King, would possess such a powerful level of battle power with world spirit techniques. Chu Feng’s battle power with world spirit techniques was a lot more frightening than his own.</p>
 <p>This was an extremely difficult thing to accept for Old Daoist Ghost Face, someone who had considered himself to be a genius world spiritist. In an instant, a sound of disbelief began to resonate from his mouth.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng ignored him completely. He began to use the Old Daoist Ghost Face’s spirit formation, as well as his own techniques, to wholeheartedly break that protective formation. He wished to obtain that Ancient Era’s Scroll as quickly as possible.</p>
 <p>“It’s useless. You will not be able to break that spirit formation. This old man has used many days to break it apart, but has still not managed to do so. You are merely an Insect Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, it is definitely impossible for you to break it apart.”</p>
 <p>“Just you wait. After this old man finishes taking care of this unfilial disciple, I’ll go and take care of you, little bastard. In the meantime, I might as well conveniently enjoy those three girls. Hahaha. Those three little beauties are all more beautiful than Nangong Yue. This old man is truly fortunate today,” Old Daoist Ghost Face uttered a shameless laugh.</p>
 <p>“Old animal, I’ll dismember your body into ten thousand pieces!!!!” Right at this moment, Nangong Ya’s voice that contained overflowing killing intent sounded once again. That was because the Nangong Yue that Old Daoist Ghost Face had spoken of was precisely his late older sister.</p>
 <p>“Unfilial disciple, did you really think that you would be able to dismember my body into ten thousand pieces? The person who’s going to die today is you.” Old Daoist Ghost Face was not to be outdone. Facing Nangong Ya’s fierce attacks, not only did he not dodge, he instead unleashed fierce attacks toward him himself.</p>
 <p>“I’ve truly underestimated that Old Daoist Ghost Face. If this is to continue, Nangong Ya might not necessarily be a match for him.”</p>
 <p>Even though Chu Feng wasn’t in the range of the battle, he was not far away from it. Since the Old Daoist Ghost Face was able to detect Chu Feng’s every movement, Chu Feng was naturally also able to detect OId Daoist Ghost Face’s every movement.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng discovered that that Old Daoist Ghost Face was very hard to deal with. He was able to block Nangong Ya’s attacks using only world spirit techniques, and was unleashing counterattacks at Nangong Ya nonstop. Even though Nangong Ya’s killing intent was soaring, he was unable to do anything to that Old Daoist Ghost Face, and had actually entered a disadvantaged state.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, should I go and help him?” Right at this moment, a voice transmission sounded in Chu Feng’s ears. It was Tantai Xue.</p>
 <p>Tantai Xue had been watching the battle between the two people the entire time. Seeing that Nangong Ya was unable to take care of Old Daoist Ghost Face, Tantai Xue also wished to help. After all, as Nangong Ya was still not defeated, it would be much more beneficial to attack that Old Daoist Ghost Face together.</p>
 <p>“Go ahead. However, you must be careful. Do not try too hard,” Chu Feng replied.</p>
 <p>“Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom~~~”</p>
 <p>Right after Chu Feng’s voice sounded, explosions began to be heard nonstop. Tantai Xue had unleashed her attacks. Tantai Xue’s attacks were truly no small matter. She had directly used her Divine Power. Her cultivation of rank two Half Martial Emperor was directly increased to rank three Half Martial Emperor. Furthermore, she took out a bamboo flute. That flute was an Incomplete Imperial Armament. Furthermore, it was not a copy, but rather an actual Incomplete Imperial Armament. It was the Talismanic Soul Stealing Flute she had obtained from the Cursed Soil Sect.</p>
 <p>With that Incomplete Imperial Armament in hand, Tantai Xue had reduced the gap in strength between her, Nangong Ya and that Old Daoist Ghost Face.</p>
 <p>“That Tantai Xue is actually this powerful?!”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Nangong Baihe was still standing beside the battle. She had a stunned expression on her face as she looked at the snowflakes that covered the entire sky, as well as the bamboo flute in Tantai Xue’s hand that was sending out explosive talismans the entire time.</p>
 <p>She discovered that not only did Chu Feng possess heaven-defying strength, Chu Feng’s companion Tantai Xue also possessed heaven-defying strength. She had truly been blind before to underestimate them so much.</p>
