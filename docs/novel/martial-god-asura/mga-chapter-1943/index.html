 <p><strong> Chapter 1943 - Things Have Changed</strong></p>
 <p>It turned out that the Ancient Era’s Elves had requested reinforcements the moment the Blood Devouring Killing Formation had been destroyed.</p>
 <p>After the Elf King received that cry for reinforcements, he personally led the Ancient Era’s Elves’ army and hurried over. The request he had received did not mention the Dark Hall. However, he had a faint feeling that this matter was related to the Dark Hall.</p>
 <p>Thus, even though they had rushed over immediately with all the speed they could muster, they were still too late.</p>
 <p>Fortunately… Chu Feng and Xian Miaomiao were still alive.</p>
 <p>After they found Xian Miaomiao, the Ancient Era’s Elves’ army came to know about Chu Feng setting up the spirit formation to undo Eggy’s seal. Thus, they did not try to disturb Chu Feng, and instead guarded this place the entire time.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, I already know about what had happened here.”</p>
 <p>“I hope that you do not burden yourself with what has happened here. After all, wars are always cruel.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, this is not your fault. Instead, this is the fault of the Dark Hall,” The Elf King said to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“But, Elf King, that Dark Hall’s Hall Master, he…” Chu Feng wanted to say that the Dark Hall’s Hall Master possessed the same Inherited Bloodline as his own, that it was very possible that the Dark Hall’s Hall Master was someone from his clan, and that this matter was ultimately related to him.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, I already know about everything. Each person possesses their own thoughts. You are not required to take responsibility for the faults of others.”</p>
 <p>“However, the Dark Hall’s actions this time around are clearly a declaration of war against us Ancient Era’s Elves. As such, I will definitely not leave this matter be.”</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, you should be standing on our side, right?” The Elf King asked.</p>
 <p>At that moment, all of the Ancient Era’s Elves’ experts turned their gazes to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“The hatred between the Dark Hall and I is absolutely irreconcilable. If possible, I want to personally kill the Dark Hall’s Hall Master,” Chu Feng said those words while gnashing his teeth in anger.</p>
 <p>“Very well,” The Elf King smiled. Then, he asked, “What do you plan to do now?”</p>
 <p>“I plan to make a trip to the Cyanwood Mountain,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Mn,” The Elf King nodded. Then, he said to a very tall yet very thin Grand Elder behind him, “Lord Lianghua, I’ll trouble you with protecting the Cyanwood Mountain for me.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, Your Majesty,” That Grand Elder said.</p>
 <p>“Your Majesty, this is?” Chu Feng was extremely shocked.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, I have already heard about the things relating to you. The people closest to you are gathered in the Cyanwood Mountain. That place will become your weak spot.”</p>
 <p>“Even though Nangong Longjian and the Compass Immortal are there, I believe you already know how strong the Dark Hall is.”</p>
 <p>“When even the World Devastator Immortal is willing to work for the Dark Hall, Nangong Longjian is simply unable to protect the Cyanwood Mountain by himself. If something were to happen to the Cyanwood Mountain, I believe you would become extremely worried and troubled.”</p>
 <p>“As for Lord Lianghua, he is a rank eight Martial Emperor.”</p>
 <p>“Even if it is the World Devastator Immortal, he would not dare to act too impudent before Lord Lianghua. With Lord Lianghua protecting the Cyanwood Mountain, I will also be able to feel more relieved,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>“I, Chu Feng, will definitely not forget this assistance Your Majesty has given me,” Chu Feng said gratefully.</p>
 <p>He did not refuse, for he was unable to find any reason to refuse the help. What the Elf King said was very reasonable. The Cyanwood Mountain was indeed one of the locations Chu Feng was most concerned about. Furthermore, it was also Chu Feng’s weak spot.</p>
 <p>However, the Ancient Era’s Elves were currently facing the Dark Hall, and had a battle to fight. Yet, at such a time, the Elf King was actually dispatching Lord Lianghua to protect the Cyanwood Mountain. This was truly a favor that Chu Feng could not show enough gratitude for.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, let’s go,” Lord Lianghua said.</p>
 <p>Even though Lord Lianghua was a person that was high and above everyone else, a Grand Elder that even the other Ancient Era’s Elves would tremble with fear upon seeing, he did not display an attitude of arrogance toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Lord Lianghua, I’ll have to trouble you then,” Chu Feng said respectfully.</p>
 <p>Then, Chu Feng and Lord Lianghua proceeded for the Purple Flames Blackmountain together. Even though they were planning to proceed for the Cyanwood Mountain, Chu Feng needed to bring Bai Ruochen, her mother Bai Suyan and Jiang Wushang to the Cyanwood Mountain as well.</p>
 <p>“Royal father.”</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng left, Xian Miaomiao suddenly threw herself into the Elf Kingdom’s bosom and began to cry loudly.</p>
 <p>“Uncle died. Uncle was killed by the World Devastator Immortal.”</p>
 <p>“I will avenge him! I’ll definitely kill the World Devastator Immortal,” Xian Miaomiao was feeling extremely pained. Sparkling teardrops rolled down her beautiful cheeks.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had guessed correctly. Xian Miaomiao had been pretending to be strong and forcing herself to smile so that he would not feel burdened.</p>
 <p>However, she was actually feeling enormous pain. After all, that blonde old man was someone that had looked after her, ever since she was a child. She possessed a very deep affection for the blonde old man. As such, how could she not be feeling pain?</p>
 <p>Merely, the pain that she felt could only be revealed after Chu Feng left.</p>
 <p>“It’s okay. Uncle will not have died in vain. Not a single one of our Ancient Era’s Elves will have died in vain. I will make the Dark Hall pay for their actions in blood.”</p>
 <p>While embracing his daughter, the Elf King was also feeling extremely pained. At the same time… he was also feeling an endless amount of rage. With so many of his clansmen having been killed, he, as the Clan Chief, was suffering from a greater pain than anyone else.</p>
 <p>…………</p>
 <p>After journeying for some time, Chu Feng and Lord Lianghua successfully retreived Bai Ruochen, her mother Bai Suyan and Jiang Wushang.</p>
 <p>Currently, they had finally arrived at the Cyanwood Domain and reached the Cyanwood Mountain.</p>
 <p>“Wow, the current Cyanwood Mountain is truly bustling with noise and excitement,” Bai Ruochen was very surprised upon seeing the current Cyanwood Mountain.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because the current Cyanwood Mountain was truly different from before. There were people both in the sky and on the ground. It was extremely lively.</p>
 <p>The Cyanwood Mountain was now most definitely many times livelier than it had been when Chu Feng had first arrived.</p>
 <p>Currently, the Cyanwood Mountain was not only a place that the people from the Cyanwood Domain wished to join, it had also become a place that people from all over the Holy Land of Martialism wished to join.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because news had spread of Nangong Longjian and the Compass Immortal had becoming guest elders of the Cyanwood Mountain.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the news of the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts becoming the Cyanwood Mountain’s ally had also spread.</p>
 <p>Currently, to the people of the Holy Land of Martialism, not only was the Cyanwood Mountain the leader of the Nine Powers, it had become an enormous power that surpassed even the Four Great Imperial Clans.</p>
 <p>For such a huge monster, even though it would only accept outstanding talents as disciples, there were countless people that wished to become its disciples.</p>
 <p>“Not to mention Nangong Longjian and the others joining the Cyanwood Mountain, merely little friend Chu Feng’s reputation itself would be sufficient to make the Cyanwood Mountain reach the peak of prosperity,” Lord Lianghua said.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, Chu Feng’s current reputation surpasses even that of Nangong Longjian and the Compass Immortal.”</p>
 <p>“However… if the people of the world were to know that the Ancient Era’s Elves are also allied with Chu Feng, and that even Lord Lianghua was sent forth to personally protect the Cyanwood Mountain, I wonder how shocked they would be,” Bai Ruochen said with an expression of anticipation.</p>
 <p>“This matter of me being here cannot be known by others. We cannot allow others to know that I’m guarding the Cyanwood Mountain,” Lord Lianghua said.</p>
 <p>“Why’s that?” Jiang Wushang asked in a confused manner, “Wouldn’t there be even more people that would want to join the Cyanwood Mountain should they know that Lord Lianghua is also here? Wouldn’t that allow the Cyanwood Mountain to become even more powerful?”</p>
 <p>“The current enemy of the Cyanwood Mountain is not the other Nine Powers, the Four Great Imperial Clans or the Three Palaces. Instead, it is the Dark Hall.”</p>
 <p>“The Dark Hall is a power that the Cyanwood Mountain, regardless of how much it expands, cannot surpass.”</p>
 <p>“That is why we cannot allow the people of the Dark Hall to know that Lord Lianghua is here.”</p>
 <p>“If they were to know, they would be prepared should they decide to attack the Cyanwood Mountain in the future. That would be detrimental to both the Cyanwood Mountain and Lord Lianghua,” Chu Feng explained.</p>
 <p>“So that’s the case,” Hearing those words, both Jiang Wushang and Bai Ruochen came to a sudden realization.</p>
 <p>“What little friend Chu Feng said is very correct,” Lord Lianghua nodded satisfiedly.</p>
 <p>As for Bai Suyan, she was looking at Chu Feng with a smile on her face.</p>
 <p>She felt that it was no mere coincidence that Chu Feng had matured to the point that he now had. He truly possessed capabilities that surpassed others.</p>
