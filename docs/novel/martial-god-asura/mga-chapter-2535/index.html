 <p><strong>Chapter 2535 - Bloodscale Monstrous Clan</strong></p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng retrieved his Ancient Era’s War Sword. He sat cross-legged in midair and closed his eyes.</p>
 <p>Then, he swallowed ten medicinal pellets and covered his body with spirit power.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng knew that Young Master Li Ming no longer possessed the strength to attack him.</p>
 <p>Even though he had only used the Ancient Era’s War Sword for such a short period of time, Chu Feng had overloaded his body by using it.</p>
 <p>Thus, he had to work to lessen the backlash from the Ancient Era’s War Sword using all the abilities that he could.</p>
 <p>However, even with this being the case, Chu Feng’s complexion soon turned pale, and his aura started to become erratic and weak.</p>
 <p>“Never would I have expected the backlash from this Ancient Era’s War Sword to be this severe.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng gasped in his heart.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, the battle was short. Else, the backlash Chu Feng would have received would most definitely have been even more severe.</p>
 <p>It would even be possible that he would lose the ability to battle, like Young Master Li Ming.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, Chu Feng had only managed to unleash a portion of the Ancient Era’s War Sword’s power.</p>
 <p>This could be seen by how the Ancient Era’s War Sword was only a hundred meters long.</p>
 <p>When the Ancient Era’s War Sword had appeared in the Ancient Era’s War Clan, it had been over a thousand meters long!!!</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at the moment when Chu Feng was wholeheartedly focused on healing his injuries, Young Master Li Ming’s body grew weak and fell from the air. She actually did not even have the strength to stabilize herself in the air.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng hurriedly opened his eyes and extended his finger. Spirit power shot out from Chu Feng’s finger.</p>
 <p>That spirit power was extremely fast. Young Master Li Ming had only fallen ten meters from the sky when Chu Feng’s spirit power reached her. Chu Feng’s spirit power turned into a cloud that caught Young Master Li Ming.</p>
 <p>Then, Chu Feng used his oppressive might to send the two Ancestral Armaments Young Master Li Ming had tossed away earlier onto the cloud beside her.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng did not hold any hostility toward Young Master Li Ming. Thus, even though Chu Feng had won this battle, he did not wish to make things difficult for her.</p>
 <p>“What is this? Are you trying to humiliate me?”</p>
 <p>However, Young Master Li Ming was clearly unappreciative of Chu Feng’s kindness. She questioned Chu Feng with an extremely weak voice.</p>
 <p>She felt that what Chu Feng was doing was simply humiliating her.</p>
 <p>“That girl is truly unappreciative. Chu Feng, you must teach her a lesson. Otherwise, she will forever not place you in her eyes,” Her Lady Queen said aggrievedly.</p>
 <p>“Teach her a lesson, how? My beloved Eggy, you have the greatest amount of ideas, how about you give me a suggestion?” Chu Feng asked with a beaming smile.</p>
 <p>“She is powerless right now. Why don’t you do that to her and make her your woman? Perhaps she might become docile and obedient afterwards?” Her Lady Queen said with a mischievous smile on her face.</p>
 <p>“That girl is quite decent-looking. It would indeed be pretty good for me to do that,” Chu Feng also revealed a mischievous smile. However, then, he said hesitantly, “Merely, there isn’t an enormous hatred between us. Wouldn’t it be too excessive for me to do something like that?”</p>
 <p>“For an unreasonable girl like her, you should punish her like that. Else, she will forever not know the immensity of the heaven and earth,” Her Lady Queen said.</p>
 <p>“Mn, it is still my Eggy that is most reasonable. Since that’s the case, I will do as you suggested.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng decided to ignore the pain from the backlash and stopped healing his injuries. With a mischievous smile on his face, he slowly stood up.</p>
 <p>Not only did Chu Feng have a mischievous smile on his face, but even the gaze with which he looked to Young Master Li Ming had changed.</p>
 <p>“What are you planning to do?” Seeing the mischievous smile on Chu Feng’s face, Young Master Li Ming’s expression changed. She started to panic.</p>
 <p>It was not that she was a cowardly individual. Rather, from Chu Feng’s gaze, she saw what she was most afraid of.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng could beat her or even kill her. She would not blink an eye at that.</p>
 <p>However, if Chu Feng were to do such a thing to her, she would absolutely be unable to accept it.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he would naturally not be so shameless as to do that sort of thing to Li Ming.</p>
 <p>Moreover, even if he were to ignore morality, Young Master Li Ming was not Chu Feng’s type.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was merely doing this to scare her.</p>
 <p>For some unknown reason, he felt her to be very amusing. Toying with her would be able to bring Chu Feng joy.</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly shouted, “Who is it?!”</p>
 <p>At the same time, the mischievous gaze on Chu Feng’s face turned incomparably sharp.</p>
 <p>Being stared by Chu Feng’s gaze, even the surrounding space turned incomparably ice-cold. It was even more bone-piercing than winter.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be afraid, we’re on the same side.”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, the space in the direction that Chu Feng was staring at started to squirm. Then, several tens of figures walked out from it.</p>
 <p>Seeing those people, Chu Feng’s expression changed.</p>
 <p>Those people simply did not resemble humans at all.</p>
 <p>Although they possessed a humanoid build, they were over twice the height of an ordinary human.</p>
 <p>Although they were wearing the same sort of red armor, Chu Feng was able to tell from their exposed skin that their skin was covered with red scales.</p>
 <p>Those scales were crimson red. It was a very dazzling sight.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, their eyes were dark green in color.</p>
 <p>Rather than saying that they were humans, they resembled more or less resembled a group of monstrous beasts.</p>
 <p>Merely, Chu Feng had never seen monstrous beasts like them before.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, the aura of those several tens of people were all those of peak Martial Ancestors.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Chu Feng was able to sense that they possessed the same sort of heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation like himself.</p>
 <p>“Paa, paa, paa~~~”</p>
 <p>After appearing, the leading monstrous beast started to clap its hands. It also revealed a good-natured smile toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Brother, it must be said that your abilities are truly decent. To be able to subdue that fellow, I am truly in humble admiration.”</p>
 <p>Although that monstrous beast praised Chu Feng, Chu Feng was still completely on guard against them. He asked, “Exactly who are you all?”</p>
 <p>“We are the masters of the Demon Elimination Cave, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan,” The leader of the group said.</p>
 <p>“Bloodscale Monstrous Clan?” Chu Feng was startled. He had never heard of a Bloodscale Monstrous Clan before.</p>
 <p>“Judging from your reaction, I can tell that you do not know about us. However, that’s understandable too. Our Bloodscale Monstrous Clan has lived in seclusion in the Demon Elimination Cave, withdrawn from worldly affairs. It is very natural that you would not know about us.”</p>
 <p>“That said, you do not have to worry. We are friends… because, we possess the same enemy,” That Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s group leader said.</p>
 <p>Right after saying those words, it suddenly turned its gaze filled with anger toward Young Master Li Ming. It shouted, “Capture that fellow.”</p>
 <p>After saying those words, the several tens of monstrous beasts behind it started to fly toward Young Master Li Ming.</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right at that moment, a fire dragon suddenly soared forth. It swept through the sky and separated those monstrous beasts from Young Master Li Ming.</p>
 <p>“Brother, what are you doing?” The Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen turned their surprised gazes toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because that fire dragon was sent forth by Chu Feng using the Flame Dragon Greatsword.</p>
 <p>“I do not care about what sort of hatred you all might have with her. However, you all can forget about bringing her away today,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“You…” Hearing those words, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen were startled.</p>
 <p>Not to mention them, even Young Master Li Ming’s expression changed. Confusion emerged in her eyes.</p>
 <p>She was unable to understand. Earlier, she was really planning on killing Chu Feng. Thus, why would he be protecting her now?</p>
 <p>Could it be that Chu Feng really planned to do immoral things to her? Could he be planning to personally torture her?</p>
