 <p><strong> Chapter 2019 - Plan Success </strong></p>
 <p>After it was decided, Nangong Longjian and the others set off for the four powers on the same day.</p>
 <p>As for the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the others, they began to prepare the materials needed to set up the grand defensive formation.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, due to the fact that Chu Feng had just assimilated the Five Elements Secret Skills and was the main force in setting up the defensive spirit formation, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the others did not wish for Chu Feng to become too exhausted. Thus, they decided to take the task of gathering the materials needed entirely upon themselves.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng was finally able to enjoy some leisure time. He turned his awareness into his world spirit space and looked to the still-sleeping Eggy. Then, Chu Feng smiled a relieved smile and turned to leave.</p>
 <p>“It would seem that the harvest this time around is destined to be large,” After Chu Feng cast his awareness back into his body, the smile on his face grew wider.</p>
 <p>The enormous power of those five elemental energies had destroyed Chu Feng’s territory completely. It was not Chu Feng who had willed that to happen. Rather, it was caused by the Five Elements Secret Skills.</p>
 <p>Although Chu Feng had obtained a new understanding of the usage of the Five Elements Secret Skills after they were all assimilated into him, Chu Feng’s cultivation had not increased. Thus, that frightening energy that caused the destruction of his territory was indeed caused by the Five Elements Secret Skills.</p>
 <p>Indirectly, it demonstrated the frightening power of the Five Elements Secret Skills. Merely, Chu Feng had yet to completely grasp their strength.</p>
 <p>However, one thing worthy of mention was that, although the five elemental energies were so frightening and had destroyed Chu Feng’s entire territory, they did not harm Eggy. Instead, they brought Eggy into Chu Feng’s body. That was truly miraculous and unbelievable.</p>
 <p>After all, Chu Feng’s world spirit gate needed to open for Eggy to enter his world spirit space. Logically, this should be impossible for anyone other than Chu Feng to accomplish. However, the energies that the Five Elements Secret Skills turned into had managed to accomplish it.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, they had brought Eggy into Chu Feng’s world spirit space while wreaking destruction all over. It was as if they were deliberately protecting Eggy.</p>
 <p>It was precisely because of all of this that Chu Feng felt that the Five Elements Secret Skills themselves were an enormous treasure. The reason for that was because they contained immeasurable power.</p>
 <p>However, if the five symbols were gathered, he would be able to open another treasure. In other words, Chu Feng would obtain two treasures.</p>
 <p>That was why Chu Feng felt that he had profited enormously this time around.</p>
 <p>After the materials were gathered, Chu Feng began to set up that spirit formation capable of defending against attacks from peak Martial Emperors together with the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the others.</p>
 <p>That grand formation was too complicated. Even though Chu Feng and the other Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists were working together to set it up, they still took quite some time to set it up.</p>
 <p>……….</p>
 <p>Time shuttled past. In a flash, two months had passed.</p>
 <p>At that moment, a shocking scene appeared in a forbidden area of the Heavenly Law Palace.</p>
 <p>Not only was the Heavenly Law Palace’s Palace Master in this forbidden area, the Mortal King Palace’s Palace Master was also here.</p>
 <p>However, at that moment, those two peak experts of humanity were half kneeling on the ground in a petty and low manner.</p>
 <p>Before them stood three individuals. The person to the left was the World Devastator Immortal. The person to the right was that mysterious woman. As for the person in the middle, he was the man that possessed the same Inherited Bloodline as Chu Feng… the Dark Hall’s Hall Master.</p>
 <p>“Lord Hall Master, we are incompetent. We have failed in our attack on the Cyanwood Mountain. We have failed to kill Chu Feng. Lord Hall Master, please bestow us our punishment,” The two Palace Masters seemed to have already consulted with one another as to what to say, as the two of them were both saying the same words.</p>
 <p>“If you all had managed to successfully raze the Cyanwood Mountain to the ground, my plan would have failed,” The Dark Hall’s Hall Master started to laugh from behind his mask.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, the two Palace Masters’ bodies started to shiver. Then, their expressions changed greatly. It was as if they had just suffered an enormous injury. However, in the end, they restrained their emotions and asked servilely, “Lord Hall Master, this subordinate does not understand what you mean.”</p>
 <p>“It’s fine if you two do not understand. However, do not ask about it,” The Dark Hall’s Hall Master said.</p>
 <p>“But…” At that moment, the two Palace Masters’ expressions grew more and more ugly. After all, the two of them had suffered disastrous losses from attacking the Cyanwood Mountain.</p>
 <p>“Rest assured. In the future, I will return everything you have lost to the Cyanwood Mountain twofold,” The Dark Hall’s Hall Master said.</p>
 <p>“Lord Hall Master, I have another request,” The Heavenly Law Palace’s Palace Master said.</p>
 <p>“Speak,” The Dark Hall’s Hall Master said.</p>
 <p>“That Chu Feng, would you mind leaving him to me? I wish to personally kill him,” The Heavenly Law Palace’s Palace Master said in a very fierce manner. He truly loathed Chu Feng to the bones. Even in his dreams, he would dream about killing Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“I’m afraid that will not be possible. His life belongs to me. Only I am allowed to kill him,” The Dark Hall’s Hall Master said.</p>
 <p>“......” Hearing those words, the Heavenly Law Palace’s Palace Master took a glance at the Mortal King Palace’s Palace Master. They were both at a loss as to what to say. They were truly confused. Since the Dark Hall’s Hall Master did not wish to kill Chu Feng, why did he have them attack the Cyanwood Mountain?</p>
 <p>With that, wouldn’t it mean that he had wasted his military strength in vain?</p>
 <p>“If there’s nothing else, the two of you can withdraw,” The Dark Hall’s Hall Master waved his sleeve.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the expressions of the two Palace Masters did not improve. After all, they were grand characters. Yet, they were being toyed around with by someone, round and round. As such, the two of them felt extremely unreconciled.</p>
 <p>“Did you not hear what I just said?” Seeing that the two Palace Masters were still here, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master’s voice sounded once again. Merely, this time around, there was a faint coldness in his voice.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the bodies of the two Palace Masters shivered once more. Being stimulated by the coldness they felt, the two of them recalled how powerful this Dark Hall’s Hall Master before them was. Thus, the two of them bowed to the Dark Hall’s Hall Master while kneeling and then got up, “Lord Hall Master, Milord, Milady, we shall take our leave.”</p>
 <p>After the two Palace Masters left, the World Devastator Immortal’s womanly voice sounded, “Lord Hall Master, I have received a secret letter.” Then, he handed a letter to the Dark Hall’s Hall Master.</p>
 <p>The Dark Hall’s Hall Master opened the letter. There was not a single word written on it. However, he was not flustered by that. Instead, he began to form a spirit formation. As the spirit formation enveloped the letter, a strand of gaseous substance flowed out from the letter and entered his mask.</p>
 <p>“Hahahaha…”</p>
 <p>The very next moment, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master suddenly stood up from his seat and started to laugh. It was a resounding laughter that echoed throughout the vast palace hall that they were in.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the mysterious woman remained completely composed. There was not a single trace of change to her expression. However, the World Devastator Immortal looked to the Dark Hall’s Hall Master with a shocked expression, seemingly as if he wanted to know what the contents of the letter were.</p>
 <p>After his wild laughter, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master said, “Chu Feng, oh Chu Feng, as expected of a person from the Outer World. You have surpassed my expectations, and given me a pleasant surprise.”</p>
 <p>“Lord Hall Master, could it be… it’s a success?” The World Devastator Immortal asked.</p>
 <p>“Mn, Chu Feng had successfully assimilated the Five Elements Secret Skills. Our plan is a success.”</p>
 <p>“Not long from now, we will be able to know exactly what the treasure hidden in the Five Elements Secret Skills is,” said the Dark Hall’s Hall Master with a nod. Even though he was wearing a mask, his joy could still be felt.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng is actually that surprisingly valiant?” Hearing those words, the World Devastator Immortal revealed an ugly expression. His own son was killed by Chu Feng. Thus, he detested Chu Feng to the bones. Yet, Chu Feng had actually managed to assimilate the Five Elements Secret Skills. To him, this was not good news at all.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because he knew very well that this Lord Hall Master before him had attempted to assimilate the Five Elements Secret Skills too. For that, he had even killed the previous owners of the Gold Immortal Profound Technique, the Wood Immortal Profound Technique and the Earth Immortal Profound Technique. [1. I guess this explains why the Heavenly Law Palace’s Palace Master had the secret skill even though Leng Yue said that she saw a grand elder using it.]</p>
 <p>Although the Dark Hall’s Hall Master succeeded in assimilating two of the secret skills, his body was unable to contain a third secret skill.</p>
 <p>However, in the heart of the World Devastator Immortal, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master was an existence akin to a god.</p>
 <p>Yet, Chu Feng had accomplished what was impossible for even the Dark Hall’s Hall Master. This caused the World Devastator Immortal to feel extremely uneasy.</p>
 <p>After all, after encountering Chu Feng several times, he now had a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng. He feared that Chu Feng would surpass him sooner or later if this were to continue. At that time, not only would he not be able to kill Chu Feng, he would instead be killed by Chu Feng.</p>
