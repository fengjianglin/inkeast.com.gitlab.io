 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1040 - The Hope of the Southern Cyanwood Forest</strong></p>
 <p>“Lord Headmaster, please be lenient. Please look upon how our Han family were loyal and devoted to the Southern Cyanwood Forest for so many years. Lord Headmaster, we beg of you, please give us another chance.”</p>
 <p>Hearing Lord Headmaster’s words, Han Qingyu and the rest of the Han family members were instantly stunned. It was as if a giant hammer that weighed millions of catties was being dropped on them, smashing them to a stupefied state.</p>
 <p>To expel all of the Han family members from the Southern Cyanwood Forest and ban all Han family descendants from stepping half a step into the Southern Cyanwood Forest in the future, was simply too ruthless. Not only did it instantly eradicate all the power that the Han family had accumulated in the Southern Cyanwood Forest, it even cut off the escape route of the Han family. This caused the Han family members to truly be incapable of accepting it.</p>
 <p>“Lord Headmaster, although the Han family is at fault, they have, after all, provided countless meritorious services to our Southern Cyanwood Forest. They have also sent many talented individuals to the Cyanwood Mountain for our Southern Cyanwood Forest. How about we have them amended for their past mistakes and give them another chance?” It was not only the Han family that was begging for forgiveness, there were even some elders begging the Lord Headmaster on behalf of the Han family.</p>
 <p>Although the tyranny of the Han family in the Southern Cyanwood Forest was something that many people loathed, the Han family was actually very useful for the Southern Cyanwood Forest.</p>
 <p>The Han family was a big clan. Although they had borrowed the resources of the Southern Cyanwood Forest to cultivate their young, they had also provided many outstanding talents for the Southern Cyanwood Forest.</p>
 <p>For example, among the most outstanding disciples in the Southern Cyanwood Forest now, close to a third of them were from the Han family. Before Chu Feng arrived at the Southern Cyanwood Forest, the several most powerful disciples were all from the Han family. From this, one could tell the importance the Han family possessed for the Southern Cyanwood Forest.</p>
 <p>Regardless of how outrageous their crimes were, they had indeed contributed quite a bit to the Southern Cyanwood Forest. If the Han family was to be truly expelled from the Southern Cyanwood Forest and have their relationship with the Southern Cyanwood Forest severed, it would be an enormous loss for the Southern Cyanwood Forest.</p>
 <p>Thus, although many of the elders disliked the Han family, when considering the greater picture, they did not wish for the Han family to leave the Southern Cyanwood Forest. That was because the Holy Land of Martialism was filled with powers. If the Han family was to be expelled from the Southern Cyanwood Forest, they would still be able to easily join another power. If they were to join a power that is antagonistic against the Southern Cyanwood Forest, then wouldn’t it be an extreme loss for the Southern Cyanwood Forest?</p>
 <p>“All of you, shut up.” The begging of the various elders actually angered the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s headmaster. As he shouted those words of anger, the heaven and earth even shook.</p>
 <p>His voice was extremely loud and clear. Even the sky appeared like it was about to shatter. As for the people present, they all received a strong shock. After this loud shout, everyone shut their mouths tightly. No one dared to utter a word. That was because they had sensed the determination Lord Headmaster had in expelling the Han family from the Southern Cyanwood Forest.</p>
 <p>“I have said this before, anyone who refuses to follow this decision of mine shall be killed with no exception. Could it be that I must repeat myself?” The Southern Cyanwood Forest’s headmaster cast his sharp gaze at everyone. This time around, no one dared to say anything anymore. That was because they knew the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s elder would always stand firm by what he says. If anyone was to dare to say anything back, they might really be killed by him.</p>
 <p>Just like this, the Han family that had tyrannized the Southern Cyanwood Forest was completely expelled from the Southern Cyanwood Forest on this day. Whether it was the Punishment Elder Han Qingyu or those outstanding disciples the Southern Cyanwood Forest had nourished for many years and planned to send to the Cyanwood Mountain this year, as long as they were from the Han family, they were all expelled from the Southern Cyanwood Forest.</p>
 <p>There were actually people who had anticipated this day. That was because regardless of how powerful the Han family was, their manner of conduct in the past years was truly too excessive. The current Han family already had the idea of seizing the power of the Southern Cyanwood Forest and becoming the rulers themselves. This was something that the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s headmaster could not tolerate.</p>
 <p>However, before today, no one would have thought that the fuse that would lead to the expulsion of the Han family from the Southern Cyanwood Forest was actually a youngster from the Southern Sea Region. There was no doubt that after today, Chu Feng’s name would be spread through the vast Southern Cyanwood Forest. That was because he had truly created a shocking major event.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng was in the Headmaster’s Palace Hall. He had completely recovered from his injuries. However, as he was alone in the dazzling and luxurious palace hall, it appeared to be somewhat lonely.</p>
 <p>It was the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s headmaster who had invited Chu Feng to this place. However, because the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s headmaster had personally gone to expel those from the Han family and put in office a new Punishment Elder and other elders, this ended up taking quite some time. Due to that, the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s headmaster had been unable to be present with Chu Feng the entire time.</p>
 <p>“Creak~~~” At last, the palace hall’s entrance that had been shut the entire time was opened. An elderly figure appeared from the entrance. It was the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s headmaster.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, I’m sorry for the delay. An urgent matter that I must take care of had occurred. I ended up making you wait for a long time.” Seeing Chu Feng, the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s headmaster smiled. However, his face was filled with an apologetic expression.</p>
 <p>“Lord Headmaster, this disciple is truly undeserving of your apology.” Chu Feng hurriedly got up and courteously greeted the headmaster. No matter what, he had joined the Southern Cyanwood Forest. Thus, he was already a disciple of the Southern Cyanwood Forest. When faced with the Lord Headmaster, how could he dare to be rude? Moreover, this Lord Headmaster was the person that had saved him.</p>
 <p>“Sigh, there’s no need for you to be this courteous. Little friend Chu Feng, there is no need for you to treat me as your elder, much less the headmaster. If possible, I wish for you to treat me as if I’m your friend.”</p>
 <p>“My name is Sikong Zhaixing. Little friend Chu Feng, you can call me by my name.” Said the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s headmaster with a smile on his face. His attitude was extremely amiable.</p>
 <p>Although it was Chu Feng’s honor for the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s headmaster to say those words to him, but as Chu Feng was, after all, a disciple, he ended up being a bit baffled. That was because with his status, how could he possibly address the Lord Headmaster by his name?</p>
 <p>However, after thinking about it, a bright idea suddenly came to light in Chu Feng’s head. With a respectful yet not overly respectful tone, Chu Feng courteously said to Sikong Zhaixing. “Junior Chu Feng pays his respect to Senior Sikong.”</p>
 <p>“Haha, very well. Although you’re still addressing me as senior, it’s much more pleasant to the ear than being addressed as Lord Headmaster.” The Southern Cyanwood Forest’s headmaster laughed loudly. He appeared to be very happy. He then inspected Chu Feng with a concerned gaze and asked, “Little friend Chu Feng, how is your body’s recovery?”</p>
 <p>“Senior, it is all thanks to the medicinal pellets that you’ve given me. Chu Feng’s injuries has already healed.” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“That’s great.” The Southern Cyanwood Forest’s headmaster nodded. He then said, “Little friend Chu Feng, I ended up letting you suffer today.”</p>
 <p>“Senior has already upheld justice for Chu Feng. Even if junior has to suffer a bit, it is worth it.” Chu Feng replied.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, that Han family has done malicious things in my Southern Cyanwood Forest for many years. Yet, I’ve neither bothered to hear nor care about their conduct. Might you have thought that I am muddleheaded, incompetent and unworthy of being the headmaster?” Sikong Zhaixing asked.</p>
 <p>“No. Senior Sikong, I felt that you most definitely have a special intention for not disciplining the Han family till now.” Chu Feng shook his head. Although he only knew the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s headmaster for a very short while, Chu Feng did not see this Sikong Zhaixing as a muddleheaded person. Instead, he appeared extremely capable.</p>
 <p>“Heh, little friend Chu Feng, you’re flattering me. It cannot be said that I have a special intention. However, it is true that I have my own selfish motives.”</p>
 <p>“As the Southern Cyanwood Forest’s headmaster, how could I not know about the conduct of the Han family?”</p>
 <p>“However, why did I not care about them? That is because I still have to rely on the Han family. The Han family is a large family with a long history in this area. They were originally a regional power. Due to forming ties with one of our Southern Cyanwood Forest’s elder and setting up an agreement with him, they ended up sending a portion of their outstanding descendants to our Southern Cyanwood Forest for cultivation.”</p>
 <p>“This had been the way for many years. Other than sending disciples to our Southern Cyanwood Forest, the Han family would train their members themselves. They absolutely refused to allow the people from the Han family to join other powers.”</p>
 <p>“The reason the Han family was like that appeared to be because they were complying with the agreement their elder had with our Southern Cyanwood Forest’s elder. However, it was actually because the Han family is incapable of separating themselves from the cultivation resources of our Southern Cyanwood Forest. If they were to go to another power, it would be extremely difficult for the Han family to attain their current status. It would be even more difficult for them to try to stealthily transfer that power’s cultivation resources into the Han family.”</p>
 <p>“As for the reason why I had turned a blind eye to the conducts of the Han family, it is not because I wanted to comply to the agreement from our senior. Instead, it’s because our Southern Cyanwood Forest was also separating from the Han family.”</p>
 <p>“Our Southern Cyanwood Forest has its origin in the Cyanwood Mountain. It is a genuine [1. By genuine, they mean that it is a subsidiary power set up the the Cyanwood Mountain themselves, not a power that became a subsidiary power to the Cyanwood Mountain afterwards.]subsidiary power of the Cyanwood Mountain. The reason why the Southern Cyanwood Forest was constructed in this region is so that we could search for outstanding talents to send to the Cyanwood Mountain. Our purpose is to provide a steady flow of outstanding younger generation to our Cyanwood Mountain so that its glory could continue onward.”</p>
 <p>“However, this place possesses many powers. Furthermore, talents were limited. Perhaps there are people who were considered to be pretty talented in this region. However, when we send them to the Cyanwood Mountain, it is extremely rare for them to be not looked down upon.”</p>
 <p>“Although the conduct of the Han family is excessive, when compared to the other people, the Han family’s younger generations’ talent is relatively good. Every year, they are capable of providing a portion of outstanding disciples for our Southern Cyanwood Forest.”</p>
 <p>“This allowed our Southern Cyanwood Forest to be able to send more or less some talented individuals to the Cyanwood Mountain. Although when compared to the other three Cyanwood Forests, both the quantity and quality of our disciples are greatly inferior. However, it is still, at a whole, passable.”</p>
 <p>“However, if we are to not have the Han family. I’m afraid that the number of disciples our Southern Cyanwood Forest is capable of sending to the Cyanwood Mountain would greatly decrease. At that time, our Southern Cyanwood Forest, a genuine subsidiary power to the Cyanwood Mountain, would provide even less talented individuals to the Cyanwood Mountain than the non-genuine subsidiary powers. We would lose so much face that we’ll be unable to hold our heads up anymore.”</p>
 <p>When mentioning this matter, Sikong Zhaixing displayed an expression of helplessness. As for Chu Feng, after he knew about the whole story, he also began to feel very apologetic. Regardless of what Sikong Zhaixing’s intention was, the Han family had been expelled from the Southern Cyanwood Forest because of him. He felt that he had unknowingly done a thing that caused great loss to the Southern Cyanwood Forest.</p>
 <p>“However, the reason why I am so determined in expelling the Han family from our Southern Cyanwood Forest is because I’ve already seen the hope of our Southern Cyanwood Forest. As for that hope, it is you.” Suddenly, Sikong Zhaixing spoke again. The gaze that he looked to Chu Feng with contained a different kind of sensation. It was a gaze filled with enormous expectations.</p>
