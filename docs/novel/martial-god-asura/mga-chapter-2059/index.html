 <p><strong> Chapter 2059 - Total Evacuation</strong></p>
 <p>“The Heaven Reaching Immortal has a very odd temperament. Even though he possesses a decent relationship with me, this is ‘decent’ only when compared to his relationships with others. Thus, in the end, the relationship that I have with him is only at that level.”</p>
 <p>“If I have something to request of him, he might decide to help me if he’s in a good mood. However, if I am to bring all these people to find him, I fear that he will not agree to help.”</p>
 <p>“However, there is nothing that can be done about this. We have no choice but to test our luck. If he is to decide to ignore the deaths of all the living things in the world, then it could only be said to be a tribulation that we have to go through,” After saying those words, the Elf King revealed a helpless expression.</p>
 <p>Even though he had been cracking down on the Dark Hall not long after they had appeared, the current situation had already surpassed the range of his ability. At that moment, he had become powerless.</p>
 <p>“Merely, the population of the Holy Land of Martialism is too enormous. There are definitely over a hundred quintillion beings here. It is impossible to move all of them at such short notice.”</p>
 <p>“As such, only the elites can be saved. However, even if we only save the people from the major powers, we might still not necessarily be able to make it in time,” After saying those words, the Elf King revealed a sentimental gaze.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng also felt very unwell. It was not his desire to be unable to save everyone. However, with the situation at hand, it was the only thing they could do.</p>
 <p>They all say that the greater the strength one possesses, the greater the responsibility one possessed. Unwittingly, Chu Feng and the Elf King were tasked with the heavy responsibility of saving all living things in the world. The pressure from that was something that only they understood.</p>
 <p>“I was unable to do much regarding the Dark Hall’s Hall Master. However, now… perhaps I might be able to do something.”</p>
 <p>“I have a method we can try,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“What is it?” Hearing what Chu Feng said, the Elf King was overjoyed.</p>
 <p>“To create spatial warships that can travel back and forth through the Ancient Era’s Teleportation Formations,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Spatial warships?” The Elf King was surprised to hear that. However, he also revealed an anticipating gaze. He was able to tell that the ‘spatial warships’ that Chu Feng spoke of would be extremely remarkable.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng continued, “The amount of people that we wish to evacuate right now is too numerous. Furthermore, they must be moved to the location of the Transmogrification Gate in a short period of time. As such, we must create spatial warships that the Holy Land of Martialism currently lacks.”</p>
 <p>“Spatial warships are actually very simple. When steered by Martial Emperor-level experts, they will possess the speed of the Martial Emperors steering them. Furthermore, they can sail through the Ancient Era’s Teleportation Formations. Most importantly, spatial warships use a spatial formation to create an isolated space in the warship. With that, more people can enter them, and we will be able to evacuate more people in a short period of time.”</p>
 <p>“That’s a great idea. Merely, these spatial warships must require a lot of time to create, right? We might not necessarily have enough time for them,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>“Due to the fact that the speed of the spatial warships will be determined by the person steering it, it would be fine to make a single steering formation. That is a very easy task.”</p>
 <p>“As for the isolated space, it also does not need to be enormous. It would do as long as it was capable of accommodating a sufficient amount of people. Thus, that is also relatively simple. I am able to create ten such spatial warships in a day,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Ten a day?” Hearing those words, the Elf King was even more shocked. However, he knew that Chu Feng was not someone that would boast. Thus, at the same time as he was shocked, he was more overjoyed.</p>
 <p>“That’s great. If it is truly possible, we would be able to save more people,” Even though a catastrophe was about to befall them, the Elf King still revealed an overjoyed expression on his face.</p>
 <p>Then, after the Alliance Army finished sweeping up the battlefield, they began to move toward the Elf Kingdom. As for Chu Feng, he began to form the spatial warships with the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the other Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists.</p>
 <p>With the assistance of the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the others, Chu Feng managed to create a total of fifteen spatial warships in a day.</p>
 <p>Whenever a spatial warship was completed, many high level Martial Emperors would personally board the spatial warships to steer them. They would immediately leave to evacuate elites from all over the Holy Land of Martialism.</p>
 <p>Their first destinations were the Underworld Palace, the Cyanwood Mountain, the Four Great Imperial Clans, the King Monstrous Dragon Race and the Ancient Era’s Elves’ various territories.</p>
 <p>Following that, they went to move the various other monstrous beast races and the Nine Powers.</p>
 <p>After that, it was the unknown powers. In short… they would attempt to save as many people as they could. They planned to put forth their greatest strength to help others.</p>
 <p>Even though the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace had submitted to the Dark Hall, the Ancient Era’s Elves still dispatched two spatial warships to save them. After all, the ones that had submitted to the Dark Hall were the elites, whereas the Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace’s elders and disciples that remained were innocent.</p>
 <p>However, even with this being the case, they must prevent there being spies from the Dark Hall notifying the Dark Hall’s Hall Master that everyone had left for the so-called Transmogrification Gate.</p>
 <p>Thus, all of the spatial warships possessed powerful isolation effects. Upon entering them, one would definitely not be able to send any news outside.</p>
 <p>Currently, the mission to save the living things of the world was in full operation. Furthermore, the speed of the operation could be said to be lightning fast. However, it was not all smooth sailing.</p>
 <p>It was fine for the Cyanwood Mountain, the Underworld Palace, the King Monstrous Dragon Race and the Four Great Imperial Clans, in other words, the powers allied with the Ancient Era’s Elves, as they knew the terror of the Dark Hall and believed in the Ancient Era’s Elves. Thus, even though they found it very difficult to accept, they still ended up abandoning their respective powers that had existed for tens of thousands of years and gathered up all of their treasures and people from their powers to enter the spatial warships.</p>
 <p>However, for the other powers, they did not fully trust the Ancient Era’s Elves’ words of an imminent calamity.</p>
 <p>Next, no one was willing to abandon their powers that had existed for tens of thousands of years. They felt that would be denouncing their ancestors. As such, many ended up refusing the Ancient Era’s Elves’ good intentions.</p>
 <p>Faced with this sort of situation, the Ancient Era’s Elves did not bother to force them to embark on the spatial warships. In any case, they were unable to force them to embark on the spatial warships anyways. As such, they immediately left to persuade other powers. The reason for that was because their time was extremely limited.</p>
 <p>The Ancient Era’s Elves were truly worthy of being Ancient Era’s Elves. Their rallying power was extremely strong. While major powers like the Three Palaces, Four Clans, Nine Powers and the many powerful monstrous beast races possessed some capabilities to question and refuse the Ancient Era’s Elves, to the powers that were not very strong, when they saw the arrival of the Ancient Era’s Elves on the spatial warships, and heard what they said, they truly could not find any reason to refuse them.</p>
 <p>After all, regardless of how long their powers had existed, they would definitely be able to obtain more and better resources than before should the Ancient Era’s Elves help them. Thus, the smaller powers were more willing to accept the Ancient Era’s Elves’ assistance.</p>
 <p>After a total of ten days had passed, Chu Feng and the others managed to create one hundred and fifty spatial warships. All of the spatial warships were capable of carrying hundreds of millions of people.</p>
 <p>Thus, a hundred and fifty spatial warships were enough.</p>
 <p>At that moment, even the Elf Kingdom had prepared themselves, and were starting to proceed for the Transmogrification Gate. However, Chu Feng had ended up steering a spatial warship himself toward the Alliance Domain.</p>
 <p>Contained there was the World Spiritist Alliance that had sealed themselves away for a very long time. Even though the World Spiritist Alliance’s spirit formation was very powerful, Chu Feng did not feel that it would be able to withstand the Dark Hall’s Hall Master’s attack. As such, Chu Feng had to bring them away with him. Else, should the World Spiritist Alliance be destroyed, it would be an enormous loss for the Holy Land of Martialism.</p>
 <p>That said, Chu Feng was extremely worried on his way there. After all, the World Spiritist Alliance was already sealed. If Chu Feng was unable to get in contact with the people from the World Spiritist Alliance, and should he not be able to open that spirit formation, he would not be able to save the people from the World Spiritist Alliance.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, Chu Feng’s worries were needless. Even though the people from the World Spiritist Alliance had sealed themselves within the grand formation, they were able to see the situation outside from within it. Thus, when they saw Chu Feng, they opened their grand formation.</p>
 <p>After hearing about what had happened from Chu Feng, the people from the World Spiritist Alliance all gasped in shock. They had not expected the Dark Hall to be so powerful that even the Ancient Era’s Elves could do nothing about them. At that moment, sighing and sobbing could be heard nonstop. After all, no one wished to see such a fate descend upon them.</p>
 <p>However, in the end, they decided to lead everyone from the World Spiritist Alliance into Chu Feng’s spatial warship. After all, compared to the other powers, the World Spiritist Alliance was the first one to know about how frightening the Dark Hall was. For the sake of survival, so what if they had to evacuate?</p>
