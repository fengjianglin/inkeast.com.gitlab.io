 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 381 - Gold-cloak World Spiritist</strong></p>
 <p><span style>The area Chu Feng pointed at was the palace right now. But on the map, there was a thing in the center of the palace, yet at that instant, there wasn’t.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The most important thing was that if one looked closely, they would discover that the palace actually had two floors. But at that instant, only one floor appeared. Which meant that there was either another floor below the palace, or another floor above the palace. This place was not the real end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Zi Ling discovered that change, she hurried arrived at the place where the map indicted there was an object and laid a Spirit Formation at that place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, with a light yell of “open”, the Spirit Formation started to give out dazzling brilliance and at the same time, in the direction of the Spirit Formation, a stage of rock appeared with seven-coloured radiance lingering around it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that stage of rock appeared, the brilliance got brighter and brighter, and at the end, it projected up and enveloped the entire palace’s ceiling. But the strangest thing was that as it was being covered by the seven-coloured radiance, the ceiling of the palace started to change and the special rocks got more and more faint, and finally, started to disappear. The thing that appeared in front of Chu Feng’s and Zi Ling’s eyes was another palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shape of the palace was the same as the one they were in currently, but the only thing different was that in mid-air of the palace’s center, a row of symbols were floating. Those symbols were floating in the air and they emanated strange energy, as if within the delicate symbols, they contained tens of thousands of changes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And the most important part was that outside of the symbols, there were four golden-coloured big words floating in the air. A rank 9 martial skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a rank 9 martial skill!” After seeing the four big words, rank 9 martial skill, Zi Ling’s eyes instantly lit up. Her alluring body leaped, she rose, and while extending her hand, she flew over towards the symbols that concealed the rank 9 martial skill and grabbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This girl, such a quick speed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that scene, Chu Feng tightly frowned because he knew the reason why Zi Ling went over so quickly was certainly because she was afraid that he would go over before her and take away the rank 9 martial skill. Obviously, the girl had still not completely trusted him yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*hmm* But before Zi Ling’s thin and long hands touched the symbols, a strange energy surge started to spread and instantly, it permeated the top area of the entire palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*whoosh whoosh whoosh*</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately after, around Zi Ling, several golden-coloured Spirit Formation chains appeared. The Spirit Formation chains were like water snakes as they coiled around Zi Ling’s body and tied her tightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dammit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, Zi Ling used her entire body’s power and wanted to get rid of it, but her efforts were in vain as just as she used strength, the golden-coloured chains quickly shrunk and they were going to be imbedded into her bones. The agony of feeling that her physical body was almost going to shatter caused Zi Ling’s little face to instantly turn deathly-white and from her forehead, large amounts of sweat slid down and because of the pain, she couldn’t help but shriek.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why has this happened? This is actually also a mechanism? But I used my Spirit power to scout it out yet there was clearly nothing wrong with it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Zi Ling who was in the upper-layer of the palace while suffering torment, Chu Feng’s expression slightly changed because he could not see through where the mechanism in the palace was. He didn’t know how to save Zi Ling because the golden-coloured Spirit Formation chain was truly too powerful. The Spirit Formation power that was condensed out was something that Chu Feng had never seen before, and he could not understand it at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*hmm* But just at that time, the air next to Zi Ling’s body suddenly wigged and quickly after, a figure appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a consciousness as his body was half-transparent, but the consciousness was still a World Spiritist because he was wearing a World Spirit Cloak and his appearance was tightly covered by the cloak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And the thing that shocked Chu Feng the most was the World Spirit Cloak that the consciousness wore was extremely unordinary. Golden light overflowed out of him and it had a very imposing grandeur.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His cloak was imprinted with symbols and they were extremely special as well, as if every single symbol had tens of thousands of changes with infinite power. That person was actually wearing a World Spirit Gold Cloak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gold-cloak World Spiritist?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Feng’s face was filled with shock and he couldn’t help but take in a breath of cool air. In the entire continent of the Nine Provinces, there was no one who could reach the realm of Purple-cloak World Spiritist and they were like a legend. But at that instant, in front of him, a Gold-cloak World Spiritist had actually appeared, so how was it possible that Chu Feng wasn’t shocked?</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the Gold-cloak World Spiritist also cast his gaze towards Chu Feng. His eyes were like an eagle’s eyes, and like two sharp blades, they pierced through Chu Feng’s body, seeing through everything that he was, and Chu Feng had no way of resisting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This...this is the power of a Gold-cloak World Spiritist! It is too scary. Other than the Divine Lightning in my dantian, almost everything was seen through by him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Feng was greatly shocked once again and even cold sweat couldn’t help but be left behind on his forehead because he discovered that the Gold-cloak World Spiritist in front of him was truly too scary. He had never seen such a scary person. With a single glance, he saw through everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm?” And after looking at Chu Feng, even the Gold-cloak World Spiritist expressed a bit a surprise, then quickly after, he spoke with a voice of a middle-aged man, “You have actually established a contract with an Asura World Spirit at such a young age. You’re not simple! Boy, what is your relationship with this lady?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, she is my friend.” Chu Feng respectfully replied. As he faced that person, he didn’t dare to be disrespectful in any way because he was too strong. The power that he grasped was absolutely unimaginable by Chu Feng, and perhaps with a thought from him, Chu Feng would disappear like a&nbsp;strand of smoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Only a friend?” The Gold-cloak World Spiritist indifferently asked and there was a bit of suspicion in his voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, not only a friend, she is the...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She is the one whom I love. Senior, I beg you. Please let her go.” Chu Feng pleaded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let her go? It seems like you want to save her?” The Gold-cloak World Spiritist curiously asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, of course! Senior, as long as you let her go, I will be willing to do whatever you want me to do. You can torture me, but I hope that you can let her go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, when Chu Feng saw Zi Ling’s painful appearance, he could really not endure it. Even if he endured the pain for her, he would be willing to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So it is still that kind of foolish love. But you must understand clearly that when she saw my martial skill, she didn’t even consider your feelings.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Her selfishness was extremely strong and she wanted to take it herself. Is a female such as her worth it for you to love?” The Gold-cloak World Spiritist seemed to be reminding Chu Feng that Zi Ling was an extremely selfish female.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, perhaps in your perspective, she isn’t worth it, but in my eyes, she is. She is worth it for me to love her without regards of myself.” Chu Feng honestly and calmly smiled and his face was filled with sincerity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Feng didn’t truly love Zi Ling. He had always had a heart of caution towards her, so how could he love her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he didn’t want Zi Ling to be harmed. Also, he knew that if the Gold-cloak World Spiritist in front of him didn’t want him and Zi Ling to leave alive, it didn’t matter what Chu Feng said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When facing such an expert after intruding into his land and causing him to be displeased, a few simple words of pleading was absolutely not enough to move that expert’s heart to cause him to let Chu Feng and Zi Ling go.</span></p>
