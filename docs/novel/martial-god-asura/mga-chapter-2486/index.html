 <p><strong> Chapter 2486 - Chu Xuanlang</strong></p>
 <p>At that moment, practically everyone present was certain that Chu Feng’s secret skill was not stopped by Chu Feng himself. Rather, it was really stopped by someone else. Chu Feng… did not lie.</p>
 <p>The reason why the crowd was so certain was because a middle-aged man had appeared before the crowd’s sight.</p>
 <p>Although that middle-aged man possessed an ordinary appearance, a deep gaze and a stubbly beard, he did not appear to be sloppy. Instead, he gave off a mature charm.</p>
 <p>No one knew how old that man was. In fact, one could only faintly feel his aura.</p>
 <p>As such, the crowd were unable to determine what level of cultivation that man had. However, instinctively, they started to feel fear toward him.</p>
 <p>It was as if a tiger had suddenly appeared among a group of hares. Before the tiger started attacking the hares, before the tiger roared, the hares managed to smell the danger.</p>
 <p>The crowd felt that that person was at the very least a True Immortal-level expert.</p>
 <p>True Immortals, they were experts standing at the apex of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p>
 <p>Regardless of how powerful a Martial Ancestor might be, regardless of what sort of heaven-defying battle power they might possess, and regardless of what sorts of abilities they might have, True Immortals were being that they could not contend against.</p>
 <p>Back when Chu Feng was a peak Half Martial Ancestor, he could increase his cultivation to that of a Martial Ancestor temporarily after using his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings.</p>
 <p>However, such a thing was out of the question for the True Immortal Realm. The True Immortal Realm was not a realm of cultivation that one could break through by using the power of one’s Heavenly Bloodline.</p>
 <p>Thus, not to mention Chu Feng being only a rank seven Martial Ancestor right now, even if he were a rank nine Martial Ancestor and unleashed his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings to increase his battle power, he would still not be a match for a True Immortal-level expert.</p>
 <p>In short, Martial Ancestors would always be Martial Ancestors. They were beings that would never exceed True Immortals. This was the greatness of the True Immortal Realm.</p>
 <p>The True Immortal realm was the true dividing line in the path of martial cultivation. Before this dividing line, regardless of how high one’s cultivation might be, regardless of how powerful one’s abilities might be, one would forever remain a mortal.</p>
 <p>However, upon passing that dividing line, one would no longer be a mortal. Rather, one would have become an immortal. When faced with the power of an immortal, mortals would naturally be no match.</p>
 <p>Thus, after a True Immortal appeared, everyone felt that it would be impossible for Chu Feng to defeat him.</p>
 <p>However, the reason why the crowd was so astonished was not only limited to the fact that that man was very likely a True Immortal. In addition to that, it was because that man was very unfamiliar; he was someone that none of them had ever seen before.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, on that man's waist was a title plate. There were three large words written on the title plate -- Chu Heavenly Clan!!!</p>
 <p>“He’s someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, many of Chu Feng’s supporters started to worry. They all knew very well that the Chu Heavenly Clan was the overlord of an Upper Realm. To put it simply, they were the masters of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p>
 <p>Since that man from the Chu Heavenly Clan had appeared, he would naturally not look on without doing anything as Chu Feng tried to kill Chu Luxuan.</p>
 <p>After all, Chu Luxuan was not an ordinary member of the younger generation. Instead, he was a genius of the Chu Heavenly Clan.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the crowd finally realized why Chu Luxuan had laughed like that earlier.</p>
 <p>It turned out that it was because he knew that someone would come save him, that the person to die today would be Chu Feng no matter what.</p>
 <p>“Hahahaha…”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, Chu Luxuan started laughing again. This time around, not only was his laughter filled with mockery toward Chu Feng, but it was also filled with pride.</p>
 <p>As the pressure from the Ancient Era’s War Axe that was suppressing him earlier had disappeared Chu Luxuan stood up and looked at Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>The smile on his face grew more and more concentrated. At that moment, Chu Luxuan totally had the appearance of someone taking advantage of his position to bully another. However, not a single person dared to say anything regarding Chu Luxuan.</p>
 <p>The world of martial cultivators was like that In that world, it was not only one’s individual strength that mattered. One’s background, one’s clan and one’s reliance also mattered.</p>
 <p>It was Chu Luxuan’s fortune to be able to possess that sort of background. Even if others disapproved of it, what could they possibly do about it?</p>
 <p>At that moment, the crowd could only feel sorry for Chu Feng, feel sorry for him being so unlucky as to provoke a clan with such a robust background.</p>
 <p>However, right at that moment, that man shouted at Chu Luxuan angrily, “You still have the gall to laugh?”</p>
 <p>His shout not only came as a shock to Chu Luxuan, it also came as a shock to the bystanding crowd.</p>
 <p>“You’ve challenged someone to battle and been defeated. Yet you still have the nerve to laugh? Do you feel that you’re not being humiliated enough that you want to play to the gallery?” The man asked Chu Luxuan.</p>
 <p>Chu Luxuan lowered his head silently. An ashamed expression emerged on his face.</p>
 <p>“Since when did relying on another become an ability you could flaunt?” The man continued.</p>
 <p>Chu Luxuan didn’t answer. However, his face grew even more ashamed.</p>
 <p>“Answer me!” Suddenly, the man shouted sternly again.</p>
 <p>His shout caused even the bystanders to tremble in fear. As for Chu Luxuan, he was so scared that his body started to shiver all over.</p>
 <p>“Uncle Xuanlang, this Luxuan knows his mistake,” Chu Luxuan said timidly.</p>
 <p>Although Chu Luxuan admitted to his error, the man did not continue to pay attention to him. Instead, he turned his head toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Different from when he looked at Chu Luxuan, when he looked at Chu Feng, there was not the slightest trace of sternness on his face. Instead, there was a good-natured smile.</p>
 <p>“Young brother, you’re Chu Feng, right?” The man asked.</p>
 <p>“Since you already know, why bother asking?” Chu Feng answered.</p>
 <p>“Heh…” The man was not angered. Instead, his smile grew even stronger. He said, “It is merely a spar. Is there really a need to take his life?”</p>
 <p>“You’re planning to help him handle me?” Chu Feng asked. This was the question that he cared about the most.</p>
 <p>“Of course not. Merely… I hope that you can spare his life,” The man said with a faint smile.</p>
 <p>“He’s pleading for leniency? He’s not planning to attack Chu Feng?”</p>
 <p>The crowd were all surprised upon hearing those words. The reason for that was because that man not only said that sort of thing, but even his attitude was that of someone pleading. He seemed to truly not have plans to attack Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>But, he was clearly someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan. It would be one thing for him to not stand up for Chu Feng. Yet, how could he be this courteous toward Chu Feng?</p>
 <p>The crowd were truly confused. After all, if they were this man before them, they would definitely not do what he was doing.</p>
 <p>Instead, they would ruthlessly teach Chu Feng a lesson so as to avenge their clan’s younger generation.</p>
 <p>“I have a question. Was it you… who captured my two friends?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Your two friends are indeed with me. Merely, I have not captured them. Rather, I invited them.”</p>
 <p>“Actually, I have not come here today with the intention of helping Luxuan.”</p>
 <p>“Rather, I have come for you,” That man said to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“For me?” Chu Feng was surprised.</p>
 <p>“I have come especially to invite you,” The man said.</p>
 <p>“Invite me?” Chu Feng’s gaze changed slightly.</p>
 <p>Sensing that the situation was amiss, Chu Luxuan spoke out, “Uncle Xuanlang, this Chu Feng killed my older brother.”</p>
 <p>“Indeed, your older brother was killed by Chu Feng. However, that was a result of his talent being inferior. As such, there’s nothing to complain about.”</p>
 <p>“Do not forget about the reminder the clan has given you all before you all came here. The fact that I am pleading for leniency for you today is already an exception.”</p>
 <p>“If you want to avenge your older brother, I will not stop you. However, you can forget about having me help you avenge your older brother,” The man reprimanded Chu Luxuan sternly.</p>
 <p>Chu Luxuan’s face turned red after being reprimanded. Even though it was clear that he was feeling extremely unreconciled, he did not dare to refute what that man said at all.</p>
 <p>Then, that man looked to Chu Feng again and courteously said, “I nearly forgot to introduce myself. I have the same surname as you. My name is Chu Xuanlang. I am a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan.”</p>
 <p>“Very well, I can accompany you,” Chu Feng nodded. He felt sincerity from the attitude of this Chu Xuanlang.</p>
 <p>However, he would naturally not agree to accompany this Chu Xuanlang only because of that. Most importantly, it was because he believed that Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong were with him.</p>
 <p>The reason why he agreed to accompany that Chu Xuanlang was because he wanted to see Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.</p>
