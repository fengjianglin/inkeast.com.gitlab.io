 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1688 - The Dreadful Intention For Self Interest</strong></p>
 <p>“However, there is an item that I will need Third Miss’s help with,” Chu Feng suddenly said.</p>
 <p>“Benefactor, what it is? Please do not hesitate and tell me,” Luo Huan said straightforwardly.</p>
 <p>“Can you go and gather some drops of Invisible Dew so that the two of us can use them as a reference?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Even if we are to make a counterfeit, we should still make it resemble the original. If we can see what the Invisible Dew looks like, it will be easier for the two of us to make the counterfeit,” Du Wanwu said.</p>
 <p>“No problem, I will go and tell my father about this right away.”</p>
 <p>“Benefactors, please wait here for a moment. I will return immediately,” Luo Huan did not dare to hesitate and immediately left. The reason for that was because she knew that Chu Feng and Du Wanwu would be able to save their Luo Family.</p>
 <p>Thus, Luo Huan directly arrived at her father’s residence.</p>
 <p>At this moment, it was not only her father that was present in his residence. There were also some other people.</p>
 <p>Her father had a head full of white hair and a pair of sword-like eyebrows. His gaze appeared very much like the gaze of a family head.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the Luo Family’s Family Head was also the strongest individual in the Luo Family. He was a rank two Half Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>Other than Luo Huan’s father, there were four other people in the room. Two were old men who possessed cultivations of rank one Half Martial Emperor. These two people were Luo Huan’s two uncles. In the Luo Family, they were elders who possessed very high status. They could be said to be only subordinate to Luo Huan’s father and above everyone else.</p>
 <p>Other than these three Half Martial Emperors, there were also two rank nine Martial Kings. One was around fifty years old, and the other was around a hundred years old. However, both of them had the appearances of middle-aged men. These two people were Luo Huan’s oldest brother and second brother.</p>
 <p>Due to the fact that Luo Huan was extremely eager to inform her father about the matter regarding Chu Feng and Du Wanwu, she did not greet them and directly entered the room without knocking on the door.</p>
 <p>Luo Huan was overjoyed to see that the most important people in the Luo Family were all gathered here. Immediately, she stepped forward and said, “Father, uncles, big brother, second brother, our Luo Family has encountered noble people. Our Luo Family will be saved.”</p>
 <p>“Kneel on the floor!” However, before Luo Huan could finish what she wanted to say, a boundless aura appeared unexpectedly and forced her knees to the ground.</p>
 <p>The powerful aura not only caused the ground created by special rocks to be shattered, it also caused Luo Huan’s knees to bleed.</p>
 <p>“Father, what are you doing?” Luo Huan looked to her father with an expression of being wronged. She knew that the oppressive might that had forced her to kneel on the ground was her father’s oppressive might. However, she didn't know why her father was doing such a thing.</p>
 <p>“You are truly daring! You actually colluded with outsiders to kill the people from the Black Fiend. You are simply pushing our Luo Family onto the path toward destruction!”</p>
 <p>“Not only that, you actually invited the culprits that killed the Black Fiend to our Luo Family as guests. Do you want our Luo Family to be immediately eliminated by the Black Fiend?!” The Luo Family’s Family Head pointed at Luo Huan with a shivering finger and spoke with extreme anger.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Luo Huan’s complexion turned red. She was angered. She said, “Father, what are you saying?!”</p>
 <p>“It is not us who are killing the people from the Black Fiend. Rather, it was the people from the Black Fiend who were killing us! If it wasn’t for the two benefactors, you would not be able to see your daughter again!”</p>
 <p>“Yet, how could you say these sorts of words now?! How could you say that I have pushed our Luo Family onto a path toward destruction?! If it must be said, the person who has pushed our Luo Family onto a path toward destruction would be you! If you had handed over the Invisible Dew, these things would not have happened!”</p>
 <p>“Sigh, third sister, you are unaware of this. In order to preserve our Luo Family, father has already made the firm resolution to hand over the Invisible Dew.”</p>
 <p>“However, you all have killed the people from the Black Fiend. Thus, even if we are to hand over the Invisible Dew, the Black Fiend will not let us off. You have truly caused an enormous calamity,” Luo Huan’s big brother criticized her.</p>
 <p>“Enough of the rubbish. Third sister, quickly, tell us where those three people are. We will go and capture them so that we can push all of the blame onto them when the people from the Black Fiend show up,” Luo Huan’s second brother said.</p>
 <p>“That would be for the best,” Luo Huan’s big brother nodded.</p>
 <p>“Big brother, second brother, what are you saying? They are the people who saved my life! How could you do that sort of thing?!” Hearing what they said, Luo Huan was extremely enraged.</p>
 <p>“Third sister, we are only doing this because we are thinking about our Luo Family. In the end, they are only outsiders. For the sake of the continued existence of our Luo Family, what wrong is there in sacrificing the lives of three outsiders? Are you someone from our Luo Family or not?” Luo Huan’s big brother said.</p>
 <p>“However, one must behave with integrity and conscience. Furthermore, those three people, one of them is only a child,” Luo Huan was unyielding.</p>
 <p>“All of you, shut up!” Right at this moment, the Luo Family’s Family Head spoke again. He took a deep breath and then said, “Luo Huan, what your big brother and second brother said is correct. If you are still a person of our Luo Family, lead the way to them.”</p>
 <p>“Father, you must absolutely not do that. Not only should we not attack them because they have shown kindness toward us, even if we are to actually attack them, our Luo Family would still be no match for them. You all have not seen them. They are extremely powerful. They are definitely not ordinary people.”</p>
 <p>“Not to mention big brother and second brother, even if you and uncles were to act together, you all would still be no match for them,” Luo Huan urged against it with determination.</p>
 <p>“You are truly speaking highly of others and denouncing your own people! Bring us there right away. I shall see exactly who they are for you to exaggerate them in this manner.”</p>
 <p>Luo Huan’s big brother and second brother both arrived before Luo Huan. They picked her up and prepared to leave. They were planning to force Luo Huan to show them the way to capture Chu Feng, Du Wanwu and Goudan’er.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need for that.”</p>
 <p>However, right at this moment, a voice suddenly sounded. At the same time, the tightly shut door was abruptly and violently opened.</p>
 <p>At the moment when the door was opened, the people from the Luo Family noticed that there were three figures outside.</p>
 <p>“Benefactors!” Luo Huan was shocked to see these three people. The reason for that was because they were none other than Chu Feng, Du Wanwu and Goudan’er.</p>
 <p>“Du Wanwu, didn’t I say that the Luo Family would not hand over the Invisible Dew for us to use as a reference that easily?”</p>
 <p>“Merely, I didn’t expect that the people of the Luo Family would be this despicable. We saved them out of kindness, yet they actually wanted to capture us so as to push the blame onto us; they want us to die. Truly, this is the dreadful intent of self interest.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng said with a beaming smile. Even though he was very surprised by all this, he was able to accept it.</p>
 <p>Compared to Chu Feng’s calmness, Du Wanwu’s expression was extremely ugly. Evidently, he had not expected that the people of the Luo Family would act like this.</p>
 <p>“Perfect timing,” Right at this moment, Luo Huan’s big brother and second brother suddenly moved. They turned into two rays of light and, with the imposing might of rank nine Martial Kings, they charged toward Chu Feng, Du Wanwu and Goudan’er.</p>
 <p>At the same time, their hands started to move about. Numerous powerful eagle claws were being shot out from their hands. That was a martial skill. They were trying to capture Chu Feng and the others alive.</p>
 <p>Faced with the attacks of these two men, Du Wanwu did not even bother to move. As for Chu Feng, he first pulled Goudan’er behind him, and then stepped forward; he had stepped in front of Du Wanwu.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng did not attack. Instead, with a smile on his face, he quietly waited for the two men’s attacks to arrive.</p>
