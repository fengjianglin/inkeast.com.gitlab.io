 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 882 - Public Humiliation</strong></p>
 <p><span style>There was a large number of people gathered ten thousand miles away from the Gale Plains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their cultivations were not weak—most were peak Martial Lords. Although they couldn’t be called as peak experts, they were still slightly famous people who occupied their own spot in the Eastern Sea Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, they were watching a battle—a battle between the two strongest forces in the Eastern Sea Region: the Immortal Execution Archipelago and the Crippling Night Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the surface of the plains was splattered with blood. There were even some limbs lying around. Only a small portion of the people there retained a complete corpse; however, at that moment, none exhibited any signs of life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those people, other than some from the Immortal Execution Archipelago, were mostly from the Crippling Night Demon Sect. Moreover, they were all Martial Lords.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Above the sky, there were two battlefields. One was the interweaving of fire and water—their battle covered the sky and sun, and might born from their clashes was extremely terrifying. In that battlefield, there were four people fighting back and forth, endlessly switching from offense to defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two of them wore a fiery-red robe. They were clearly young men, yet there were beautiful feathers on their heads. On their bodies, there were also many precious ornaments. Their decorations made them appear neither male nor female, but more like two humanoid monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In reality, those two </span><i><span style>weren’t</span></i><span style> human—they truly were monsters, because they were Monstrous Beasts. They were the two Protectors from the Inferno Divine Bird clan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ones exchanging blows with those two Protectors were two old men. One of them had long red hair, blazing like an inferno, while the other hand long blue hair, soft like water. At that moment, they were controlling immense volumes water and fire, and fighting the two Protectors from the Inferno Divine Bird clan. They were the great and famous Water King and Fire King from the Crippling Night Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The battlefield of four Martial Kings was extremely intense. No matter the people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago, or the observers invited by the Immortal Execution Archipelago, they didn’t dare to approach them, fearful of being swirled into the uncontrollable shock waves. After all, those four were too strong. Even a single remnant shock wave would be sufficient to kill a Martial Lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Other than that battlefield, there was another one, and it was similarly eye-catching. Similarly as well, there were four people, and they were all rank eight Martial Lords. However, they were not fighting two-on-two, but one-on-three.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason it was so fascinating was because they were the publicly acclaimed peak geniuses in the Eastern Sea Region. The young master of the Immortal Execution Archipelago—Murong Xun—as well as the disciples of the Crippling Night Demon Sect’s Three Protectors—Xuan Xiaochao, You Tonghan, and Fu Fengming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, they were exchanging blows, like they did at the Depraved Valley. The difference, however, was that Murong Xun now did not have a Royal Armament. At that moment, he was holding an Incomplete Royal Armament. As for Xuan Xiaochao and the others, they were the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But even though Murong Xun only held an Incomplete Royal Armament, his fighting strength was still very strong. He alone actually forced back Xuan Xiaochao and the others, and on their bodies, there were even injuries of varying degrees. Even as all three of them fought a single person, they could still not defeat Murong Xun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone, do you see this? These are the trash of the Crippling Night Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They only know how to bully the fewer with more, and bully the weak as the strong. In these days, they have not used any few number of these despicable methods to ambush my Immortal Execution Archipelago. They are truly the epitome of shamelessness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Today, my Immortal Execution Archipelago wants to let the world know if the Crippling Night Demon Sect does not have any advantage in numbers or strength, they are no match for us.” Suddenly, a clear voice rang out—it was from an enormous warship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On that colossal warship, there were several thousand experts from the Immortal Execution Archipelago, all standing orderly. Moreover, at the forefront of the warship, there was an old man sitting who had white hair on both sides of his head, and black hair for the rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That old man’s eyes were akin to an eagle’s. They were mighty even with the lack of anger, and at that moment, he was actually sitting on ten peak Martial Lords. If one looked carefully, they would discover those ten peak Martial Lords were the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers were all bloody and bruised. Even though they were very furious, they could not rid themselves of that person’s pressure. In battle, they could only fall one after the other, and allow that old man to sit on their bodies as they endured such humiliation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But that could not be blamed on them, because the person who sat on them was a Martial King. Moreover, not a normal Martial King, but the Sixth Immortal who oversaw the Gale Plains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just in case, he too had temporarily left and followed Murong Xun and the others. So, even though the Crippling Night Demon Sect had sent two Martial Kings, the Water King and the Fire King, they were no match for the Crippling Night Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the two Protectors from the Inferno Divine Bird clan were suppressing the Fire King and Water King, the Sixth Immortal commenced a massacre. He completely slaughtered the members of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, leaving behind only the Ten Gold-cloak Brothers, Xuan Xiaochao, You Tonghan, Fu Fengming, the Water King, and the Fire King.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why isn’t that Sixth Immortal making a move to finish off the Crippling Night Demon Sect? Instead, he’s allowing them to continue fighting. Does he not fear a change in circumstances?” The Immortal Execution Archipelago was clearly able to end the battle, yet they didn’t. When they saw such a scene, some observers felt confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are truly foolish! Can’t you tell? Why else do you think the Immortal Execution Archipelago detained us and said there was a good show? This, right now, is the good show they want to show us.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He wants them to fight, and let the two Protectors from the Inferno Divine Bird clan kill off the Water King and Fire King, then let Murong Xun kill off the Three Protectors’ disciples.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“With that, not only would their strength be shown, it would even emphasize the Crippling Night Demon Sect’s powerlessness. They want to tell the entire world that if they fought on equal ground, the Crippling Night Demon Sect would be no match for the Immortal Execution Archipelago,” explained someone who understood what was happening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha, you shameless fools from the Crippling Night Demon Sect! Right now, I will not do anything! I give you a fair confrontation, and as long as you win on either battlefield, I will allow all of you to leave safely! However… I’m just afraid you won’t be able to use this chance!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oi oi oi, Water King Fire King, what are you two old things doing? Back in the day, weren’t you two so mighty? Are both of you old now? Or that you’ve always been useless, and can only scare others with the facade of the Crippling Night Demon Sect?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And you three brats, aren’t you all a bit too useless? At least the Water King and Fire King are in a fair match, but why can’t the three of you even defeat a single person? Why are you all so useless? The Three Protectors’ disciples don’t really seem to be all that impressive, huh?” The Sixth Immortal felt even smugger when he heard the crowd’s discussions. What he aimed for was this effect. He wanted to humiliate the Crippling Night Demon Sect in public.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoh. The Crippling Night Demon Sect has always been a bunch of shameless people. They only know how to ambush the Immortal Execution Archipelago’s younger generation with the old dogs who’ve cultivated for many years. They are simply cowards, don’t you think?” As Murong Xun held a large golden blade and fought Xuan Xiaochao and the others, there was no end to his sneering and mocking as his sinister face also filled itself with arrogance.</span></p>
