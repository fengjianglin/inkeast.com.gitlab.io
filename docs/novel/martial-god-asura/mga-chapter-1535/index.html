 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1535 - Meticulously Planned</strong></p>
 <p>The Cursed Soil Sect was situated in the eastern region of the Holy Land of Martialism. This place could be said to be the vastest region among all of the domains under the rule of the Nine Powers.</p>
 <p>Thus, the population of the Cursed Soil Domain could also be said to be the most numerous out of all of the domains occupied by the Nine Powers. However, recently, the population of the Cursed Soil Domain was rapidly decreasing.</p>
 <p>As for why it was decreasing, it was because of a single word, ‘captured.’</p>
 <p>“No, don’t capture my husband.”</p>
 <p>“Release my child, please, I beg of you.”</p>
 <p>“Mother, save me! Father, save me!!!”</p>
 <p>At a remote town of the Cursed Soil Domain, the sound of weeping was overflowing</p>
 <p>It turned out that a group of people had arrived at in this region and captured everyone within the town.</p>
 <p>As for this group of people, they were none other than the overlords of the Cursed Soil Domain, the people from the Cursed Soil Sect.</p>
 <p>“Puuu~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a ray of crimson light flashed past. Over three hundred people had all turned into blood. They were dead beyond dead.</p>
 <p>The blood sprinkled down like rain and ruthlessly landed onto the faces, bodies and clothes of the wailing crowd. The powerful strength actually knocked all of them down to roll all over the ground.</p>
 <p>“Let's see who dares to wail again. I’ll slaughter that person!” One of the Cursed Soil Sect’s elderly men spoke those words.</p>
 <p>Once those words left his mouth, no one dared to wail again. Obediently, the crowd allowed themselves to be captured by the people from the Cursed Soil Sect, and they were then placed into a chariot larger than even their town.</p>
 <p>“Haha, a bunch of trash. With how cowardly you all are, you’re simply not worthy of being humans,” Seeing the fearful appearances of the townspeople, the several other elderly men started to laugh.</p>
 <p>Evidently, these elderly men were the leaders of this bunch. They were all Half Martial Emperors. Their cultivations could not be said to be weak. Likely, even in the Cursed Soil Sect, they were core elder-level characters.</p>
 <p>“As the ruler of this region, instead of protecting your people, you actually kill them indiscriminately. Your Cursed Soil Sect is truly good at ruling.”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a figure landed before the crowd. This person was wearing a black cloak that covered his appearance. Even his aura was hidden. However, he landed before the six elders and spoke provocations toward them.</p>
 <p>“Little bastard, where the hell did you come from? You actually dare to involve yourself in the matters of our Cursed Soil Sect?”</p>
 <p>The elder who had just killed more than three hundred people earlier snorted coldly. Then, he waved his arm, and a paper talisman shot forth. With enormous killing intent, the paper talisman began to fly toward the black-cloaked man.</p>
 <p>That was a paper talisman refined by the Cursed Soil Sect. Although it appeared to be very ordinary, it contained the power of a martial skill. As the person who had unleashed that paper talisman was an elder at the Half Martial Emperor level, that paper talisman was capable of completely destroying a city. If it were to land on a person, it was obvious how frightening it would be.</p>
 <p>“Pow~~~”</p>
 <p>However, the black-cloaked person did not dodge the talisman at all. Instead, he extended his palm and grabbed the paper talisman. Then, he clenched his fist. “Boom,” the paper talisman exploded in his hand. However, his hand was not damaged in the slightest.</p>
 <p>“You…” Seeing this scene, the crowd from the Cursed Soil Sect were all extremely scared. The paper talisman had been extremely powerful, so much so that ordinary Half Martial Emperors would dodge as soon as they saw it. None would possibly dare to block it.</p>
 <p>Yet, this black-cloaked man not only blocked it, he even grabbed it with his hand and allowed it to explode within his palm. Even with how enormously powerful that paper talisman had been, he was not damaged in the slightest. What did that mean? This meant that this black-cloaked man was extremely powerful.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>The black-cloaked man was as fast as a demon. He did not give the people of the Cursed Soil Sect any time to ponder. With a slight sway of his body, he had already arrived before the elder that had attacked him. With a hand as sharp as a blade, he thrust it forward. “Puu,’ his hand pierced into that elderly man’s dantian. Then, he actually ruthlessly pulled out the elderly man’s dantian.</p>
 <p>“Did you know that even Sang Kun would not dare to say to me what you had just said,” After that black-cloaked man finished saying those words, his palm trembled slightly. ‘Bang,’ that old man exploded.</p>
 <p>“Run away!” Seeing that the situation was bad, the people from the Cursed Soil Sect with fast reactions immediately turned to flee.</p>
 <p>However, the black-cloaked man waved his sleeve, and a burst of martial power surged forth.</p>
 <p>“Bang, bang, bang, bang~~~”</p>
 <p>With sounds like the explosions of firecrackers, the people who were trying to flee all exploded into showers of blood. Without exception, they were all killed.</p>
 <p>“Flee? I shall see who dares to flee,” The black-cloaked man let out a mocking laugh.</p>
 <p>“Milord, please spare us, please spare us!”</p>
 <p>“We have eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai. Milord, please, please let us live!”</p>
 <p>Seeing this, the remaining people from the Cursed Soil Sect did not dare to flee. One by one, they kneeled onto the ground and began to kowtow and beg the black-cloaked man for forgiveness.</p>
 <p>“A bunch of animals. Your actions are ruthless, yet your courage is nonexistent. You all are simply unworthy of being humans,” After the black-cloaked man let out those words, he placed his hands behind his back and stepped onto the air. With one step at a time, he began to rapidly proceed toward the clear blue sky filled with white clouds.</p>
 <p>Seeing that man growing further and further away, the survivors of the Cursed Soil Sect all heaved a breath of relief. They all felt that they had managed to escape a calamity.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>However, suddenly, the black-cloaked man softly waved his sleeve. Then, an oppressive power came crushing down from the sky.</p>
 <p>“Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang~~~”</p>
 <p>Another string of explosions was heard. As blood splattered all over, the remaining survivors of the Cursed Soil Sect had all died. At the same time, the enormous chariot was also destroyed. As for the people imprisoned within it, they had all been released. There were so many people that they were like a colony of ants.</p>
 <p>It turned out that it was not only the people from this town who had been captured and placed into that chariot. The amount of people were so numerous that they numbered several millions.</p>
 <p>As the people looked to the black-cloaked man, who was gradually disappeared into the sky, they all stood there with stunned expressions. They were unable to even say a single word. Quietly, they looked to the black-cloaked man with eyes filled with worship and gratefulness.</p>
 <p>That was because they knew that it was precisely that person who had saved and released them.</p>
 <p>“Thank you for saving us, thank you for saving us.”</p>
 <p>After the black-cloaked man had disappeared, the people whom he had rescued all knelt onto the ground and began to kowtow toward him as if they were worshipping a god.</p>
 <p>“Escape quickly. Flee into the deep mountains and live in seclusion. Else, the Cursed Soil Sect will not let you all get away,” This voice sounded from the sky.</p>
 <p>Hearing that voice, the people all came to realize the gravity of their situation. Immediately, they began to either fly through the air, frantically run or take out treasures. Essentially, they were using all sorts of different methods, using their fastest methods, to escape in all directions.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the black-cloaked man had returned to the sky and above the clouds. There were five people standing at this place. As for these five individuals, they were Chu Feng and the others.</p>
 <p>The black-cloaked man took off his black cloak and revealed his appearance. It turned out that he was the Cyanwood Mountain’s headmaster, Dugu Xingfeng.</p>
 <p>“How was it, did you remember the appearances of those people?” Dugu Xingfeng turned to ask the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master.</p>
 <p>“Naturally. Here, eat this,” As the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master spoke, he opened his palm. On his palm were six pills. He handed a pill each to Dugu Xingfeng and the others.</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng, Dugu Xingfeng and the others took the pills, their bodies began to rapidly change. The change to Chu Feng’s body was the most obvious. In the blink of an eye, he had turned into that old man who had had his dantian pulled out and was then killed by Dugu Xingfeng. Even his aura was exactly the same as that old man’s.</p>
 <p>As for the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master, Dugu Xingfeng, Miao Renlong and Hong Qiang, their appearances all turned into that of the other four Cursed Soil Sect’s elders.</p>
 <p>“Never would I have thought that we would have to change our appearances to the appearances of those scum,” The World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master laughed lightly. After that, he handed the last pill to the Yan Clan’s Ancestor, “Senior, please.”</p>
 <p>“There’s no need for me to take that. After you all mix yourselves in, I will watch over you all from the shadows. If that Fiend Emperor doesn’t appear, I will not do anything. If that Fiend Emperor is to attack, I will stop him.”</p>
 <p>“You all can rest assured and focus on your rescue. While you do not have to worry too much, it will also be best that you do not create too enormous of a disturbance. If you do not have to alarm the Fiend Emperor, it would be best not to alarm him.”</p>
 <p>“Else, while alarming the Fiend Emperor alone would not be anything major, if we were to alarm the other Martial Emperors of the Cursed Soil Sacred Assembly through our fight, things would then become very difficult to deal with,” The Yan Clan’s Ancestor said.</p>
 <p>It turned out that they had already planned to disguise themselves to sneak into the Cursed Soil Sect, then find Tantai Xue to save her.</p>
