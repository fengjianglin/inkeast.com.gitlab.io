 <p><strong> Chapter 1885 - Innumerable Obstacles</strong></p>
 <p>“Oh you. After eating, you should wipe your mouth,” Princess Lingyue took out her handkerchief and began to wipe the corners of Xian Miaomiao’s mouth. She was smiling with eyes filled with gentleness.</p>
 <p>Princess Lingyue was famous for being very amiable. She would generally display her gentle side to others. However, it was only when she was with Xiao Miaomiao that she would reveal her purest gentleness.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, I have no other hobbies other than eating,” Xian Miaomiao hugged Princess Lingyue tightly. With her eyes closed, she began to rub her little face in Princess Lingyue’s embrace nonstop. Her appearance was like that of a coquettish kitten.</p>
 <p>“It’s no wonder that mother named you Miaomiao. You are truly a gluttonous kitten,” Princess Lingyue softly tapped Xian Miaomiao’s head. Suddenly, her gaze flashed, and she grabbed onto Xian Miaomiao’s shoulder. While looking Xian Miaomiao in the face, she asked, “Miaomiao, your cultivation… you’ve broken through to rank three Martial Emperor?”</p>
 <p>“Yep,” Xian Miaomiao nodded her head while smiling.</p>
 <p>“Oh you, your progress is truly too fast. It has clearly only been a short while since your last breakthrough,” Although Princess Lingyue was saying those words, she was actually extremely happy.</p>
 <p>Originally, only males were allowed to inherit the throne of the Elf King. The death of the current Elf King’s sole son had been equivalent to him having no successor to pass on the throne to. Thus, he had wanted another son the entire time. However, after Xian Miaomiao’s birth, he gave up on that thought.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because he decided to have Xian Miaomiao succeed the throne. For that, he had gathered all of the grand elders to hold a meeting with them.</p>
 <p>After learning of his intentions, the grand elders all immediately opposed it. Even though Xian Miaomiao’s father was the Elf King, he was still pressured by them.</p>
 <p>However, Xian Miaomiao’s talent was soon revealed. Her cultivation began to increase at lightning speed, a rate capable of causing people to become speechless.</p>
 <p>Under this sort of situation, the grand elders that were originally firmly opposed to Xian Miaomiao succeeding the throne no longer said anything.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because Xian Miaomiao’s talent was simply too frightening, so unimaginably frightening. For an Ancient Era’s Elf like her, even though she was a woman, it would still be understandable for her to succeed the throne.</p>
 <p>After all, the Elf King was generally always the strongest Ancient Era’s Elf. It was also only the strongest that would be qualified to sit on the throne of the Elf King.</p>
 <p>“Miaomiao, I came across a human today. Who do you think it was?” Princess Lingyue asked.</p>
 <p>“Big sister, you’re being boring. You’ve already told me that it’s a human. Yet, you still want me to guess. Are you looking down on my intelligence?” Xian Miaomiao cast a side-eye at Princess Lingyue.</p>
 <p>“Oh you. I’m trying to have you guess who that human was,” Princess Lingyue said.</p>
 <p>“Nope. I’m not doing it. I’m not interested in humans,” Xian Miaomiao curled her lips. As she spoke, she extended her hand and grabbed. Then, a plate of dimsum on a table in the distance reached her hand. She began to gulp down on the dimsum.</p>
 <p>“My my my, I wonder who it was that always mentioned that Chu Feng to me. Could it be that Chu Feng is not a human?” Princess Lingyue asked.</p>
 <p>“Aiyah?!!”</p>
 <p>“Big sister, you’re saying that it’s Chu Feng? You’ve met Chu Feng? Where at?” At that moment, Xian Miaomiao immediately grabbed onto the corner of Princess Lingyue’s clothes. She was hopping and skipping in excitement.</p>
 <p>“Look at you. If I were to tell you that he is currently within our Elf Kingdom, wouldn’t you go wild with joy?” Princess Lingyue said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“He came to our Elf Kingdom? Where’s he at? I’m going to go find him,” As Xian Miaomiao spoke, she planned to run outside to find Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Get back here. No matter what, you’re still a princess. Act a bit more reserved. Besides, didn’t you only meet him once? Why would you keep him in your mind constantly?” Princess Lingyue asked.</p>
 <p>“Big sister, you don’t understand. Chu Feng is the only human other than Qing Xuantian that managed to trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle. I am very curious about him. I want to know whether he will become the next Qing Xuantian,” Xian Miaomiao said.</p>
 <p>“There’re a lot of Ancient Era’s Immortal Needles. Furthermore, the ones outside are not hard to trigger. If it’s merely that, he will not be able to become someone like Qing Xuantian. That said, that Chu Feng does possess quite a bit of skill.”</p>
 <p>“When I saw him, I immediately noticed that he was indeed different from the other humans,” Princess Lingyue said.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, that’s right. His progress is extremely fast. I’ve heard that even Nangong Longjian is standing up for him and forced the Four Great Imperial Clans to reconcile with Chu Feng. He must’ve done so because he noticed Chu Feng’s potential,” Xian Miaomiao said.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, he’s very promising,” Princess Lingyue nodded.</p>
 <p>“Big sister, in that case, quickly tell me where Chu Feng is. I’ll go and see him,” Xian Miaomiao said.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be in such a rush. I’ll have to test him first,” Princess Lingyue said.</p>
 <p>“Test? Test Chu Feng? What for?” Xian Miaomiao asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“No, not Chu Feng. Xian Yushi,” Princess Lingyue said.</p>
 <p>“Xian Yushi?” Xian Miaomiao was completely confused.</p>
 <p>“Xian Yushi, the reason why I decide to bring him alongside me and help him train is because I discovered that his nature is the same as his older brother Xian Yuyin’s.”</p>
 <p>“That sort of nature is extremely bad. Not to mention the outsiders, it will be extremely dangerous even for us Ancient Era’s Elves.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, I wish to change him. However, I discovered that one’s nature is truly hard to change.”</p>
 <p>“This time around, I deliberately had him receive Chu Feng and hinted some things to him. I wish to see whether he will choose correctly or not.”</p>
 <p>“If he chooses correctly, then it will be fine. In the future, regardless of what he wants to do, I will not concern myself with it.”</p>
 <p>“However, if he chooses incorrectly, his nature must be suppressed. We absolutely cannot allow for a second Xian Yuyin to appear,” Princess Lingyue said.</p>
 <p>“I understand. But, big sister, it’s not that I’m finding fault with you, but you’re simply wasting time. That Xian Yushi will definitely disappoint you. He simply possesses the same sort of nature as his older brother,” Xian Miaomiao said.</p>
 <p>“If that is the case, there’s nothing that can be done. I have already given him his chance,” Princess Lingyue said.</p>
 <p>…………</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng was still waiting outside of the Elf Kingdom’s city’s gate.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng did not expect that he would have to wait from dusk till dawn.</p>
 <p>Yet, even though it was already dawn now, Chu Feng did not inquire of the guards as to where Xian Yushi had gone off to, nor did he leave the premises. Instead, he continued to wait.</p>
 <p>When noon came, an Ancient Era’s Elf guard walked out and brought Chu Feng to the palace where Xian Yushi lived.</p>
 <p>“Aiyo, Chu Feng, I am truly sorry. I was too tired last night. After I finished taking care of things, I fell asleep upon my return.”</p>
 <p>“After I finished eating my breakfast and taking care of things, I kept feeling like I had forgotten something. It was only after thinking about it very hard that I remembered that I had forgotten about you,” Xian Yushi said with a beaming smile.</p>
 <p>He was simply insulting Chu Feng with his words. He was saying that Chu Feng was so insignificant that not only had he forgotten Chu Feng’s existence, it had even taken him a great amount of effort just to recall Chu Feng’s existence.</p>
 <p>“Heh…” Chu Feng smiled lightly at Xian Yushi’s insults. He did not take them too deeply to heart. The reason for that was because he had already anticipated that Xian Yushi would deliberately make things difficult for him.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you must be hungry right? Come, try out the culinary delicacies that I’ve prepared for you,” Xian Yushi handed a bowl from the table to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing the bowl he had been handed, Chu Feng started to frown. Inside that bowl was a black paste-like substance. Furthermore, it was bubbling nonstop. That was simply not food. Instead, it was poison.</p>
