 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1852 - Luring A Snake Out Of Its Hole</strong></p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, it is not that I do not wish to tell you. Rather, I truly do not know much about that senior.”</p>
 <p>“Back then, he had helped our World Spiritist Alliance and saved my life. Thus, when he entrusted Lil Mei to be, I naturally did my best to look after her.”</p>
 <p>“As for his identity, truth be told, I truly do not know anything at all. In fact, I do not even know his name.</p>
 <p>“However, I personally think that he is one of the top existences in the Holy Land of Martialism.”</p>
 <p>“As for Lil Mei, since she is his disciple, there should not be anyone that would dare to touch her. If anyone were to truly dare to touch Lil Mei, they would incur great troubles for themselves. Thus, you do not have to worry about Lil Mei’s safety,” The Left Reverend said.</p>
 <p>“Thank you senior,” Chu Feng nodded. However, he became even more curious as to the identity of that blind old man. He truly never expected that the old man who was thought to be a madman in the Eastern Sea Region was actually such a powerful existence in the Holy Land of Martialism.</p>
 <p>Afterward, with the reasoning that he possessed an important matter to take care of, Chu Feng left the World Spiritist Alliance. After Chu Feng left, the World Spiritist Alliance immediately activated their grand defensive formation. After that, all the people from the World Spiritist Alliance ended up living their daily lives within the World Spiritist Alliance.</p>
 <p>That said, the World Spiritist Alliance would never forget that they would have been completely massacred should Chu Feng not have appeared today. Thus, Chu Feng became their great benefactor that had saved their World Spiritist Alliance.</p>
 <p>At the moment when the majority of the people were feeling extremely grateful toward Chu Feng, there was also a small group of people that were feeling an endless amount of guilt, shame and fear.</p>
 <p>Those people were the people that tried to deliberately make things difficult for Chu Feng when he had just arrived at the World Spiritist Alliance.</p>
 <p>There were both elders and disciples in this group. Back then, they absolutely had not placed Chu Feng in their eyes. That was the reason why they had dared to bully and humiliate him.</p>
 <p>Currently, they remained the same as when they had first met Chu Feng. The elders were still elders, and the disciples were still disciples. However, Chu Feng had became their great benefactor that had saved their World Spiritist Alliance. Chu Feng’s strength was not only above their Alliance Master’s, his strength was also above that of the World Spiritist Immortal. Likely, even if the entire World Spiritist Alliance were to fight against Chu Feng, they would still be no match for him.</p>
 <p>At this moment, they felt extremely guilty and ashamed. They were regretting their decision to do that sort of thing to Chu Feng. They felt that they possessed eyes, but had failed to recognize Mount Tai.</p>
 <p>In addition to that, they were also feeling a lingering fear because of what they had done to Chu Feng. After all, with Chu Feng’s current strength, if he wanted to take their lives, even the World Spiritist Immortal would not be able to stop him. Furthermore, with Chu Feng’s current status, if he insisted on taking their lives, the World Spiritist Immortal would simply not try to stop him at all.</p>
 <p>They knew very well that between minor characters like themselves and Chu Feng, the World Spiritist Immortal would definitely choose Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, they were also extremely glad. They were rejoicing that Chu Feng was not such a narrow-minded individual. Else, they would not be able to continue living right now. Thus, at the moment when they were feeling guilty and ashamed, they also felt a sense of adoration for Chu Feng from the bottoms of their hearts.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng did not know what the people from the World Spiritist Alliance were thinking. He had not forgotten his true purpose in coming to the Alliance Domain because of what happened with the World Spiritist Alliance.</p>
 <p>Thus, after journeying for some time, Chu Feng arrived at the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest. The Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest appeared to be the same as before. There had not been much of a change.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng did not disturb anyone. With his current situation, it was better that he have as little contact with others as was possible. Else, he might end up implicating them in the future.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng stealthily arrived before the cave that contained the crystal coffin.</p>
 <p>That crystal coffin had been hidden by Hong Qiang through the use of a concealment formation. Without the key to the formation, it was very difficult to reveal the crystal coffin.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng stood before the concealment formation and waved his sleeve. Then, the empty space before him began to change, and revealed waves like the surface of a lake. Soon, the crystal coffin and that gravestone appeared before him.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had undone the concealment formation without using the key that had been given to him by Hong Qiang. After all, the current Chu Feng was already a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. Hong Qiang’s techniques would not be able to stop him.</p>
 <p>As Chu Feng looked to the crystal coffin and saw that beautiful woman who still looked like a celestial fairy, great waves surged forth in Chu Feng’s heart.</p>
 <p>When Chu Feng first saw that woman, he was still extremely weak. At that time, Martial Emperors were unfathomable existences to him.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng now possessed the strength to kill rank two Martial Emperors. Furthermore, he also knew the name of this woman. She was Duan Qirou.</p>
 <p>“Senior Duan, I am truly sorry. This junior should not have disturbed your rest. Merely, you are truly capable of helping me. Thus, I have no choice but to disturb your rest.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, if you can see this from the heavens, you should also wish to be reunited with Senior Duan, right?”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng first bowed to Duan Qirou’s corpse. After all, she had hidden herself in this place. For Chu Feng to move her coffin, it was inevitably not too good of a thing to do.</p>
 <p>Afterward, Chu Feng set up a spirit formation. After finishing his spirit formation, Chu Feng lightly shouted, “In!”</p>
 <p>Both the crystal coffin and that gravestone ended up being sucked into that spirit formation. Then, Chu Feng formed hand seals with his his hands, and the spirit formation began to shrink in size. It turned into the size of a palm before entering Chu Feng’s Cosmos Sack.</p>
 <p>The crystal coffin and gravestone were extremely extraordinary. Likely, ordinary rank two Martial Emperors would not be able to move them. However, it was different for Chu Feng. After all, Chu Feng was a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. Furthermore, the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram contained many powerful spirit formations that were extinct to others. Thus, this crystal coffin was already not at all an issue to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>The spirit formations contained within the Nine Spirits Divine Diagram were truly very miraculous. For example, there was the spirit formation that summoned several hundred Martial Emperor-level ferocious beasts which Chu Feng had used at the World Spiritist Alliance. Then, there was the spirit formation he had just used to remove the crystal coffin and the gravestone. Both of them were spirit formations that no ordinary world spiritist possessed. However, Chu Feng had grasped both of them.</p>
 <p>After retrieving the crystal coffin, Chu Feng began to hurry back to the World’s Hidden Valley without stopping. Merely, before he arrived at the World’s Hidden Valley, Chu Feng suddenly stopped.</p>
 <p>Using his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng had discovered a layer of hidden sensing formations. As long as Chu Feng continued onward, he would have triggered that formation. At that time, someone would come to know of his coordinates for a short period of time.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on? This this spirit formation wasn’t here earlier,” Eggy said.</p>
 <p>“Let me carefully inspect it,” Chu Feng began to carefully inspect the spirit formation, and discovered that this spirit formation was set around the World’s Hidden Valley. It had sealed both the sky and the ground leading to the World’s Hidden Valley. As long as Chu Feng wished to return to the World’s Hidden Valley, he must definitely pass through that concealed sensing formation.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, this is fishy. Could it be that someone’s lying in ambush for you?” The alert Eggy said.</p>
 <p>“That’s most likely the case. Eggy, who do you think it is?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“It’s definitely not the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts. After all, only Yaojiao Guang and Yaojiao Tingyu know that you’ve come here. They would not betray you.”</p>
 <p>“It should also not be the Four Clans. If it were them, they would not use this sort of cheap trick. Likely, when you discovered this spirit formation, they would’ve already surrounded you.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, the way I see it, there must definitely be someone from the World’s Hidden Valley that wants to plot against you. What do you think?” Eggy said.</p>
 <p>“I am of the same opinion. After all, I also possess enemies in the World’s Hidden Valley”, Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“You’re talking about Song Yuheng? But wasn’t Yin Gongfu the only one that knew that you left the World’s Hidden Valley?” Eggy said.</p>
 <p>“Senior Yin will definitely not have betrayed me. I trust him. However, Senior Yin was not the only one that saw me leaving this place that day,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“You’re talking about Yin Gongfu’s servant?” Eggy asked.</p>
 <p>“He’s most likely Song Yuheng’s spy,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“That’s very possible. In that case, what do you plan to do?” Eggy asked.</p>
 <p>“For something like this, it would be extremely easy for me to break through it. However, I am not going to.” As Chu Feng spoke, he walked over and triggered the concealed formation.</p>
 <p>“Boy, you’re planning to lure the snake out from its hole?” Eggy asked with a beaming smile. She was not worried for Chu Feng. Instead, she had an expression of anticipation.</p>
