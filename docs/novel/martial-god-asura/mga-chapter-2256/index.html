 <p><strong> Chapter 2256 - What Is Your Motive</strong></p>
 <p>“Lord Valley Master, Chu Luyang was precisely killed by this child,” Li Rui’s master replied.</p>
 <p>“However, with his cultivation, how could he possibly possess the strength to kill Chu Luyang?” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master revealed a puzzled expression.</p>
 <p>“Lord Valley Master, this child used despicable means to murder Chu Luyang,” Li Rui’s master said.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng wished that he could spit at Li Rui’s master’s face.</p>
 <p>He thought to himself, ‘This old fart truly dares to say anything. He actually started to put the label of despicable on my head.’</p>
 <p>“You really killed Chu Luyang?” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master turned to ask Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>It was not as simple as a mere question; the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master was also observing Chu Feng. He was trying to see whether or not Li Rui’s master had used any special martial techniques to forcibly restrict Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>If Li Rui’s master had truly used some sort martial technique to restrict Chu Feng, this Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master would naturally be able to tell with a single glance.</p>
 <p>However, this was also the reason why Li Rui’s master was clever. He seemed to knew this Valley Master very well, and knew that he would observe Chu Feng to determine whether or not Chu Feng had been restricted.</p>
 <p>As such, he had not used martial techniques to suppress Chu Feng, and instead meticulously prepared that medicinal pellet for Chu Feng to be forced to take.</p>
 <p>As for the result, it would naturally be the same as what Li Rui’s master had anticipated. The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley master did not manage to detect the existence of the medicinal pellet.</p>
 <p>“I am asking you whether or not you killed Chu Luyang,” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master asked once again.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this, Li Rui’s master tried to speak so that he could decide Chu Feng’s crimes. However, to his surprise, Chu Feng actually nodded.</p>
 <p>He had pleaded guilty?</p>
 <p>Li Rui’s master was very shocked to see that Chu Feng had actually nodded to it. Originally, he thought that even if Chu Feng couldn't speak, he would definitely not plead guilty.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng had actually pleaded guilty. This made Li Rui’s master very confused. He did not understand what Chu Feng was thinking.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Chu Feng have nodded, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master sighed and said, “Chu Luyang is, after all, a member of the Chu Heavenly Clan. As he was a subordinate of our Sunset Cloud Valley, I must provide him with justice,”</p>
 <p>“That is why this subordinate wished to ask Lord Valley Master to convict this Chu Feng,” Li Rui’s master pleaded.</p>
 <p>“Is there even a need for me for something like this? According to the laws of our Sunset Cloud Valley, those that dare to kill people of our Sunset Cloud Valley are all to…”</p>
 <p>Before the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master could finish his words, an aged old lady hurried out from within the palace. She said, “Lord Valley Master, this is bad! Lady Yan’s illness has relapsed again!”</p>
 <p>“My mother’s illness has relapsed again?” Hearing those words, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master hurriedly and worriedly stood up from his seat.</p>
 <p>He had had an extremely calm expression earlier. However, at this moment, his face was covered with panic.</p>
 <p>It could be seen that this Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master was a filial son. Else, he would not panic like that after finding out that his mother’s illness had relapsed.</p>
 <p>“Elder Tuoba, I have ordered you to ask for an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, have you managed to find one?!” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master asked Li Rui’s master.</p>
 <p>“Lord Valley Master, regarding this… Immortal-cloak World Spiritists are truly too difficult to find. This subordinate is incompetent. So far, I have yet to manage to successfully petition one,” Li Rui’s master said with an ashamed expression.</p>
 <p>However, no one noticed that Li Rui’s master took a stealthily glance at Chu Feng when he said those words.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng noticed his gaze. From that gaze, Chu Feng saw a sinister smile.</p>
 <p>He was smiling in complacence.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng came to a realization. Not only was the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master a person fond of talents, he was also someone who urgently needed the assistance of an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist to help cure his mother’s illness.</p>
 <p>In this sort of situation, if the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master found out that Chu Feng was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, Chu Feng would definitely be saved.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng was unable to speak. He could only watch as the opportunity to survive slipped past him without him being able to grab onto it.</p>
 <p>That was the reason why Li Rui’s master was so complacent. He was feeling proud of how quick-witted he felt himself to be.</p>
 <p>“Go, go and ask for for an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist again. No matter what, you must successfully petition one,” After the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master said those words, he followed that old lady and began to proceed toward the inside of the palace. Evidently, his mother was located inside the palace.</p>
 <p>“Lord Valley Master, then, what about this child?” Li Rui’s master hurriedly asked.</p>
 <p>“Is there even a need to ask? Kill him!!!” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master shouted.</p>
 <p>“Yes, Milord,” At this moment, Li Rui’s master once again revealed an extremely complacent smile.</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, Chu Feng suddenly spoke. “Lord Valley Master, you wish to help cure your mother’s illness, no? Perhaps myself would be able to help,”</p>
 <p>“This!!!”</p>
 <p>Once Chu Feng spoke, Li Rui’s master’s expression immediately changed. He was frightened green in the face.</p>
 <p>He truly could not understand how Chu Feng was able to speak after he was fed that medicinal pellet.</p>
 <p>He had clearly heard that medicinal pellet to be something that even Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists would not be able to undo.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he had only just become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. Furthermore, he was also an Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. No matter what, he should not be able to undo the effects of that medicinal pellet.</p>
 <p>Exactly what was going on? Why was he able to speak?</p>
 <p>“What did you say? You can cure my mother’s illness?” At this moment, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master turned his sharp gaze toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng felt killing intent in the gaze of that Valley Master.</p>
 <p>Evidently, this Valley master did not believe that Chu Feng possessed the ability to treat his mother’s illness. Thus, the first thing that came into his mind was that Chu Feng was deceiving him.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, as he was worried and vexed for his mother’s illness, his mood was extremely bad. As such, he would not be able to tolerate anyone deceiving him at such a time.</p>
 <p>“Lord Valley Master, do not listen to the crazy and unfounded ravings of this child. How could he possibly be able to treat Lady Yan’s illness?”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Li Rui’s master started to panic. He hurriedly walked toward Chu Feng and used his boundless martial power to restrict Chu Feng, preventing him from babbling nonsense again.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right at this moment, boundless spirit power suddenly burst forth from Chu Feng’s body.</p>
 <p>It was Immortal-level spirit power. At this moment, not only was the spirit power hovering around Chu Feng, it was also being controlled by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Being enveloped by this spirit power, Chu Feng’s aura became completely different. It was as if he were a grand expert.</p>
 <p>“Lord Valley Master, do you recognize this?” Chu Feng asked loudly.</p>
 <p>“Damn it!” Seeing that Chu Feng had actually unleashed his Immortal level spirit power, Li Rui’s master started to panic even more. He unleashed his surging martial power with the intention of beating down Chu Feng’s spirit power.</p>
 <p>“Stop!!!”</p>
 <p>However, right at this moment, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master shouted furiously.</p>
 <p>Once that furious shout was heard, a boundlessly powerful oppressive might swept forth. It not only forcibly scattered Li Rui’s master’s oppressive might, it also forced Li Rui’s master back several steps, nearly knocking him to the ground.</p>
 <p>“Tuoba Shangshui, is this how you handle things?!!!” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master pointed at Li Rui’s master and shouted furiously.</p>
 <p>Seeing that the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master was furious, Li Rui’s master hurriedly kneeled to the ground. He said, “Lord Valley Master, this subordinate does not know what he did wrong.”</p>
 <p>“You do not know what you did wrong? I asked you to go and petition an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist to treat my mother’s illness.”</p>
 <p>“In the end, after seeking and asking for so long, you’ve yet to successfully request an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. If that was even true.”</p>
 <p>“However, right now, there is clearly an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist standing right before you. Why did you not tell me about this?”</p>
 <p>“Exactly what is your motive?” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master stared at Li Rui’s master furiously.</p>
 <p>This Valley Master was truly angered.</p>
