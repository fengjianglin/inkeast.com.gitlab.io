 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1284 - Final Confrontation</strong></p>
 <p>“Mortal Taboo: Illusion Light Technique.”</p>
 <p>Seeing that the situation had taken a turn for the worse, Chu Feng immediately activated his powerful movement martial skill and began to rapidly fly backward. At the same time, the boundless martial power within his body also began to violently surge forth and started to rotate about in a special trajectory.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was using his movement martial skill to help himself obtain some extra time so that he could use his strongest attack, the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash.</p>
 <p>“Those are… our Cyanwood Mountain’s Earthen Taboo: Mirage Technique and the Earthen Taboo: Fragmentary Sky Arrows!!!”</p>
 <p>When they saw the attack that Bai Yunxiao used, not to mention Chu Feng, even the Cyanwood Mountain’s management elders turned pale with fright.</p>
 <p>As they were very powerful experts, not only were they able to clearly see Bai Yunxiao’s attack, they were able to, in a split second, determine what martial skills Bai Yunxiao had used.</p>
 <p>As management elders of the Cyanwood Mountain, they managed to determine with a single glance that what Bai Yunxiao used were two of the Cyanwood Mountain’s notable martial skills.</p>
 <p>Of these two martial skills, one was an illusion whereas the other was an actual attack. If these two martial skills were to be used simultaneously, not only would they possess an extremely powerful destructive force, they would also affect one’s opponent’s judgement and even trap them within an illusion in an instant, making it so that they could only sit and wait for death.</p>
 <p>While these two martial skills were very powerful, both of them were extremely difficult to learn. To simultaneously use both of these martial skills was even more difficult and most definitely not something that any ordinary person was capable of doing.</p>
 <p>In fact, there were many elders in the Cyanwood Mountain that had yet to step into the Half Martial Emperor level who were unable to use these two martial skills simultaneously. From this, one could tell how difficult it was to do so.</p>
 <p>However, Bai Yunxiao actually managed to do it. Not only did this display how outstandingly talented Bai Yunxiao was, it also meant that a great catastrophe would soon befall Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>After all, the distance between Chu Feng and Bai Yunxiao was extremely close. From the might of the Earthen Taboo: Mirage Technique and the Earthen Taboo: Fragmentary Sky Arrows, it seemed that Chu Feng simply had no way of escaping death.</p>
 <p>“This Bai Yunxiao is truly outrageous. Chu Feng had already stopped, yet he actually used such a ruthless method to mount a sneak attack. He should be punished!”</p>
 <p>At this moment, the subordinates of Half Martial Emperor White Ape quickly made preparations to save Chu Feng. Not only did they plan to save Chu Feng, they also planned to properly punish Bai Yunxiao.</p>
 <p>After all, all of them had managed to see what had happened earlier. Chu Feng knew when to stop, and did not continue attacking Bai Yunxiao, instead deciding to let him go once his victory was determined. Thus, Chu Feng was being extremely benevolent and did what he should do in that kind of situation.</p>
 <p>Yet, Bai Yunxiao actually took advantage of Chu Feng turning his back to him to suddenly launch such a fierce attack. This sort of mindset and method was truly that of a vile character.</p>
 <p>“Humph.”</p>
 <p>However, right at the moment when the management elders discovered that the situation was bad and prepared to act to rescue Chu Feng, Chu Feng actually snorted coldly and stopped moving backwards.</p>
 <p>With a cold voice, he said, “Bai Yunxiao, you have brought this upon yourself.”</p>
 <p>Once he finished saying those words, Chu Feng’s surroundings started to tremble. The trembling was originally very weak. However, it quickly became very violent. It was so much so that spatial cracks appeared in the sky. An extremely powerful aura was suppressing the space surrounding Chu Feng so much that it was about to shatter.</p>
 <p>While this change was occurring, boundless King-level martial powers from the world began to gather around Chu Feng like hurricanes. In the end, these vast violent martial powers were all absorbed by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Boom.”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, coldness flashed through Chu Feng’s eyes. At the same time, a very sharp aura emerged from them.</p>
 <p>Following that, a muffled ‘bang’ was heard as a crimson-colored gaseous substance burst out from Chu Feng’s body.</p>
 <p>That gaseous substance was extremely strange. Its shape was similar to that of a sharp blade. Yet, there also appeared to be densely packed and innumerable snake-like things moving within it. Like little demons from the underworld, those snake-like things were emitting wails like ghosts and howls like wolves; it was an extremely terrifying sound.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, when the crimson-colored gaseous substance appeared, the color of the sky immediately changed. Not only did the gaseous substance contain an extremely frightening power, its speed was also astonishingly fast. In the blink of an eye, the crimson-colored gaseous substance covered every corner of the region.</p>
 <p>“That special energy, it’s the Firmament Energy.”</p>
 <p>“Could it be that Chu Feng managed to master the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Shield?”</p>
 <p>When they sensed the energy emitted by Chu Feng, the management elders of the Martial Skills Department were all shocked.</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, Bai Yunxiao’s violent attack arrived before Chu Feng and was less than three meters away from him.</p>
 <p>Right when Chu Feng was about to be struck by Bai Yunxiao’s attack, he suddenly shouted, “First slash!”</p>
 <p>His shout was like the command of a ruler. As that strange and frightening gaseous substance wailed like ghosts and howled like wolves, bringing with it an enormous amount of destructive power, it gathered toward Bai Yunxiao’s incoming Earthen Taboo Martial Skills and collided with them head-on.</p>
 <p>“Woosh,” a crimson-colored ray of light flashed past, and then a crimson-colored criss-cross-shaped slash formed. It landed on the Bai Yunxiao’s frightening martial skills.</p>
 <p>“Boom.”</p>
 <p>After a single strike, Bai Yunxiao’s Earthen Taboo Martial Skills that contained a boundless amount of power actually turned into a vast amount of mist and violent energy ripples. It had been dispersed!</p>
 <p>Bai Yunxiao’s combined attack using two Mortal Taboo Martial skills was actually easily defeated by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>This scene stunned those management elders who had thought that Chu Feng would be facing a life and death crisis. Shock filled their wide open eyes.</p>
 <p>“Second slash!”</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng did not stop with only this, nor did he give anyone time to react. He once again shouted, and another crimson-colored slash appeared. This crimson-colored slash began to charge toward Bai Yunxiao.</p>
 <p>Before the might of that crimson-colored slash, not to mention the places that it passed, even the space before it began to shatter and crumble like mirrors.</p>
 <p>“Regardless of what other methods you might possess, you will not be able to win against me today!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that his attack was defeated and that Chu Feng’s incoming attack was even stronger than the one before, Bai Yunxiao was greatly enraged.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Bai Yunxiao’s body was flickering with light and emitting hot steam. Several wrinkles appeared in the corners of his eyes and on his forehead. In an instant, he aged several years. From the appearance of a twenty-some year old, he now appeared like a thirty-some[1.Rebel01: who has wrinkles at 30??? hahahah] year old man.</p>
 <p>Not only did his appearance age, his battle power also increased, and his attacks became much more ferocious. The countless amount of weapons that he formed seemed to be invincible as they were shot toward Chu Feng’s attack, splitting it apart.</p>
 <p>“Yunxiao, he’s, he’s actually burning his own lifespan?!” When they saw this scene, the management elders from the Punishment Department were unable to contain themselves from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.</p>
 <p>While Bai Yunxiao’s battle power increased, he had to pay a very large price for it. Not only did he wear down his body, he was also burning his life energy. This sort of method was comparable to using Forbidden Medicines. In fact, the price one had to pay was actually even greater.</p>
 <p>However, what was done could not be undone. As Bai Yunxiao had already used such a method to insist on defeating Chu Feng, regardless of how unwilling the Punishment Department’s management elders were, there was nothing they could do about it. The only thing that they wished for right now was for Bai Yunxiao to quickly defeat Chu feng and gain victory in this battle.</p>
 <p>“Woosh, woosh, woosh.”</p>
 <p>With his life as the price, Bai Yunxiao had managed to obtain a considerable amount of power.</p>
 <p>His current Earthen Taboo: Mirage Technique and Earthen Taboo: Fragmentary Sky Arrows were much stronger than before. After they broke apart Chu Feng’s second slash, they continued onward and broke apart Chu Feng’s third slash.</p>
 <p>However, Bai Yunxiao had still underestimated Chu Feng. Chu Feng’s Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash contained a total of nine slashes. Furthermore, each and every slash was stronger and fiercer than the previous one.</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng’s first slash, second slash and third slash were defeated, Chu Feng cast the fourth slash and the fifth slash one after the other.</p>
 <p>When Chu Feng cast the sixth slash, an extremely loud ‘boom’ was heard. The surrounding space was actually shattered completely. Chu Feng’s sixth slash not only completely destroyed Bai Yunxiao’s attack, it even broke apart his Divine Power.</p>
