 <p><strong>Chapter 2569 - To Be Even</strong></p>
 <p>As for Zi Xunyi, it was also obvious that the current her had no heart to pay attention to the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, she was still seriously injured. Even if she were to chase after the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, she would not necessarily be able to stop him.</p>
 <p>Thus, in such a situation, Chu Feng would rather have the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief escape than to have more people injured.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, hahahaha…”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief whose flesh had been completely bitten away and whose bones were broken by Ying Mingchao’s bites suddenly started to laugh.</p>
 <p>“Go ahead and torture me. It doesn’t matter how much you torture me, after all, I will soon die,” The Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief mocked.</p>
 <p>Since he knew that he would not survive either way, he was able to accept his situation.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Ying Mingchao was stunned. He stopped biting at the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.</p>
 <p>No one knew exactly what Ying Mingchao was thinking just then.</p>
 <p>“Hahahaha, Ying Mingchao, in the end, you are unable to do anything to me. I am still the one in control of my fate.”</p>
 <p>Seeing Ying Mingchao’s reaction, the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief started to laugh even more frantically. Although he was going to die, he felt that he had not lost the battle. Rather, he was acting as if he was the winner.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Ying Mingchao spoke coldly, “In that case, I will extinguish your entire clan before your death.”　　</p>
 <p>“You…” Hearing those words, the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief immediately let out an incomparably alarmed voice.</p>
 <p>He was scared. He was extremely scared. As he knew that he was going to die, he did not care about his own life.</p>
 <p>However, the Kong Heavenly Clan was still something that he worried deeply for. In fact, the reason why he was willing to sacrifice himself was all so that he could preserve his Kong Heavenly Clan.</p>
 <p>“Ying Mingchao, don’t, you absolutely must not.”</p>
 <p>“It is my fault. Everything is my fault. I am the one at fault for everything back then. I am also the one at fault for everything today.”</p>
 <p>“This matter is unrelated to my clansmen. They are all innocent. Please, you must not attack them,” In panic, the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief started to beg Ying Mingchao.</p>
 <p>However, Ying Mingchao completely ignored the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. He slowly stood up and said to him, “Open your eyes and watch carefully.”</p>
 <p>After saying those words, Ying Mingchao’s body started to emit a dark green radiance.</p>
 <p>“Rumble, rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>The dark green radiance started to spin like a whirlwind. With Ying Mingchao as the eye of the storm, the dark green radiance started to sweep forth.</p>
 <p>Wherever it passed, everything was destroyed. In merely an instant, the entire Kong Heavenly Clan was razed to the ground.</p>
 <p>“No!”</p>
 <p>“Nooo!!”</p>
 <p>“Noooooo!!!”</p>
 <p>The Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief let out an incomparably furious roar.</p>
 <p>Not only was his roar filled with anger, it was also filled with grief.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because the Kong Heavenly Clan that was originally filled with countless buildings, a majestic atmosphere and had resembled a paradise on earth, then it had been turned into a hell on earth.</p>
 <p>Thick smoke covered the entire region. It was smoke from the destroyed buildings. Even with multiple layers of spirit formations, they were unable to withstand the might of Ying Mingchao’s attack.</p>
 <p>Beneath the rubble of the buildings were countless corpses. Regardless of whether they were men, women, young or old, they were all dead.</p>
 <p>Apart from the people that had escaped the Kong Heavenly Clan earlier, Ying Mingchao’s attack left a destructive impact upon the Kong Heavenly Clan.</p>
 <p>“This…”</p>
 <p>The impact of Ying Mingchao’s attack was simply too great. Even Chu Feng felt muddle-headed.</p>
 <p>When Chu Feng opened his eyes again, he discovered the current state of the Kong Heavenly Clan.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng suddenly recalled the scene of the extermination of the Chu Family.</p>
 <p>However, the Chu Family was merely a small family. As for the Kong Heavenly Clan, it was a colossus.</p>
 <p>All those lives were instantly obliterated. The degree of destruction was hard to believe.</p>
 <p>“They brought it upon themselves,” Zi Xunyi said to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>It turned out that Zi Xunyi had stood before Chu Feng to block Ying Mingchao’s attack. Otherwise, even Chu Feng might not have survived the impact of that attack.</p>
 <p>“I’ll kill you!!!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a body of light shot out from the devastated remains of the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.</p>
 <p>That body of light was golden, and was flickering with enormous power.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, that body of light had the same appearance as the original appearance of the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. From his expression, Chu Feng was able to tell how furious the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was.</p>
 <p>It was understandable. Although the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief possessed a very bad moral character, he was someone who valued his clan enormously.</p>
 <p>Else, he would not have been willing to sacrifice his own life for his clan.</p>
 <p>Yet now, his clan was gone. The thing that he wanted to protect the most was gone.</p>
 <p>He now had nothing left. Thus, how could he not be furious?</p>
 <p>“Paaa~~~”</p>
 <p>However, faced with the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief filled with murderous desire, Ying Mingchao merely pushed forth his palm and grabbed the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief by the throat.</p>
 <p>With merely a single clench of Ying Mingchao’s palm, the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief reacted as if his life had been captured.</p>
 <p>Although rage and murderous desire still filled his face, his aura was much inferior to before.</p>
 <p>“Go and accompany your clansmen in death,” After saying those word, Ying Mingchao tightly clenched his grasp.</p>
 <p>“Bang.” The body of light that the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had turned into shattered into pieces.</p>
 <p>Following that, the aura of the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief also disappeared.</p>
 <p>He had died. Following that muffled explosion, he was utterly killed.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Ying Mingchao seemed to have regained his calm. He took a glance at his surroundings. From his eyes, a trace of regret could be seen.</p>
 <p>That was understandable. Ying Mingchao was not an evildoer. If his head had not been filled with rage earlier, he would not have killed so many innocents.</p>
 <p>Innocent, of course they were innocent. Regardless of what their Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had done, regardless of how many evildoers there were in the Kong Heavenly Clan, it remained that there were still good individuals in the Kong Heavenly Clan, and even many newly-born children.</p>
 <p>They had all definitely died innocently.</p>
 <p>However, the world of martial cultivators was cruel. The weak were prey to the strong, and battles of grudges were common things.</p>
 <p>Strength was everything in the world of martial cultivators. When the weak died, they had no way to argue for justifications.</p>
 <p>Today, the Kong Heavenly Clan was defeated. As such, the calamity of a clan extermination arrived upon them.</p>
 <p>However, what about over a thousand years ago?</p>
 <p>When Ying Mingchao was defeated, what happened to his Hero City?</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was able to very well imagine how Hero City had also suffered the calamity of utter elimination back then.</p>
 <p>Although he felt slightly regretful, Ying Mingchao did not linger there forever. Instead, he hurriedly arrived beside Zi Xunyi.</p>
 <p>“Xunyi, are you alright?”</p>
 <p>“Quickly, take this medicinal pellet. Let me help you heal your injuries.”</p>
 <p>Ying Mingchao immediately supported Zi Xunyi. Furthermore, he handed her a medicinal pellet and helped her swallow it. Then, waves of gentle spirit power began to flow from his palm into Zi Xunyi’s body.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, Ying Mingchao was extremely worried for Zi Xunyi.</p>
 <p>However, Zi Xunyi swung her body and struggled free from Ying Mingchao.</p>
 <p>“Xunyi, are you still angry at me?” Ying Mingchao asked nervously.</p>
 <p>“Mingchao, I came to save you today of my own accord.”</p>
 <p>“However, Zhenping was unrelated to this.”</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry, I cannot meet you again.”</p>
 <p>“You also do not have to come find me again.”</p>
 <p>“From this point onward, we are even now.”</p>
 <p>As Zi Xunyi spoke, she lifted up Xuelin Zhenping’s corpse.</p>
