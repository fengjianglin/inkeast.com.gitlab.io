 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1152 - Senior Sister Furong</strong></p>
 <p>Unfortunately, this woman was unwilling to face others with her actual appearance, as there was a gauze cloth covering her face, revealing only her eyes.</p>
 <p>This woman’s eyes were not very large. However, they were very spirited. Adding on her long eyelashes, she gave off a very mature sensation.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, the gauze cloth that covered her face was extremely thin. Thus, an outline of her face could be seen. From a single glance, Chu Feng was able to tell that she was a beautiful woman, an enchanting sexy-type beautiful woman.</p>
 <p>“Senior brother Chu Feng, let me introduce you, this is senior sister Furong.”</p>
 <p>“Senior sister Furong, he is the senior brother Chu Feng that I mentioned to you. Earlier when Yao’er was bullied by others, it was senior brother Chu Feng who helped save her.” Yao’er began to introduce the two of them with a smile on her face.</p>
 <p>“Thank you for helping Yao’er.” After she heard what Yao’er said, that woman’s eyes narrowed as she looked to Chu Feng with a gentle gaze and nodded amiably at Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“It’s merely something that I should do.” Seeing this, Chu Feng also smiled amiably and nodded in response.</p>
 <p>After this, that woman did not bother to talk much more with Chu Feng. Instead, with lotus steps,[1.real soft steps] she began to walk toward the center of that ocean of Firmament Medicinal Herbs.</p>
 <p>“Yao’er, is this senior sister Furong also someone that has helped you before?” After the woman left, Chu Feng walked over to Yao’er and asked her.</p>
 <p>“Mn, senior sister Furong is the same as senior brother Chu Feng, she’s also a kindhearted person. However, she did not come here to gather Firmament Medicinal Herbs. Instead, she ha come here to rest with her eyes closed,” Yao’er replied.</p>
 <p>“To rest with her eyes closed?” Chu Feng was astonished to hear those words.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Senior sister Furong almost always comes here once every month, and rests with her eyes closed for an entire day and night. Only then will she leave,” Yao’er explained.</p>
 <p>“Oh? That long?!”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng turned his gaze to toward that woman once again. Only then did he discover that the woman addressed by Yao’er as senior sister Furong had already sat down in a cross-legged position in the field of Firmament Medicinal Herbs.</p>
 <p>At this moment, their distance was rather far. Adding on the fact that the Firmament Medicinal Herbs were pretty tall, this led to the woman’s entire body to be covered up by the Firmament Medicinal Herbs. The only thing that Chu Feng was able to see was the upper portion of her shoulders and her head. Furthermore, she had actually really closed her eyes.</p>
 <p>“Truly a strange individual.” Seeing that this senior sister Furong really did as Yao’er said, Chu Feng muttered in his heart.</p>
 <p>Even though the Firmament Medicinal Herbs were so numerous here, and made this place extremely beautiful, the Firmament Medicinal Herbs possessed a very strong medicinal aroma. To close one’s eyes and rest in this place, one would likely not be able to relax one’s heart and please one’s spirit.</p>
 <p>However, all individuals were different. While the majority of people might enjoy the smell of flowers, there would be a small portion that would feel that the smell was stinky instead.[2.I am one of those]</p>
 <p>As for this senior sister Furong, Chu Feng could not ascertain whether or not she might be a special person who enjoyed special smells. Perhaps she might truly enjoy the smell of these medicinal herbs, and their smell might really be able to relax her heart and please her spirit. Thus, Chu Feng could only decide that she was a strange individual.</p>
 <p>“Yao’er, I’ve already finished gathering the seeds. I didn’t pluck any Firmament Medicinal Herbs because a hundred thousand seeds is already an enormous assistance and more than sufficient,” said Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“You’ve finished gathering the seeds? This quickly?” Surprise was written all over Yao’er’s face. She felt the words spoken by Chu Feng to be extremely unbelievable. After all, it was a hundred thousand seeds. Regardless of how strong Chu Feng was, logically, he should not be able to gather them this quickly.</p>
 <p>“Heh.” Chu Feng merely smiled at Yao’er’s surprise. That was because he actually did not spend as much time as Yao’er thought he did. He had merely used a brief moment to gather the hundred thousand seeds.</p>
 <p>“Senior brother Chu Feng, in that case, are you preparing to leave?” asked Yao’er.</p>
 <p>“Mn, I still have something that I need to do. If I have the time, I will come and visit you again in the future,” said Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Okay, senior brother Chu Feng, you must definitely come and visit Yao’er when you have time in the future.” As Yao’er said those words, she took out the jade stone and was preparing to open the exit for Chu Feng. As for Chu Feng, he also followed after her and was preparing to leave this place.</p>
 <p>“This sensation?” However, right at this moment, Chu Feng’s pupils suddenly shrank. Immediately after, he hurriedly turned around and cast his gaze toward senior sister Furong once again.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng discovered that senior sister Furong was exactly as she had been before. On the surface, there appeared to be no change to her at all.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng was able to sense that numerous layers of formless ripples were being spread out from senior sister Furong’s body, covering the entire ocean of Firmament Medicinal Herbs.</p>
 <p>When the formless ripples reached the limit of their spread, they began to reverse directions and rush back into senior sister Furong’s body. This rhythm was like breathing, going out and going in in harmony.</p>
 <p>However, what entered into senior sister Furong’s body when the formless ripples returned were not only the formless ripples themselves. There was also a sort of energy that was extracted from the Firmament Medicinal Herbs. As for those energies, they were absorbed together with her returning ripples.</p>
 <p>Even though those energies were extremely weak, they was still detected by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“She isn’t resting with her eyes closed. Instead, she’s borrowing the energies of the Firmament Medicinal Herbs here to train.”</p>
 <p>“This woman, who exactly is she?” At this moment, Chu Feng’s heart was filled with shock. That was because the method used by this woman was truly ingenious. Had it not been for Chu Feng’s enormous spirit energy, then likely even he would not be able to discover that this senior sister Furong was actually using the Firmament Medicinal Herbs to train.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, from the very beginning, Chu Feng had not managed to sense this woman’s cultivation. Originally, Chu Feng did not care much about it, he had thought that she wanted to conceal her cultivation.</p>
 <p>However, at this very moment, she was on the move, and Chu Feng had also utilized his spirit energy. Logically, her cultivation should be exposed. However, there was no exposure to her cultivation at all. This meant that she was most likely very powerful.</p>
 <p>However, once he detected that the situation was strange, Chu Feng did not decide to give up. He truly wanted to know whether this senior sister Furong might be using the Firmament Medicinal Herbs to train in a Forbidden Technique or Martial Skill. That was because Chu Feng did not discover that the Firmament Medicinal Herbs possessed the characteristic to increase one’s strength.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng made some adjustments to his spirit energy so as to conceal it. Then, he slowly assimilated his spirit energy into senior sister Furong’s body. He wanted to try to discover the true cultivation of this senior sister Furong, as well as what exactly she was doing.</p>
 <p>“Buzz.” However, right at the moment when Chu Feng’s spirit energy touched senior sister Furong, a very powerful ripple was actually shot out from her body and completely repelled Chu Feng’s spirit energy.</p>
 <p>At the same time, that senior sister Furong abruptly opened her eyes and looked at Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Crap.”</p>
 <p>Faced with this sudden change, Chu Feng did not know what to do. Even though he had already imagined that this senior sister Furong’s cultivation might be stronger than his own, he never imagined that her sensitivity would be this powerful too.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng was certain that this senior sister Furong’s cultivation greatly surpassed his own. Furthermore, it greatly surpassed even Long Chenyi. She was a true demon-level character.</p>
 <p>Thus, if she was to become displeased by his action of trying to determine her cultivation, then she would totally be capable of killing Chu Feng on the spot.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, after that senior sister Furong opened her eyes, she did not display any traces of anger. Instead, she lightly smiled as she looked at Chu Feng before turning her head back and closing her eyes once again. She returned to her training, and did not bother to look into what had happened.</p>
 <p>“Haa, it would appear that this Cyanwood Mountain is truly interesting.” At this moment, Chu Feng also revealed a relieved smile. An expression of anticipation actually emerged in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had heard about the countless demon-level characters present in the Cyanwood Mountain before, as well as how amazing they were. However, those were, after all, simply rumors that he had heard.</p>
 <p>As of today, however, he experienced one such individual for himself. At the very least, this senior sister Furong was an existence who was much more powerful than himself.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng did not feel any pressure because of this. Instead, he felt excited. Even though the Cyanwood Mountain possessed countless experts, and they would inevitably turn into things that might block his path, to go against the stream would help to realize one’s potential even better.</p>
 <p>As the saying goes, man seeks his way up just as water seeks its way down. Without a headwind, how could one become strong?</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he was someone who needed this sort of resistance so that he could become stronger.</p>
