 <p><strong> Chapter 2488 - During The Two Years</strong></p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, never would I have expected this Chu Xuanlang to really agree to your demands.”</p>
 <p>“But, your current situation is not optimistic either. Now that the Kong Heavenly Clan knows that you’re still alive, they will definitely not let you get away.”</p>
 <p>“If you do not use the Evil God Sword, then, with your current strength, it is obvious that you will not be able to contend against the Kong Heavenly Clan.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, don’t forget that you also have a great hidden enemy, the Infant Soul Sect. It is the target that you must take care of.”</p>
 <p>“Instead of having this Chu Xuanlang protect the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall, why didn’t you ask him to protect you directly?” Her Lady Queen asked.</p>
 <p>“Milady Queen, we still have no idea what sort of status this Chu Xuanlang possesses in the Chu Heavenly Clan.”</p>
 <p>“However, it is evident that he is very well-informed about all the things that we’ve done in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.”</p>
 <p>“Protecting powers like the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall is simply a trivial matter for him. However, if I am to ask him to protect me, the significance will be completely different, and he might not necessarily agree to it.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, if I am to ask him to protect me, what if my father is to find out about it?”</p>
 <p>“Has the Chu Heavenly Clan not disgraced my father and I enough?”</p>
 <p>“That is why I have vowed that I will never bring up the name of the Chu Heavenly Clan to protect myself.”</p>
 <p>“Naturally, I cannot have someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan protect me,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Mn, to not use them to protect you, but to be able to use them to protect your friends. You’ve handled this matter beautifully.”</p>
 <p>“Boy, you’ve truly grown more and more shrewd. This Queen has not nurtured you in vain,” Her Lady Queen said happily. As she said those words, an immensely proud expression emerged on her exceptionally beautiful face. It was as if Chu Feng’s current intelligence was all thanks to her contributions.</p>
 <p>“Milady Queen, in that case, shouldn’t you present me with a bit of reward?” Chu Feng asked with a smile.</p>
 <p>“What sort of reward do you want?” Her Lady Queen revealed an innocent expression.</p>
 <p>“For example, give me a kiss, or let me give you a kiss?” Chu Feng let out a shameless laugh.</p>
 <p>“That suggestion is boring. How about I hack you with a knife once or twice?” Her Lady Queen revealed a mischievous smile.</p>
 <p>“Cough, cough… I was joking. Don’t take it seriously. I can’t continue to chat idly with you anymore, I still have to scout out information regarding this Chu Xuanlang. I need to know why he invited me,” Chu Feng hurriedly found an excuse to escape from Her Lady Queen. He then turned to Chu Xuanlang.</p>
 <p>“Don’t ask anything. Once we’re there, you will come to a natural realization,” Chu Xuanlang said with a faint smile.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was surprised. This Chu Xuanlang’s perception was truly impressive. Even though his gaze was fixed ahead the entire time, he managed to sense that Chu Feng was planning to speak. Furthermore, he knew what Chu Feng wanted to ask.</p>
 <p>In such a situation, Chu Feng also smiled faintly. He no longer tried asking Chu Xuanlang any questions.</p>
 <p>The two of them did not utter another word on their journey.</p>
 <p>That said, Chu Feng was able to sense that Chu Xuanlang was very powerful. Even if he was only a True Immortal, he was definitely not a True Immortal that the True Immortals of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm could compare to.</p>
 <p>In fact, it might even be possible that he was not a True Immortal-level expert at all.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because the surrounding objects on their journey were all indistinct. Chu Feng was unable to see anything clearly.</p>
 <p>From this, it could be seen how powerful Chu Xuanlang was. Else, it would not be possible for him to possess such speed.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, Chu Feng was unable to detect his aura even while they were rapidly journeying.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he was, after all, an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.</p>
 <p>When someone of Chu Feng’s caliber was unable to detect Chu Xuanlang’s cultivation, it could only mean two things.</p>
 <p>Either Chu Xuanlang possessed some sort of treasure that could conceal his cultivation, or he was so powerful that Chu Feng was simply incapable of determining how strong he was.</p>
 <p>Judging from the situation at hand, the latter was the more probable case.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>Finally, Chu Xuanlang stopped, and Chu Feng was once again able to see his surroundings clearly.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng discovered that they were only flying in the sky.</p>
 <p>When he looked down, he could only see spacious and empty lands, ordinary looking forests and ordinary looking brooks. There were no human habitats here.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, Chu Xuanlang made a grabbing motion toward the empty space before him. Then, he made a pulling motion, as if he were opening a door.</p>
 <p>“Snap~” The space before them was actually opened, with a door emerging in its place. On the other side of the door was actually a completely different world.</p>
 <p>An isolated space. This was an isolated space created by Chu Xuanlang.</p>
 <p>However, it was not an ordinary isolated space. The reason for that was because that isolated space was actually formed through special methods using only martial power.</p>
 <p>In other words, that isolated space was unrelated to world spirit techniques.</p>
 <p>Precisely due to the fact that it did not contain the slightest bit of spirit power, even Chu Feng did not detect that there was actually an isolated space there earlier.</p>
 <p>“Go on in. Your friends are waiting for you,” Chu Xuanlang said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Senior, you’re not entering?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Since you all are going to reminisce with one another, it’d be better that I don’t participate in this. As such, I will wait for you here,” Chu Xuanlang said.</p>
 <p>“Thank you,” Chu Feng returned a courteous smile. Then, he walked in.</p>
 <p>That isolated space was not very large. However, there were mountains and rivers there. It was a picturesque scene.</p>
 <p>With Chu Feng’s observational ability, he soon discovered a building among the mountains and rivers.</p>
 <p>It was a simple building. In fact, it could even be said to be an extremely simple and unadorned little house made with tiles and bricks. The house had a small fenced-in courtyard. It looked just like a commoner’s home in the countryside.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng was actually unable to see through the little tile and brick house. However, Chu Feng knew that if Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong were here, they would definitely be inside the house.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng flew down. Right after he entered the courtyard, a figure flew out from the house and blocked the door.</p>
 <p>At that moment, not only did Chu Feng see a gaze filled with killing intent, he also felt a very powerful aura. That person… was actually a rank eight Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing who the person before him was clearly, Chu Feng revealed a joyous expression.</p>
 <p>At the same time, that person’s cold expression also changed instantly.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because the person before Chu Feng was Zhao Hong.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you’re actually alive?” Upon seeing Chu Feng, Zhao Hong revealed an expression of disbelief.</p>
 <p>“Aren’t I standing before you? Zhao Hong, your cultivation truly progresses quickly,” Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had thought that with how talented Zhao Hong was, her cultivation should be able to advance by leaps and bounds in two years’ time. However, he did not expect her cultivation to increase so much.</p>
 <p>With this, it was no longer that the Kong Heavenly Clan would end up suffering by her hands. With the abilities Zhao Hong possessed, having a cultivation of rank eight Martial Ancestor would indeed serve as a nightmare for the Kong Heavenly Clan.</p>
 <p>“You’re not bad yourself. You’re actually a rank seven Martial Ancestor already. Judging from this, it would seem that the current me is no match for you already,” Zhao Hong said jokingly.</p>
 <p>“No, no, you’re the ruthless demonic woman. How could I dare fight against you?” Chu Feng also started joking around.</p>
 <p>“Tsk, don’t make cutting remarks. I have already renounced my old ways,” Zhao Hong curled her lips and smiled. Her smile was truly quite pleasant to see.</p>
 <p>Even Chu Feng had to admit that Zhao Hong was a beauty. At the very least, she was originally a beauty.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng felt very happy in his heart. He felt happy for his brother. After all, with how Wang Qiang looked, being able to find a girl like Zhao Hong could be considered to be a toad managing to eat the meat of a swan.</p>
 <p>“Oh, that’s right, where’s Wang Qiang?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Something happened to him?” Suddenly, Chu Feng’s gaze changed.</p>
 <p>He discovered that when he asked about Wang Qiang, Zhao Hong’s expression changed. The expression she revealed was not a good one. Instead, it seemed to indicate bad news.</p>
