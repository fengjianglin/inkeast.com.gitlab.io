 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tsk~~~” Wuma Shengjie rolled her eyes at Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s the tsk about? How come your cultivation has increased again? Girl, you’re truly amazing. You are most definitely a formidable opponent of mine,” Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng was not joking around. It was true that Wuma Shengjie’s cultivation had increased again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was no longer a rank five Martial Immortal. Instead, her cultivation had increased to rank six Martial Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The speed at which her cultivation increased was not at all inferior to Chu Feng's.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, if it wasn’t for the fact that Chu Feng had gained comprehension on the Heavenly Lightning Punishment Platform, he would also only be a rank six Martial Immortal at that moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, young friend Chu Feng, you don’t have to be so modest. Shengjie has already mentioned to me that you have managed to unseal your Lightning Armor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even if Shengjie were to fight you, I feel that Shengjie would definitely not be a match for you. Besides, since Shengjie was able to make gains from that Ancient Era’s remnant, I think that young friend Chu Feng must’ve gained some harvest from the Ancient Era’s remnant too, no?” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief looked to Chu Feng with a beaming smile. There was a hidden implication within his gaze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How could the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief not be able to tell that Chu Feng was concealing his cultivation? Furthermore, he knew that Wuma Shengjie was able to make a breakthrough in her cultivation thanks to her gains in the Ancient Era’s remnant. Thus, he guessed that Chu Feng had deliberately concealed his cultivation because he wanted to hide something. Likely, he had already made a breakthrough too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He guessed that Chu Feng’s current actual cultivation should be that of a rank six Martial Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not most likely, instead, it’s definitely,” Wuma Shengjie said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ve discovered even that?” Chu Feng smiled. Then, with a thought from Chu Feng, his rank seven Martial Immortal cultivation was released.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young friend Chu Feng, you… you actually managed to make two successive breakthroughs?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief immediately revealed an astonished expression upon sensing that Chu Feng’s current cultivation was a level higher than he had expected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was not only him, as even Wuma Shengjie was looking at Chu Feng with a gaze filled with astonishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young friend Chu Feng, that comprehensive ability of yours is simply too astonishing,” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief gasped with admiration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This junior indeed managed to gain some harvest from the Ancient Era’s remnant. However, it is actually due to another opportunity that I encountered that I managed to gain my current cultivation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Chu Feng spoke, he concealed his aura again. Although there was an unwritten rule in the martial cultivation world that if one were to conceal one’s cultivation before one’s senior, it would be a sign of disrespect, apart from those who were deliberately seeking trouble, no one would actually care about that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason for that was because there was another saying in the martial cultivation world. That is, a person of the younger generation concealing his or her cultivation was a sign of modesty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, it was not only the people of the younger generation; many people of the older generation also made a habit of concealing their cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Chu Feng, he was not concealing his cultivation for modesty’s sake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was merely doing it because he felt like it. He would conceal and reveal his cultivation depending on what he felt like doing. And at that moment… he just so happened to want to conceal his cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What sort of opportunity did you encounter again?” Wuma Shengjie asked curiously. Judging from her appearance, she seemed to be very curious about how Chu Feng managed to increase his cultivation to rank seven Martial Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, people had competitive desires. She had only just managed to catch up to Chu Feng with great difficulty. Yet, it turned out that she was once again surpassed by Chu Feng. If anyone else were in her shoes, they would also be somewhat unwilling to accept it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Chu Feng had truly managed to increase his cultivation elsewhere, she would feel a bit better.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Otherwise, she would feel unwell. After all, that would mean that Chu Feng’s comprehensive ability was simply too much stronger than hers. This would give her a feeling of defeat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m telling the truth, I wouldn’t lie to you,” Chu Feng said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In that case, where did you encounter that opportunity?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wuma Shengjie, a person of few words, was actually asking successive questions. Sure enough, she cared about this matter a lot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If I am to tell you that this opportunity of mine came from being struck by lightning, would you believe me?” Chu Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you don’t want to tell me, then forget about it,” Wuma Shengjie cast a side-eye at Chu Feng. Evidently, she did not believe him in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m telling the truth. I’m not lying to you,” Chu Feng said with a grin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing such an attitude from Chu Feng, Wuma Shengjie believed him even less. Soon after, she decided to ignore him completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shengjie, do not be rude,” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief quietly berated Wuma Shengjie. However, she paid absolutely no attention to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evidently, the Lord Clan Chief was not at all imposing to Wuma Shengjie. This caused him to feel rather embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, it’s fine, it’s fine. Shengjie and I are good friends. This is normal between friends,” Chu Feng said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tsk~~~” Wuma Shengjie curled her lips. She reacted as if she did not appreciate Chu Feng’s friendliness in the slightest. However, a trace of happiness was present in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is truly Shengjie’s good fortune to have a friend like young friend Chu Feng. If only Shengjie could be as sensible as young friend Chu Feng, this old man would be completely at ease,” The Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief sighed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Afterwards, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief continued to chat with Chu Feng on the journey, whereas Wuma Shengjie remained cold and detached. She would not even look at Chu Feng, and would only grace them with her gaze when they mentioned something that interested her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unknowingly, Chu Feng, the Wuma Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and Wuma Shengjie passed through the Ancient Era’s Teleportation Formation and arrived in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once Chu Feng exited the teleportation formation, a shocked expression immediately appeared on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ignoring the magnificent sceneries of the Nine Dragons Upper Realm, Chu Feng immediately felt his senses assaulted by the natural energies here, which were much more intense than those of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The difference in natural energy could directly affect a martial cultivator’s cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Evidently, the Nine Dragons Upper Realm was extremely precious, and not something that the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm could compare to. It was no wonder the Tantai Heavenly Clan would occupy it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most importantly, a vast crowd was gathered at the exit of the teleportation formation. Both heaven and earth were packed with people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, more and more people were walking out of the teleportation formation’s exit following Chu Feng and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were people from all different powers. There were even many Exalted-level experts hidden among them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One should know that this was only one of the many teleportation formations in the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.</span></p>
