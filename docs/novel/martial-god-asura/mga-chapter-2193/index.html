 <p><strong> Chapter 2193 - The Power Of Asura</strong></p>
 <p>“Senior Liu Chengkun, please do not worry about me. You should leave right now!” Chu Feng shouted. He did not wish to implicate Liu Chengkun.</p>
 <p>However, Liu Chengkun smiled lightly at Chu Feng’s urge to leave. He said, “Little friend Chu Feng, a man should not give up so easily.”</p>
 <p>“Although I, Liu Chengkun, am quite old, I am still a man. Furthermore, our Red Butterfly Society possesses numerous grudges and grievances with this Luyang’s Pavilion to begin with. Furthermore, I, Liu Chengkun, also possess a great personal hatred against this Hong Xi.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, this is not simply a matter that concerns you alone. No matter what, I will not let this Hong Xi get away today. Even if it must end in mutual destruction, I must still kill him.”</p>
 <p>After saying those words, Elder Liu Chengkun shouted loudly. After that shout, his Incomplete Ancestral Armament began to shine brightly. At the same time, Elder Liu Chengkun’s aura also became much more powerful.</p>
 <p>Subsequently, the Emperor Taboo: Great Tidal Wave unleashed by Elder Liu Chengkun also became much more powerful. Successive enormous waves shattered space itself. Once again, they began to drown Hong Xi, making it extremely difficult for him to continue onward.</p>
 <p>Willpower and killing intent.</p>
 <p>Elder Liu Chengkun had completely unleashed all of his power. He had already reached his limit. However, he was still able to increase his power. He had only managed to accomplish all that by relying on his willpower to kill Hong Xi.</p>
 <p>“Humph,” Hong Xi snorted mockingly. He seemed to have already seen through this fact. Thus, he sneered, “Merely an arrow at the end of its flight. I shall see how much longer you can persevere.”</p>
 <p>“Damn it. This wouldn’t do if it is to continue like this,” At that moment, Chu Feng was extremely nervous.</p>
 <p>Even though Elder Liu Chengkun had declared that he possessed personal hatred with that Hong Xi, and that his death would be unrelated to Chu Feng, Chu Feng would still blame himself should Elder Liu Chengkun really die here today.</p>
 <p>“I can only give it a try,” Suddenly, a determined expression flashed through Chu Feng’s eyes. He placed his palm onto his Cosmos Sack.</p>
 <p>He was planning to use the power that he could not control, the Evil God Sword!!!</p>
 <p>Even though the Evil God Sword appeared to only be an Imperial Armament, it was most definitely not a mere Imperial Armament. Else, it would be impossible for even his father to warn him about using the Evil God Sword.</p>
 <p>The power of the Evil God Sword was extremely frightening. Chu Feng did not have the ability to control it. If things went wrong, Chu Feng might even end up being killed by the Evil God Sword.</p>
 <p>However, that power that he could not control was the only thing that Chu Feng could rely on. After all, there was such an enormous difference in cultivation between him and that Hong Xi. It would simply be impossible for Chu Feng to defeat Hong Xi with his own strength.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, don’t worry,” However, right at that moment, a soft and gentle voice entered Chu Feng’s ears, advising him against using the Evil God Sword.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s body trembled upon hearing that voice. His heart tensed up. At that moment, he felt as if he had been struck by lightning.</p>
 <p>However, the sensation he felt was not one of pain. Rather, it was one of immense joy. He was truly and immensely overjoyed. It was as if the greatest thing had happened in this world.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because that voice he heard soundedvery familiar. It was Eggy’s voice, the voice of Her Lady Queen.</p>
 <p>After hearing Eggy’s voice, Chu Feng immediately cast his awareness into his world spirit space. He wished to see what had happened there.</p>
 <p>Upon reaching his world spirit space, he was even more incapable of controlling his emotions, and revealed an ecstatic expression.</p>
 <p>Eggy, Her Lady Queen, had woken up.</p>
 <p>Wearing a black dress, she was still as exceptionally beautiful as she always was. With a smile on her face, she looked at Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Milady Queen, you’re finally awake.”</p>
 <p>“Is it really you? I’m not dreaming, right?” Chu Feng was truly overjoyed. He did not expect that Eggy would wake up at such a time.</p>
 <p>“Hey, hey, hey! Where are you touching? Are you deliberately taking advantage of this Queen?!” Eggy curled her lips and cast a disdainful gaze at Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because Chu Feng was not behaving honestly at all. Not only had he hugged the little beauty into his bosom, he was also rubbing her nonstop with his hands. He was so bold that he was using his hands to touch Eggy’s exquisite and perfect cheeks.</p>
 <p>However, even though that was the case, Eggy merely called Chu Feng out for his actions, and did not push him away.</p>
 <p>“Haha, Eggy, it is truly you. Do you know how much I missed you?” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Enough of this disgusting behavior. This Queen did not really fall asleep. I have heard all of your soliloquies throughout these days.”</p>
 <p>“In the future, if this Queen is not present, you must not say those sorts of things. Else, even if I am fine, I will be disgusted by your words to the point where I will not be fine,” Eggy said with her lips curled.</p>
 <p>Even though she revealed a disgusted facial expression, her beautiful eyes were displaying happiness.</p>
 <p>“In that case, you know about all the things that happened?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“I remember them even better than you,” Eggy raised her head and spoke proudly.</p>
 <p>“Then, the spirit formation my mother placed on you, did you…!!!” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“I know. Although your mother sealed my cultivation, that spirit formation was indeed beneficial to me. As such, I am unable to blame her.”</p>
 <p>“If you don’t believe me, look,” Eggy smiled sweetly, then unleashed her aura.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng was able to clearly sense the cultivation of Her Lady Queen Eggy. She was many times more powerful than before.</p>
 <p>It was as his father had declared, Eggy was a Half Martial Ancestor now. Not only that, she had also surpassed Chu Feng’s cultivation.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was merely a rank two Half Martial Ancestor. However,p Eggy was already a rank six Half Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. Let this Queen out. I will personally teach that ignorant stinky lizard.”</p>
 <p>“This Queen will make him know that not just anyone can be bullied by him. That you, Chu Feng, are under the umbrella of this Queen.”</p>
 <p>Eggy waved her fists around angrily. Even though she had just regained consciousness, she knew all about what Chu Feng had experienced. Thus, she was impatient to teach that Hong Xi a lesson.</p>
 <p>“Of course. No… wait.”</p>
 <p>“Milady Queen, although your cultivation is strong, you are only a rank six Half Martial Ancestor. That Hong Xi, on the other hand, is a rank nine Half Martial Ancestor. Furthermore, he has reached rank one Martial Ancestor after using the power of his Inherited Bloodline. Would you… really be able to contend against him?” Chu Feng asked with a frown. He was worried for Eggy.</p>
 <p>“Really be able to contend against him? What sort of words are those? Who are you looking down on? Are you looking down at Your Lady Queen, or are you looking down at me?” Eggy asked with a furious expression.</p>
 <p>“This…” Chu Feng did not dare to answer.</p>
 <p>“Haha, look at your expression. I am only toying with you,” Eggy smiled proudly. Her smile was extremely beautiful. Looking at that smile, Chu Feng was nearly intoxicated.</p>
 <p>“Rest assured, regardless of how powerful that Hong Xi’s cultivation might be, his battle power is too weak. As for this Queen, my battle power is capable of surmounting seven levels of cultivation.”</p>
 <p>“No, that’s wrong. If, according to what your father said, all Martial Emperors and Martial Ancestors possess battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation, then this Queen’s battle power, when compared to theirs, is capable of surmounting four additional levels of cultivation.”</p>
 <p>“However, even if it is only surmounting four levels of cultivation, the Queen is still able to contend against ordinary rank one Martial Ancestors. Furthermore, ordinary rank one Martial Ancestors are definitely no match for this Queen. Thus, you don’t have to worry.”</p>
 <p>“This Queen will definitely teach that Hong Xi a lesson so bad that he will cry and go look for his mom,” Eggy said proudly.</p>
 <p>“Heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation. Milady Queen, you are truly amazing,” Hearing those words, Chu Feng revealed a joyous expression.</p>
 <p>He knew very well that Her Lady Queen was someone that never lied. Since Her Lady Queen declared that she possessed a battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation, that meant that she most definitely did.</p>
 <p>Before, Chu Feng had guessed that Her Lady Queen’s heaven-defying battle power would be much stronger than his own. However, it turned out that Her Lady Queen’s heaven-defying battle power was even more amazing than he had guessed it to be.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had only managed to obtain his current heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation after breaking through to the Half Martial Ancestor realm. However, Her Lady Queen’s heaven-defying battle power was even stronger than his still.</p>
 <p>“This Queen was also only able to increase my battle power after my cultivation increased to the Half Martial Ancestor level. If this Queen is able to reach Martial Ancestor level, my battle power will increase by another level,” Eggy added proudly.</p>
 <p>“Heh, since that is the case, it is time to let them experience how powerful Milady Queen is,” Chu Feng said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“No,” Eggy shook her head.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Chu Feng asked in a surprised manner.</p>
 <p>Eggy smiled sweetly. She said, “What this Queen will let them experience is the power of Asura.”</p>
