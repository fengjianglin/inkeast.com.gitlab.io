 <p><strong> Chapter 2023 - Acquiring the Scroll</strong></p>
 <p>After journeying for some time, Chu Feng and the Immeasurable Immortal finally arrived at the Wonderstone Dao Ground.</p>
 <p>“This is the Wonderstone Dao Ground? It is truly extraordinary.”</p>
 <p>Seeing the scene before him, Chu Feng’s expression changed. The corners of his mouth raised into a slight smile.</p>
 <p>Before him was a vast plain. However, on the plain were stones of varying sizes. Those stones were all different shapes. Some looked like humans, and some looked like beasts. Even though there were a lot of wonderstones in the Holy Land of Martialism, Chu Feng had a special feeling from merely a single glance at the wonderstones in this place.</p>
 <p>These stones were most definitely not ordinary stones.</p>
 <p>These sorts of stones covered the entire vast plain. They numbered several hundred thousand. It was truly a magnificent sight.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, they are extraordinary. The reason why the stones of this place are known to be wonderstones is because they are indestructible. Furthermore, none of them can be moved,” The Immeasurable Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“They’re actually this miraculous? Could it be that those stones are treasures?” Hearing those words, Chu Feng was also very surprised.</p>
 <p>“No, they’re not treasures. Since the Ancient Era, there have been many people who have researched the stones here. Even I myself have researched them.”</p>
 <p>“Although the stones here give off a very special sensation and are indestructible, they are actually only ordinary stones, and not treasures,” The Immeasurable Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“Ordinary stones? How could ordinary stones be indestructible and unable to be moved?” Chu Feng was even more shocked.</p>
 <p>“According to my master, the reason why this Wonderstone Dao Ground was known as a Dao Ground was because there is a special sort of power in this place. It is that power that protects the wonderstones in this place.”</p>
 <p>“Although no one knows why that special power would protect these stones, it remains that it exists for those stones. Perhaps it is because of that that this place became the Wonderstone Dao Ground,” The Immeasurable Immortal explained.</p>
 <p>“So that’s the case,” Chu Feng nodded.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, now that we’ve arrived at the Wonderstone Dao Ground, have you managed to sense the treasures?” The Immeasurable Immortal asked.</p>
 <p>“No, I am unable to sense anything. I would have to set up a spirit formation. After that spirit formation is formed, it would form a treasure map. As for that treasure map… it records the location of that treasure,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“So this place only contains a treasure map, and the treasures themselves are hidden elsewhere?” The Immeasurable Immortal asked.</p>
 <p>“That should be the case,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“The Five Elements Old Ancestor is truly cautious. Originally, I thought that the secret to his treasure would be solved should one assimilate the Five Elements Secret Skills. Never would I have expected it to be this troublesome,” The Immeasurable Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“However, since we’ve already arrived, we should still give it a try. Chu Feng, go ahead and set up your spirit formation. I will protect you here,” The Immeasurable Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“Senior, thank you,” Chu Feng nodded. Then, without hesitation, he proceeded toward the center of that Wonderstone Dao Ground and started to set up a spirit formation in midair.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng set up the spirit formation very quickly. However, watching Chu Feng setting up the spirit formation, the Immeasurable Immortal exclaimed in astonishment. The spirit formation that Chu Feng had set up was too complicated.</p>
 <p>If Chu Feng were to explain the spirit formation to him, then perhaps he would understand it. However, Chu Feng did not bother to explain the spirit formation. Thus, he was unable to make sense of what Chu Feng was doing.</p>
 <p>Although he was unable to make sense of it, he was able to sense the frightening power contained within the spirit formation.</p>
 <p>It was precisely because that spirit formation was so frightening and complicated that the Immeasurable Immortal exclaimed in admiration. He was pondering how Chu Feng had managed to accomplish that. If it were him, it would simply be impossible.</p>
 <p>“That child’s talent is truly frightening. He might even become the first Immortal-cloak World Spiritist since the Ancient Era,” Looking at the majestic grand spirit formation in mid-air, the Immeasurable Immortal was unable to contain himself from praising Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>The way he saw it, Chu Feng’s world spirit technique had not only surpassed them, he might even be the number one world spiritist in the entire Holy Land of Martialism, above all world spiritists.</p>
 <p>The way he saw it, even the first among the Ten Immortals, the remarkable Heaven Reaching Immortal, might not necessarily be able to compare with Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, how old was Chu Feng? He was already able to attain such a level of accomplishment at such a young age; how frightening would his accomplishments be in the future?</p>
 <p>Upon thinking about it, the Immeasurable Immortal felt a deep amount of disbelief. Truly, he had no choice but to feel admiration for Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>In truth, the spirit formation that Chu Feng was setting up was indeed extremely complicated; it had completely surpassed the Immeasurable Immortal’s imagination. Even for Chu Feng, it took him an entire month to finish setting up that spirit formation.</p>
 <p>“Huu…” At that moment, Chu Feng finally arrived beside the Immeasurable Immortal. He was dripping with sweat and his complexion was also slightly unwell. However, he had a smile on his face as he said, “Senior, I’ve succeeded.”</p>
 <p>“Succeeded? Then, what about the map? Where is the map?” The Immeasurable Immortal inspected the spirit formation Chu Feng had set up. He carefully inspected it from top to bottom. He was searching for the whereabouts of the map.</p>
 <p>“Senior, please look,” The corners of Chu Feng’s mouth rose into a light smile again. Then, he began to form hand seals with one hand and spoke a special incantation.</p>
 <p>“Rumble, rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>The earth started to tremble. Then, energies visible to the naked eye began to fly out from the surface of the Wonderstone Dao Ground and entered the spirit formation in midair.</p>
 <p>In this sort of situation, that spirit formation in midair started to shine with increasingly brighter light. In the end, its bright light was like that of a full moon, illuminating their surroundings. It was a truly magnificent sight.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, that spirit formation, it… it is actually the power of this place,” Seeing this scene, the Immeasurable Immortal became increasingly astonished.</p>
 <p>Although the special power of the Wonderstone Dao Ground was said to be there to protect the stones in this area, it had always been a mystery. The reason for that was because no one had been able to successfully capture that power. As such, they were unable to confirm whether or not that power really existed.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng had now verified its existence. Not only had he verified the existence of that power, he had also used his spirit formation to gather the special, powerful and mysterious energy.</p>
 <p>In other words, Chu Feng had managed to undo the mystery of the Wonderstone Dao Ground that no one else had managed to do.</p>
 <p>It turned out that mystery was related to the Five Elements Old Ancestor.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Finally, all of the mysterious power that was protecting the enormous Wonderstone Dao Ground was sucked dry.</p>
 <p>The Wonderstone Dao Ground no longer possessed any special power. Although the stones of this place remained extremely fantastic with all kinds of different stones, they had become very ordinary.</p>
 <p>This place… had became an ordinary field.</p>
 <p>However, the Immeasurable Immortal’s heart was unable to calm down. His gaze was fixed upon the grand spirit formation floating in midair like the bright moon.</p>
 <p>After it finished absorbing all of the special power contained in the Wonderstone Dao Ground, that grand spirit formation that was emitting silvery light became even more frightening. It was as if there was an explosive power rolling about within it. As for that explosive power, it could explode at any moment.</p>
 <p>However, the silvery light that was illuminating their surrounding was dissipating. As the dazzling silvery light dissipated, the Immeasurable Immortal was able to clearly see that there was a scroll in the center of that grand spirit formation.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng continued to form hand seals with one hand. Then, he extended his other hand toward the grand spirit formation and made a grabbing motion. Then, that scroll flew out from the spirit formation and entered Chu Feng’s hand.</p>
