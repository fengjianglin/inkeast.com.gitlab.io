 <p><strong> Chapter 2505 - Unable To Heal</strong></p>
 <p>With the help from the Golden Crane True Immortal, Chu Feng’s cultivation soon recovered. His body was also reformed by the Golden Crane True Immortal.</p>
 <p>In merely the blink of an eye, Chu Feng turned from a skeleton monster back to his original appearance.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was also able to sense that the Golden Crane True Immortal was going all-out with his world spirit techniques to heal him.</p>
 <p>In such a situation, the pain Chu Feng felt started to subside. However, for some unknown reason, he was still feeling pain.</p>
 <p>This was especially true for his head. He was feeling extreme pain in his head. It was as if his head was about to explode.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, this sort of pain seemed to be imprinted deep in his head, ineradicatblely.</p>
 <p>Seeing that the Golden Crane True Immortal had finally stopped treating him, Chu Feng spoke, “Senior, I am sorry. This junior let you down. That God Bestowment Bamboo Slip has been…”</p>
 <p>“Don’t say anymore. Chu Feng, I already know everything. The reason this place appeared was because of that expert’s doings.”</p>
 <p>“That individual is an existence that not even I can contend against. As such, how could you possibly be able to save the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip before him?”</p>
 <p>“Actually, the fact that we were able to survive after facing someone like that is already an enormous fortune from within misfortune. Thus, you do not have to have any sort of mental burden. As for your friend’s injury, I will definitely heal him,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“Thank you senior,” Chu Feng revealed a grateful expression.</p>
 <p>Although Chu Feng was depressed by the fact that the God Bestowment Bamboo Slip had been snatched away, the fact that the Golden Crane True Immortal was willing to honor their previous agreement and help Wang Qiang heal his injury made him immediately overjoyed.</p>
 <p>Seeing Chu Feng’s overjoyed expression from him saying that he would cure Wang Qiang’s injury, the Golden Crane True Immortal sighed.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, there is one thing that I must tell you,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“Senior, please go ahead,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you were able to pass through the mountain of blades and sea of flames without any cultivation by relying on your enormous spirit power and drive.”</p>
 <p>“Truth be told, this is the first time I’ve seen such enormous spirit power and drive. By enormous, I do not mean how strong your spirit power and drive is. Rather, I mean how determined you were.”</p>
 <p>“That said, even though you’ve managed to successfully pass through the mountain of blades and the sea of flames, you’ve seriously overloaded your spirit power.”</p>
 <p>“Because of that, you’ve seriously injured your spirit power. It is so serious that even I am unable to heal it.”</p>
 <p>“Do you feel that your head hurts, that you do not feel completely healed? Furthermore, is the pain in your head growing more and more intense?” The Golden Crane True Immortal asked.</p>
 <p>“That is indeed the case,” Chu Feng nodded.</p>
 <p>“That is what an injury to one’s spirit power does. That is incurable regardless of how powerful the person trying to heal you might be. If you want to be cured, you can only rely on yourself.”</p>
 <p>“Perhaps you will recover by yourself over time. However, it is also possible that you will not recover for your entire life.”</p>
 <p>“If that is truly the case, not only will it affect your martial cultivation, it might become very difficult for your world spirit techniques to make progress.”</p>
 <p>“If that’s the case, I’m afraid that you may only be able to continue on as an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist for the rest of your life,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s heart trembled upon hearing those words. It was as if an invisible mountain had appeared out of nowhere and descended ruthlessly onto his head.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng was struck dumb. He had guessed that there might be some lingering effect. However, he had never imagined it to be so serious.</p>
 <p>“Your cultivation will be affected, and your world spirit techniques will become stagnant? How could it be this serious?!!!”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, quickly, ask him if there’s a way to cure this.”</p>
 <p>Her Lady Queen’s voice sounded. Compared to Chu Feng, Her Lady Queen was even more restless. She was extremely nervous.</p>
 <p>However, faced with the incomparably nervous Lady Queen and the Golden Crane True Immortal who had an ashamed expression all over his face, Chu Feng did not try to ask more questions. Instead, he smiled and said, “Senior, I have chosen this path. You do not have to blame yourself. Furthermore, I will definitely be able to recover.”</p>
 <p>Seeing Chu Feng reacting like this, the Golden Crane True Immortal’s eyes moved. The self-blame in his eyes did not decrease. Instead, it increased.</p>
 <p>He seemed to want to say something. However, in the end, he didn’t say anything. Instead, he flipped his palm and took out a green jade bottle.</p>
 <p>He opened the jade bottle and then a green medicinal pellet rolled out from it.</p>
 <p>That medicinal pellet was only the size of a grain of rice. It had an appearance similar to that of a grain of white rice. However, it was not white, but rather green in color. It was very translucent and sparking. Furthermore, it flickered with a firefly-like glimmer.</p>
 <p>Once that medicinal pellet appeared, the surrounding space started to become gentle and a faint fragrance soon emerged.</p>
 <p>That fragrance was very refreshing to smell. Merely by smelling that fragrance, Chu Feng felt that his headache, as well as the pain all over his body, decreased greatly.</p>
 <p>“Take this medicinal pellet. It will be able to alleviate your body’s pain, as well as your headache. At the very least, this medicinal pellet will allow you to not be affected by your injury in your future battles against others.”</p>
 <p>“Take one at a time. You are only to take another one when the effect of the medicine gradually dissipates,” The Golden Crane True Immortal handed the medicinal pellet as well as the jade bottle that held the rest of the medicinal pellets to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Upon receiving the medicinal pellet, he immediately placed it in his mouth. It was as the Golden Crane True Immortal said, once that medicinal pellet entered his mouth, it turned into strands of aura that assimilated into his entire body, and even his spirit.</p>
 <p>Soon, the pain Chu Feng felt all over his body, as well as that massive headache, both disappeared.</p>
 <p>Moreover, Chu Feng was able to tell that there were still a lot of medicinal pellets in that jade bottle. Evidently, the Golden Crane True Immortal had produced so many pain-killing medicines because he was afraid that Chu Feng would not be able to recover from his injury, that he would continue to be affected by it.</p>
 <p>“Thank you senior,” Chu Feng put the remaining medicine away and expressed his thanks to the Golden Crane True Immortal.</p>
 <p>The Golden Crane True Immortal sighed and said, “You must not thank me. If it wasn’t for me, you wouldn’t be like this. If you are to thank me still, you will only make me feel even more ashamed.”</p>
 <p>“Come, let’s go. Let’s go see your friend.”</p>
 <p>After that, the Golden Crane True Immortal brought Chu Feng away from Mount Cloud Crane.</p>
 <p>“He really managed to request his help?”</p>
 <p>Chu Xuanlang, who had been waiting outside Mount Cloud Crane the entire time, revealed a surprised expression upon seeing Chu Feng returning with the Golden Crane True Immortal.</p>
 <p>Chu Xuanlang did not continue to stay hidden in the void. Instead, he hurriedly moved forward to welcome their arrival.</p>
 <p>He… a grand expert from the Chu Heavenly Clan, actually hurriedly clasped his fist respectfully to greet the Golden Crane True Immortal.</p>
 <p>“Junior Chu Xuanlang pays his respect to Palace Master Golden Crane.”</p>
 <p>“Palace Master?” Upon hearing those words and seeing Chu Xuanlang’s humble appearance, Chu Feng finally realized that the Golden Crane True Immortal seemed to be a remarkable existence in the Upper Realms.</p>
 <p>Else, it would be impossible for the grand Chu Xuanlang of the Chu Heavenly Clan to be so respectful.</p>
 <p>However, it was precisely because of how extraordinary a status the Golden Crane True Immortal possessed that Chu Feng came to realize even more how frightening that old cat was.</p>
 <p>After all, no matter how powerful the Golden Crane True Immortal was, he was completely powerless to fight back, before that old cat.</p>
 <p>That old cat was most definitely not only an expert of the Upper Realms. It was most likely an existence that could truly move about unhindered through Starfields.</p>
 <p>But, if that old cat was that powerful, exactly how powerful was Zhan Haichuan from back then?</p>
 <p>After all, even after Zhan Haichuan died, he was still able to trap the old cat in his tomb for so long.</p>
 <p>From this, it could be deduced that Zhan Haichuan was an existence stronger than that old cat.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng had completely forgotten about the serious injury to his spirit power.</p>
 <p>He seemed to be able to see the magnificent Starfields, as well as the countless powerful existences in those Starfields.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng felt that he would one day join the ranks of those experts.</p>
 <p>Thus, he was filled with endless anticipation for himself.</p>
