 <p><strong>Chapter 2562 - Finally Meeting Ying Mingchao</strong><br>　　<br>The sudden arrival of the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief shocked the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s True Immortals.<br>　<br>They suddenly recalled Grandmaster Prophet’s prophecy. He had prophesied that three people would arrive.<br>　　<br>However, they had overlooked that third individual. Furthermore, none of them expected that third individual to be a rank two True Immortal.<br>　　<br>“Take this. It will heal your injuries. After that… go and save him. I will help you keep these people at bay,” The Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief handed Zi Xunyi a medicinal pellet.<br>　　<br>“Zhenping,” At that moment, Zi Xunyi looked at the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief with a very complicated expression.</p>
 <p>Evidently, she had never expected the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief to be willing to come assist her even after how cruelly she refused him.</p>
 <p>He was willing to come assist her in saving his rival in love.</p>
 <p>“Don’t say anything.”</p>
 <p>“Just go and save him.”</p>
 <p>The Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief smiled faintly at Zi Xunyi. That smile of his was so very gentle.</p>
 <p>Even though Chu Feng was a man, his heart was was also moved upon seeing that smile.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng knew how much the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief loved Zi Xunyi.</p>
 <p>If Zi Xunyi’s love for Ying Mingchao was so rare and deep that she was willing to give up her life and abandon everything for him, then the love the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief had toward Zi Xunyi was the same.</p>
 <p>His love for her also penetrated deep into his bones. He was willing to abandon everything for her.</p>
 <p>Even Chu Feng, an outsider, was moved by him. As such, Chu Feng could very well imagine what Zi Xunyi was feeling in her heart.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Zi Xunyi’s eyes became moist. She seemed to want to say something.<br>　　<br>However, right at that moment, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief suddenly turned around. He looked to the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s True Immortals.</p>
 <p>At that moment, he no longer had a gentle smile on his face. All there was on his face was a very fierce expression and frightening killing intent.</p>
 <p>“You dare touch my woman?! You shall all die!!!”</p>
 <p>Then, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief soared into the sky. With the crimson blade in hand, he charged toward the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, let’s go.”<br>　　<br>Seeing that, Zi Xunyi immediately swallowed the medicinal pellet. Then, she grabbed Chu Feng and began to rush toward the direction of the Grief Calamity Mountain Range.<br>　　<br>“Where do you think you can escape to?!” Seeing that scene, the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief immediately chased after them.</p>
 <p>Their main target was Chu Feng. As such, he would naturally not allow Chu Feng to escape easily.</p>
 <p>“Rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right at that moment, a slash was sent toward him, forcibly making him stop his chase them.</p>
 <p>It was the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief.</p>
 <p>“Your opponent is me!” The Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief shouted coldly.</p>
 <p>His voice was akin to thunder. It was truly awe-inspiring.</p>
 <p>As for the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, he completely ignored the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief and continued to chase after Chu Feng and Zi Xunyi.<br>　<br>“Rumble~~~”<br>　<br>Another slash was sent forth, blocking the path of the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief again.<br>　<br>“I said, your opponent is me!” The Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief shouted again.<br>　<br>“Very well, since you wish to die this much, I will help you.”</p>
 <p>The Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was infuriated. He decided to ignore Chu Feng and Zi Xunyi, and instead charged toward the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief.</p>
 <p>“To dare touch Zi Xunyi, the ones who will die are you all!!!”</p>
 <p>As for the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief, he was not to be outdone.</p>
 <p>Brandishing the crimson blade in his hand, he actually began to take on the seven Kong and Zhou Heavenly Clans’ True Immortals by himself.<br>　　<br>Chu Feng had no idea what sort of medicine the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief gave Zi Xunyi. However, he was certain that the medicine was very powerful.<br>　<br>After taking that medicinal pellet, Zi Xunyi’s injuries started to rapidly improve. Her aura also started to recover.<br>　<br>Furthermore, following Chu Feng’s guidance, they soon reached the entrance of the Grief Calamity Mountain Range.</p>
 <p>“Who is it?!”</p>
 <p>There were many Kong Heavenly Clan’s elders guarding the entrance of the Grief Calamity Mountain Range. Their cultivations were all very strong; they were all peak Martial Ancestors.<br>　<br>Seeing that there were people approaching the Grief Calamity Mountain Range, they immediately revealed their weapons and shouted sternly.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, even though they were very far away, Chu Feng was still able to sense their killing intent.<br>　<br>“Scram!”<br>　　<br>However, Zi Xunyi did not even bother to stop moving.<br>　　<br>With merely a wave of her sleeve, she sent forth her martial power and smashed away all of the elders guarding the entrance of the Grief Calamity Mountain Range.<br>　　<br>Before Zi Xunyi, those peak Martial Ancestors were like fallen leaves. They were unable to withstand a single blow from her.</p>
 <p>When they landed on the ground, they started bleeding from their seven facial orifices.<br>　<br>Just like that, they all died. All of them were killed by Zi Xunyi.</p>
 <p>However, this was reasonable. After all, Zi Xunyi was a rank two True Immortal. Apart from the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and the Zhou Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, there was practically no one in the Kong Heavenly Clan who could hinder her.<br>　　<br>However, Chu Feng was able to feel that Zi Xunyi was not a ruthless person. He felt that it was most likely due to what had happened earlier that she decided to kill them.</p>
 <p>The Kong and Zhou Heavenly Clans wanted to kill her, and nearly succeeded.<br>　　<br>Being in that sort of situation, Zi Xunyi’s heart was burning with rage. Thus, it was understandable for her to decide to kill.</p>
 <p>After entering the Grief Calamity Mountain Range, Chu Feng moved about with ease and familiarity. As he had already been there once, he quickly brought Zi Xunyi to that remnant and found Ying Mingchao.</p>
 <p>Merely, as Ying Mingchao was affected by the forbidden technique, Chu Feng and Zi Xunyi were simply unable to see him.</p>
 <p>However, Ying Mingchao was able to see them.</p>
 <p>“Xunyi, Xunyi, is it you, is it you?”<br>　　<br>“It really is you. Xunyi… I’ve finally gotten to see you again.”</p>
 <p>Ying Mingchao was extremely excited upon seeing Zi Xunyi’s arrival.</p>
 <p>In fact, Chu Feng was able to tell that even Ying Mingchao’s tone had changed. He was no longer as crude and vulgar as before. On the contrary, his tone was so very gentle.<br>　<br>If he didn’t hear it himself, Chu Feng would never believe that Ying Mingchao was capable of speaking so gently.</p>
 <p>That said, compared to Ying Mingchao’s excitement and enthusiasm, Zi Xunyi had a complicated expression on her face.<br>　　<br>She did not say anything. However, glistening teardrops appeared in her eyes.</p>
 <p>Soon, tears began to flow down her cheeks uncontrollably.</p>
 <p>Her love that she had not met for over a thousand years, that lover that she loved dearly for so long, she was finally able to see him.<br>　<br>Only Zi Xunyi herself knew what sort of emotion that was.<br>　<br>“Xunyi, don’t cry, don’t cry.”</p>
 <p>Seeing that, Ying Mingchao hurriedly consoled her. That grand hero was actually panicky.</p>
 <p>However, Zi Xunyi ignored Ying Mingchao. Instead, she turned to Chu Feng and handed him a scroll. She said to him, “Chu Feng, remember the contents of this scroll. Make sure to remember it carefully. You cannot afford to make a single mistake.”<br>　　<br>After saying those words, Zi Xunyi started to set up a spirit formation. That spirit formation was very complicated. Even Chu Feng was unable to make sense of it.<br>　<br>However, Zi Xunyi was able to set up that spirit formation with enormous ease. In merely a short moment, she finished setting up the spirit formation.</p>
 <p>After finishing the spirit formation, Zi Xunyi asked Chu Feng, “Chu Feng, did you memorize the contents of the scroll?”</p>
 <p>“Senior, I’ve memorized it all,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Are you able to act according to the contents on the scroll?” Zi Xunyi asked again.</p>
 <p>“I am,” Chu Feng nodded.</p>
 <p>The contents of the scroll were related to the spirit formation she had set up. However, it was not how to set up the spirit formation, but rather how to activate the spirit formation.<br>　<br>In short, it was very difficult to set up the spirit formation. Its difficulty was different from that of the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation, and did not need to consume a great amount of energy and time.</p>
 <p>Instead, its difficulty was related to one’s technique. One must be able to set up the spirit formation smoothly in one go.</p>
 <p>As for the method to set up the spirit formation, it was extremely complicated. Thus, if one were to make a mistake while setting up the spirit formation, the spirit formation would definitely fail.<br>　<br>If one wished to grasp such a spirit formation, one must spend a lot of time learning it. One must become familiar with it. It was very similar to learning a martial skill.</p>
 <p>Thus, although Zi Xunyi had managed to finish setting up the spirit formation rapidly, the amount of effort she had put into learning that spirit formation was unimaginable.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, not only was that spirit formation very difficult to set up, it was also very difficult to activate.</p>
 <p>Once activated, the spirit formation could not be stopped. Otherwise, it would crumble completely, and would have to be set up again.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Ying Mingchao would also receive a backlash from the spirit formation.</p>
