 <p><strong>Chapter 2714 - Witness The Course Of Events</strong></p>
 <p>“You’ve guessed correctly. I have already seen this Mirror Pearl. The pleasant surprise that I had personally prepared has already been obtained by someone else,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.</p>
 <p>“Obtained by someone? There’s actually someone capable of obtaining it? Who was it? How did they accomplish it?”</p>
 <p>“That’s right, Lord Villa Master, exactly who was it that actually possessed the ability to obtain your pleasant surprise?”</p>
 <p>At that moment, the Immortal Armament Villa’s various elders all began to question him with curious expressions on their faces.</p>
 <p>They all knew what that pleasant surprise was.</p>
 <p>It was that World Spirit Beast.</p>
 <p>Thus, they also knew how difficult it was to handle that World Spirit Beast.</p>
 <p>If anyone was able to defeat that World Spirit Beast, they would obtain first place in the hunt.</p>
 <p>“I have only just exited my closed-door training. Thus, I did not manage to see how he managed to defeat that World Spirit Beast.”</p>
 <p>“However, from the discussions of others in the hunting ground, I came to know that it was done by a young man by the name of Chu Feng,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng? Could it be someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan?” The fiery red-haired old man asked.</p>
 <p>The others present also revealed a special sort of gaze.</p>
 <p>Based on the conversation between the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master and the fiery red-haired old man, the crowd realized that the person capable of defeating that World Spirit Beast and obtaining the so-called pleasant surprise would most definitely be an extraordinary individual.</p>
 <p>If that Chu Feng was also someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan, then it would mean that there was another extraordinary existence among the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations.</p>
 <p>“Incorrect,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master shook his head.</p>
 <p>Then, he turned his gaze toward Chu Xianshuo, “Little friend Chu Xianshuo, it seems that you’ve encountered a rival this time around.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Xianshuo revealed an ugly expression. Then, he spread forth his palm, and light began to surge within it.</p>
 <p>It was Immortal-level spirit power. Furthermore, the spirit power was Snake Mark.</p>
 <p>“Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist. Young master Chu Xianshuo is truly outstanding.”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing the spirit power emitted by Chu Xianshuo, the bystanders started to praise him nonstop.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Xianshuo ignored the people that were praising him.</p>
 <p>The spirit power he emitted began to move around within his palm. Soon, a spirit formation was formed.</p>
 <p>This spirit formation outlined a portrait. As for that portrait, it was Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master, is this the Chu Feng that you spoke of?” Chu Xianshuo asked the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master.</p>
 <p>“That is precisely him. Could it be that young master Chu Xianshuo knows him?” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master asked.</p>
 <p>“Haha…” Chu Xianshuo sneered.</p>
 <p>Then, he said, “I do. Of course I do. That man was disrespectful toward me earlier, and has been beaten to a dog-like state by me. He kneeled on the ground and begged me for forgiveness.”</p>
 <p>“Out of kindness, I decided to spare him once. Never would I have imagined that he would dare be this presumptuous and create troubles for our Chu Heavenly Clan in the hunting ground with his world spirit techniques.”</p>
 <p>“The way I see it, he has grown tired of living,” Chu Xianshuo spoke fiercely</p>
 <p>Upon hearing what Chu Xianshuo said, the bystanders were all astonished.</p>
 <p>Never did they imagine that the man by the name of Chu Feng was not only not from the Chu Heavenly Clan, but he actually also had such a major conflict with Chu Xianshuo.</p>
 <p>They all began to feel worried for Chu Feng in their hearts.</p>
 <p>After all, those who offended the Chu Heavenly Clan would all end up suffering greatly.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Xianshuo, you have not seen the situation of the hunting ground through this Mirror Pearl. Thus, how could you know that Chu Feng caused trouble for your Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations?” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master asked.</p>
 <p>“A guess,” Chu Xianshuo said.</p>
 <p>“Unfortunately, you’ve guessed right,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said. “Although I also didn’t manage to witness it myself, I came to know from the conversations of the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations and the others inside that your Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations decided to pick a fight, and were then taught a lesson by that Chu Feng.”</p>
 <p>“You…” At that moment, Chu Xianshuo’s expression turned very ugly. He actually revealed a slightly angry expression.</p>
 <p>Before the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations had entered the hunting ground, they had already declared that they would take care of Chu Feng. Thus, how could he not know what would’ve happened in there?</p>
 <p>Yet, the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master actually spoke the truth as to what had happened inside before all those people. His action was simply akin to slapping Chu Xianshuo and the other Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations in the face.</p>
 <p>After all, trying to humiliate someone only to be humiliated instead was a very humiliating thing.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Xianshuo retorted, “Those are merely your words. How could I believe them?”</p>
 <p>He actually decided to refuse to admit that his Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations had gone to attack Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“This Mirror Pearl of mine is capable of seeing the situation inside the hunting ground,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.</p>
 <p>“It’s you who saw the situation inside and not me. You can say whatever you want,” Chu Xianshuo said.</p>
 <p>“Haha…” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master chuckled.</p>
 <p>He said, “Little friend Chu Xianshuo, I know that you’re angry. However, it’s useless for you to dispute this with me. If you have the capability, you should enter the hunting ground and defeat that Chu Feng.”</p>
 <p>“I am going to enter the hunting ground to take care of him even without you telling me that. As long as I, Chu Xianshuo, participate in this hunt, I will be the one to obtain the first place in this hunt,” Chu Xianshuo said.</p>
 <p>“Merely, I’m afraid that you might not necessarily be able to defeat that Chu Feng,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.</p>
 <p>“What makes you so certain that I will not be able to defeat him?” Chu Xianshuo narrowed his eyebrows and asked in a very displeased manner.</p>
 <p>“Merely by the fact that he managed to defeat the World Spirit Beast that I personally set up,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.</p>
 <p>“You dare say that I cannot?” Chu Xianshuo said.</p>
 <p>“Haha…” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master chuckled again. However, he didn’t answer.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because he knew very well that he had set up that World Spirit Beast so that he could make things difficult for Chu Xianshuo.</p>
 <p>Thus, he was practically certain that Chu Xianshuo would not be able to defeat his World Spirit Beast.</p>
 <p>“I’ve already said it. That Chu Feng fought against me before. However, he was utterly powerless to even fight back against me,” Chu Xianshuo said.</p>
 <p>“Martial cultivation is martial cultivation, whereas world spirit techniques are world spirit techniques. One must not confuse the two of them,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.</p>
 <p>“Then I’ll have you know that even in terms of world spirit techniques, I will be able to suppress him to the ground like a dog,” Chu Xianshuo said.</p>
 <p>“Haha. This old man only believes in what he can see,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.</p>
 <p>Seeing the reaction from the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master, Chu Xianshuo grew even more annoyed. He was able to tell that the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master deeply looked down on him.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a bright idea emerged in Chu Xianshuo’s mind.</p>
 <p>He said, “You’re right. You only believe in what you can see. I believe everyone else is the same.”</p>
 <p>“No one is able to make a conclusion as to exactly what happened in the past.”</p>
 <p>“However, everyone here is capable of witnessing what will happen later on.”</p>
 <p>“Since your Mirror Pearl is capable of seeing all that’s happening inside the hunting ground, why don’t you make the contents of the Mirror Pearl public, and allow everyone to witness what will happen in the hunting ground later?” Chu Xianshuo said to the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Xianshuo, you mean to say that you want everyone to witness what will happen in the hunting ground after you’ve entered it?” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master asked.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong? Are you unable to do so?” Chu Xianshou asked provocatively.</p>
 <p>“I am able. Merely… I think you should reconsider it,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.</p>
 <p>“Are you looking down on me? Very well, the more you look down on me, the more I want to make you know that I, Chu Xianshuo, possess world spirit techniques that trash like that Chu Feng cannot compare to,” Chu Xianshuo said.</p>
 <p>“Very well. Young people should have the sort of self-confidence that you possess.”</p>
 <p>“Since you are determined, this old man will satisfy you,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master began to set up a spirit formation after saying those words.</p>
 <p>Dazzling spirit power began to emerge the moment he began. Soon, a grand formation was completed.</p>
 <p>That Mirror Pearl served as the core of the grand formation. Thus… that grand formation was capable of displaying the situation inside the hunting ground.</p>
 <p>Merely, it was only capable of seeing a part of the hunting ground. The scene that appeared in the grand formation was only the entrance of the hunting ground.</p>
 <p>“This formation of mine will follow you. Thus, we will be able to witness all that you encounter once you enter the hunting ground,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing those words, all the people present became excited.</p>
 <p>They had all come to witness whether or not Chu Xianshuo would be able to obtain first place in the hunt again.</p>
 <p>And now, they actually had a chance to see all that Chu Xianshuo experienced in the hunting ground. This was something that the crowd had never imagined would happen before.</p>
 <p>“All of you, all you people here, open your eyes wide and witness what is about to happen!”</p>
 <p>“Witness how I, Chu Xianshuo, will beat up that Chu Feng!”</p>
 <p>Chu Xianshuo made such a declaration. Then, he leapt forward and entered the hunting ground.</p>
