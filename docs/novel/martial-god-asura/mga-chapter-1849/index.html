 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1849 - Absolute Despise</strong></p>
 <p>At the moment when the people from the World Spiritist Alliance were all cheering excitedly, the three rank two Martial Emperors from the Dark Hall didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because they discovered that the water dragon, the fire dragon and the golden ferocious beasts were all carrying Incomplete Imperial Armaments or Top Quality Royal Armaments and Cosmos Sacks in their mouths. Those were all the possessions from the people of their Dark Hall.</p>
 <p>Upon thinking about how the previously mighty and impressive experts from the Dark Hall that were openly slaughtering the people from the World Spiritist Alliance had all been killed and their treasures plundered, the three Martial Emperors felt extreme lament.</p>
 <p>“Exactly who is it? Do you dare to show yourself?” The more the three rank two Martial Emperors thought about it, the more angry they became. Unable to contain themselves, they shouted at the golden sphere of light. At this moment, the three of them were no longer bothering to continue fighting against the World Spiritist Immortal. Instead, they firmly fixed their gazes onto that golden sphere of light.</p>
 <p>“Show myself? How would I not dare?” The voice from before sounded.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, the golden sphere of light began to dissipate. Soon, a figure appeared before everyone’s line of sight.</p>
 <p>“It’s the Left Reverend, it’s Lord Left Reverend.”</p>
 <p>“It’s Lord Left Reverend. Could it be that he has brought back reinforcements?” Upon seeing the man that had appeared before them, the crowd from the World Spiritist Alliance began to cheer nonstop. They all knew who he was. He was their Lord Left Reverend.</p>
 <p>At this moment, many elders and disciples felt that the Left Reverend had brought back reinforcements.</p>
 <p>“Mn?” At this moment, those people with good eyesight continued to fix their gazes onto the dissipating golden sphere of light. The reason for that was because they all knew that the person that had spoken earlier was not the Left Reverend. There were definitely other people in that golden sphere of light.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Finally, the golden sphere of light disappeared completely. At this moment, Chu Feng appeared before the crowd.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng’s body was covered with an armor of lightning and on his back were also two wings of lightning. His cultivation was the same as the Left Reverend’s. He was currently a rank one Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng?” Upon seeing Chu Feng, the expressions of the people from the World Spiritist Alliance all grew stiff. Then, different sorts of gazes appeared in their eyes.</p>
 <p>Some were baffled and others were shocked. They were all able to imagine that the God that had saved them was not the Left Reverend. In that case, it would be very likely for that God to be Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, is it really you?” At this moment, Sima Ying and the others’ gazes were also firmly fixed onto Chu Feng. They were all extremely emotional. At the same time, they all felt disbelief. They were not certain that it was really Chu Feng that had saved their World Spiritist Alliance.</p>
 <p>This was not because they were looking down on Chu Feng. Rather, it was because Chu Feng was a person from the younger generation, a person of the same age group as them.</p>
 <p>The battle earlier was something that even the strongest existence in the World Spiritist Alliance, the World Spiritist Immortal, had been powerless against. This was why they were skeptical as to whether the one that had saved them in that desperate crisis was truly Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, it’s actually you?” At this moment, the three Dark Hall’s Martial Emperors revealed expressions of deep shock. They had thought about many possibilities. However, none of them had ever expected for the person that saved the World Spiritist Alliance to be Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong? Scared? Didn’t you all wish to capture me? I’m standing right before you. Come, capture me,” Chu Feng said with a beaming smile. His gaze simply did not place those three rank two Martial Emperors in his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, regardless of what sort of treasure you used to create those golden ferocious beasts, it remains only the product of a treasure, and not your actual strength.”</p>
 <p>“As for the three of us, we are rank two Martial Emperors. Our strength is real,” Although they were extremely shocked to discover that it was Chu Feng, they soon heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>The World Spiritist Alliance possessed a lot of experts. They were truly scared that some exceptional expert had arrived to save the World Spiritist Alliance. After all, the might revealed earlier had truly not been something to look down upon.</p>
 <p>However, if it was Chu Feng, then they would not be afraid. Regardless of what sort of ability Chu Feng had used to increase his cultivation to rank one Martial Emperor, regardless of what sort of treasure Chu Feng had used to create the hundreds of golden ferocious beasts, they still felt that Chu Feng was merely a member of the younger generation.</p>
 <p>They had lived for a very long time, and experienced all sorts of crises. As such, how could they possibly fear a person from the younger generation, and one that was so young on top of that?</p>
 <p>“Treasure? Since when did world spirit techniques become treasures in your eyes?” Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, with a wave of his sleeve, the several hundred golden ferocious beasts all turned into golden light and entered Chu Feng’s body.</p>
 <p>“Heavens! Those were actually world spirit techniques?”</p>
 <p>At that moment, not to mention the three Dark Hall’s Martial Emperors, even the experts of the World Spiritist Alliance that were extremely proficient with world spirit techniques were enormously astonished by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>It was only when the golden ferocious beasts let out golden light that they discovered that they had been formed with world spirit techniques. Furthermore, Dragon marks filled those golden-bright and dazzling world spirit energy. Thus, they had also discovered that Chu Feng had not only unleashed such an exquisite world spirit technique, he had also become a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you’re a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist now?” Although he already knew that, the Left Reverend was still unable to contain himself from asking Chu Feng that question. He wished to verify this, for it was truly no small matter.</p>
 <p>“Senior, this junior has just recently become a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Great, this is truly great. Chu Feng, the speed of your progress truly surpasses my imagination,” The Left Reverend was extremely overjoyed.</p>
 <p>At the same time, many of the people present, for example, the World Spiritist Immortal, Miao Renlong, the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master and others, also revealed extremely overjoyed expressions on their aged faces.</p>
 <p>Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists. How many of them were present in the entire Holy Land of Martialism? Chu Feng had become a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist at such a young age. He was most definitely the youngest Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist in the history of the Holy Land of Martialism.</p>
 <p>“You’ve actually become a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist?” At that moment, the expressions of the three Dark Hall’s Martial Emperors changed.</p>
 <p>If Chu Feng had used treasures to summon those ferocious beasts, they would not have been afraid of Chu Feng. However, Chu Feng had actually created them with his world spirit techniques. This was absolutely not a small matter at all.</p>
 <p>While there were a few Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists, not many among them could actually create that many Martial Emperor-level ferocious beasts. At the very least, it was impossible for the World Spiritist Immortal to accomplish that feat. However, Chu Feng had managed to do it.</p>
 <p>Logically, Chu Feng should have only just become a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. His world spirit techniques should not be that powerful.</p>
 <p>However, he had unleashed such a powerful world spirit technique. This was sufficient to show that his world spirit techniques were extremely exquisite. As such, they had no choice but to take Chu Feng seriously.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng ignored the questioning of the Dark Hall’s Martial Emperors. Instead, he walked toward the World Spiritist Immortal one step at a time. As he walked, the water dragon and the fire dragon revealed their true forms. They were the Water Immortal Profound Technique and the Fire Immortal Profound Technique.</p>
 <p>Although they were Secret Skills, they looked extremely sacred. However, those two sacred existences were following behind Chu Feng like two bodyguards. This scene caused the crowd from the World Spiritist Alliance to become awestruck. They gasped in amazement, and their eyes were filled with admiration.</p>
 <p>After arriving before the World Spiritist Immortal, Chu Feng said to him, “Senior, you’ve been though a lot. Take a rest. Allow this junior to take care of these three animals on your behalf.”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, we should join hands against them,” The World Spiritist Immortal was worried about Chu Feng taking the three rank two Martial Emperors on alone.</p>
 <p>“Senior, please rest assured. I am enough to take care of the three of them. You do not have to trouble yourself again,” Chu Feng said confidently.</p>
 <p>“......”</p>
 <p>“Then, be extra careful,” Seeing Chu Feng’s extremely confident gaze, the World Spiritist Immortal moved to the side. The reason for that was because he knew that Chu Feng was not acting arrogant. For Chu Feng to be this confident at such a time, it was most likely because he possessed the strength to be confident.</p>
 <p>Thinking about it, when Chu Feng swept the floor with the Four Clan’s younger generation at Mooncloud City, he was already filled with astonishment and with admiration for Chu Feng’s heaven-defying strength.</p>
 <p>And now, Chu Feng was going to fight by himself against three rank two Martial Emperors. The World Spiritist Immortal truly wished to see how Chu Feng was going to fight against them.</p>
 <p>“What arrogance! However, that’s fine. I also happened to want to experience exactly how amazing the legendary Secret Skills are.”</p>
 <p>“Come, allow me to experience whether the strength of the Water Immortal Profound Technique and the Fire Immortal profound Technique are truly as they are rumored to be,” One of the Dark Hall’s Martial Emperors held his Incomplete Imperial Armament and stood forth.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right at this moment, the Water Immortal Profound Technique and the Fire Immortal Profound Technique suddenly entered Chu Feng’s body.</p>
 <p>After retrieving the two Secret Skills, Chu Feng said with a beaming smile, “Who said that I’m going to fight against you all using my Secret Skills?”</p>
 <p>“You…” That Martial Emperor who had stood out to fight against Chu Feng stood there in a stunned manner. He was at a complete loss.</p>
 <p>He had thought that Chu Feng had relied on the strength of his Secret Skills. Yet, Chu Feng had now deliberately refused to use his Secret Skills. This brought great anger to him.</p>
 <p>He was being looked down upon. Chu Feng was absolutely looking down on him.</p>
