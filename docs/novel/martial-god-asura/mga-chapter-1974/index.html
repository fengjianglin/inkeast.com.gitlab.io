 <p><strong> Chapter 1974 - Absolute Suppression</strong></p>
 <p>“I said that I am going to kill you,” Chu Feng repeated.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng said those words without much emphasis. However, when the crowd heard those words, their bodies trembled, and their expressions grew stiff.</p>
 <p>Even though many people had not managed to personally see Chu Feng killing Xian Yuyin, they heard about what had happened. After Chu Feng killed Xian Yuyin, he had clearly fled the scene immediately. He fled in terror from Xian Yuyin’s uncle and was only alive because he was saved by the Weaponry Refinement Immortal.</p>
 <p>Yet, what was going on right now? Chu Feng actually declared that he had spared Xian Yuyin’s uncle? Was that not boasting shamelessly?</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, are you stupid or what? You actually said those words to me?”</p>
 <p>“Earlier, if it hadn’t been for the Weaponry Refinement Immortal saving you, you would’ve already been killed by me. You’re going to kill me? Do you even think you’re qualified?” Xian Yuyin’s uncle said with a loud voice.</p>
 <p>“Whether or not I’m qualified, won’t you know when you fight me?” Chu Feng said with a disapproving expression. The gaze with which he looked to Xian Yuyin’s uncle was actually filled with disdain.</p>
 <p>“Bastard! If I do not dismember your body into ten thousand pieces today, I am not an Ancient Era’s Elf.”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Xian Yuyin’s uncle unleashed his attack. With a thought, he controlled his surging martial power. With earth-shattering might, it began to engulf Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Everything had happened too quickly. At that moment, apart from the rank six Martial Emperors present, the majority of the others were unable able to react to Xian Yuyin’s uncle’s attack. At that moment, there were still a lot of people standing beside Chu Feng. Those people all felt an intense killing intent surrounding them.</p>
 <p>At that moment, if Xian Yuyin’s uncle’s attack were to land successfully, it would not only be Chu Feng who would die. Many others would also accompany him in death. The reason for that was because even though Elder Huang Guan and the others possessed the strength to block that attack, none of them dared to act against the Ancient Era’s Elves. As such, they could only escape by themselves.</p>
 <p>“Disperse,” instantly lightning flashed through Chu Feng’s eyes, and his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings appeared together.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had not moved. He had only shouted. However, that shout of his had turned Xian Yuyin’s uncle’s attack into energy ripples. They rumbled before Chu Feng, but were unable to approach him.</p>
 <p>Blocked. Xian Yuyin’s uncle’s attack was blocked by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>At that moment, everyone revealed stunned expressions. They were all startled because they had all discovered that Chu Feng’s current aura was that of a rank four Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>They had heard that Chu Feng’s Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings were capable of increasing his cultivation by two levels. Thus, judging from that, Chu Feng’s actual cultivation was already no longer that of the rank one Martial Emperor that others said he was. Instead, he was a rank two Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>However, even if Chu Feng was a rank two Martial Emperor who had managed to temporarily increase his cultivation to rank four Martial Emperor through a special method, it should still be impossible for him to be a match for a rank six Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>However, at the moment when Chu Feng unleashed his oppressive might, the crowd all felt that Chu Feng’s oppressive might was even more frightening than Xian Yuyin’s uncle’s oppressive might.</p>
 <p>Exactly what was going on?</p>
 <p>At that moment, Elder Huang Guan was the one who asked, “A heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation? Little friend Chu Feng, could it be that you possess a battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation?”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. It is as senior suspected, I possess a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivations,” Chu Feng nodded.</p>
 <p>“What? A heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation? Chu Feng’s battle power is capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation?”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, the crowd that was already extremely shocked became completely stunned. It was not that they were ignorant. Rather, a battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivations was truly too frightening.</p>
 <p>Ordinary Martial Emperors only possessed battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. For those capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation, they were simply legends. Yet, Chu Feng was actually capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation? That was simply unparalleled.</p>
 <p>Not to mention the others, even the gaze with which Xian Yuyin’s uncle looked to Chu Feng had changed.</p>
 <p>He was a rank six Martial Emperor with a battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he was a rank four Martial Emperor with a battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation.</p>
 <p>Even though there appeared to be an enormous gap in strength between the two of them, Chu Feng’s heaven-defying battle power had made up for the gap in their martial cultivation. Currently, the two of them possessed the same level of battle power.</p>
 <p>“No wonder you’re that arrogant. However, you killed my nephew. As such, I must return the debt in blood,” However, even with that being the case, Xian Yuyin’s uncle was still unwilling to give up. Instead, he unleashed another ferocious attack at Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>But regardless of how he attacked Chu Feng, he was unable to injure Chu Feng in the slightest. Regardless of how fierce his attacks were, they all ended up being blocked by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>In the end, Xian Yuyin’s uncle even used an Incomplete Imperial Armament. However, he was still unable to suppress Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash!!!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Feng shouted and unleashed the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash’s nine slashes in rapid succession. As for that ninth slash, not only did it manage to slice through Xian Yuyin’s uncle’s attack, it had even sliced off one of his arms.</p>
 <p>“Heavens, that!!!” Everyone was stunned by that scene. They were at a complete loss as boundless astonishment filled their hearts.</p>
 <p>Even if Chu Feng possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting five levels of cultivation, his actual battle power should only be equal to that of Xian Yuyin’s uncle. However, as the two men fought, Chu Feng held absolute superiority in their battle. In fact, even after Xian Yuyin’s uncle unleashed his Incomplete Imperial Armament, Chu Feng still fought him without any weapon.</p>
 <p>However, it was precisely such a weaponless Chu Feng that had sliced off one of Xian Yuyin’s uncle’s arms. Not only was his arm sliced off, the Incomplete Imperial Armament that he had held in that hand also fell to the ground.</p>
 <p>“Ahhhh!!!!!!!!!!!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Xian Yuyin’s uncle started to shout. He was not shouting from the pain of losing his arm. Rather, he was shouting due to his overwhelming anger.</p>
 <p>After shouting, he flipped his remaining palm. Immediately, heaven and earth started to tremble as a golden-bright and dazzling giant ax appeared in his hand.</p>
 <p>Imperial Armament. That was an actual Imperial Armament that emitted an incomparable amount of Emperor’s Might. When that Imperial Armament appeared, Xian Yuyin’s uncle’s aura instantly increased enormously. His aura had actually begun to suppress Chu Feng’s.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, so what if you possess overwhelming power? I possess an Imperial Armament. Your measly little life is destined to be mine,” Ever since the fight begun, Xian Yuyin’s uncle had been oppressed by Chu Feng the entire time.</p>
 <p>The reason why he had not used his Imperial Armament after fighting for so long was because he had not wanted to publicly shame himself. After all, even if he managed to defeat Chu Feng through the use of his Imperial Armament, he would only appear to have won through an unfair advantage.</p>
 <p>However, as matters stood, he no longer possessed any other choice. Regardless of whether he was willing to or not, he had to admit that Chu Feng was very powerful, and had surpassed him. If he still held back on using his Imperial Armament, the person that would end up dying would be him.</p>
 <p>And now since he had revealed his Imperial Armament, Xian Yuyin’s uncle was once again filled with confidence. He was finally able to explosively release the feeling of being oppressed the entire time.</p>
 <p>“This is truly bad!!!”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Elder Huang Guan and the others that wished for Chu Feng’s victory all started to frown. The reason for that was because an Imperial Armament’s strength was not something that could be looked down upon.</p>
 <p>If two people of equal strength were fighting, and one of them possessed an Imperial Armament, that Imperial Armament would be capable of reversing the entire fight.</p>
 <p>‘Chu Feng, you are doomed this time,’ The crowd from the Heavenly Law Palace began to sneer in their hearts. They all wished for Chu Feng’s death. However, the performance Chu Feng displayed earlier caused even them to have a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng, and feel that Chu Feng would not be killed. Originally, they had been extremely disappointed. However, they now managed to see hope again.</p>
 <p>“Imperial Armament? You’re not the only one with one,” Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly flipped his palm. As silvery light flickered, the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader appeared in his hand.</p>
