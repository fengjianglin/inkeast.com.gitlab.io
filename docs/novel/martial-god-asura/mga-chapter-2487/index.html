 <p><strong> Chapter 2487 - Who Is The Coward?</strong></p>
 <p>“However, not only did this Chu Luxuan capture my friends as hostages, using them to threaten me, he also ordered for his men to exterminate the Three Stars Hall. Everyone knows that the Three Stars Hall were also my friends. If I didn’t arrive on time, the Three Stars Hall would’ve likely been gone by now,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Chu Luxuan actually ordered his men to extinguish the Three Stars Hall? This is truly too ruthless, no? Even if the Three Stars Hall is related to Chu Feng, there shouldn’t be a need for one to go so far as to use them to vent one’s anger, no?” After hearing what Chu Feng said, everyone's heart tightened.</p>
 <p>They all realized that that Chu Luxuan was actually only a gentleman on the surface, but in reality was a despicable and vile individual.</p>
 <p>After all, in the Sunset Cloud Valley, he had only imprisoned the people of the Sunset Cloud Valley, and did not injure them in the slightest. This made him appear to be someone who was able to distance himself clearly between his grudges and grievances.</p>
 <p>In turn, many people felt that Chu Luxuan was an upright individual.</p>
 <p>However, he actually did such a despicable thing in the shadows. He had actually wanted to exterminate the entire Three Stars Hall. He was simply too ruthless.</p>
 <p>When comparing the two, an intense contrast could be seen. This inevitably caused the crowd to feel that Chu Luxuan was a hypocrite.</p>
 <p>He would do one thing on the surface, and do another in the shadows.</p>
 <p>“Thus, no matter what, I absolutely cannot allow this matter to be dropped just like this,” Chu Feng continued.</p>
 <p>“You don’t want to drop this matter? What can you possibly do about it?” Seeing that Chu Feng still wanted to continue looking further into this, the already sullen Chu Luxuan spoke in a very unreconciled manner.</p>
 <p>“You shut up!” Right after Chu Luxuan said those words, Chu Xuanlang immediately shouted at him angrily.</p>
 <p>After being berated by Chu Xuanlang, Chu Luxuan’s fury vanished instantly. Once again, he lowered his head silently.</p>
 <p>“Go ahead and tell me what you want,” Chu Xuanlang said to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Firstly, I want you to guarantee the safety of the people from the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Very well, I agree to that. From today on, if anyone in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm dares to attack the Sunset Cloud Valley or the Three Stars Hall, they will be making an enemy out of me, Chu Xuanlang. I will definitely not allow them to get away with it,” Chu Xuanlang agreed frankly.</p>
 <p>“Frank,” At that moment, even Chu Feng felt admiration for Chu Xuanlang’s manner of bearing.</p>
 <p>Logically, a person of the younger generation like Chu Feng would simply not have the qualifications to make conditions with someone like Chu Xuanlang.</p>
 <p>However, not only did Chu Xuanlang allow Chu Feng to raise his demands, but he also agreed to Chu Feng’s demands. This meant that… Chu Xuanlang truly possessed sincerity in his invitation for Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Then, young brother Chu Feng, are you willing to leave with me now?” Chu Xuanlang asked.</p>
 <p>“Of course,” Chu Feng answered.</p>
 <p>“Very well. There’s no time to delay, let’s set off right now. Your two friends are still waiting for you,” As Chu Xuanlong spoke, he soared into the sky and arrived before Chu Feng. He was planning to leave with Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly said, “Wait.”</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Chu Xuanlang asked.</p>
 <p>“There’s a gift that I must give him,” After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he looked at Chu Luxuan.</p>
 <p>“What gift?” Not only was Chu Xuanlang curious, but the others present were also very curious.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng wanted to give a gift to Chu Luxuan? This was simply something inconceivable.</p>
 <p>However, it was evident that Chu Feng was not joking around. Thus, they were all curious as to exactly what sort of present Chu Feng would give Chu Luxuan.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Before the attentive gazes of the crowd, Chu Feng raised his hand and made a grabbing motion. Then, an attractive force covered the sky.</p>
 <p>Before such an enormous attractive force, one of the two halves of the enormous signboard that had been cut into two by Chu Feng was sucked toward him.</p>
 <p>Before the signboard could reach Chu Feng’s hand, Chu Feng suddenly waved his hand downward. Then, the signboard began to fly down from the sky. “Boom!” Like an enormous sharp blade, it landed beside Chu Luxuan.</p>
 <p>“Sssss~~~”</p>
 <p>When the crowd saw that piece of the signboard, they were all shocked.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Luxuan, his expression turned exceptionally ugly.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because there was only a single word on the signboard -- coward.</p>
 <p>“To challenge me to a battle by capturing people to threaten me, only to hide behind your senior’s protection to save your life.”</p>
 <p>“The word coward suits you better,” Chu Feng said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“You!!!” Chu Luxuan’s complexion turned red. He started to gnash his teeth in anger. He had the appearance of someone who was about to lash out at Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, before Chu Luxuan could speak, Chu Xuanlang said, “Luxuan, enough. Since you’ve lost, you must be willing to accept it.”</p>
 <p>After Chu Xuanlang spoke, even though Chu Luxuan was feeling displeased, he did not dare to say anything.</p>
 <p>Then, the space where Chu Xuanlang and Chu Feng were at trembled slightly. After that, Chu Xuanlang and Chu Feng disappeared.</p>
 <p>At that moment, only Chu Luxuan, the people of the Sunset Cloud Valley and the bystanders remained.</p>
 <p>“The hell are you all looking at?!” Suddenly, Chu Luxuan exploded. He shouted furiously, and caused even space itself to violently tremble. That ferocious gaze of his seemed to indicate that he wanted to eat someone alive.</p>
 <p>Faced with such a Chu Luxuan, how could the crowd dare say anything? None of them even dared to look him in the face.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, I’ll show you sooner or later!”</p>
 <p>Chu Luxuan was truly feeling extremely sullen. Not only was he feeling extremely sullen, but he also felt extremely humiliated.</p>
 <p>Thus, he had no face to continue to stay there. After he finished saying those words, his body shifted, and he disappeared.</p>
 <p>Evidently, he had also left.</p>
 <p>Although he felt extremely furious, he did not do anything to the crowd present, nor did he do anything to the people of the Sunset Cloud Valley.</p>
 <p>However, it remained that he had shouted loudly at the crowd, and aimed the anger in his heart toward the crowd.</p>
 <p>“If you have the ability, go and vent out your anger to Chu Feng. The hell are you venting your anger on us for?”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. It seems that a genius of the Chu Heavenly Clan is only at this level too.”</p>
 <p>After verifying that Chu Luxuan had left, some bold individuals began to voice their discontent. After that, they all left in succession.</p>
 <p>There were also people that chose to stay. They were still enjoying themselves while reminiscing on the things that had happened.</p>
 <p>After all, it could be said that they had witnessed an enormous event.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had appeared and dispelled the rumors of his death. They were all able to verify that that exceptional genius was still alive.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Chu Feng had defeated a genius of the Chu Heavenly Clan with his absolute strength. Such a battle was simply too great.</p>
 <p>What happened was destined to be spread far and wide. In fact, it would even be passed down to future generations. And they, were witnesses to that major battle.</p>
 <p>Merely by witnessing what had happened on that day, they could boast for thousands of years to their friends, their children and their descendants. Thus, at this moment, they were all feeling extremely excited.</p>
 <p>Of course, there were also a portion of people that decided to stay so as to worm their way into being friends with the Sunset Cloud Valley.</p>
 <p>Their intentions were very clear. Since Chu Feng possessed such overwhelming strength, and had also obtained the favor of that Chu Heavenly Clan’s Chu Xuanlang, he was destined to rise in power.</p>
 <p>The crowd felt that there would be a bloodbath soon, a bloodbath formed by the emergence of Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>After what happened on that day, they firmly believed that that person from the younger generation, Chu Feng, possessed the ability to stir up a storm in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p>
 <p>As the Sunset Cloud Valley possessed an extraordinary status with Chu Feng, they felt that if they were able to enter a relationship with the Sunset Cloud Valley, they might be able to hug Chu Feng’s thighs and benefit from him.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had no idea what was happening in the Sunset Cloud Valley at that moment. However, he was also not worried about the safety of the people in the Sunset Cloud Valley.</p>
 <p>He could tell that this Chu Xuanlang was definitely an extraordinary individual. Likely, he would possess an extraordinary status even in the Chu Heavenly Clan.</p>
 <p>Else, there would be no reason for a genius as proud and arrogant as Chu Luxuan to be that scared of him.</p>
 <p>With him voicing his guarantee, not to mention Chu Luxuan, it was likely that not a single person in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm would dare do anything to the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall.</p>
 <p>With the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall safe, Chu Feng would have one less worry. As such, he would be able to do things with less concern in the future.</p>
