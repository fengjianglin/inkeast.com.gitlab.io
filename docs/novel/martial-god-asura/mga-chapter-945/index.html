 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 945 - Kill without Exception</strong></p>
 <p><span style>When the Demon Sealing Sword arose, everything shook. Gales blew all about, and the entire palace was in chaos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only after a long while did it gradually calm down…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the burst of might faded away, Chu Feng was still standing at the very same place; however, in his hand, there was an extra pitch-black sword—it was, of course, the Demon Sealing Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This… How is this possible? He truly pulled it out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was dumbfounded. They felt this was not reality, and some people were even trembling in fear. No matter what, they never expected this young man to truly pull out the Demon Sealing Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the Demon Sealing Sword! A Royal Armament no one could pull out other than the former head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect! Even the Four Protectors had failed, yet this young man had succeeded! How could they remain collected?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bastard! Who do you think you are to hold the Demon Sealing Sword?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>You Mingdeng was enraged. He released his rank four Martial King aura, and with killing intent, he leapt towards Chu Feng. He was actually attacking Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*boom*</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, before he was even able to approach him, a thunderous explosion rang out. At the same time, the Demon Sealing Sword in Chu Feng’s hand shot up, bringing Chu Feng into the air. After breaking through the palace’s ceiling, he broke through the underground palace, into the surface, arriving in the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heavens, what is that? What flew from beneath?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a person, and it seems to be someone from the Crippling Night Demon Sect! Who is that? I don’t think I’ve seen him before?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people on the surface still didn’t know anything that occurred underground. When an object flew out from below and straight into the blue sky, it shocked the people above ground. All of them raised their head and curiously looked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Simultaneously, the ones underground started flying out and arrived on the surface. What Chu Feng took away was the Crippling Night Demon Sect’s treasure, the Demon Sealing Sword!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, only after arriving on the surface did they discover Chu Feng hadn’t left. At that moment, he stood unmoving in the air. The sky itself started changing due to Chu Feng’s emergence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*boom rumble rumble rumble*</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rolling black clouds surface into the peaceful atmosphere, and thick strings of lightning were akin to enormous sinister dragons as they circled around Chu Feng’s body, protecting him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Sealing Sword released endless black mist which lingered endlessly in the air. A horrifying ear-piercing howl, akin to the cry of a demon, reverberated through the mist and out into the surrounding area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, the black mist progressively increased in size. By the time it stopped expanding, it had already enveloped the entire sky. Despite the terrifying howls and cries that rang out from the black mass, none of it harmed Chu Feng. Rather, it appeared that it was guarding him instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is happening? The Demon Sealing Sword is protecting him!” Not to mention others, even You Mingdeng and the other Protectors were completely baffled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You Mingdeng, I pulled out the Demon Sealing Sword! Therefore, I am now the head of the Crippling Night Demon Sect! You don’t kneel and kowtow, and even dare to attack me! This is truly dishonourable, and this offense warrants execution!” Chu Feng shouted as he held the Demon Sealing Sword and pointed at You Mingdeng below.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? That’s the Demon Sealing Sword? The Crippling Night Demon Sect’s most valuable treasure, the Demon Sealing Sword?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Feng’s words undoubtedly told everyone he had successfully pulled it out, and became qualified to lead them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What should we do? When the sect head was alive, he had indeed said the one who pulled out the Demon Sealing Sword could become sect head, and we had to unconditionally serve that person!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many people panicked. Although Chu Feng had been successful, they were naturally unwilling to have a person they knew nothing of to lead them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?!” You Mingdeng asked. His words lacked the slightest bit of respect, and instead were filled with fury and resentment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You really want to know who I am? No problem, I’ll show you who I am!” Chu Feng laughed, then waved his big sleeve. When the sleeve slid past his face, Chu Feng’s complexion had changed, returning to its initial form.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng? He’s Chu Feng?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The observers couldn’t help but deeply gasp. Some were incomparably excited, and some felt disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though for many of them it was their first time seeing Chu Feng, they still recognized him. After all, Chu Feng was famous in the Eastern Sea Region. His wanted posters were pasted in every street in the Eastern Sea Region. Not to mention the people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect, even many ordinary citizens knew of Chu Feng’s appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Chu Feng, is it you? Is it truly you? You haven’t died?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan Xiaochao and Fu Fengming were elated as they shouted loudly. If it weren’t for their masters stopping them, they would have already risen into the air and passionately embraced him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their relationship with Chu Feng had always been quite good. When they first heard that Chu Feng had possibly died, they had even felt sorrowful for quite a while. Right now, knowing that Chu Feng hadn’t died yet, they were naturally surprised and excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Xuan Xiaochao, it is indeed me. I haven’t died. I escaped from the Misty Peak.” Chu Feng nodded. He too had quite good feelings towards Xuan Xiaochao and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, it truly is Chu Feng! This is great! I was wondering why this person was so monstrous… So he was Chu Feng! He’s an unprecedented genius in the Eastern Sea Region, and now, he has pulled out the Demon Sealing Sword! He should indeed become sect head.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were cheers that rang out within the sea of people after confirmation of Chu Feng’s identity. From that, one could see a large portion of the Crippling Night Demon Sect felt it was acceptable for Chu Feng to become sect head. Some even wanted him to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Chu Feng had only been in the Crippling Night Demon Sect for a very short time, his achievements completely convinced them all. They felt only a genius like him could bring the Crippling Night Demon Sect back to its glory. He was the most suitable nominee for sect head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before, due to the existence of the Four Protectors, they didn’t dare to say those words. However, Chu Feng had now pulled out the Demon Sealing Sword. He became the successor the former sect head decided on. They could finally speak the thoughts in their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng, I knew you had ulterior motives by joining the Crippling Night Demon Sect! Indeed, you came here for the Crippling Night Demon Sect’s invaluable treasure, the Demon Sealing Sword! Today, don’t even think of leaving!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Members of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, attention! This child is not a member of our sect, and he even dares to rob our treasure! He must be killed without exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No matter who it is, if you’re a member of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, you will have accomplished a great deed if you kill Chu Feng, and you will be greatly rewarded!” But just at that moment, You Mingdeng pointed towards Chu Feng and shouted. He had actually ordered Chu Feng’s death.</span></p>
