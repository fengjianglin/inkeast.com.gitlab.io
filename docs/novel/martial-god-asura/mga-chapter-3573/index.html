 <p><strong>Chapter 3573 - One Year</strong></p>
 <p>“In that case, what must I do to leave this place?”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s expression turned serious.</p>
 <p>Ignoring the fact of whether or not he would be able to leave, a year was simply too long.</p>
 <p>“Don’t ask too many superfluous questions. Just do as I say,” after the little girl said those words, she suddenly leapt forward and started to fly in the sky.</p>
 <p>Seeing that, Chu Feng did not hesitate, and flew after the little girl.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Time passed quickly. In the blink of an eye, it had been many months since Chu Feng arrived at that place.</p>
 <p>Once the night passed, it would be exactly a year.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The stars covered the sky above.</p>
 <p>The light of fireflies covered the ground below.</p>
 <p>Sounds of bugs could be heard nearby, and cranes could be seen flying in the distance.</p>
 <p>This place was truly a land of immortals, a paradise. Its nights were particularly beautiful.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was currently on the summit of a floating mountain.</p>
 <p>Surrounding him were many other floating mountains.</p>
 <p>The buildings on top of those floating islands were not only peculiar, but they were also emitting light.</p>
 <p>Those were formations!!!</p>
 <p>During the past year, Chu Feng had been busy every day. In fact, he had never even closed his eyes. He had been completely focused on doing one task the entire time -- setting up defensive formations.</p>
 <p>All the defensive formations present in his surroundings were taught to him by the little girl.</p>
 <p>They not only utilized Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques, but they also utilized an even stronger power, the power of the Void Sacred Tree.</p>
 <p>Thus, those defensive formations were all very powerful!!!</p>
 <p>Standing atop the floating island, Chu Feng looked into the distance.</p>
 <p>He saw bright starlight, and the peaceful night sky. He furrowed his brows into a frown.</p>
 <p>If he was still unable to leave before the night was over, he would, as stated by the little girl, die there.</p>
 <p>“Child, will they really come tonight?”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng lowered his head and looked down at the palace below.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Once Chu Feng’s words left his mouth, a figure flew up from the palace below. Like a butterfly, that figure circled gracefully around the palace as it flew upward. Finally, it landed beside him.</p>
 <p>As for that figure, she was none other than the little girl Chu Feng had met a year ago.</p>
 <p>He had interacted with the little girl morning and night over the past year. Thus, their relationship had become pretty good.</p>
 <p>However, the little girl had not told Chu Feng her name even at that moment.</p>
 <p>She wanted Chu Feng to address her as ‘senior’, but Chu Feng was more fond of addressing her as ‘child.’</p>
 <p>In the beginning, the little girl was very much against it. However, over time, perhaps she had gotten used to it, but she quietly accepted Chu Feng’s way of addressing her.</p>
 <p>“Rest assured, they will definitely come,” said the little girl.</p>
 <p>“Child, does it mean that I will be able to leave this place should I be able to stop those things that are coming to catch you?” asked Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had been setting up defensive formations the entire year all for the sake of that day.</p>
 <p>According to the little girl, demonic beings would come to capture her the following day.</p>
 <p>Those demonic beings were no small matter. Only those formations were capable of protecting her.</p>
 <p>As long as he could protect the little girl, he would be able to leave.</p>
 <p>“Be completely at ease, as long as those demonic beings are stopped, I will release you.”</p>
 <p>“If they cannot be stopped, then you’ll have to die together with me,” said the little girl.</p>
 <p>“Turns out it’s you who gets to decide whether or not I can leave?” asked Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“I am not the one who gets to decide it. This is a trial that the Void Sacred Tree has for you. It is also a trial it has for me. You are only able to have a chance to enter this place because I chose to believe in you.”</p>
 <p>“And now, you and I are grasshoppers tied to the same rope. If I am to die, you will not be able to live either. If I am to live, you will be able to leave.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, I hope that you will not disappoint me Otherwise… you will make me, who has lived for over a million years, die here.”</p>
 <p>The little girl looked at Chu Feng with a very serious expression. She did not seem to be joking at all.</p>
 <p>“Child, be completely at ease. Do you see this?” As Chu Feng spoke, he took out a crimson sword from his Cosmos Sack.</p>
 <p>“This sword is called the Evil God Sword. It is quite powerful. If those defensive formations are all unable to stop those so-called demonic beings, I will use this sword to slaughter all of them,” Chu Feng spoke in a very show-offish manner. He fiddled with the Evil God Sword before the little girl.</p>
 <p>“With that lousy sword of yours? You don't know how powerful those demonic beings are. If those defensive formations are unable to stop them at all, we will truly be screwed,” said the little girl.</p>
 <p>“With me here, your safety is guaranteed,” Chu Feng spoke with confidence.</p>
 <p>The reason why Chu Feng was so confident was because he knew how powerful those defensive formations were. After all, those were defensive formations that he had spent an entire year of effort and the power of the Void Sacred Tree to set up.</p>
 <p>“I’ll be relying on you then,” the little girl revealed a sweet smile.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had been in that place for a year now. Although the little girl was very fond of talking, he rarely saw her smile.</p>
 <p>Perhaps because she rarely smiled, when Chu Feng saw that smile on her face, he became even more determined to protect her.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because he saw trust in the little girl’s smile.</p>
 <p>“Rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the earth started to tremble violently. Even the skies were reacting to the shaking.</p>
 <p>The trembling grew stronger and stronger, the rumbles louder and louder. Flocks of birds flew into the sky, and beasts roared. The region had entered complete chaos.</p>
 <p>Following that, many terrifying roars exploded from afar. Those roars were even more ear-piercing than thunder.</p>
 <p>“Is it those demonic beings you spoke of?” asked Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Apart from those guys, what else could it be? What else could possibly create such a commotion in this world?” said the little girl.</p>
 <p>“I’ve spent an entire year to set up these defensive formations. I’ll see exactly what sort of ability those demonic beings might possess.”</p>
 <p>Facing the unknown demonic beings, it would be a lie to say that Chu Feng did not feel nervous. However, at the same time, he was somewhat looking forward to them too.</p>
 <p>He wanted to see exactly what sort of capability those demonic beings might possess. He wanted to see if they could breach the grand defensive formations that he had spent an entire year setting up.</p>
