 <p><strong> Chapter 2240 - Young Master Li Ming</strong></p>
 <p>Chu Feng felt overjoyed upon hearing those words.</p>
 <p>He current did possess a lot of enemies. Not mentioning Luyang’s Pavilion, merely the Four World Spiritist Emperors already had the intention to kill him.</p>
 <p>It was indeed very difficult for him to protect himself with merely the strength of a rank four Half Martial Ancestor. Even for Her Lady Queen, who possessed overwhelming battle power, she was only able to easily kill rank one Martial Ancestors. When faced with rank two Martial Ancestors, a fierce battle would be unavoidable.</p>
 <p>However, those three Immortal Transformation Pellets were capable of increasing Chu Feng’s cultivation from rank four Half Martial Ancestor to Martial Ancestor. Especially the third medicinal pellet, it was capable of increasing Chu Feng’s cultivation to rank five Martial Ancestor. That was no small matter at all.</p>
 <p>It would truly be a qualitative leap.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng knew that the Immortal Transformation Pellets were most definitely not ordinary medicinal pellets. Even if they were concocted by the Golden Crane True Immortal, it would likely have been a very laborious process.</p>
 <p>“Thank you senior,” Chu Feng carefully put the medicinal pellets away. Then, he asked, “Senior, how long will the effects of the medicinal pellets last?”</p>
 <p>“The effects will last for an hour,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“One hour? If fighting against others, that would suffice,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“It would naturally be enough. However, you must remember this. Although your cultivation will increase after using the medicinal pellets, your Heavenly Bloodline’s power will be sealed. Not only will you not be able to use your Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings, even your heaven-defying battle power will be gone.”</p>
 <p>“For example, should you take the first medicinal pellet, you will be able to obtain the strength of a rank three Martial Ancestor for an hour.”</p>
 <p>“However, even though you will be able to control the martial power and use it to unleash martial skills, you will only be able to contend against rank three Martial Ancestors. All rank four Martial Ancestors will be able to easily kill you.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, when faced with different enemies, you must make sure to use different Immortal Transformation Pellets. Remember, you must not be careless,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“Thank you for your reminder, senior. This junior will forever remember senior’s grace today,” Chu Feng clasped his fist and thanked him.</p>
 <p>“Grace? This Immortal is merely fond of talent, and does not wish for you to be killed by others that harbor evil intentions.”</p>
 <p>“However, even though I am fond of talent, this Immortal will still not conceal the fact that you have killed that Li Rui.”</p>
 <p>“I will personally announce this matter to the crowd. However, before I announce it, you should first confess to that man from the Sunset Cloud Valley,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s heart tightened. However, he still clasped his fist and bowed, “Senior, that is something that this junior has done. As such, I will assume the responsibility.”</p>
 <p>“That would be the best,” After the Golden Crane True Immortal’s voice sounded, a spirit formation enveloped Chu feng. When the light of the spirit formation dissipated, Chu Feng had left that place.</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng left, the Golden Crane True Immortal and the plain clothed old monk appeared.</p>
 <p>“It seems that you truly do not plan to take him as your disciple?” The plain clothed old monk asked the Golden Crane True Immortal.</p>
 <p>“That child’s talent is indeed rare. However, I, Golden Crane, am not a half-hearted individual. Since I have already chosen that brat, I will naturally not choose Chu Feng instead.”</p>
 <p>“Since you think so highly of Chu Feng, why do you not take him as your disciple?” The Golden Crane True Immortal asked the old monk.</p>
 <p>“You think I do not want to take him as a disciple? You should know that I think very highly of him. I feel that his accomplishments in the future will surpass that brat that you think highly of,” The plain clothed old monk said.</p>
 <p>“Are you saying those words to incite me?”</p>
 <p>“Even if Chu Feng’s accomplishments today have been decent, I still feel that his future accomplishments will be inferior to that brat that I’ve chosen,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“This, I’m not going to argue with you. You have your own vision, whereas I have mine. Arguing will serve no purpose.”</p>
 <p>“I will only tell you this. I truly wanted to take that Chu Feng as my disciple. Merely, you also know what sort of mysterious technique I train in. There is nothing I can teach him,” The plain clothed old monk said helplessly.</p>
 <p>“Who said you had to teach him? You could simply have him be your disciple, and not teach him anything, granting him only the status of your disciple.”</p>
 <p>“Like that, you would be able to openly protect him.”</p>
 <p>“Else, for a talent like him to rely only on himself, it will be very easy for him to die young.”</p>
 <p>“Not mentioning the others, merely those four brats already harbor killing intent toward him. Else… I wouldn’t have given him those three Immortal Transformation Pellets.”</p>
 <p>“You should know how dark the world of martial cultivators is.”</p>
 <p>“However, should you take him as your disciple, I wouldn’t have to interfere in this matter,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“That is precisely the reason why I cannot take him as my disciple. You also know how many enemies I have,” The plain clothed old monk said.</p>
 <p>“This…” At that moment, the Golden Crane True Immortal was startled. He seemed to have thought of something. After a while, he said, “It shouldn’t be an issue in this Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, no?”</p>
 <p>“Who knows when they will chase me over here,” The plain clothed old monk smiled wryly.</p>
 <p>“Oh you,” The Golden Crane True Immortal sighed. Then, he said, “If that is the case, you really should distance yourself from that Chu Feng. If he is by himself, there will still be a chance that he will survive.”</p>
 <p>“However, if he is to become involved with you, he will definitely be killed.”</p>
 <p>“See, didn’t I say that?” The plain clothed old monk sighed helplessly. Then, he looked to the Golden Crane True Immortal with a beaming smile. He said, “How about you help him some more?”</p>
 <p>“Forget about it. We are neither relatives nor friends. Even if I am extremely fond of talent, I have already helped as much as I can. After all, he is but a stranger that I’ve met once,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“That’s true,” The plain clothed old monk nodded. Then, he said, “In that case, whatever accomplishments he might be able to obtain will all depend on himself.”</p>
 <p>“Even if you are worried for him, it would be useless. If he truly possesses abilities, he will definitely break through the hardships. After all, it was like that for the two of us back then too.”</p>
 <p>“However, if his strength is insufficient, even if he is to be killed by others, it cannot be blamed on them. After all, the world of martial cultivators is cruel like that,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>The plain clothed old monk sighed deeply. He knew that what the Golden Crane True Immortal had said was very true.</p>
 <p>At the moment when the Golden Crane True Immortal and the plain clothed old monk were conversing, Chu Feng had been teleported out of Mount Cloud Crane.</p>
 <p>It was not only Chu Feng that was here. At that moment, everyone was gathered here.</p>
 <p>At that moment, it was not only Xu Yiyi and the others that were unable to ascend Mount Cloud Crane that were here; even Liu Xiaoli and the others that had managed to ascend Mount Cloud Crane were here.</p>
 <p>At that moment, practically everyone was looking at Chu Feng with gazes of admiration. In fact, many of the younger generation were looking at him with gazes filled with envy and adoration.</p>
 <p>Clearly, everyone already knew what had happened at the summit of Mount Cloud Crane.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you are truly amazing. I’ve heard that you’ve become an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.”</p>
 <p>“Wow! You simply surpass my imagination. I am truly proud to have a friend like you.”</p>
 <p>Xu Yiyi rushed toward Chu Feng. Like a horse that had thrown off its reins, she started to jump around non-stop after reaching Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need for you to be this excited, no?” Chu Feng said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Of course I’m excited. You are the second youngest Immortal-cloak World Spiritist in our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,” Xu Yiyi said excitedly.</p>
 <p>“Second? Who is the first?” Liu Xiaoli asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“Don’t you know? It would naturally be the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm’s number one genius, Young Master Li Ming,” Xu Yiyi said.</p>
 <p>“Young Master Li Ming?” Liu Xiaoli revealed a surprised expression. It was not only her; many of the others present also revealed such expressions.</p>
 <p>“You all couldn’t possibly have never heard of Young Master Li Ming, right? He is our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm’s most talented, most demon-level genius.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, that’s right. I’ve heard that the Golden Crane True Immortal even wanted to take him as his disciple.”</p>
 <p>“However… he was refused,” Xu Yiyi said.</p>
