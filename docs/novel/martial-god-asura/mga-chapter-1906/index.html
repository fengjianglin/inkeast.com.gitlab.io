 <p><strong> Chapter 1906 - Kneel And Beg For Forgiveness</strong></p>
 <p>“Avaricious Immortal, there’s no need for you to gasp in surprise just yet. Next, it’s time for you to break my formation.”</p>
 <p>Faced with the Avaricious Immortal’s panicky expression, Chu Feng’s smile did not decrease in the slightest. As he spoke, he sat down in midair, clasped his hands together and closed his eyes.</p>
 <p>“What is Chu Feng doing? Isn’t he supposed to be setting up his spirit formation?”</p>
 <p>Originally, a lot of people had thought that Chu Feng was going to set up his spirit formation, and were greatly looking forward to it.</p>
 <p>However, after Chu Feng sat down, he became motionless.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, once he started sitting, he sat for two entire hours. It was as if he had fallen asleep. This caused the crowd to be extremely puzzled and confused by what Chu Feng was doing.</p>
 <p>Could he truly have fallen asleep?!!!</p>
 <p>“Done.”</p>
 <p>However, after two hours passed, Chu Feng not only opened his eyes, he also stood up with a slight smile on his face.</p>
 <p>“Done? What’s done? Clearly nothing was done, no?” The crowd looked all around, but were unable to find any spirit formations. Exactly what had Chu Feng done?</p>
 <p>He seemed to have not done anything other than sleep for two hours. Yet, since he didn’t do anything, why did he say ‘done?’</p>
 <p>Could it be that Chu Feng was going to throw the competition and give the Avaricious Immortal a chance?</p>
 <p>But, there shouldn’t be a reason for him to do that. The two of them were enemies. Chu Feng should be itching to kill the Avaricious Immortal. Thus, how could he possibly be throwing the competition for the Avaricious Immortal?</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, are you deliberately wasting my time?” In fact, even the Avaricious Immortal was extremely confused.</p>
 <p>Although he was extremely shocked by Chu Feng breaking through his spirit formation, he had not conceded to Chu Feng. After all, he also had the opportunity to break through Chu Feng’s spirit formation.</p>
 <p>However, what sort of situation was this? Chu Feng had simply not set up any spirit formation. Thus, how was he supposed to break through the spirit formation?</p>
 <p>That was why he said that Chu Feng was wasting his time.</p>
 <p>“Wasting time? No, it is time for you to attempt to break my spirit formation,” As Chu Feng spoke, he opened his palms that were clasped together.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>At that moment, a dazzling golden light appeared with a flicker.</p>
 <p>It was a golden sphere. It was only the size of a goose egg. Yet, it was glistening with illuminating golden light like the bright sun.</p>
 <p>“Could that be the spirit formation that Chu Feng set up? Why is it so small?”</p>
 <p>Xian Miaomiao and the others were all bewildered. Compared to the spirit formation the Avaricious Immortal had set up, the one that Chu Feng had set up was simply too tiny in comparison.</p>
 <p>“That is the spirit formation that Chu Feng set up? Heh, ridiculous. Although I do not know any world spirit techniques, I am still able to tell that that spirit formation is unable to withstand a single blow,” Xian Yuyin started to laugh coldly.</p>
 <p>Xian Yuyin had been stunned by Chu Feng being able to break apart the Avaricious Immortal’s spirit formation. Even though he was still standing in midair, he felt as if he had dropped into an endless abyss, without a way to ever get out of this predicament.</p>
 <p>However, at that moment, after seeing Chu Feng’s spirit formation, he managed to see hope again.</p>
 <p>However, after the Avaricious Immortal saw the golden sphere, he grew motionless, as if he had been petrified. He was completely stunned.</p>
 <p>“Avaricious Immortal, what are you standing there for? Could it be that you are also able to break my spirit formation in an instant?” Chu Feng asked with a beaming smile. He was absolutely mocking the Avaricious Immortal. The reason for that was because he knew that the Avaricious Immortal would not be able to break his spirit formation.</p>
 <p>“Avaricious Immortal, it’s your turn,” At that moment, it was instead Xian Yuyin who grew impatient, and actually called out to remind the Avaricious Immortal. The reason he did that was because he did not wish for the Avaricious Immortal to lose.</p>
 <p>He had already lost to Chu Feng in a competition of talent. If the Avaricious Immortal were to also lose to Chu Feng in a competition of world spirit techniques, all that they had planned today would be ruined. Furthermore, they would instead demonstrate how powerful Chu Feng was once again.</p>
 <p>“Humph, sure enough, they possess relations with one another,” At that moment, Xian Miaomiao and Princess Lingyue, as well as some of the Protectors all cast a side eye at Xian Yuyin.</p>
 <p>At that moment, practically all the people from the Elf Kingdom wished for Chu Feng to win. The reason for that was because they deeply disliked the Avaricious Immortal.</p>
 <p>Yet, at such a time, Xian Yuyin had a different reaction from all of them, and was actually standing on the side of the Avaricious Immortal. This naturally caused the crowd’s impression of Xian Yuyin to worsen.</p>
 <p>“Avaricious Immortal, what are you thinking about?! Quickly, break that formation!!!”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Xian Yuyin had no heart to be concerned with what the others were thinking about him. The reason for that was because even though he had reminded the Avaricious Immortal, the Avaricious Immortal was still standing there motionlessly. It was as if he had been stunned. This caused Xian Yuyin to feel extremely uneasy.</p>
 <p>“Putt~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, the Avaricious Immortal actually kneeled in midair and said to Chu Feng, “Little friend Chu Feng, I’ve lost. I admit my defeat. Please spare my life, please spare my life.”</p>
 <p>The crowd members were all stunned by that scene. What sort of situation was this? Chu Feng’s spirit formation was merely a little golden sphere; how could it possibly force the Avaricious Immortal to such a state, force him to actually admit his defeat?</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, his expression remained unchanged. It was as if he had anticipated this to begin with.</p>
 <p>Even though that spirit formation of his was only the size of a goose egg, it was even more difficult to break through than the spirit formation the Avaricious Immortal had previously set up.</p>
 <p>Even Chu Feng, who knew the method to break his spirit formation, would still find it very difficult for him to actually break through his spirit formation. As such, there was no need to mention how difficult it would be for the Avaricious Immortal, who didn’t even know the method to break through his spirit formation.</p>
 <p>“Avaricious Immortal, you are truly shameless. We agreed to bet our lives. You accepted that condition frankly back then.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, earlier, I gave you the authority to decide the rules for the competition. I have already yielded to you enough.”</p>
 <p>“Since you’ve been defeated, you should wholeheartedly accept it and honor your promise. Yet, what is the meaning of your actions right now?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, I was truly in the wrong. I was thinking of nothing but personal gains before. I will never do that again.”</p>
 <p>“These are all of the possessions that I’ve acquired in my lifetime. All of my riches are here. Little friend Chu Feng, please spare my life, please give me a chance to turn over a new leaf.”</p>
 <p>As the Avaricious Immortal spoke, he took out three Cosmos Sacks. Furthermore, while still kneeling, he crawled over to Chu Feng, and with a petty and low appearance, presented the three Cosmos Sacks to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng bluntly accepted the Three Cosmos Sacks and began to inspect them.</p>
 <p>He was truly shocked upon inspecting the three Cosmos Sacks. What was contained within those three Cosmos Sacks?</p>
 <p>It was actually even more Cosmos Sacks. Each one of his three Cosmos Sacks contained several hundred Cosmos Sacks. Adding on all of the Cosmos Sacks, they actually numbered a total of a thousand eight hundred and thirty-six Cosmos Sacks.</p>
 <p>The treasures contained in that many Cosmos Sacks was truly a dazzling lineup. It could be said that there was some of everything there.</p>
 <p>There were even many Natural Oddities that Chu Feng needed.</p>
 <p>Merely, those Natural Oddities did not contain a lot of Natural Energies. Thus, they were not very helpful to the current Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>That said, other than the Natural Oddities, there were still a lot of other treasures, including many Incomplete Imperial Armaments.</p>
 <p>It must be said that the Avaricious Immortal had truly gathered a lot of treasures in the course of his life. Merely, even he did not expect that the treasures he had unscrupulously gathered through his lifetime, the treasures that he had disregarded his own reputation to gather, would actually all have been gathered for Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“These items are mine to begin with. After all, once you die, your possessions should naturally be mine,” Although Chu Feng had calmly accepted the three Cosmos Sacks, he did not plan to spare the Avaricious Immortal. Someone like the Avaricious Immortal was truly too hateful and could not be spared. Else, he would cause no end of trouble.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, please spare me. I admit that I altered the Blood Devouring Armors. But, I did all that because I was forced to do so. I did not want to do it. It was all because of him, he was the one who forced me to do that,” As the Avaricious Immortal spoke, he pointed his finger at Xian Yuyin’s father.</p>
 <p>“Avaricious, You… you… you, what nonsense are you talking about?” Seeing this scene, Xian Yuyin’s father started to panic. He truly did not expect for the Avaricious Immortal to be this despicable. Not only was he afraid of death, he even, for the sake of living, actually snitched on him.</p>
 <p>“Xian Daofeng, don’t you act dumb! It was clearly you who instructed me to do all this. I only did this because you agreed to give me benefits.”</p>
 <p>“You and your son are envious of little friend Chu Feng’s talent. And you, for the sake of helping your son, decided to have me entrap little friend Chu Feng. You are truly despicable and unworthy of being an Elf Kingdom’s Protector.”</p>
 <p>However, the Avaricious Immortal was not afraid of Xian Yuyin’s father at all. Not only that, he even took out the jade pendant that Xian Yuyin’s father had presented to him last night.</p>
 <p>The Avaricious Immortal held the jade pendant up high. Then, he swept his gaze over the crowd and said, “Milords, I am not lying. This is what that Xian Daofeng gave me. He promised me that as long as I managed to take care of Chu Feng, he would bestow me enormous benefits tonight.”</p>
 <p>Not only did the Avaricious Immortal snitch on Xian Yuyin’s father, he even began to add details to the story. Whether it was real or not, he said it all. Furthermore, he placed all the responsibility onto Xian Yuyin’s father.</p>
