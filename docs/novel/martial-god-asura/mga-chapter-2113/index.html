 <p><strong> Chapter 2113 - Realm of Gods</strong></p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, do you realize this now? No matter how talented you are, when before absolute power, you will remain only an ant.”</p>
 <p>“I admit that I was defeated in the battle today. I was defeated by you in this one-on-one battle.”</p>
 <p>“That’s why I will definitely win next time. Next time, I will truly make you all open your eyes wide in amazement.”</p>
 <p>“I will let you all know exactly how powerful of a background this Hall Master possess.”</p>
 <p>After saying those words, the light that covered the Dark Hall’s Hall Master suddenly grew even more dazzling. It was so dazzling that even Chu Feng was forced to cover his face and move back.</p>
 <p>When that light disappeared, the people were shocked to discover that the Dark Hall’s Hall Master had… disappeared.</p>
 <p>“It’s that trick again,” Chu Feng started to frown.</p>
 <p>That was precisely the method the Dark Hall’s Hall Master had used to escape the Moon Immortal at the Icesnow Plains.</p>
 <p>That escape method was extremely powerful. Likely, it was some sort of escaping treasure. Chu Feng was frowning because there was nothing he could do about the escape technique that the Dark Hall’s Hall Master possessed.</p>
 <p>“Rumble, rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, rumbles could be heard. Chu Feng raised his head upward, and discovered that it was the Transmogrification Gate opening.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng.”</p>
 <p>After the gate was opened, many young and beautiful figures rushed toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>They were Xian Miaomiao, Sima Ying and the others. Among them, Xian Miaomiao’s speed was the fastest. At that moment, she had already arrived before Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you are amazing. You made that Dark Hall’s Hall Master piss his pants in terror. I shall see whether he will dare to act so arrogantly again in the future,” Xian Miaomiao was jumping and hopping; she was extremely happy. It was as if she was feeling very elated.</p>
 <p>Lil’ Red was standing on Xian Miaomiao’s shoulder. Complaceny filled its insect face. Bouncing vivaciously, it said, “That’s right, that’s right. Great Sir is so very awesome. As expected of my Great Sir.”</p>
 <p>“Long live Lord Chu Feng, long live Lord Chu Feng.”</p>
 <p>“Lord Chu Feng, you are simply our savior. You have saved our lives.”</p>
 <p>“Lord Chu Feng, even the Magma Emperor has been subdued by you! You are simply akin to a god to us!!!”</p>
 <p>“Finally, an overlord has appeared in our era. That overlord is you, Lord Chu Feng!!!”</p>
 <p>“Thank you Lord Chu Feng, thank you Lord Chu Feng!!!”</p>
 <p>…………</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Chu Feng discovered that, being led by the Elf King and the Heaven Reaching Immortal, many people came out of the Transmogrification Gate.</p>
 <p>Seeing that, Chu Feng hurriedly shouted, “Everyone, please hear me out!!! The Dark Hall’s Hall Master is still alive. You all cannot exit the Transmogrification Gate yet. Please return to the Transmogrification Gate immediately. The Holy Land of Martialism is still extremely dangerous right now.”</p>
 <p>“Ah?!!!” Hearing what Chu Feng said, the crowd were all startled.</p>
 <p>However, they soon managed to react to Chu Feng’s words. The people that came out of the Transmogrification Gate hurriedly pushed at the people behind them. They were even shouting, “Quickly, return, we must return. Didn’t you hear what Lord Chu Feng said? The outside is not safe yet. Quickly, return to the Transmogrification Gate.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s warning was very useful. The crowd could be said to be extremely obedient toward Chu Feng. Soon, those people that wanted to come out all obediently returned to the Transmogrification Gate.</p>
 <p>However, the Elf King and the others still walked toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, never would I have expected that you would really succeed. This old man has truly not misjudged you.”</p>
 <p>“Say, how did you manage to subdue the Magma Emperor? I am extremely curious,” The Compass Immortal and the others began to praise Chu Feng without holding back. Chu Feng had truly broadened their horizons today.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he was smiling without saying anything. When he saw the Compass Immortal walking out of the Transmogrification Gate, a boulder on his heart finally dropped.</p>
 <p>Earlier, he had been extremely worried that the Compass Immortal did not listen to him, and had not gone to find the Transmogrification Gate. And now… he was finally relieved.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master should’ve escaped. What do you plan to do now?” The Elf King asked.</p>
 <p>Once the Elf King asked those words, the crowd all grew quiet. Although the Dark Hall’s Hall Master had been driven away by Chu Feng, it remained that he was still alive. The most important matter now was how to take care of the Dark Hall’s Hall Master.</p>
 <p>“Seniors, please rest assured. I left an imprint on the Dark Hall’s Hall Master when I was fighting him. That imprint is very well-hidden. I believe that he will not be able to discover it.”</p>
 <p>“I am able to pursue him by following that imprint. He cannot escape,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Was it when you used the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader to injure him?” The Heaven Reaching Immortal asked in astonishment.</p>
 <p>“Mn,” Chu Feng nodded.</p>
 <p>“Never would I have expected that you already had a plan in mind, and had already planned ahead at that time,” The Heaven Reaching Immortal gasped in admiration upon finding out that his guess was true.</p>
 <p>“That Dark Hall’s Hall Master escaped from the Icesnow Plains using that special technique. As he was able to use it once, he would inevitably be able to use it again.”</p>
 <p>“As my strength iswas about the same as his own, it would naturally be impossible for me to kill him with a single strike. As such, I had to make preparations ahead of time,” Chu Feng explained.</p>
 <p>After hearing what Chu Feng said, the crowd did not say much. Instead, deep admiration appeared in their eyes.</p>
 <p>Such a trick was something that even they would not necessarily be able to think of. Yet, Chu Feng had thought of it.</p>
 <p>Not only did he think of it, he had also managed to accomplish it. That caused them to feel admiration for Chu Feng from the bottoms of their hearts.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, are we able to assist you?” The Elf King asked.</p>
 <p>“I keep feeling that the Dark Hall’s Hall Master might be related to me. Thus… I feel that it’s better that I take care of this personally,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Very well. In that case, are you able to sense where the Dark Hall’s Hall Master is at now?” The Elf King asked.</p>
 <p>“I am able to sense his direction. However, as the distance is too great, I am unable to ascertain his position,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“In that case, there is no time to waste. Go ahead and chase after him. You don’t have to worry about us,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>“Mn,” Chu Feng nodded. Then, he turned around and left.</p>
 <p>He did not bring the Four Great Divine Beasts with him. The reason for that was because, as matters stood, the Four Great Divine Beasts would not be able to help him either.</p>
 <p>As for the Four Great Divine Beasts, they understood Chu Feng’s intentions. Thus, they hid inside the Transmogrification Gate with everyone else.</p>
 <p>…………</p>
 <p>Chu Feng chased after the Dark Hall’s Hall Master continuously for many days without rest.</p>
 <p>However, he suddenly stopped at this moment.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because enormous tall walls had appeared before him.</p>
 <p>Those walls were glistening with light; they were walls formed with a spirit formation. Those spirit formation walls were extremely firm. They were impossible for even the current Chu Feng to destroy.</p>
 <p>However, in the center of that world spirit wall was an enormous gate. Inside the gate… looked like a different world.</p>
 <p>Firstly, the flowers, plants and trees inside the gate were all things that Chu Feng had never seen before. Furthermore, most importantly… An extremely dense Ancient Era’s aura was being emitted from that place.</p>
 <p>It was as if all the grasses and trees in that place were all from the Ancient Era.</p>
 <p>That place was the most famous location in the Holy Land of Martialism. It was also the most dangerous forbidden area.</p>
 <p>The Ancient Era’s Cemetery, also known as the Realm of Gods.</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng stared at the Realm of Gods for a very long time, he carefully took out an item from his Cosmos Sack.</p>
 <p>It was a ladle, a seemingly very ordinary ladle. However, when Chu Feng held that ladle before, his Inherited Bloodline had throbbed twice. It had caused a special reaction from his Inherited Bloodline.</p>
 <p>Merely, after Chu Feng took a glance at the ladle, he put it away. Then, he raised his head and looked to the Realm of Gods.</p>
 <p>“Never would I expect to come to this place by chasing after the Dark Hall’s Hall Master.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng sighed emotionally. Back then, Chu Feng had wanted to come to the Realm of Gods before he even set foot into the Overlord Domain.</p>
 <p>It was for no other reason than the fact that that ladle brought forth a special sensation to him. That sensation was so familiar, yet so indescribable. As for that ladle, it had originated from the Realm of Gods.</p>
 <p>Merely, after Chu Feng entered the Overlord Domain, things had begun to happen unceasingly. He ended up going to a lot of places, to do a lot of things, and did not have the time to do what he wanted to do.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng had not been able to go to the Realm of Gods the entire time.</p>
 <p>And now, he was finally here. He had arrived at the place where he had wanted to go the entire time. Merely, upon getting there Chu Feng was slightly hesitant, and slightly afraid of stepping into the Realm of Gods.</p>
 <p>It was for no other reason than the words spoken by the Dark Hall’s Hall Master before.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was able to tell that the Dark Hall’s Hall Master didn’t seem to be joking with him. It seemed that he truly possessed helpers in the Holy Land of Martialism.</p>
 <p>However, as matters stood, Chu Feng possessed no alternatives. He must enter the Realm of Gods. Even if enormous dangers awaited him in the Realm of Gods, he must still enter.</p>
