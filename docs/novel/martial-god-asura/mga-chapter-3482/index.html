 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Linghu Hongfei?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why would he be here? Didn’t he declare that he wouldn’t participate in this year’s selection?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one had expected Linghu Hongfei to come. His arrival brought the crowd an enormous yet pleasant surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, Linghu Hongfei was the publicly accepted number one genius of the Ancestral Martial Starfield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars without him would simply be incomplete.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not to mention seeing him fight, even just seeing him was something that many people yearned for. This was especially true for the people of the younger generation. Among the younger generations, the women were the most excited.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Which woman wouldn’t want to find the most outstanding man in the world to protect her?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without a doubt, Linghu Hongfei was the partner that they dreamed of. Unfortunately, he stood too high. They knew that they would not be able to match up to him. That said, this did not decrease their admiration and adoration for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Linghu Hongfei, it would appear that you’ve had a change of heart?” Wuming Ken asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This junior had encountered some troubles before. Because of that, I was unable to come to participate in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars in time. I didn’t wish for everyone to delay the selection because of this junior, and renounced my participation because of that. But this junior has just managed a recovery this evening, and immediately rushed over. I hope that milord can give this junior an opportunity to participate in the selection,” Linghu Hongfei clasped his fist. His attitude was very humble. Although he spoke forcefully with conviction, he did not lose his manners, and also did not lose his proud demeanor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Linghu Hongfei’s behavior not only infatuated the people of the younger generation, but it was even met with non stop praise from the older generation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In that case, your health is fine now?” Wuming Ken asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you for your concern, milord. This junior has indeed recovered,” answered Linghu Hongfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s great. After all, you are the future pillar of our Ancestral Martial Starfield. If something is to happen to you, it would not be good for our Ancestral Martial Starfield.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As for whether or not you can participate in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars, this old man is unable to make the decision. I will have to discuss it with milord.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Wuming Ken finished saying those words, he flew toward the leading Starfield Master Realm’s war chariot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one knew who or what was inside that war chariot. However, without a doubt, it most definitely held the grand characters of the Starfield Master Realm. It would even be possible for there to be Utmost Exalted-level experts inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not long afterward, Wuming Ken flew back from the war chariot and returned to where he had previously stood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Linghu Hongfei, milord has agreed to make an exception for you today to join the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars,” he said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you milord,” Linghu Hongfei clasped his fist to express his thanks. Although he was smiling, he was not acting ecstatic. It would appear that he was certain that he would obtain such a result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, it was not only Linghu Hongfei who was certain. Many people present all felt that as long as Linghu Hongfei wished to participate, he would definitely be allowed to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, he was the publicly accepted strongest genius. Even if he didn’t participate in the selection, people would still consider him to be the strongest genius.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instead, a selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars without him would be less impactful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Should Linghu Hongfei be a participant, the rankings of the Ancestral Martial Decastars would become proper again. Thus, even if it was to make an exception, the Starfield Master Realm would still allow him to participate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Wuming Ken added, “However, there is a condition.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What condition is there? Senior, please speak away,” Linghu Hongfei replied calmly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“For the sake of convincing the masses, you are not allowed to take a hidden path. Instead, you must take the open path. If you are able to reach the other side through the open path, I believe that no one will be unconvinced. At that time… you can challenge any one of those ten. Should you win, you will be able to participate in the selection,” Wuming Ken said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Take the open path? That condition is simply too difficult, no?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s true. After all, there are Exalted-level Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts in there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s impossible. However… if it’s Linghu Hongfei, it might be possible.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, many people felt that the condition was excessively harsh. However, there were also people that felt that Linghu Hongfei might be able to accomplish what was impossible for others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, his strength far surpassed that of the other younger generations. Otherwise… he wouldn’t possibly possess such enormous fame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What were demon-level geniuses? Linghu Hongfei was what an actual demon-level genius would be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What were geniuses? Before Linghu Hongfei, others could not be considered geniuses at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Very well, this junior is willing to accept the condition,” Linghu Hongfei accepted the condition decisively.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Woosh~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Linghu Hongfei’s body shifted. He directly arrived on the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound and walked in through the Giant Cosmos Bell’s entrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment Linghu Hongfei flew through the gate, the crowd all became incomparably curious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, they were unable to see through the Giant Cosmos Bell. As such, they were unable to see what the situation inside was like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seemingly knowing what the crowd were thinking, Wuming Ken formed hand seals with both hands while chanting. Then, he pointed his right hand at the Giant Cosmos Bell and shouted, “Open!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the next moment, the bright Giant Cosmos Bell became transparent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, the crowd were all able to see the situation inside the Giant Cosmos Bell without using any sort of special ability.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were many paths inside the Giant Cosmos Bell that could lead to the exit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those paths were all very complicated. The reason for that was because one could use those paths to avoid the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, there was a path among them that shot straight ahead. That path was the closest and fastest way to the exit. However, it was also the most dangerous path, as it was practically crowded with ferocious beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That said, that path just so happened to be the one chosen by Linghu Hongfei. Linghu Hongfei had decided to take the most dangerous path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some of the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts would shake mountains as they galloped on the ground. Others could rip apart space itself as they flew through the skies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were not monstrous beasts that possessed intelligence. Instead, they were ferocious beasts with slaughter as their nature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were even Exalted-level existences among the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts in there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, although he was in such a dangerous place, Linghu Hongfei was not only calm, but he also remained as graceful as ever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He held a sword in his hand, and flew straight ahead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As his hand moved sliced the air, many sword rays swept forth from his sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sword rays took the form of crescents, and continued to expand in size. The largest among them reached over a thousand meters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The places where the sword rays swept past were completely cleared. Not to mention those Martial Immortal-level Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts, even the Exalted-level Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts were sliced in half by the sword rays. They were simply incapable of contending against Linghu Hongfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most shocking of all, the sword in Linghu Hongfei’s hand was not some sort of treasured weapon. Instead, it was only an ordinary iron sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An iron sword like that could even be shattered by a relatively tough rock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, in Linghu Hongfei’s hand, that iron sword turned into a sharp weapon capable of easily killing Exalted-level Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why such a thing was possible was due to Linghu Hongfei’s cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rank two Exalted. That was his current strength,</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tang Zhenghao, a fellow member of the Ancestral Martial Decastars, was still only a Heavenly Immortal. Even Linghu Yueyue was only a Martial Immortal. Furthermore, she was quite some distance from becoming a peak Martial Immortal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, Linghu Hongfei had already reached the Exalted realm. Furthermore, it was rank two Exalted on top of that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was Linghu Hongfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So powerful! No wonder he’s the Ancestral Martial Starfield’s strongest genius.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“With him here, all other geniuses will be eclipsed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Marvelous. Sure enough, the Ancestral Martial Decastars with Linghu Hongfei is the actual Ancestral Martial Decastars.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is there even a need for this competition? How could anyone possibly compete against him? There’s simply no need for a competition at all, the first place of the Ancestral Martial Decastars is destined to belong to Linghu Hongfei.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not only were the people of the younger generation completely stunned, even those from the older generation were praising Linghu Hongfei nonstop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he was very young, his talent was truly heaven-defying. It was not only the people of the younger generation that would not be able to compare to him. Even many of those from the older generation that had trained for several thousand years found themselves inferior by comparison.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Linghu Hongfei’s performance, even Chu Feng started to frown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng had come to participate in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars with a very clear goal in mind - obtaining first place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, with Linghu Hongfei as his opponent, how exactly was he supposed to deal with him?</span></p>
