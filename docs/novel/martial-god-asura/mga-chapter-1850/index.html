 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1850 - The Mysterious Dark Hall</strong></p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you are truly confident in yourself. However, world spirit techniques remain only world spirit techniques. Even if you are capable of creating even more rank one Martial Emperor-level ferocious beasts, it would still impossible for you to defeat the three of us, for we are true rank two Martial Emperors.”</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng retrieved his Secret Skills, the other Dark Hall’s Martial Emperor thought that Chu Feng was planning to fight against them with world spirit techniques.</p>
 <p>“World spirit techniques? There’s simply no need for that. Today, I shall use my own strength to take care of the three of you.”</p>
 <p>“Clank~~~”</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng said those words, he drew his Heavenly Immortal Sword. Once the Heavenly Immortal Sword was revealed, an overwhelming righteous aura surged forth and began to linger around Chu Feng, changing the airs that Chu Feng emitted. At this moment, Chu Feng looked like a Sword Immortal descending upon the world. Looking at him, one would feel deep veneration.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, I’ve heard that you possess a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation. While that might be to your advantage now, that advantage of yours will only work against Half Martial Emperors.”</p>
 <p>“At the level of Martial Emperors, you will no longer possess that advantage. Everyone knows that only those that possess heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation are capable of becoming Martial Emperors,” The last Dark Hall’s Martial Emperor said.</p>
 <p>“You’re telling me that my heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation is the same as your heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. Thus, I do not have an advantage?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Naturally, you still possessed an advantage. Merely, when facing Martial Emperors, you would, at the very most, only possess a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting one level of cultivation. If the ones standing before you right now are three rank one Martial Emperors, you would naturally possess an advantage over them.”</p>
 <p>“However, the three of us are actually three rank two Martial Emperors. Did you think that you would possess an advantage over us?” That Dark Hall’s Martial Emperor said.</p>
 <p>“Wouldn’t you know whether or not I possessed an advantage by fighting against me?” Chu Feng smiled lightly. Immediately afterward, his smiling gazed shone with coldness. At the same time that happened, his Heavenly Immortal Sword turned into ten thousand sword rays that shot toward the three Dark Hall’s Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>“Perfect timing,” The three Martial Emperors all snorted coldly as they released their majestic killing intent. They took the initiative and charged forward to face Chu Feng’s attacks.</p>
 <p>“Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom~~~”</p>
 <p>At this moment, ear-piercing rumbles resonated nonstop. Blade rays and sword silhouettes were appearing all over the sky. Chu Feng and the three Martial Emperors fought in one location.</p>
 <p>However, right after the four of them started fighting, Chu Feng immediately obtained an absolute superiority over them. By relying on his sharp sword techniques, he forced the three Dark Hall’s Martial Emperors to retreat in defeat again and again. At this moment, the only thing they could do was defend.</p>
 <p>“Good! What a profound sword technique! I have never seen such a profound sword technique before. It would seem that Chu Feng has managed to completely comprehend the essence of the Heavenly Immortal Sword Technique.”</p>
 <p>Seeing Chu Feng suppressing the three Dark Hall’s Martial Emperors by himself, the people from the World Spiritist Alliance exclaimed in astonishment. Chu Feng’s sword techniques were truly too exquisite. They could simply be compared to Taboo Martial Skills. With merely that sword technique, Chu Feng was able to beat down on those three Dark Hall’s Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>“Damn it! I refuse to believe this!”</p>
 <p>To be suppressed by Chu Feng right after they started battling caused the three Dark Hall’s Martial Emperors to feel extremely unreconciled. All of them shouted loudly, and then golden rays began to spread out from them. They turned into an enormous tornado that engulfed heaven and earth as it swept toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>It was a martial skill, an Earthen Taboo Martial Skill. Being suppressed by Chu Feng, they could only start using martial skills to contend against Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s Heavenly Immortal Sword was constantly changing as it revealed its ability. Relying on merely that Heavenly Immortal Sword, Chu Feng blocked the Earthen Taboo Martial Skill unleashed jointly by those three Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>‘And here I thought the Dark Hall was extremely powerful. It turns out that you guys are inferior to even a rank two Martial Emperor from the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts,’ Chu Feng sneered in his heart.</p>
 <p>When Chu Feng had fought against that rank two Martial Emperor from the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts, he had felt some pressure. However, when facing these three Dark Hall’s Martial Emperors, Chu Feng felt absolutely no pressure from them. He simply did not have to use his Taboo Martial Skills or Secret Techniques against them. He was able to completely suppress them using only his Heavenly Immortal Sword.</p>
 <p>Of course, although Chu Feng was still a rank one Marital Emperor, his strength today was not comparable to the strength he had possessed back then. At this moment, he had already gradually gotten used to the Martial Emperor’s power. Naturally, he was more powerful compared to back then.</p>
 <p>“Puu, puu, puu~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Feng’s sword technique changed again, and then three rays of blood sprayed out from the bodies of the three Dark Hall’s Martial Emperors. A hole appeared in the dantians of those three Martial Emperors. They actually all had their cultivations crippled by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Bastard! I’ll tear you apart alive!”</p>
 <p>Sensing that their dantians had been damaged and their cultivations were rapidly flowing away, the three Dark Hall’s Martial Emperors all flew into a rage, and began to recklessly throw themselves at Chu Feng. They planned to engage in a final life and death struggle.</p>
 <p>“Humph,” Chu Feng snorted coldly. Then, the Heavenly Immortal Sword in his hand swept through the air. As a cold ray streaked across the horizon, and the three Dark Hall’s Martial Emperors were all sliced in half before falling to the ground. They had lost all ability to continue fighting against Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Speak! Exactly what is the Dark Hall? Who is it that created it? Why did you all insist on making me an enemy?” Chu Feng landed beside the three men and questioned them while pointing his sword at them.</p>
 <p>“Haha… hahahaha… wahahahahaha…” The three men burst into loud laughter. Their laughter was extremely strange.</p>
 <p>“You all had best tell me the truth. Else, I will make you all wish you were dead,” As Chu Feng spoke, he used world spirit techniques to bind the three men. Other than speaking, there was nothing else that the three of them could do.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you’re actually using this sort of trick on us? You’re truly looking down on our Dark Hall.”</p>
 <p>“I’ll tell you this. The Dark Hall shall become your nightmare. Those that the Dark Hall want to kill, none of them will be able to survive. You are no exception,” The leader of the three Dark Hall’s Martial Emperors spoke coldly.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng raised his hand and swept his sword across. He sliced apart the man’s mask. He was trying to see exactly who he was.</p>
 <p>However, when that man’s mask was sliced apart, what appeared before Chu Feng was a disfigured face beyond recognition.</p>
 <p>His face could be said to be completely and utterly disfigured. Even when using his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng was unable to make out his original facial features.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, I’ve already said it. Our Dark Hall shall become your nightmare. You should give up on cheap tricks like these,” The man sneered, and then a ‘bang’ was heard. His body exploded on the spot.</p>
 <p>“Bang~~~”</p>
 <p>“Bang~~~”</p>
 <p>Immediately after him, the other two Dark Hall’s Martial Emperors’ bodies also exploded. They were all dead.</p>
 <p>“Why would it be like this?” At this moment, the Left Reverend and Right Reverend, as well as the other experts of the World Spiritist Alliance, all rushed over. Astonishment filled their faces.</p>
 <p>“A certain kind of self destruction spirit formation was implanted into their bodies. As long as they wished to die, even I would not be able to stop them,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, that is the case. It would seem that this Dark Hall is no small matter. After all, very few people in the Holy Land of Martialism are capable of setting up that sort of spirit formation,” The World Spiritist Immortal nodded.</p>
 <p>“Lord World Spiritist, do you know of the Dark Hall’s origins?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“I do not. There are too many hidden experts in the Holy Land of Martialism. Even if you had me guess, I would not be able to guess who created it. All I know is that the Dark Hall is currently raising a large army. Furthermore, their appearance was absolutely not a coincidence. I have an ominous premonition,” The World Spiritist Immortal said.</p>
 <p>After hearing what the World Spiritist Immortal said, Chu Feng grew silent. Like the World Spiritist Immortal, he too felt an ominous premonition.</p>
 <p>While there were a lot of powers in the Holy Land of Martialism, the Three Palaces, the Four Clans, the Nine Powers, the Ancient Era’s Elves and several large monstrous beast races were publicly accepted to be the strongest powers.</p>
 <p>However, regardless of how those powers fought with one another, they would never try to extinguish the other powers. At the very least, they would only teach the other powers a lesson.</p>
 <p>However, this newly-appeared Dark Hall had planned to extinguish the entire World Spiritist Alliance merely because they had refused to join them. From this, it could be determined that the Dark Hall was a vicious and merciless power.</p>
 <p>For such a power to appear in the Holy Land of Martialism, not to mention Chu Feng, it would likely not be something good for the entire Holy Land of Martialism.</p>
