 <p><strong> Chapter 2359 - Razed To The Ground</strong></p>
 <p>Ying Heavenly Clan. The most sacred palace. A place that could contain several millions of people.</p>
 <p>At that moment, not only were the many experts from the Ying Heavenly Clan gathered here, there were also a total of five tier two powers’ headmasters and many other experts present.</p>
 <p>Among the five tier two powers, two were among the comparatively more powerful tier two powers like the Ying Heavenly Clan.</p>
 <p>As for the remaining three tier two powers, although they were inferior to the Ying Heavenly Clan, they were only slightly weaker. Thus, their strength was also not to be looked down upon.</p>
 <p>These five tier two powers were all allies to the Ying Heavenly Clan. They were currently gathered here for a common purpose -- to assist the Ying Heavenly Clan in taking care of Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>At that moment, they had unanimously reached an agreement and entered a coalition.</p>
 <p>Thus, at that moment, all of the Ying Heavenly Clan’s clansmen, including the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, were feeling very complacent.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because they had not invited their allies over for the sake of taking care of Chu Feng. Most importantly, they had invited their allies over to take care of the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall, who had declared their support for Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>To the people of the Ying Heavenly Clan, they believed that regardless of how powerful the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall might be, they would undoubtedly be defeated by their current alliance.</p>
 <p>Thus, at that moment, the Ying Heavenly Clan was going to prove to the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm that no one, not even the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall, would be able to protect someone that their Ying Heavenly Clan wanted to take care of.</p>
 <p>“Lord Clan Chief, this subordinate has an urgent report!!!” Right at that moment, a Ying Heavenly Clan’s elder hurriedly rushed in.</p>
 <p>“How could you act this flustered before our honored guests?!” Seeing that elder’s flustered expression, the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was annoyed.</p>
 <p>“Lord Clan Chief, the people we dispatched to the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds have returned.”</p>
 <p>“According to our reliable sources, both groups dispatched by our Ying Heavenly Clan encountered Chu Feng,” That elder said.</p>
 <p>“Encountered Chu Feng? Then, did they manage to capture him alive?” Upon hearing the name Chu Feng, the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief immediately stood up from his seat. The expressions of the others present also changed. They all turned their gazes to that elder.</p>
 <p>“No,” That elder shook his head.</p>
 <p>“No?!”</p>
 <p>“There were so many people. Yet, they were unable to even capture a person from the younger generation? Trash! Utterly useless trash!”</p>
 <p>“Where are they?! Call them over! I shall personally reprimand them! They have truly disgraced our Ying Heavenly Clan!” Sure enough, upon hearing the report, the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief immediately revealed a furious expression.</p>
 <p>“Lord Clan Chief, they… they have already died,” That elder said.</p>
 <p>“What? Died?” Hearing those words, the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and the others present were all stunned. Surprise filled their eyes.</p>
 <p>To them, the fact that the experts dispatched by the Ying Heavenly Clan had failed to capture Chu Feng was already extremely unreasonable. Yet now, how could they all be dead?</p>
 <p>“Was it the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall?” The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked. The way he saw it, it could only be the people from the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall that would kill the people from their Ying Heavenly Clan in the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds.</p>
 <p>“No, they were killed by Chu Feng,” The reporting elder said.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng? They were killed by Chu Feng?!!!” At that moment, the crowd were even more astonished.</p>
 <p>“Lord Clan Chief, that Chu Feng seems to have obtained a spirit formation in the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds. That spirit formation greatly increased his strength to a degree not to be looked down upon.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, according to reliable sources, the remnants in the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds were indeed Grandmaster Kai Hong’s remnants. As for the person who managed to obtain Grandmaster Kai Hong’s inheritance, it too was Chu Feng,” That elder said.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng actually obtained Grandmaster Kai Hong’s inheritance?!”</p>
 <p>“How could that be? Weren’t experts from the Zhou Heavenly Clan, Kong Heavenly Clan, Immortal Sword School and Buddha’s Heavenly Temple there?”</p>
 <p>“With that many experts, how could a member of the younger generation snatch away the inheritance?”</p>
 <p>At that moment, it was not only the crowd from the Ying Heavenly Clan that were unable to sit tight, even the five allied powers that the Ying Heavenly Clan had invited over were unable to sit tight. One by one, they began to whisper in each other’s ears and wag their tongues. In fact, many of the people present did not believe the reporting elder’s words to be true.</p>
 <p>“How reliable is this news?” The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.</p>
 <p>“Reliable, absolutely reliable. Reportedly, apart from Chu Feng, two other individuals obtained the inheritance with him. Those two individuals are Chu Feng’s friends. Furthermore, they are both from the younger generation as well.”</p>
 <p>“Currently, Grandmaster Kai Hong’s inheritance and all of the treasures are in their hands,” That reporting elder said.</p>
 <p>“Truly, never would I have expected that Chu Feng to obtain such unexpected success,” Upon saying those words, the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief revealed a strange smile. Then, he burst into joyous laughter.</p>
 <p>“Brother Ying, why are you suddenly this happy?” Someone asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“That Chu Feng is someone that we planned to take care of. As long as we can capture him, Grandmaster Kai Hong’s inheritance and treasures will all be ours,” The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.</p>
 <p>“While that might be the case, news of this matter has already spread. Likely, it will not only be us who want to take care of Chu Feng.”</p>
 <p>“Likely, a lot of people are already planning to take care of Chu Feng. Furthermore, those four tier one powers will most likely not let Chu Feng get away either. After all, Grandmaster Kai Hong’s inheritance and treasures are no small matter,” Someone said worriedly.</p>
 <p>“If that’s the case, wouldn’t it be even better? While we are able to suppress the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall by joining hands, it remains that we will suffer some casualties should we attack them.”</p>
 <p>“However, if the four tier one powers were to act, any one of them would be able to completely crush the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall,” The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.</p>
 <p>“Ingenious, truly ingenious!” After hearing what the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said, the crowd came to a sudden realization.</p>
 <p>“The Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall have taken a fancy to Chu Feng’s potential and decided to protect him regardless of what price they must pay.”</p>
 <p>“Yet, that Chu Feng actually snatched away Grandmaster Kai Hong’s inheritance and treasures. Although this might appear to be that Chu Feng being skillful, it remains that he is but a member of the younger generation. Thus, what he has done is a gargantuan sin. He has provoked an enormous calamity.”</p>
 <p>“I truly wonder. Once this news spreads to the Sunset Cloud Valley and the Three Stars Hall, will they continue to protect that Chu Feng?”</p>
 <p>“I truly want to see what sort of expression they will have. Hahahaha!!!”</p>
 <p>At that moment, the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, the five headmasters and the many management elders all burst into loud laughter.</p>
 <p>The way they saw it, Chu Feng had provoked an enormous disaster. There would be countless individuals that would want to take care of Chu Feng. Thus, there was simply no need for them to act, as someone else would take care of Chu Feng for them. They felt like they would be able to win this battle without even fighting.</p>
 <p>However, right at the moment when the crowd were overjoyed and loudly laughing, the expression of the elder who arrived to report the news turned increasingly ugly. He seemed to want to say something, but didn’t dare to say it.</p>
 <p>However, in the end, he clenched his teeth, summoned up his courage and spoke with a trembling voice, “Lord Clan Chief, Lord Headmasters, I fear that we cannot touch Chu Feng.”</p>
 <p>“What? Ying Hang, what sort of nonsense are you spouting?!” Hearing those words, the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was immediately furious. As he spoke, the space around him started to tremble.</p>
 <p>“Putt~~~”</p>
 <p>Seeing this, the reporting elder immediately knelt on the ground. He said, “Lord Clan Chief, we have not only received news from the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds today, we have also received letters from the four tier one powers.”</p>
 <p>“Letters from the four tier one powers?” At that moment, the crowd were surprised once again.</p>
 <p>“In fact, it is not only letters from the four tier one powers.”</p>
 <p>“We have also received letters from some of the old monsters that have not bothered with the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm’s worldly affairs for a very long time,” As that reporting elder said those words, he was sweating profusely. As he spoke, he took out many letters from his sleeve.</p>
 <p>Merely from the outer appearance of the letters, one could tell that those letters were from different sources. Most importantly, four among the pile of letters were indeed from the four tier one powers.</p>
 <p>Apart from the four tier one powers, the other letters also contained the names or marks of their senders. It was as that elder had said, the senders of those letters were all extraordinary people. It was true that they were all renowned old monsters of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p>
 <p>Even without mentioning the four tier one powers, merely those old monsters were all individuals that the Ying Heavenly Clan could not afford to offend.</p>
 <p>“We generally have very little contact with those people. Why would they suddenly send letters to us?” The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief started to frown. He felt that with how strange things were today, it most likely wouldn’t amount to something good.</p>
 <p>“The contents of the letters are roughly the same. Merely, what they state is something that this subordinate does not dare say,” that reporting elder said as he wiped away his sweat repeatedly.</p>
 <p>“What are the contents. Speak frankly,” The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief urged.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, tell us immediately,” The five tier two powers’ headmasters also started to urge that elder. They all wanted to know what the four tier one powers and those old monsters wanted.</p>
 <p>“They have declared that we are not to touch Chu Feng again.”</p>
 <p>“If we insist on becoming Chu Feng’s enemy, they will raze our Ying Heavenly Clan to the ground,” The reporting elder said.</p>
 <p>“What?!!!” Hearing those words, not to mention the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, even the others present were all stunned. Some among them were so startled by the news that they fell onto their butts.</p>
