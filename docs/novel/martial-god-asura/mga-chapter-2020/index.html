 <p><strong> Chapter 2020 - Eternal Pride</strong></p>
 <p>“World Devastator, what’s wrong? Could it be that you’ve grown afraid?” The Dark Hall’s Hall Master asked.</p>
 <p>“Lord Hall Master, that Chu Feng is hard to deal with. If we are to ignore him like this, this subordinate is afraid that we will invite a calamity on ourselves in the future,” The World Devastator Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need to be afraid. Chu Feng has been within my grasp all along. If I wish to kill him, I can do so at any time.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, he will not be able to live for long. At that time, I will allow you to kill him for me so that you can avenge your son,” The Dark Hall’s Hall Master said.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Lord Hall Master.”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, the World Devastator Immortal was overjoyed. He truly wished to kill Chu Feng himself. Merely, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master had said that only he was allowed to kill Chu Feng. This caused the World Devastator Immortal to feel very depressed.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because the World Devastator Immortal was determined to kill Chu Feng himself. Only by doing so would he be able to avenge his son. However, he was afraid that he would be punished by the Dark Hall’s Hall Master should he kill Chu Feng. As such, the matter of killing Chu Feng had been in his mind, tormenting him the entire time.</p>
 <p>However, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master had now allowed him to kill Chu Feng. As such, he was finally unshackled from that worry. He was now able to torture and kill Chu Feng without worrying about anything. To him, this was a truly joyous matter.</p>
 <p>“Lord Hall Master, this subordinate has one more thing that I don’t understand,” The World Devastator Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“What is it?” The Dark Hall’s Hall Master asked.</p>
 <p>“It is one thing for the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace to hand their secret skills to Chu Feng. After all, they were defeated and forced to do so.”</p>
 <p>“But, how are you so certain that the Underworld Palace would hand the Earth Immortal Profound Technique to Chu Feng?” The World Devastator Immortal asked in a confused manner.</p>
 <p>The World Devastator Immortal knew that the Heavenly Law Palace and the Mortal King Palace would be defeated in their invasion of the Cyanwood Mountain. The reason for that was because it was the Dark Hall’s Hall Master that had ordered their attack.</p>
 <p>Before the Dark Hall’s Hall Master had ordered his attack, he already knew that the Underworld Palace and the Ancient Era’s Elves would proceed for the Cyanwood Mountain. In addition to that, Lord Lianghua was in the Cyanwood Mountain. Thus, it was destined that the Heavenly Law Palace and Mortal King Palace would be defeated.</p>
 <p>The very premise of this plan was so that Chu Feng could obtain the Five Elements Secret Skills and assimilate them into his body.</p>
 <p>However, there was one question regarding this plan that the World Devastator Immortal did not understand. That question concerned the Earth Immortal Profound Technique. Why would the Underworld Palace present the Earth Immortal Profound Technique to Chu Feng without any reason to do so?</p>
 <p>“It’s actually very simple. It’s useless for the Underworld Palace to keep the Earth Immortal Profound Technique. Furthermore, Chu Feng has already obtained the other four of the Five Elements Secret Skills. As such, since the Underworld Palace wishes to become allies with the Cyanwood Mountain and the Ancient Era’s Elves, they will naturally present the Earth Immortal Profound Technique to Chu Feng so that all five of the secret skills would be in his possession,” The Dark Hall’s Hall Master said.</p>
 <p>“Hall Master is truly a person with deep plans and distant thoughts. This subordinate is filled with admiration. Merely… how did you know that Chu Feng would be able to assimilate the Five Elements Secret Skills?” The World Devastator Immortal asked.</p>
 <p>“I didn’t know whether or not he’d succeed.”</p>
 <p>“Merely, it remains that he is from the Outer World. As such, he is stronger than the people from the Holy Land of Martialism. Therefore, there was a trace of hope that he would be able to successfully assimilate the Five Elements Secret Skills. I didn’t expect that he would truly be able to accomplish that,” The Dark Hall’s Hall Master said.</p>
 <p>“So even Lord Hall Master was uncertain as to whether or not Chu Feng would succeed. But, if Chu Feng were to fail, wouldn’t he…?” The World Devastator Immortal was extremely astonished.</p>
 <p>“Failure would only mean death. But he will die sooner or later in any case. As such, why would I fear his death?”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha…” The Dark Hall’s Hall Master burst into loud laughter. As he laughed, he began to enter the void and left the palace.</p>
 <p>Following behind him, that mysterious woman also left.</p>
 <p>At that moment, only the World Devastator Immortal remained. He had a somewhat complicated expression on his face.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, he felt that he was increasingly unable to see through the thoughts of this Lord Hall Master. However, because of that, he felt even more delighted to serve him. He felt that only someone like the Dark Hall’s Hall Master was worthy of his servitude.</p>
 <p>………...</p>
 <p>Time passed quickly. In the blink of an eye, half a month passed.</p>
 <p>After spending two and a half months, Dugu Xingfeng finally returned from the Cursed Soil Sect.</p>
 <p>Actually, the Cursed Soil Sect was very close to the Cyanwood Mountain. The reason why Dugu Xingfeng was tasked with going to the Cursed Soil Sect, the closest of the four powers, was also because his cultivation was the weakest.</p>
 <p>Merely, due to the fact that Dugu Xingfeng was the person with the lowest cultivation among the four that were tasked with obtaining the symbols, things happened on the journey, and he was delayed. However, he eventually managed to successfully obtain the symbol and return to the Cyanwood Mountain.</p>
 <p>After returning to the Cyanwood Mountain, Dugu Xingfeng rushed straight for the Cyanwood Mountain’s core region. However, before he even approached it, he suddenly stopped flying. As if petrified, he stood in midair.</p>
 <p>At that moment, a dense expression of admiration appeared on his previously anxious face.</p>
 <p>Before him was a place that used to be a vast plaza. However, it had been turned into an enormous fort.</p>
 <p>Not only did that fort cover the vast plaza, it also shot straight into the clouds, and looked very extravagant.</p>
 <p>The fort was completely golden in color, and enormous dragon-veined patterns were moving about through the fort. It was as if there were countless enormous dragons sealed in the fort. At the same time, it looked like countless enormous dragons were protecting the fort.</p>
 <p>As far as the eye could see, that fort looked like a divine shrine.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, as he stood before the fort, Dugu Xingfeng seemed to have realized what was meant by ‘truly impregnable.’</p>
 <p>Actually, as the Cyanwood Mountain had existed for so long, they also possessed a very powerful defensive formation. Merely, when compared to the spirit formation before him, that spirit formation they had was simply inferior in all aspects other than size.</p>
 <p>And this… it was the grand defensive spirit formation that Chu Feng and the others had set up.</p>
 <p>“Xingfeng, you’ve finally returned. If you were any later, I would’ve gone out to find you.”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, several figures soared into the sky and stood before Dugu Xingfeng. The person leading them was Baili Xuankong. Other than Baili Xuankong, the others that had left to obtain the symbols were all present.</p>
 <p>“My apologies. A small inconvenience appeared on the journey. I have made everyone wait,” Dugu Xingfeng said in a self-blaming manner.</p>
 <p>After all, the crowd had been considerate of him, and deliberately sent him to the Cursed Soil Sect that was closest to the Cyanwood Mountain. However… he was still the last one to return. This caused him to feel very ashamed.</p>
 <p>“Headmaster Dugu, did you succeed?” Nangong Longjian asked.</p>
 <p>“Yes, I did” Dugu Xingfeng took out an extremely exquisite box from his Cosmos Sack. After opening the box, a symbol appeared. That symbol’s shape was different from the one that Chu Feng had obtained from the Cyanwood Mountain. However, it was emitting the same sort of dense ancient aura.</p>
 <p>“This is great,” Seeing that Dugu Xingfeng had also succeeded, the crowd present all started to smile in joy.</p>
 <p>“Ancestor, is that the grand spirit formation that Chu Feng and the other Immortals worked together to set up?” Dugu Xingfeng asked.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Xingfeng, this grand spirit formation could be said to be the most extraordinary spirit formation that I’ve ever seen.”</p>
 <p>“Not only is it capable of withstanding attacks from peak Martial Emperors, it also possess thirty-eight different offensive formations. It is capable of both attacking and defending. It is truly powerful.”</p>
 <p>“Most importantly, it was created by one of our Cyanwood Mountain’s disciples, Chu Feng,” When Baili Xuankong introduced the grand defensive spirit formation to Dugu Xingfeng, both his manner and tone were extremely excited.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because he knew that not even the Heavenly Law Palace, the Mortal King Palace or the Underworld Palace had a spirit formation like that one. As for all of this, it had all been bestowed to them by Chu Feng. Like Chu Feng, this grand spirit formation would become the Cyanwood Mountain’s eternal pride.</p>
