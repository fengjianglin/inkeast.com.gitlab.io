 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Linghu Yuhua mentioned the name Chu Feng, Linghu Hongfei’s expression suddenly twisted. He immediately grabbed his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, not only did he have an extremely pained expression on his face, but his body was also shivering violently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hongfei,” Seeing that, Linghu Yuhua hurriedly supported Linghu Hongfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A faint light was being emitted from Linghu Hongfei’s chest. When the light disappeared, bean-sized beads of cold sweat covered Linghu Hongfei’s face. His complexion was paper pale, and his aura extremely weak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That said, both Linghu Hongfei and Linghu Yuhua had anticipated this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Linghu Hongfei finally released his hand that was tightly grabbing his chest. There was actually a stone in his palm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That stone was only the size of a fingernail. Yet, it was pulsing and flickering with a faint blue light, as if it were alive. From a glance, one could tell that the stone was not an ordinary item. Unfortunately, the stone was currently shattered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Snap~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Linghu Hongfei clenched his palm and crushed the stone completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His body started to tremble even more violently. It was no longer caused by his injury. Instead, he was trembling from anger, endless anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Linghu Hongfei like that, Linghu Yuhua revealed a look of pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was common knowledge that the Linghu Heavenly Clan had assimilated the Cyan Nethersoul with Linghu Hongfei when he was born.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, they didn’t know that the Linghu Heavenly Clan had assimilated another item into Linghu Hongfei’s body before the Cyan Nethersoul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The worth of that item was not at all inferior to the Cyan Nethersoul. As for that item, it was the stone that Linghu Hongfei took from his chest and then crushed to pieces. Its name was the Life-protector Soulstone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Life-protector Soulstone was capable of saving Linghu Hongfei’s life once.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why the Linghu Heavenly Clan had assimilated the Life-protector Soulstone with Linghu Hongfei before the Cyan Nethersoul was because they were worried that he might fail the assimilation with the Cyan Nethersoul and end up having his consciousness seized by it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Merely, no one had expected for his willpower to be so strong that he would easily subdue the Cyan Nethersoul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, from the day he was born, not only did he possess the Cyan Nethersoul, a power from the Ancient Era, but he also had an extra life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Merely, no one would’ve imagined that the Life-protector Soulstone that had accompanied Linghu Hongfei all his life since the moment he was born would be shattered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, it was shattered by a person of the younger generation with a cultivation that was much weaker than his own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for that person, he was Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Linghu Yuhua was able to imagine how Chu Feng was capable of such a feat. Likely, it was that grand formation Chu Feng had set up, the spirit formation that Chu Feng called the Octoforms Lightning Sealing Formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After that spirit formation was used, Linghu Hongfei was completely sealed and thoroughly suppressed. He was simply incapable of breaching that spirit formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that situation, he had only had two options. He could either admit defeat, or enter a life and death struggle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Linghu Hongfei had chosen the latter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, he had sacrificed the extra life that had accompanied him since birth, the Life-protector Soulstone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To Linghu Hongfei, that was an extremely painful decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he had no choice but to do it. He couldn’t possibly allow himself to be defeated by Chu Feng like that before all those people. If that were to happen, he would not be able to establish himself in the Ancestral Martial Starfield anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, Linghu Hongfei felt that he was merely careless, and that he would definitely be able to defeat Chu Feng should he be given another chance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the price for a second chance would be the Life-protector Soulstone, he had felt that it was worth it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Merely, he had never imagined; no one had ever imagined, that Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques would have reached such a terrifying level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His world spirit techniques had far surpassed his martial power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A rank one Exalted-level world spirit was actually able to force Linghu Hongfei to unleash all the abilities that he had. Yet, in the end, he was still unable to gain victory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A tie?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was not the result that Linghu Hongfei wanted. Yet, it was the ultimate outcome of the match.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After paying the price of the Life-protector Soulstone, he was only able to gain a tie in the match. To Linghu Hongfei, it was no different than being defeated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, please tell me the truth. Am I truly inferior to Chu Xuanyuan?” Linghu Hongfei asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hongfei, it is not necessary for one to compare oneself to another person one’s entire life. It would serve as the best progress as long as you continue to make breakthroughs nonstop,” said Linghu Yuhua.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“While it is possible for me to not compare myself to others, if I want to become the strongest person in the Ancestral Martial Starfield, I cannot avoid being compared to him,” Linghu Hongfei said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, please tell me the truth. Back then, was Chu Xuanyuan really stronger than me?” Linghu Hongfei looked to Linghu Yuhua with a gaze filled with longing for an answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He not only wanted an answer, he also wanted to remove the knot in his heart that had troubled him for many years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Linghu Hongfei like that, Linghu Yuhua was unable to lie to him anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Xuanyuan’s performance back then surpassed even his father, Chu Hanxian. His son, Chu Feng, is also unable to compare to him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not to mention the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield, likely in the entire Holy Light Galaxy, there has never been a person as powerful as Chu Xuanyuan,” Linghu Yuhua said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing those words, Linghu Hongfei did not say anything. However, the light in his eyes had instantly disappeared. He seemed to have lost his soul.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, immediately after, Linghu Hongfei heaved a long sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was as if he had finally let go of an enormous stone that has been crushing him, and became much more relaxed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sure enough, I had been deceiving myself the entire time,” Linghu Hongfei smiled bitterly and shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hongfei, within a hundred years of age, no matter what you do, you will not be able to surpass Chu Xuanyuan. However, the future is long, and it is still hard to say what will happen then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“After all, Chu Xuanyuan is not as fortunate as you are. Like him, you shine brilliantly, and have long been seen as a thorn by the Starfield Master Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, standing behind you is the Linghu Heavenly Clan, Even the Starfield Master Realm does not dare to touch you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yet, it was different for Chu Xuanyuan. Although he was matchlessly brilliant, the Chu Heavenly Clan is unbearably weak.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Because he did not have any backing, Chu Xuanyuan was forced to escape from the Ancestral Martial Starfield at a young age. Upon his return, he was immediately met with threats from the Starfield Master Realm. Helpless, he ended up being imprisoned by his own clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Reportedly, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s forbidden area is capable of weakening his cultivation. Chu Xuanyuan is no longer a threat to the Starfield Master Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“While it is true that he was born with matchless brilliance, and that no one could even be compared to him, he ended up suffering a miserable end.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“His martial cultivation path has long since reached its end, whereas yours is just starting.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thus, Hongfei, you do not have to cling to his past achievements. After all, in the future, you will definitely surpass Chu Xuanyuan,” Linghu Yuhua said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, you don’t have to try to deceive me. Is Chu Xuanyuan really not a threat to the Starfield Master Realm anymore?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If that really were the case, Lord Clan Chief would not have dispatched people to the Ancestral Martial Lower Realm to search for him, no?” said Linghu Hongfei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing those words, Linghu Yuhua’s expression changed slightly, “Hongfei, where did you learn of this matter?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, not only have I heard about it, but I have also heard that after our clansmen reached the Chu Heavenly Clan’s forbidden area, they were unable to even meet Chu Xuanyuan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As for the reason why, it was because there was a barrier there. That barrier was so powerful that not a single person from our clan could breach it,” said Linghu Hongfei.</span></p>
