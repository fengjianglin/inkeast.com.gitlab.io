 <p><strong>&nbsp;Chapter 2523 - Scaring Away A True Immortal</strong></p>
 <p>“It is absolutely true. Two years ago, I witnessed with my very own eyes Chu Feng killing the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elders using that sword. Even the Kong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief was unable to contend against him.”</p>
 <p>“Brother Zhou, take my advice, do not be impulsive. Else… the consequences will be unthinkable,” Zhuge Mingren said earnestly.</p>
 <p>“In that case, the matter regarding the Demon Armament is true?”</p>
 <p>Seeing how serious Zhuge Mingren reacted, the others present also began to doubt whether or not what had happened two years ago was real.</p>
 <p>After all, Zhuge Mingren was a very reputable individual in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. The things he said held a lot of credibility.</p>
 <p>To hear about the rumors was one sort of feeling. However, to personally see Zhuge Mingren and to hear him saying this sort of thing so earnestly was a completely different sort of feeling.</p>
 <p>Moreover, Chu Feng had an extremely confident appearance.</p>
 <p>Thus, at that moment, many of the people present started to half-believe the matter regarding the Demon Armament.</p>
 <p>As the saying goes, if something didn’t concern oneself, one would not have to worry. However, if it did, then one must be extra careful.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Zhou Yuluo found himself in a very awkward situation.</p>
 <p>If he were to attack Chu Feng now, there would only be two possible results.</p>
 <p>Either the Demon Armament in Chu Feng’s hand was a fake, and he would be able to directly kill Chu Feng, ending everything.</p>
 <p>Or the Demon Armament in Chu Feng’s hand was real, and he would end up enraging Chu Feng and be killed by Chu Feng should he attack him.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, we have never met before this. There are neither grievances or grudges between us either. There is no need for us to confront one another with weapons. How about we discuss things?”</p>
 <p>After a moment of hesitation, Zhou Yuluo not only retrieved his extended hand, but he also retrieved his oppressive might filled with killing intent.</p>
 <p>At that moment, he no longer possessed the overbearing arrogance from before. He was also no longer furious. Instead, he revealed a fake smile on his face.</p>
 <p>Even though everyone could tell that it was a fake smile that he had forced out, they also knew that the reason Zhou Yuluo reacted like this was because he was scared.</p>
 <p>Scared, he was indeed scared. He was afraid that Chu Feng’s Demon Armament was truly capable of beheading True Immortals.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Zhou Yuluo had grown timid, Zhou Fukong was struck dumb. He felt as if he had managed to grab onto a log while drowning, only to find out that log was actually rice straws that were unable to save him at all.</p>
 <p>“Elder Zhou, save me!!!”</p>
 <p>In a moment of desperation, Zhou Fukong cried for help. He was deeply afraid that Zhou Yuluo would disregard him.</p>
 <p>“You shut up!” Zhou Yuluo shouted at Zhou Fukong.</p>
 <p>Then, he looked to Chu Feng and said, “Chu Feng, I do not know exactly what happened here today.”</p>
 <p>“However, the corpses of that Dugu Jianxu and the Wine-Meat Monk are there. I believe their deaths are related to you?”</p>
 <p>“I’ve killed them, what about it?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Why did you kill them?” Zhou Yuluo asked.</p>
 <p>“They wanted to kill me and my friend. Why shouldn’t I kill people who want to kill me?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Since you said it like that, you must possess your own reasons. I will not argue with you.”</p>
 <p>“However, Chu Feng, I must remind you of this: those two were no ordinary individuals. They were not people that you can kill as you wish.”</p>
 <p>“Since you’ve killed them, you must prepare yourself to shoulder the consequences,” Zhou Yuluo said.</p>
 <p>“There’s simply no need for you to remind me of that,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Very well. Since you’ve already made the preparations, I will say no more. Today, I only have one request. Might you be willing to take me into consideration and spare Zhou Fukong?” Zhou Yuluo said.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, the crowd was startled. Then, they looked to one another, and discovered that they all had astonished expressions on their faces.</p>
 <p>Request. A grand True Immortal Zhou Yuluo was actually making a request of Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Considering his status, this was no longer being courteous. Instead, he was lowering himself.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yuluo had already given in. The crowd felt that Chu Feng should give way to Zhou Yuluo too and spare Zhou Fukong.</p>
 <p>To drop this matter like this would be beneficial to both sides.</p>
 <p>“I’ve said that I am determined to take this Zhou Fukong’s life today,” However, Chu Feng was not planning to give Zhou Yuluo face.</p>
 <p>“You are truly undiscriminating!!!”</p>
 <p>Zhou Yuluo’s expression changed enormously. His forced smile instantly disappeared, and was replaced with anger.</p>
 <p>He truly never expected for Chu Feng to be this savage. He had already lowered himself, yet this Chu Feng was still insistent on doing things his way. He was simply not placing him in his eyes at all.</p>
 <p>With this, how could he, a True Immortal who had always been domineering, not be furious?</p>
 <p>Chu Feng did not bother with Zhou Yuluo at all. Instead, he turned to Zhao Hong and said, “Zhao Hong, kill him.”</p>
 <p>“You really want me to kill him?” At that moment, Zhao Hong was hesitant.</p>
 <p>After all, this was different from when she had killed Dugu Jianxu and the Wine-Meat Monk.</p>
 <p>If she were to kill Zhou Fukong, she would be doing so before a Zhou Heavenly Clan’s True Immortal-level expert.</p>
 <p>This was truly too crazy.</p>
 <p>“It would do to leave him an intact corpse,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Very well,” Seeing that Chu Feng was insistent on killing Zhou Fukong, Zhao Hong did not hesitate any longer and raised her palm.</p>
 <p>“Stop!” At that moment, Zhou Yuluo shouted loudly. Then, he threatened, “Zhao Hong, if you dare kill him, I’ll take your life!”</p>
 <p>“Give it a try if you dare!” Chu Feng shouted back furiously.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you… did you really think that I was afraid of you?” The anger in Zhou Yuluo’s eyes grew stronger and stronger.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng completely ignored his anger. Instead, he said to Zhao Hong, “Do it.”</p>
 <p>“Paaa~~~”</p>
 <p>Zhao Hong did not hesitate. Her palm landed on Zhou Fukong’s head.</p>
 <p>The next moment, Zhou Fukong died like Dugu Jianxu and the Wine-Meat Monk.</p>
 <p>“She actually killed him?!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Zhao Hong had actually killed Zhou Fukong right before Zhou Yuluo, the crowd was truly stunned.</p>
 <p>This courage and boldness of hers was simply something that they found incomprehensible. It was also something that commoners did not possess.</p>
 <p>Although Zhao Hong’s courage caused them to feel admiration, they admired Chu Feng even more.</p>
 <p>They knew very well that if it wasn’t for Chu Feng backing her up, Zhao Hong would not be able to kill Zhou Fukong.</p>
 <p>However, thinking that a Martial Ancestor was actually capable of frightening a True Immortal, this caused them to gasp in admiration.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, they saw it with their very own eyes. If they hadn’t, they wouldn’t have believed this to be true even if they were to hear about it.</p>
 <p>“I’ve killed him. The corpse is yours,” Chu Feng grabbed Zhou Fukong’s corpse and tossed it toward Zhou Yuluo.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yuluo caught the corpse. At that moment, his body was shaking. Especially his arms that caught Zhou Fukong’s corpse, the veins on his arms were bulging. From this, it could be seen how furious he was.</p>
 <p>However, even though he was filled with overflowing fury, he still did not attack Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>It was not that he did not want to attack Chu Feng. Rather, he did not dare to attack Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>He was afraid, afraid that Chu Feng’s Demon Armament was real. He was afraid that he would end up being killed by Chu Feng the moment he attacked Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, from today on, our Zhou Heavenly Clan and you are unable to coexist in this world!” Zhou Yuluo said while gnashing his teeth furiously.</p>
 <p>“Heh…” Chu Feng chuckled at Zhou Yuluo’s words.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng knew more or less what sort of status Dugu Jianxu, the Wine-Meat Monk, Kong Doumoyuan and Zhou Fukong possessed.</p>
 <p>Since he knew their status, he naturally also knew what the consequences of killing them would be.</p>
 <p>However, he was still determined to kill them. This meant that he had already taken the consequences into consideration.</p>
 <p>While the consequences of killing them were indeed unthinkable, he was determined to avenge Zhao Hong.</p>
 <p>Thus, when Chu Feng decided to have Zhao Hong kill them, he had already prepared himself to shoulder the consequences.</p>
 <p>The consequences of making an enemy of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm’s most powerful four tier one powers!!!</p>
