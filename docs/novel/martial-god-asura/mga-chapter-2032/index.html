 <p><strong> Chapter 2032 - Endless Admiration </strong></p>
 <p>Right at that moment, the Elf Lord of this place suddenly shouted, “Your Highness, little friend Chu Feng, could you two let us out?”</p>
 <p>Turning towards the grand formation, although the Ancient Era’s Elves inside were mostly beaming with happiness for Chu Feng’s defeat of the Dark Hall’s army, they also had helpless expressions on their faces.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because they were all still trapped in the grand formation, and were unable to come out to celebrate. As such, they could only cheer inside the grand formation. It was quite an awkward situation for them.</p>
 <p>“Miaomiao, what’s going on here?” As Chu Feng had arrived somewhat late, he didn’t know how the Ancient Era’s Elves had been trapped inside that spirit formation. That said, he was able to tell that they were trapped because of that golden bell.</p>
 <p>“It was caused by Miss Miaomiao. Aiyo, stop pulling me. I’ve even called you ‘miss,’” Lil Red shouted in pain.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, I got so happy after seeing you that I nearly forgot about them,” At that moment, Xian Miaomiao scratched her head awkwardly. Then, she shouted to the golden bell, “Come back!”</p>
 <p>The golden bell started to rapidly decrease in size. In the end, it then turned into the size of a fingernail and landed on Xian Miaomiao’s hand. Then, Xian Miaomiao put it away in her sleeve.</p>
 <p>Seeing that golden bell, Chu Feng’s eyes shone. Likely, even rank eight Martial Emperors would not be able to destroy that golden bell. It might even be able to defend against attacks from peak Martial Emperors. It was most definitely a treasure.</p>
 <p>The treasures that the Ancient Era’s Elves possessed were truly miraculous.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, that stone army is actually under your control. You are truly amazing.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, the Ancient Era’s Elves flocked to Chu Feng. They had seen Chu Feng commanding the stone army to massacre the Dark Hall’s army earlier. Thus, they currently felt endless admiration for Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Senior, these people from the Dark Hall have left behind quite a lot of belongings. It’s unsuitable to leave them there. It’s better that you all collect them,” Chu Feng said to the Elf Lord with a smile on his face.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, you’re planning to leave all of those treasures to us?” Hearing those words, that Elf Lord was secretly delighted.</p>
 <p>Originally, he felt that since the Dark Hall’s army was eliminated by Chu Feng, the treasures they left behind should naturally belong to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, with what Chu Feng said, it was clear that he wanted to give those treasures to them.</p>
 <p>“That’s right,” Chu Feng nodded.</p>
 <p>“But… but, how could we…?” The Elf Lord of this territory said embarrassedly.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng said he’s giving them to you, so just accept them. Don’t refuse his kindness,” Xian Miaomiao cast a side eye at that Elf Lord.</p>
 <p>“I wouldn’t dare, I wouldn’t dare. How could I possibly refuse his kindness?” The Elf Lord nodded his head repeatedly. Then, he ordered his men to gather the treasures left behind by the Dark Hall. All of the treasures were extremely valuable goods.</p>
 <p>“It’s truly lively here,” Right at that moment, a figure suddenly appeared out of thin air.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this person, the Ancient Era’s Elves’ expressions all stiffened. Then, other than Chu Feng and Xian Miaomiao, all of the Ancient Era’s Elves kneeled on the ground and shouted in unison, “We pay our respects to Your Majesty.”</p>
 <p>“Royal father, what brought you here?” Xian Miaomiao revealed a pleasantly surprised expression upon seeing her father.</p>
 <p>“I obtained news that the Dark Hall would likely try to harm you. Thus, I hurried over. Never would I have expected that my presence was not required,” As the Elf King said those words, he looked to Chu Feng with a beaming smile. Contained within his gaze was a trace of gratefulness.</p>
 <p>Indeed, he had come too late. If it hadn’t been for Chu Feng’s prompt arrival, his Xian Miaomiao would likely have been met with an accident.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng pays his respects to Your Majesty,” Seeing the Elf King, Chu Feng also bowed to him courteously.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, please get up. We are allies. As such, we should stand on equal footing. I am unable to bear you acting like this,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>“You are my senior. How could this junior possibly dare to stand on equal footing as you?” Chu Feng shook his head.</p>
 <p>“With your talent, your cultivation will sooner or later surpass mine. Your stage is not here. Instead, it’s the Outer World.”</p>
 <p>“Actually, it is my fortune to be able to stand on equal footing with you,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>“Senior, you will always be my senior. This is something unrelated to cultivation,” Chu Feng said very respectfully. He was speaking his true feelings.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, the Elf King’s heart was moved.</p>
 <p>Even though he already knew that Chu Feng was a very modest individual, it remained that the world of cultivators was a world where one’s seniority and status was determined by one’s strength. A person as outstanding and as thoughtful as Chu Feng was truly rare.</p>
 <p>“An army of over a hundred thousand stone monsters with Martial Emperor-level cultivation are protecting our Ancient Era’s Elves’ various territories.”</p>
 <p>After that, the Elf King looked to the stone army and said, “Little friend Chu Feng, you have truly bestowed us Ancient Era’s Elves an enormous gift,” Evidently, he already knew about the stone army being posted to defend the various locations.</p>
 <p>“Your Majesty, you are flattering me. We are allies. This is only something that I, Chu Feng, should do,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, dare I ask, was the stone army obtained from the Wonderstone Dao Ground?” The Elf King asked.</p>
 <p>“Your Majesty, how did you know?” Chu Feng was surprised upon hearing those words..</p>
 <p>“Actually, we Ancient Era’s Elves have already suspected that the several tens of thousands of wonderstones in the Wonderstone Dao Ground are extraordinary objects.”</p>
 <p>“We have attempted to figure out how to use them for a long time. Merely, even though we tried all sorts of methods over the years, they all ended in failure.”</p>
 <p>“Never would I have expected for the wonderstones to be related to the treasures left behind by the Five Elements Old Ancestor. In the end, little friend Chu Feng ended up obtaining them,” After saying those words, the Elf King started to look at Chu Feng with admiration.</p>
 <p>After hearing what the Elf King said, the Ancient Era’s Elves that did not know how the stone monsters came to be all came to a realization.</p>
 <p>It turned out that the stone army was made up of the wonderstones from the Wonderstone Dao Ground. The reason why Chu Feng was able to control them was because Chu Feng had solved the secret to the Five Elements Secret Skills that no one else had managed to accomplish.</p>
 <p>Upon thinking about it, all of the Ancient Era’s Elves present, regardless of whether they were powerful experts or weaker members of the younger generation, all looked to Chu Feng with admiration in their eyes.</p>
 <p>The thing that countless people had attempted to accomplish since the Ancient Era, only to fail, was accomplished by Chu Feng. As such, even if they didn’t wish to admire Chu Feng, they would have to.</p>
 <p>“That’s not all there is to it. Not only is Chu Feng able to control the stone army, he also created all those title plates. Holding a title plate, one would be able to control a portion of the stone army.”</p>
 <p>“Here! With this title plate, one would be able to control all of the stone monsters other than the two enormous stone giants.”</p>
 <p>“Elf Lord, catch,” Xian Miaomiao threw the title plate to the Elf Lord of this territory.</p>
 <p>“No, I absolutely cannot accept this. I am extremely weak, how could I accept such an enormous gift?” At that moment, that Elf Lord was overwhelmed and began to act humbly.</p>
 <p>Some of the stone monsters in the stone army possessed higher cultivations than his. He truly did not possess the confidence to command that stone army.</p>
 <p>Especially when before the Elf King, he truly did not dare to accept such an enormous gift. The way he saw it, even if the title plate would allow one to command the stone army, the one to command the stone army should be the Elf King, and not him, a mere territory’s Elf Lord.</p>
