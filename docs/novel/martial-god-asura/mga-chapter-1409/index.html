 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1409 - You’ve Lost</strong></p>
 <p>“You are truly too arrogant. Last time, if it wasn’t for the fact that I wasn’t here, how could you have left in victory?” Lin Yezhou said with a cold voice. The intention behind his words was that if he had been present when this mysterious woman had come the last time around, he would have won against this mysterious woman.</p>
 <p>“Heh…” After hearing those words, the mysterious woman laughed. Furthermore, her laughter was very strange and filled with ridicule.</p>
 <p>Seeing that, Lin Yezhou coldly asked, “What are you laughing about?”</p>
 <p>“Last time, were you really not present, or was it that you did not dare to show your face? I’m sure you know what it is very well,” the mysterious woman said with a light laugh.</p>
 <p>“You…” Hearing those words, Lin Yezhou’s expression changed greatly to one of extreme ugliness.</p>
 <p>“This…”</p>
 <p>At this time, all of the upper echelons of the World Spiritist Alliance started to frown, and black lines covered their faces.</p>
 <p>That was because they all knew very well that Lin Yezhou had been in the World Spiritist Alliance the first time this mysterious woman and mysterious old man had come to their World Spiritist Alliance.</p>
 <p>However, at that time, Lin Yezhou had only been a gold-cloak world spiritist. In order to preserve their face, they had decided to not allow Lin Yezhou to appear.</p>
 <p>Then, after the woman and the old man had left, they had activated the Royal Metamorphosis Formation and had Lin Yezhou and the others enter it. This had allowed Lin Yezhou to become a royal-cloak world spiritist.</p>
 <p>However, they had never imagined that this mysterious woman would know that Lin Yezhou had been present in the World Spiritist Alliance the last time. This was a significant matter.</p>
 <p>After all, other than the upper echelons of the World Spiritist Alliance, practically no one knew that Lin Yezhou had been present in the World Spiritist Alliance the first time that mysterious woman had come to challenge them.</p>
 <p>This meant that it was either that this mysterious woman and the mysterious old man truly possessed remarkable abilities, or that they possessed spies in the upper echelon of the World Spiritist Alliance.</p>
 <p>“It’s already meaningless for you to say anything else. Now that I’ve stood forward, the person who will lose is undoubtedly you,” Lin Yezhou said.</p>
 <p>“Enough of your rubbish, receive my attack,”</p>
 <p>Right at this time, the mysterious woman suddenly shouted. Following that, her black gown started to flutter, and her body started to shine with golden radiance.</p>
 <p>That golden light contained numerous insect marks and violently surged forth like ocean waves. Each wave was larger than the previous one, faster than the previous one. The waves covered the entire sky as they galloped toward Lin Yezhou and Fu Feiteng.</p>
 <p>“That is… a slaughtering technique!!!” As they saw the violently surging waves formed of royal level spirit power, even Chu Feng’s eyes shone with shock.</p>
 <p>He was able to sense exactly how powerful that world spirit technique was. That was no simple world spirit technique. Instead, it was a slaughtering technique. The might contained in that world spirit technique was comparable to Taboo Martial Skills unleashed by Half Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>This sort of slaughtering technique was truly too powerful. Although it was still inferior to the Sealing Ancient Village’s Old Village Chief Ma’s slaughtering technique, it was not something that ordinary powerful slaughtering techniques could compare to.</p>
 <p>However, Old Village Chief Ma had trained for so long in order to obtain his strength. Yet, this woman was still so young. However, she had already grasped such a powerful slaughtering technique. This was truly too frightening.</p>
 <p>Just by thinking about it, one would realize how frighteningly powerful this mysterious woman’s world spirit techniques were.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng truly realized how powerful this mysterious woman was.</p>
 <p>“Junior brother Fu, do not hesitate, let’s attack together!!!” Neither Lin Yezhou nor Fu Feiteng were fools. Both of them managed to sense how powerful that world spirit technique was.</p>
 <p>If they were to use martial skills, they might be able to withstand that mysterious woman’s attack. However, this was, after all, a match of world spirit techniques. As such, they could not use martial skills, they could not reveal their might in martial cultivation, and thus could only block the attack with world spirit techniques.</p>
 <p>Although the two of them were also proficient in some slaughtering techniques, their mastery was greatly inferior to this woman’s.</p>
 <p>Thus, it was truly impossible for them to take on the mysterious woman’s attack alone; they had to join hands to do so.</p>
 <p>“Heeaaahhh~~~”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Lin Yezhou and Fu Feiteng attacked together. They both released their boundless royal level spirit energy that also contained extremely powerful might. When the spirit power of the two of them interweaved with one another, the might of their spirit power became even stronger.</p>
 <p>However, although their attack was very mighty, their formation was of inferior quality. The mysterious woman’s attack was that of successive great waves. Not only was the attack very ferocious, it was also very beautiful.</p>
 <p>As for Lin Yezhou and Fu Feiteng’s attack, it was only ordinary spirit power with no changes in its form.</p>
 <p>Although this would not affect the result of the confrontation, it revealed that their control in world spirit techniques was inferior to that mysterious woman’s.</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~”</p>
 <p>At the time when the spirit power from the three individuals collided with one another, violent spirit power ripples instantly formed and swept through the surroundings.</p>
 <p>However, the control of spirit power that the three of them possessed was all very powerful. Before the ripples formed by their collisions spread to the crowd, they had put a stop to them. At the very same moment, they also unleashed a new round of attacks.</p>
 <p>The mysterious woman was very powerful. She was able to seize every opportunity and unleash surprising attacks that caught Lin Yezhou and Fu Feiteng off guard every single time. It could be said that her every attack would create great difficulty for Lin Yezhou and Fu Feiteng.</p>
 <p>However, it was evident that neither Lin Yezhou nor Fu Feiteng were individuals to be trifled with either. With the two of them working together, their strength greatly increased.</p>
 <p>Even though each and every attack from the mysterious woman was extremely tricky, the two of them were able to join hands and dispel all of her attacks.</p>
 <p>After over twenty bouts, Lin Yezhou even unleashed a counterattack at the mysterious woman.</p>
 <p>What Lin Yezhou unleashed was a very strange formation. While that formation appeared to be a defensive formation, it was actually a sealing formation that contained the power of a slaughtering formation.</p>
 <p>After he used that formation, not only did he manage to block the mysterious woman’s attack, it even managed to seal the mysterious woman. This was the very first time that Lin Yezhou and Fu Feiteng had held the upper hand in the competition between the three. As for how, it was all because of this formation.</p>
 <p>“Haha, what a powerful formation. It’s no wonder Grandpa Miao decided to leave for the Sealing Ancient Village to learn the method of setting up this formation. The way it seems now, that Sealing Ancient Village possesses some abilities.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Sima Ying was in great joy and started to cheer. As she was a person of the World Spiritist Alliance, she naturally wished for Lin Yezhou and Fu Feiteng to win.</p>
 <p>In fact, it was not only her. Joyous smiles had appeared on the faces of everyone from the World Spiritist Alliance.</p>
 <p>Last time around, they had been utterly disgraced. This time, their purpose was to retrieve their lost face. And now, they had finally occupied the upper hand, they finally managed to see hope. As such, how could they not be happy?</p>
 <p>“So that is the formation that senior Miao went to the Sealing Ancient Village for. No wonder, no wonder that formation hinted of Sealing Glacial Water. That formation uses Sealing Glacial Water. That’s why it’s so valiant.”</p>
 <p>“The way it seems now, the Sealing Ancient Village’s sealing techniques are truly first rate,” After hearing what Sima Ying said, Chu Feng came to a sudden realization. He began to praise the amazingness of the Sealing Ancient Village’s spirit techniques.</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right at this moment, a loud explosion suddenly sounded. That sealing technique that had sealed the mysterious woman was actually broken through.</p>
 <p>At the moment that sealing formation was broken through, an enormous golden snake that was several hundred meters long shot explosively out from the ripples brought forth by the explosion of the sealing formation and came tearing at Lin Yezhou with its teeth.</p>
 <p>“Break!”</p>
 <p>Although this enormous snake was powerful, it was not very different compared to the attacks the mysterious woman used before. Thus, Lin Yezhou did not take it seriously. Together with Fu Feiteng, the two of them sliced the golden snake apart.</p>
 <p>“Hiss, hiss, hiss, hiss~~~~”</p>
 <p>However, to their surprise, at the moment when the enormous golden snake was sliced to pieces, it actually did not disappear. Instead, it turned into hundreds of golden snakes.</p>
 <p>Although their size turned from several hundred meters to ten meters, their quantity was over several hundred times more. Furthermore, their speed had also doubled compared to that of the enormous snake.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the snakes were once again tearing their fangs at Lin Yezhou and Fu Feiteng.</p>
 <p>“Damn it,” Seeing that the situation was bad, Lin Yezhou and Fu Feiteng started to panic. As they retreated backwards, they began to unleash attacks at the snakes.</p>
 <p>However, like last time, the several hundred snakes were sliced apart by them and turned into several thousand golden snakes. The most frightening thing was, although their bodies had gone from ten meters to one meter long, their speed had also been increased, and their might was not decreased in the slightest.</p>
 <p>At this sort of distance, they were like golden rays of light. By the time Lin Yezhou and Fu Feiteng managed to react, the thousands of snakes had already tightly and densely bound them. Other than their faces, the rest of their bodies had been covered by the golden snakes.</p>
 <p>“Heavens, what is that?” Seeing that scene, the crowd from the World Spiritist Alliance was all struck dumb. It was the first time that they had ever seen such a monstrous world spirit technique.</p>
 <p>“You’ve lost,” Right at this time, that mysterious woman’s voice sounded.</p>
 <p>Her tone was very calm and did not contain much joy. It was as if all of this was only natural.</p>
