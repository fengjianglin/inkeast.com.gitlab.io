 <p><strong>&nbsp;MGA: Chapter 1859 - Surging Hot Blood</strong></p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you’ve also thought that a traitor has appeared in the Cyanwood Mountain?”</p>
 <p>“Although it cannot be certain, I also feel that to be the most likely possibility.”</p>
 <p>“However, that is also understandable. After all, the Four Great Imperial Clans have even used an Imperial Armament as part of your bounty; there will definitely be people that will not be able to resist the enticement,” Yaojiao Guang said. It would seem that he had thought of the same thing as Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Even with this being the case, I must still find that person,” Chu Feng’s eyes were filled with killing intent. What he could not tolerate the most was betrayal.</p>
 <p>“Of course. I have already prepared my army. We can proceed toward the Ximen Imperial Clan with you to rescue your friends and seize that traitor right away,” Yaojiao Guang pointed to the army behind him.</p>
 <p>“No, this cannot do. This is a personal grudge between the Four Great Imperial Clans and myself. How could I implicate your King Monstrous Dragon Race?” Chu Feng shook his head repeatedly.</p>
 <p>Everything in this journey to rescue his friends pointed to disaster. If he were to bring the King Monstrous Dragon Beast army with him, even if he were able to successfully save his friends and win the battle, a large portion of the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts’ elites would definitely be sacrificed in the process. If they were to be defeated, it would mean utter annihilation for all of them.</p>
 <p>That was especially true now. The King Monstrous Dragon Beasts had even sent forth two of their four elders. From this, it could be seen that the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts had mobilized nearly all of their battle power.</p>
 <p>If this army were to be defeated and annihilated, the remaining King Monstrous Dragon Beasts would definitely not be a match for the Four Great Imperial Clans. Likely, the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts would end up being extinguished completely because of Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, listen to me. Other than Baili Xuankong being captured, there’s another extremely bad piece of news.”</p>
 <p>“The Snow-haired Immortal who helped you on the Gong Ba Plains before, after she came to know about this matter, she immediately sent out news that she would no longer concern herself with the grudges between you and the Four Great Imperial Clans. This time around… she is planning to watch with folded arms,” Yaojiao Guang said.</p>
 <p>“There wasn’t much of a relation between the Snow-haired Immortal and I to begin with. I am already extremely grateful that she helped me before. For her to not help me again, it is only natural,” Chu Feng did not blame the Snow-haired Immortal. After all, she did not owe him anything to begin with.</p>
 <p>Merely, Chu Feng felt that, with the Snow-haired Immortal’s personality, she should have continued to help him. For her to suddenly announce such a thing was equivalent to her telling the people of the Holy Land of Martialism that she was afraid of the Four Great Imperial Clans. This did not resemble something that the Snow-haired Immortal would do.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng felt that there must be a secret reason as to why she had done that. Merely, only the Snow-haired Immortal herself knew that secret.</p>
 <p>“Without the Snow-haired Immortal helping you, you have lost an enormous helper. If you are to fight against the Four Great Imperial Clans, your odds of winning would be too low. If you were to go by yourself, you would simply be throwing your life away. Thus, it’s better that you allow us to help you.”</p>
 <p>“Our King Monstrous Dragon Race possesses the bloodline of dragons. As such, our lifespan greatly surpassed those of humans. Our bodies are also much more powerful than humans. Thus, even if we are to fight against the Four Great Imperial Clans, our King Monstrous Dragon Race is not without any odds of winning,” Yaojiao Guang said.</p>
 <p>At this moment, a War Faction’s elder said, “Little friend Chu Feng, let’s set out now. After all, their lives are at risk,”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, our King Monstrous Dragon Race has already made its determination. We insist on helping you.”</p>
 <p>“Originally, we had planned to dispatch an elder from both the War Faction and the Peace Faction. However, the two Lord Elders from the War Faction insisted on going into battle. Do you understand their intentions?” Yaojiao Guang pointed to the two War Faction’s elders.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s heart was moved. The War Faction’s two elders had deliberately made things difficult for him many times. However, they only did for the sake of the interests of the War Faction. They were actually not monstrous beasts that could not distinguish between right and wrong.</p>
 <p>Ever since Chu Feng had helped Yaojiao Tingyu obtain the Black Dragon King’s inheritance, the two War Faction’s elders’ attitudes toward Chu Feng had had a hundred and eighty degree reversal. Right now, they even wanted to help Chu Feng fight against the Four Great Imperial Clans. Even though everything pointed to disaster, and they might end up losing their lives in the process, they still insisted on joining the battle, and handed the great responsibility of protecting the King Monstrous Dragon Race to the two Peace Faction’s elders.</p>
 <p>From this, it could be seen how determined they were to repay Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Elders, I understand your kind intentions. Merely, this is truly…” Chu Feng really did not wish to implicate the King Monstrous Dragon Race.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, do not urge us against it anymore. The enormous grace and kindness you’ve shown our King Monstrous Dragon Race is something that we must repay.”</p>
 <p>“This time, if you are to allow us King Monstrous Dragon Race to accompany you into battle, it would mean that you’ve thought highly of us.”</p>
 <p>“If you insist on refusing us, we will not force you either. However, if you are to not be able to return after leaving, our King Monstrous Dragon Race will definitely gather up the strength of our entire race to fight a life and death battle against the Four Great Imperial Clans,” The War Faction’s elders said.</p>
 <p>“Warriors of the King Monstrous Dragon Race, is what the elders said correct?” At this moment, Yaojiao Guang turned to ask the several hundred thousand King Monstrous Dragon Beast army behind him.</p>
 <p>“Our King Monstrous Dragon Race must repay the grace Chu Feng had shown us!!!”</p>
 <p>“Our King Monstrous Dragon Race must repay the grace Chu Feng had shown us!!!”</p>
 <p>“Our King Monstrous Dragon Race must repay the grace Chu Feng had shown us!!!”</p>
 <p>………………</p>
 <p>…………</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The King Monstrous Dragon Race army shouted loudly. Their voices were so loud that they resonated through the vast sky.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng hesitated for a moment. He was able to tell that the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts were determined. Thus, in the end, he took out his Heavenly Immortal Sword, pointed it toward the heavenly dome and shouted, “Very well! Today, I shall fight with the King Monstrous Dragon Race. We shall dye the Four Great Imperial Clans with blood!”</p>
 <p>“Dye the Four Great Imperial Clans with blood!!!”</p>
 <p>“Dye the Four Great Imperial Clans with blood!!!”</p>
 <p>“Dye the Four Great Imperial Clans with blood!!!”</p>
 <p>………………</p>
 <p>…………</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The King Monstrous Dragon Beasts soldiers shouted loudly alongside Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“A battle against the Four Great Imperial Clans. How could our World’s Hidden Valley possibly miss out on this? Little friend Chu Feng, would you mind bringing this old man with you?” Right at this moment, Duan Jidao suddenly appeared behind Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Lord Duan, your body…” Upon seeing Duan Jidao, Chu Feng was startled. Duan Jidao’s body was already extremely weak after instilling his bloodline’s power to Jiang Wushang. Even though he appeared to be in much better health now, so much so that he appeared to be completely fine, Chu Feng had discovered an even more serious problem.</p>
 <p>By instilling his power to Jiang Wushang, Duan Jidao’s cultivation had begun to degenerate. Originally, he had possessed the cultivation of a rank seven Martial Emperor. However, due to the inheritance process, his cultivation had degenerated to that of a rank six Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>Yet now… Duan Jidao’s cultivation had actually become that of a rank five Martial Emperor. His cultivation had degenerated by another level.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was no fool. He was proficient in world spirit techniques and many taboo techniques.</p>
 <p>Thus, he knew that after Duan Jidao had passed on his bloodline’s power to Jiang Wushang, his body was extremely weak. As such, it would be impossible for him to recover in a short period of time.</p>
 <p>Therefore, for Duan Jidao to appear healthy right now, he must’ve paid an enormous price to obtain it. As for that price, it should be that level of cultivation he had lost.</p>
 <p>For the sake of helping Chu Feng, Duan Jidao had used a taboo technique to recover his health without the slightest bit of hesitation.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, my body is fine. Merely, I must join this battle.”</p>
 <p>“As far as I’m concerned, you are also my benefactor. If it wasn’t for you, I would not only have passed on Lord Emperor Huang’s power to that Song Yuheng, I would also have buried myself for eternal rest with someone that I do not even know,” When mentioning this matter, Duan Jidao shook his head repeatedly. An ashamed expression filled his aged eyes.</p>
 <p>“Senior Duan, it’s just…” Chu Feng was still unable to bear Duan Jidao doing such a thing for the sake of helping him.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, listen to me. I am someone that was about to die to begin with. What use is cultivation to me?”</p>
 <p>“Even if I am to keep it, I will have to pass it to Wushang anyways. Wushang has also said that he would rather obtain less power in order to help you,” As Duan Jidao spoke, he waved his sleeve. Then, a figure appeared beside him. It was Jiang Wushang.</p>
 <p>“Big brother Chu Feng, if you consider me as your brother, then do not say anymore. Just agree to have me join you,” Jiang Wushang said to Chu Feng while looking at him.</p>
 <p>“Very well. Little brother Wushang, this battle… we’ll go together,” Chu Feng did not try to persuade Jiang Wushang against it. He knew that with Jiang Wushang’s personality, even if he were to urge him against it, it would be useless.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, when you’ve even agreed to have Wushang join you, what about this old man?” Duan Jidao asked with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Senior Duan, I’ll have to trouble you,” Chu Feng clasped his fist toward Duan Jidao. Chu Feng was actually very happy to have Duan Jidao join him.</p>
 <p>After all, Duan Jidao was an existence that even the Three Palaces feared. Although his cultivation had greatly decreased now that he had passed on a portion of his power to Jiang Wushang, it remained that he was still a rank five Martial Emperor. His cultivation greatly surpassed that of the Four Great Imperial Clans’ Supreme Elders.</p>
 <p>If Duan Jidao were to act, even if the Four Great Imperial Clans had set up an inescapable net, they would not necessarily be able to baffle Duan Jidao. Thus, Duan Jidao joining them had raised their odds of success enormously.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, when you’ve agreed to all of them, you wouldn’t tell me that you’ll refuse should I tell you that I want to go too, right? Else, you would truly not be giving me face,” Yin Gongfu said with a beaming smile while leading the experts from the World’s Hidden Valley.</p>
 <p>“Thank you senior,” Chu Feng did not try to refuse them. Instead, he clasped his fist and bowed to them. Then, he turned around and clasped his fist and bowed to the others, “Thank you everyone!!!”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng’s body was surging with hot blood. He was feeling an indescribable sense of being moved emotionally.</p>
 <p>As they say… in a crisis, one’s true friends will be revealed.</p>
 <p>The Four Great Imperial Clans insisted on killing Chu Feng. Chu Feng’s decision to save Baili Xuankong and the others pointed to disaster. Yet, in this sort of moment, there were actually this many people that were willing to join him to fight against the Four Great Imperial Clans. Even if they were to be defeated in battle, so what?</p>
