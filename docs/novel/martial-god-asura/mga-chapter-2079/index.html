 <p><strong> Chapter 2079 - Slaughter With A Single Strike</strong></p>
 <p>“Where did you obtain that pendant?” Chu Feng asked solemnly.</p>
 <p>“Lord Chu Feng, this jade pendant is our Blood Qilin Race’s clan protection treasure. It is reportedly from the Ancient Era,” The Blood Qilins’ Clan Chief said.</p>
 <p>“Bullshit. Speak the truth,” Chu Feng shouted furiously. The reason for that was because he knew that crimson jade pendent was most definitely not the Blood Qilin Race’s clan protection treasure.</p>
 <p>“Lord Chu Feng, I am truly not lying to you,” The Blood Qilins’ Clan Chief said firmly. However, his gaze was hesitant.</p>
 <p>“Paa~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Feng waved his sleeve, and a resounding slap landed on the Blood Qilin Clan Chief’s face.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the people present all sucked in a mouthful of cold air.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because after the slap landed, the Blood Qilin Clan Chief’s face was twisted. There was an enormous bruise and a large amount of blood was gushing out of his nostrils, his ears, and corner of his mouth. There were even wisps of blood in his eyes.</p>
 <p>From that, one could tell how powerful Chu Feng’s slap had been. Most importantly, the Blood Qilins’ Clan Chief, a Martial Emperor, was actually unable to even dodge Chu Feng’s slap. From that, people once again experienced Chu Feng’s absolute strength.</p>
 <p>However, they didn’t know that Chu Feng had simply not used any power behind his slap. If Chu Feng were to put power behind his slap, the Blood Qilins’ Clan Chief would’ve already died. Even his blood would have evaporated on the spot. How could he possibly be able to still kneel before him?</p>
 <p>“Speak the truth!” Chu Feng shouted.</p>
 <p>“Y-yes. It’s something that I picked up in the Everlasting Sea of Blood several years ago,” At that moment, the Blood Qilins’ Clan Chief no longer dared to lie.</p>
 <p>“You all have relied on that jade pendant to increase your cultivation, right?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Y-yes. We have relied on the jade pendant,” The Blood Qilins’ Clan Chief nodded.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Huangfu Haoyue and the others finally found out the reason why the Blood Qilin Race had been able to increase their strength so quickly in such a short period of time. Even though they knew that the Blood Qilins must have had a treasure that helped them increase their cultivation, they had not expected it to be a simple pendant.</p>
 <p>“It is indeed Little Fishy’s possession,” Chu Feng walked forward and took the pendant.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right at that moment, Chu Feng’s eyes abruptly shrunk. He sensed a dense killing intent being emitted from the Blood Qilins’ Clan Chief.</p>
 <p>As he looked to the Blood Qilins’ Clan Chief, he was able to clearly see that the Blood Qilins’ Clan Chief was staring at him with a murderous gaze. Furthermore, he revealed a smile of success.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, a dagger had appeared in the Blood Qilin Clan Chief’s hand. That dagger was a Royal Armament. At that moment, it was thrust at Chu Feng’s dantian.</p>
 <p>“Crap!!!”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, be careful!” Huangfu Haoyue noticed it and hurriedly shouted to warn Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng smiled coldly. He did not bother to dodge the incoming Royal Armament aimed at his dantian.</p>
 <p>“Clank~~~”</p>
 <p>Finally, that Royal Armament came in contact with Chu Feng’s body. However, it let out a sound as if it had collided with metal, and was unable to even penetrate Chu Feng’s clothes, as if it had been blocked by a powerful force.</p>
 <p>“Damn it!” At that moment, the Blood Qilins’ Clan Chief who had staked his all on that surprise attack was gnashing his teeth. He began to gather his martial power and continuously pour it into his Royal Armament dagger. He was determined to kill Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Snap~~~”</p>
 <p>However, after pouring all of his might into the dagger, the dagger actually snapped in two. Yet, Chu Feng was still completely undamaged.</p>
 <p>“How could this be?!!!” At that moment, the Blood Qilins’ Clan Chief was completely stunned. He knew that there was a definitely a disparity between his strength and Chu Feng’s strength. However, he did not expect for the disparity to be so enormous. He had used all of his strength to mount a sneak attack at Chu Feng. Yet, he was unable to injure Chu Feng in the slightest.</p>
 <p>“Foolish dog shit. You truly cannot be spared.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, a cold light flashed in Chu Feng’s eyes. Then, with a wave of his sleeve, heaven and earth darkened. At that moment, everyone was able to clearly see that with a wave of Chu Feng’s sleeve, the Blood Qilins’ Clan Chief’s body started to split apart. He first turned into a pile of blood, and then that pile of blood instantly turned into steam. He had evaporated into thin air.</p>
 <p>“Heavens! Am I seeing things?!”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Huangfu Haoyue and the others were all filled with astonishment.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because all of them had clearly seen what happened earlier. The Blood Qilins’ Clan Chief had used all of his power, but had failed to even injure Chu Feng in the slightest.</p>
 <p>Then, Chu Feng, with a wave of his sleeve, completely annihilated the Blood Qilins’ Clan Chief, leaving not even a drop of blood.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, they all felt an extremely frightening aura the moment Chu Feng unleashed his attack. That aura was something they had never felt before.</p>
 <p>“Milord, please spare us, please spare us!!!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that their Clan Chief had been slaughtered with a wave of Chu Feng’s sleeve, the rest of the Blood Qilins were all terrified. One by one, they began to continuously kowtow and beg Chu Feng for forgiveness. If they were begging Chu Feng for forgiveness earlier because they were ordered to do so by their Clan Chief, then they were doing so from the bottom of their hearts now.</p>
 <p>“There is no sin to having power. You all could have set up your own power. Yet, you all insisted on killing others to seize their territory. From that, it can be seen that your natures are vicious and merciless. The fact that you all possess vile hearts and ambitions is only one of your crimes.”</p>
 <p>“Next, your clan chief was killed. Yet, not only do you all not have the intention to avenge him, you instead started to kneel and beg for forgiveness. From that, it can be seen that you are neither loyal nor devoted. That is your second crime.”</p>
 <p>“With merely these two crimes, I will absolutely not spare your lives,” After Chu Feng said those words, he waved his sleeve again.</p>
 <p>With that wave, neither heaven nor earth turned dark. There was not the slightest trace of wind above the sea. It was strangely calm.</p>
 <p>However, the Blood Qilins were all annihilated in an instant. Not even their remains were left behind.</p>
 <p>“Ssss~~~”</p>
 <p>Seeing that scene, the people present all sucked in a mouthful of cold air. They were all terrified by Chu Feng’s abilities.</p>
 <p>Finally, Qiushui Fuyan was unable to contain herself. She stepped forward and asked, “Chu Feng, exactly what is your cultivation level now?”</p>
 <p>“Big sister Fuyan, truth be told, I am a rank four Martial Emperor,” Chu Feng spoke honestly.</p>
 <p>“You’re a rank four Martial Emperor? Boy, you are truly amazing. Since you’re a rank four Martial Emperor, why did you say that you’re no match for Huangfu Haoyue when we asked who among the two of you was stronger?” Someone asked in a very puzzled manner.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng smiled. He then said, “It is not only senior Huangfu Haoyue that I am not a match for. I am no match for all the seniors here. Regardless of what cultivation I might have, regardless of how strong I become, in my heart, I am still a junior before you all. As such, how could I possibly compare to you all?”</p>
 <p>“Oh you,” Finally, the crowd understood Chu Feng’s intentions. At that time, they became even more happy.</p>
 <p>Huangfu Haoyue walked toward Chu Feng and asked, “Chu Feng, after entering the Heavenly Road, did you manage to meet your father?”</p>
 <p>“No, I have not,” Chu Feng shook his head.</p>
 <p>“Why? Could it be that you didn’t find the location?” Huangfu Haoyue asked.</p>
 <p>“No,” Chu Feng smiled and shook his head.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Huangfu Haoyue knew that Chu Feng must have a hidden trouble that he found hard to mention. Thus, he no longer continued to linger on the topic.</p>
 <p>However, there was another question in Huangfu Haoyue’s heart. Thus, he asked, “Chu Feng, logically, since I have broken through from the Martial King realm, I should have entered the Martial Emperor realm. Why is it that I keep feeling that something’s amiss?”</p>
