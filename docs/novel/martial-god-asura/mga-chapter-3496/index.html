 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I object!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a voice sounded from the direction of the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was Linghu Tiemian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people were displeased by Wuming Ken’s decision. Linghu Tiemian, as Linghu Hongfei’s older brother and someone who detested Chu Feng greatly, would naturally feel even more displeased by the decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With his reasoning clouded by rage, he actually voiced his objection, publicly questioning Wuming Ken’s decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wuming Ken looked at Linghu Tiemian. He was not angered. Instead, using a very calm tone, he said, “Speak your objection.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even if they ended up in a tie, the one who tied with Linghu Hongfei is that world spirit, and not Chu Feng. Chu Feng merely borrowed the strength of another. How is he qualified to be equal to Linghu Hongfei?” Linghu Tiemian asked loudly. Not only were his words powerful, but he was also filled with confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was acting as if he represented justice against this unfair decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Another’s help?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mn, what you’ve said is very reasonable.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wuming Ken nodded. Then, he said to Linghu Tiemian, “How about this. If you’re able to seal someone stronger than Linghu Hongfei and Chu Feng in your world spirit space and then make that person listen to your orders to fight for you, I will give today’s Ancestra Martial Decastars’ first ranked place to you. What say you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“......”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wuming Ken’s words immediately made Linghu Tiemian speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To find someone stronger than him to help him was a very easy task for someone like him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, to have someone stronger than him enter his world spirit space was impossible for him to accomplish. As he himself was also a world spiritist, he knew very well that only world spirits were capable of entering one’s world spirit space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, summoning a world spirit stronger than him would be very difficult, and practically impossible for him. As for summoning a world spirit stronger than Chu Feng and Linghu Tiemian, it would be absolutely impossible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The strength of a world spiritist depends on only two things. One is their world spirit techniques, and the other is their summoned world spirit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since when did summoning a world spirit become seeking outside help?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If summoning a world spirit cannot be considered to be one’s own strength, then you might as well stop using your Heavenly Bloodline’s powers, your martial skills, and your weapons. Best of all, you should stop using your martial power too,” Wuming Ken’s tone became stern. His voice also grew louder and louder. Like thunder, it shook the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that sort of situation, Linghu Tiemian was at a loss for words. It wasn’t that he was afraid of Wuming Ken. If he were truly that afraid of Wuming Ken, he would not have dared to question him, even if he had lost his reasoning with rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why he was left at a loss for words was because he could not find any grounds to refute Wuming Ken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I know that many of you are dissatisfied with the outcome of Chu Feng being ranked first,” suddenly, Wuming Ken turned his gaze to the younger generations present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for those people of the younger generation, they did not even dare to look him in the face. No one was willing to offend a grand character like Wuming Ken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, you all need to be certain of one thing. You have all used treasures to increase your cultivation. Yet, this old man never said that you all were cheating. Do you know why?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s because a certain amount of strength is required for you to control those treasures, making them into your own strength. It's not something that anyone could accomplish.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Those with insufficient strength, even if they are to possess treasures, would not be able to unleash the power of said treasures.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thus, treasures are the same as weapons. As long as you're capable of controlling them, I will turn a blind eye to it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even when this shameless individual used a treasure to plot against others, this old man also turned a blind eye to it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Wuming Ken pointed to Linghu Tiemian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, Linghu Tiemian’s expression became very ugly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Indeed, him plotting against Chu Feng using a treasure was the behavior of a vile, lowly character. He himself knew very well how humiliating that was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because no one had bothered to look further into the matter, he had already forgotten about it. However, after being publicly called out by Wuming Ken, Linghu Tiemian felt extremely ashamed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since the treasures that you all are using are not against the rules, how is it against the rules for Chu Feng to use his own ability to summon a world spirit that’s stronger than him?” Wuming Ken asked loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The crowd became absolutely quiet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wuming Ken did not plan to stop just yet. He turned his gaze to Linghu Tiemian again, “Linghu Tiemian, do you know why this old man did not look further into the matter when you went against the rules in using a treasure to attack another?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Milord, you wanted to give this junior a chance to turn over a new leaf,” Linghu Tiemian hurriedly replied. His voice was actually trembling slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was originally not afraid of Wuming Ken. However, he had suddenly grown afraid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had only dared to openly question Wuming Ken earlier because he had lost his reasoning to anger, and possessed the backing of his clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, after confronting Wuming Ken and having his own behavior pointed out, he realized the disparity between him and Wuming Ken, and started feeling afraid. After all, Wuming Ken was the person who possessed the authority to make decisions in the competition, whereas he was merely a competitor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was only at that moment that he realized how foolish his decision to question Wuming Ken was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Linghu Tiemian started to submit to Wuming Ken in hopes of being given another chance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That said, Wuming Ken remained indifferent towards Linghu Tiemian’s submission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right. What you said is extremely correct. Just because I pretended to not see it doesn't mean that you weren’t in the wrong. I merely knew that you are a talent, and thus decided to give you another chance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your decision to plot against another is something that I can ignore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, you were unwilling to accept that another might obtain better results than you after your failed plot, and decided to question our Starfield Master Realm’s decision and rules because you were displeased by the results. You never even bothered to think about why this old man has decided to ignore your actions. Your behavior and conduct is truly one of a low and vile individual.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since you are one to continue to fuss over minor matters like these, you force this old man to have no choice but to fuss over things with you too,” Wuming Ken looked to Linghu Tiemian with an anger-filled face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Milord, this junior knows his mistake now. This junior was merely ignorant and puzzled before. After milord’s explanation, I have come to a sudden realization, and have realized my own mistake.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Milord, please give this junior another chance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Linghu Tiemian finally realized how serious the situation was. Seeing that the situation had turned extremely bad, he hurriedly begged for forgiveness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Wuming Ken did not even bother to take a glance at him. Instead, loudly, he announced, “I hereby announce that Linghu Tiemian, due to his despicable nature, is unbefitting of being an Ancestral Martial Decastar. Today, his title of an Ancestral Martial Decastar shall be stripped. Furthermore, he shall forever be banned from participating in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars again!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The crowd immediately looked to one another after hearing that announcement. Restaining fear and complicated expressions appeared in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if Linghu Tiemian had openly questioned Wuming Ken, he shouldn’t have been punished so severely, no? To ban him from participating in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars was simply too excessive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, suddenly, the crowd came to realize the reason why Wuming Ken made such a decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was determined to give Chu Feng the first ranked spot. If anyone dared to question his decision, he, Wuming Ken, would not be willing to let matters go.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Linghu Tiemian served as the best example for this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, Linghu Tiemian began to beg, and even knelt down to apologize to Wuming Ken. He was truly incapable of accepting this result.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had already failed in his public plot against Chu Feng, and had suffered humiliation. His reputation had already reached rock bottom. If he failed to maintain his title as one of the Ancestral Martial Decastars too, how would he have the face to stand before anyone anymore?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He, Linghu Tiemian, would likely become a topic of ridicule for everyone in the Ancestral Martial Starfield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unfortunately, all of his begging was useless. Wuming Ken had made his decision. After he finished his announcement, people from the Starfield Master Realm immediately dragged Linghu Tiemian out of the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people from the Linghu Heavenly Clan did not say anything about the decision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since the Starfield Master Realm was the overlord of the Ancestral Martial Starfield, it was only natural that no one would possibly dare to disobey them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is there anyone that objects to this old man’s decision?” Wuming Ken asked loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once he voiced that question, the surroundings grew even quieter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such quietness served to show the answer of the crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one dared to object.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wuming Ken currently represented the Starfield Master Realm. If anyone dare to object to his decision, it would mean that they were objecting to the Starfield Master Realm’s decision. Anyone doing that would simply be digging their own grave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Likely, apart from the Linghu Heavenly Clan, no one would dare to voice any objections.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, at that moment, not even the Linghu Heavenly Clan dared to voice an objection. With this, how could anyone else possibly dare to voice an objection?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides, what Wuming Ken had said was very correct too. It was Chu Feng’s own ability in being able to summon a world spirit stronger than himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That world spirit represented Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since it was a fact that the world spirit managed to reach a tie with Linghu Hongfei, Chu Feng would naturally be qualified to enjoy the title of first place together with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was his capability that earned him this right. Who could possibly question it?</span></p>
