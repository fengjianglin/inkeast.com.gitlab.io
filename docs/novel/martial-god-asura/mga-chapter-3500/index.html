 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s warship. Chu Feng had managed to get some time alone, with the excuse that he needed to treat his injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That said, at that very moment, the voice that was heard from outside made Chu Feng realize that it would be very difficult for him to continue to enjoy his time in peace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young friend Chu Feng is still treating his injuries and resting. If Lord Clan Chief needs to see him, it would not be too late to discuss matters with young friend Chu Feng after his injuries are healed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That voice was from Wuming Xingyun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wuming Xingyun had also received the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s invitation. That was the reason why he was on the warship. However, he was originally going to be on the same warship as the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and the other grand characters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, he insisted on staying on Chu Feng's warship. The reason for that was simply because Chu Feng was there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wuming Xingyun was doing that to protect him. Thus, he stayed outside of his room while Chu Feng was treating his injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Had it been others that had come to seek him out, Chu Feng could ignore them. However, he could not do so at that moment. The reason for that was because the person who had come to find him was the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, Tantai Xiangnan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Facing a grand individual like Tantai Xiangnan, if he were to act forcibly, not even Wuming Xingyun would be able to protect Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, Chu Feng was a person of the younger generation. As such, he should not put on airs before a grand character like Tantai Xiangnan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Chu Feng walked out of his room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Junior Chu Feng pays his respects to Lord Clan Chief.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Feng, why did you come out?” Wuming Xingyun was surprised to see him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, my injuries have been healed,” Chu Feng replied with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s great. Clan Chief Tantai just so happened to want to chat with you,” As Wuming Xingyun spoke, he planned to enter Chu Feng’s room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, right at that moment, the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief smiled at Wuming Xingyun, “Milord, would it be possible for you to allow young friend Chu Feng and I some personal time to chat?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why?” Wuming Xingyun revealed a look of caution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I wish to talk to young friend Chu Feng about some things that concern our clan,” said the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, please,” Chu Feng raised his hand to show the way for the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. As he spoke, he cast a meaningful glance at Wuming Xingyun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng was informing Wuming Xingyun that things were alright, and that he could deal with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that, Wuming Xingyun no longer said anything, and allowed the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and Chu Feng to be in the room together. That said, he continued to stand guard outside the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for what the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief wanted to discuss with Chu Feng, it was naturally the matter regarding the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie had entered the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound’s hidden path of certain death. Yet, not only did the two of them manage to exit it alive, but they were also accompanied by an abnormal sign.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As such, how could the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief not question them about what they’d experienced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound was rumored to be an entrance leading to the depths of the Nine Dragons Upper Realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That said, Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie had both anticipated the coming of such a day. Thus, they had discussed what they were going to say before they exited the hidden path of certain death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them had decided to lie, and not say what had truly happened in the depths of the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They merely mentioned that there were frightening creatures inside the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound. However, they were uncertain as to what those creatures were. They merely knew that they were very powerful. When they were escaping from those creatures, they inadvertently entered a tunnel. To their surprise, the tunnel possessed a very powerful attractive force, and sucked the two of them into a completely different space. Then, through the tunnel, they returned to the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing what Chu Feng said, the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief did not say much.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason for that was because he had already sought out Wuma Shengjie before going to see Chu Feng. What Chu Feng had told him was exactly the same as what Wuma Shengjie had told him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, both Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie were very calm and composed when they spoke of the matter. Their behavior was very natural, and simply did not resemble that of people who were lying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief suspected that they were lying, there was nothing he could do about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked Chu Feng something else. “Young friend Chu Feng, how is your father doing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lord Father is imprisoned in our clan’s forbidden area. I am unable to meet him either,” Chu Feng said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve heard that your Chu Heavenly Clan was able to enter the forbidden area at will,” the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That is indeed the case. However, I am unqualified to use that teleportation formation,” After saying those words, Chu Feng asked, “Senior, why are you suddenly asking me about this? Could it be that you’re acquainted with my father?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Xuanyuan is someone known by everyone in the Ancestral Martial Starfield. I was fortunate to possess a slight friendship with your father.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thus, I am rather concerned about his situation. I’ve heard that the place that your father is imprisoned in is currently being sealed off by a very powerful barrier. Because of that barrier, no one is able to enter that place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Because of that, I was worried about whether some sort of unforeseen event might’ve occurred,” the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah? There’s such a thing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, where did you hear about that? Is the information reliable?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng reacted with great astonishment. It was as if it was the first time he had learned of the matter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The news is definitely reliable. Young friend Chu Feng, I think that some sort of unforeseen event must’ve happened. After you return to your clan, you should go and ask your clansmen. Perhaps you will get an answer from them,” the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I hope that my Lord Father has not met with any mishaps,” Chu Feng was shaking. His performance of panic and worry was done brilliantly. It simply did not appear to be a pretense at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior, I am truly thankful for your magnificent hospitality in inviting me. However, this Chu Feng cannot disregard my father’s safety. Thus, I am afraid that I cannot stay for long,” he added.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young friend Chu Feng, I am able to understand your frame of mind. Actually, I’ve already heard about your business from Xing’er. You must be concerned about your friend’s disappearance, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Rest assured, I will personally investigate this matter. I will definitely give you a satisfactory answer,” the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said as he patted Chu Feng’s shoulder.</span></p>
