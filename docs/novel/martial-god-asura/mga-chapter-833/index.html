 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 833 - Power of a Single Punch</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Crippling Night Demon Sect?” When they saw those four big words, the people from the Gao Dynasty felt their hearts shake. They were frightened. An unprecedented fear birthed from their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Being from the Eastern Sea Region, they could not possibly know any clearer what the Crippling Night Demon Sect represented. In their minds, it was a group of demons who killed without blinking and didn’t care what methods they used to achieve their goals. They were an existence they didn’t dare to anger from the bottom of their hearts, and if it weren’t for the enticement and blackmail of the Immortal Execution Archipelago, they wouldn’t dare to come to this place either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the surface, their mission here was to take over all the dynasties, but in reality, it was taking revenge on Chu Feng. When they recalled that, they felt even more uneasy because everyone in the Eastern Sea Region knew Chu Feng was a member of the Crippling Night Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are they? What a terrifying formation of people!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the warships gradually approached, the people looking at them felt more and more shocked. Even though many people in the continent of the Nine Provinces didn’t know what the Crippling Night Demon Sect was, they could see that the warships were full of cultivation experts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were over ten thousand Heaven realm experts, and of them at least five hundred were at the peak of the Heaven realm. With just a single step in their attainments in cultivation, they would become Martial Lords. Of all of those experts, there were also several auras of Martial Lords.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter in terms of number, or in terms of strength, the people on the ten warships seemed to be superior to the Gao Dynasty. However, since they didn’t know if they were an enemy or ally, amidst the shock, the people from the continent of the Nine Provinces felt even more fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh*</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, just as anxiousness filled the crowd, the army of the Crippling Night Demon Sect flew down from the ten warships, and like divine troops and generals descending onto the mortal world, they approached with a powerful demeanor. In the end, they half-surrounded the Gao Dynasty who stood on the surface while hovering in the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re heading for them? That means this powerful force isn’t an enemy?” Seeing the army of the Crippling Night Demon Sect emanating animosity towards the Gao Dynasty, the people from the continent of the Nine Provinces temporarily relaxed. However, they dared not to be too careless. After all, the people before their eyes were truly too horrifying. They were people they had never seen before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone, I am the chief of the Gao Dynasty, Gao Kuncheng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“May I ask what offense I have committed for a noble sect like yours to set up such a display?” Even though he knew something was wrong, the old ancestor of the Gao Dynasty still brought a smile onto his face and asked them, feigning confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unless absolutely necessary, they did not want to anger the Crippling Night Demon Sect. After all, a huge power such as theirs was not one the Gao Dynasty stood a chance against.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*whoosh* Immediately after he spoke, the Crippling Night Demon Sect suddenly split into two. They made a path within the ocean of people, and at that moment, a young person slowly walked out, and then showed himself at the forefront of the Crippling Night Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After seeing that person, the Azure Dragon Founder, the Monstrous Monkey King, the old ancestor of the Jiang Dynasty, and many other famous people of the continent of the Nine Provinces all widened their eyes as their pupils shrank, surprised expressions emerging onto their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the people from the Gao Dynasty changed their complexions greatly because they were able to immediately recognize who that young man was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That person was… Chu Feng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s Chu Feng! This… What’s going on?” After recognizing Chu Feng, the people from the continent of the Nine Provinces instantly rejoiced, but coincident with rejoicing they felt disbelief, especially after seeing the Crippling Night Demon Sect experts’ respectful appearances towards him. They felt even more stupefied, and it was simply as if they were in a dream. They didn’t even dare to trust their own eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could that army have been brought back by Chu Feng? However, they were so strong, so how could Chu Feng…</span></i><span style> When they had such thoughts, they simply didn’t dare to continue their imagination because the scene in front of their eyes completely surpassed their expectations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They knew, from Jiang Wushang and the others, that Chu Feng was a very impressive person. However, they never would have thought he would accomplish so much in the Eastern Sea Region, a place where countless experts came forth. He even reached such a powerful level of strength, and not only was his own cultivation unfathomably deep, he even had such a large group of experts serving him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But as the people from the Nine Provinces felt shock, the expressions of those from the Gao Dynasty trembled because Chu Feng’s infamous name had already spread far and wide in the Eastern Sea Region.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even recently, when Chu Feng made such a huge ruckus at the Flower Valley’s Zi family, he not only killed the patriarch of the Zi family, it was said he even killed two rank seven Martial Lords—experts of the Immortal Execution Archipelago. If that were true, then the strength he possessed was far superior to the Gao Dynasty’s old ancestor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, seeing the poorly progressing situation, the old ancestor had a clever thought and feigned ignorance. He pretended he didn’t know Chu Feng, and first respectfully bowed and clasped his hands at him, then said with a smile, “Milord, I don’t recall any conflicts between us, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No conflicts? You clearly stated you were going to destroy my homeland, kill my family, yet now you dare to say you don’t recall any conflicts?” Chu Feng faintly smiled as a hint of ridicule flashed past his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This… Ah, milord, so this continent of the Nine Provinces is your homeland! I truly didn’t know! If I did, even if you lent me ten guts I still wouldn’t dare to come to this place!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They say the ignorant cannot be blamed. Milord, I truly didn’t know this was your homeland! I beg you to grant me mercy!” The old ancestor’s face was full of humbleness. The arrogant aura he had before was gone completely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, you truly don’t know who I am?” Seeing the amusing scene the old ancestor acted out, Chu Feng’s laughter became even louder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Milord, I haven’t even seen you before so how could I know who you are?” The Gao Dynasty’s old ancestor shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Wushang, please go ahead and tell them who… I am.” Chu Feng cast his gaze towards Jiang Wushang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Jiang Wushang still had heavy injuries and was still tied in the air by Gao Peng’s Martial power. When he saw Chu Feng’s arrival, he immediately burst in laughter and said, “You cowardly things, do you want to know who he is? I’ll tell you right now. He’s my big brother!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bastard! He knows Milord! Release the binding and admit your wrongs!” The Gao Dynasty’s old ancestor hurriedly shouted at Gao Peng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Naturally, Gao Peng didn’t dare to hesitate as he quickly released Jiang Wushang and knelt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, unexpectedly, Chu Feng smiled lightly and said, “No need for admitting your wrongs, since you won’t escape death either way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>*boom* After speaking, Chu Feng suddenly extended his hand and threw out a punch. Instantly, a destructive power surged out of his fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Struck by such power, Gao Peng didn’t even have a chance to cry out before his body exploded, becoming a pool of blood. It was not only Gao Peng who was caught by that attack as several experts from the Gao Dynasty were affected as well. They too exploded immediately, and even three Martial Lords died.</span></p>
