 <p><strong> Chapter 2476 - Fighting Alone</strong></p>
 <p>“The grand formation has been breached!!!”</p>
 <p>Even though the Three Stars Hall were prepared to fight, when they saw with their own eyes that their grand defensive formation had been shattered to pieces, the crowd from the Three Stars Hall still felt nervous in their hearts.</p>
 <p>After all, the grand defensive formation was a symbol of safety. If it was gone, it would mean that their Three Stars Hall would definitely suffer casualties.</p>
 <p>However, after the Three Stars Hall’s grand defensive formation was shattered, the Ying Heavenly Clan army did not immediately attack them. Instead, in an orderly manner, they stood above them in the sky.</p>
 <p>However, it remained that what was in the sky was the Ying Heavenly Clan’s army, all people that possessed Heavenly Bloodlines.</p>
 <p>As their Thunder Wings moved about, the crackling of thunder could be heard resonating through heaven and earth.</p>
 <p>At a glance, the figures covered in lightning seemed to cover the horizon. They stood there in an orderly manner, and simply did not resemble ordinary martial cultivators in the slightest. Instead, it was like an army of celestial soldiers had descended upon the world of mortals.</p>
 <p>Although the Ying Heavenly Clan’s army had not yet attacked the Three Stars Hall, their presence was already an enormous deterrent, attacking the morale of the people in the Three Stars Hall.</p>
 <p>At that moment, many people in the Three Stars Hall were thinking that even though their cultivations were all generally stronger than those of the Ying Heavenly Clansmen, it remained that the Ying Heavenly Clansmen were possessors of Heavenly Bloodlines, the beloved children of the heavens.</p>
 <p>Their overall power was not inferior to theirs. Furthermore, once the Ying Heavenly Clansmen reached the Martial Ancestor realm, they also possessed, apart from their Thunder Armor, Thunder Wings and heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation, that powerful Lightning Mark.</p>
 <p>Faced with such a group of enemies, could they really defeat them?</p>
 <p>If they were to say that they were not afraid, it would definitely be a lie.</p>
 <p>“Ying Heavenly Clan, why are you attacking our Three Stars Hall?”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, a thunderous shout sounded from the Three Stars Hall, spreading outward domineeringly.</p>
 <p>It was the Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster. The Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster’s words came like a balm to the hearts of everyone in the Three Stars Hall. After hearing those words, they managed to calm their minds.</p>
 <p>“Why? Today has been destined ever since you and the Sunset Cloud Valley jointly swore to protect that Chu Feng.”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the Ying Heavenly Clan’s army scattered to two sides, forming a road among the sea of people.</p>
 <p>A figure was slowly walking through the air. Following that road, a figure slowly approached. As for that individual, he was none other than the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.</p>
 <p>“Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, do you know why I did not immediately fight back against your attacks, and instead chose to unleash the grand formation for defensive purposes?” The Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster asked.</p>
 <p>“I have come with my army of Ying Heavenly Clan’s elites. However, apart from the elites, your Three Stars Hall have an enormous amount of weak disciples and elders.”</p>
 <p>“With their cultivation, they’re no different from ants. A burst of wind powerful enough to scatter grass is sufficient to kill them. You unleashed the grand defensive formation merely so that you could strive to transfer them somewhere safe,” The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.</p>
 <p>“You’re only half correct,” The Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster said.</p>
 <p>“Oh?” The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief revealed a smile of contempt. He then asked, “Then, tell me, what is the other half?”</p>
 <p>“If we are to fight, casualties are inevitable. However, there is not an irreconcilable hatred between us.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, I actually wanted to ask you. Are you really planning to have your clansmen perish for a mere friction that we had back then?” The Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster asked.</p>
 <p>“Then I wish to ask you. Back when you decided to protect Chu Feng, did you ever think that your Three Stars Hall’s disciples and elders would end up dying because of you?” The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief asked.</p>
 <p>“I did,” The Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster said.</p>
 <p>“Then why did you make that decision? Back then, if it wasn’t for the obstruction from you all and the Sunset Cloud Valley, I would’ve already slaughtered that damned bastard Chu Feng to avenge my son.”</p>
 <p>The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief grew increasingly furious. He was unable to control his state of mind the moment he recalled what had happened back then.</p>
 <p>“You wish to know the reason? Very well, I can tell you why. The reason is because Chu Feng… is worthy of us doing so,” The Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster declared.</p>
 <p>“Good, very good, very very good. What a great ‘Chu Feng is worthy of us doing so!!!’” The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief started to gnash his teeth in fury. His veins were bulging.</p>
 <p>“Since you felt that protecting that Chu Feng was worth your lives, then you must also think that your Three Stars Hall being exterminated because of that Chu Feng is also worth it.”</p>
 <p>As the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief spoke, he unleashed his rank four Martial Ancestor aura.</p>
 <p>At the same time, his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings emerged on his body. In an instant… his aura increased from rank four Martial Ancestor to rank six Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>Although a rank six Martial Ancestor did not appear to be very strong, no one dared to look down on him after he emitted his heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation.</p>
 <p>He was an existence stronger than even ordinary peak Martial Ancestors.</p>
 <p>“Wait,” Suddenly, the Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster spoke.</p>
 <p>“Spit out what you want to say, fart out what you want to fart. These might very well become your final words.”</p>
 <p>The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief flipped his palm and held a long Ancestral Armament sword in his hand. He had already made preparations to unleash a massacre.</p>
 <p>“If we are to wage war, casualties will be inevitable. I believe that is also not something that you wish to see.”</p>
 <p>“How about this: you and I will fight one another. If you are to win, you can take my life. If I am to win, I will instead spare you,” As the Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster spoke, he flipped his palm and also took out an Ancestral Armament Sword.</p>
 <p>“Very well, I’ll agree to your demand,” After the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief finished saying those words, he waved his hand to indicate to the Ying Heavenly Clansmen behind him to retreat.</p>
 <p>“You all, step down too,” The Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster gave the order. As his subordinates moved back, he soared into the sky.</p>
 <p>“Listen carefully. I have agreed to your demand not because I am afraid of casualties. After all, casualties are a common thing in wars. If one does not even have this bit of resolution, how could one possibly be a martial cultivator?”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, I have agreed to your demand not because I am afraid of losing to you. The reason for that is because you will definitely be the one to lose today.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, there is only one reason why I agreed to your demand. That is, I will have everyone in your Three Stars Hall personally witness how you, their Lord Headmaster, will be defeated by my hands,” The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said.</p>
 <p>“Isn’t it too quick for you to say things like that? Although you possess overwhelming battle power that surpasses my own due to your Heavenly Bloodline, I remain a rank eight Martial Ancestor. I’m afraid that the outcome of the battle between us is still undetermined,” The Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster said.</p>
 <p>“Still undetermined? Are you certain of that?” As the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said those words, an evil smile emerged on his face.</p>
 <p>Once that evil smile appeared, his cultivation actually started to surge. From a rank six Martial Ancestor, he reached rank seven Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>At the same time as his cultivation increased, light emerged underneath his feet. He turned into a shooting star. With extremely rapid speed, he rushed toward the Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster.</p>
 <p>A rank seven Martial Ancestor with a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation. At that moment, the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief possessed a battle power a level above the Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster, a rank eight Martial Ancestor with heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting two levels of cultivation.</p>
 <p>The one level difference in battle power was an enormous gap.</p>
 <p>At such a close distance, the Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster was unable to react in time.</p>
 <p>“Puchi~” Blood splattered about.</p>
 <p>The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s Ancestral Armament Sword had penetrated the body of the Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster.</p>
 <p>“You… you were concealing your cultivation?” The Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster’s eyes were glaring wide open. irreconciliation filled his face.</p>
 <p>As for the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, he had a pleased and delighted smile, “If I did not have absolute certainty in victory, why would I come here?”</p>
