 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 962 - Shameless and Despicable</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Go. If you’re too slow, watch out for my blade.” Jiang Qisha swept his gaze over Su Rou, Su Mei, and the others from the Misty Peak. In the end, he stopped on Zi Ling, and said, “My beauty, don’t be afraid. I will take you back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You shameless man! Chu Feng will not forgive you!” Zi Ling gritted her teeth, so much they creaked. There was also strong killing intent in her beautiful eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, that trash? I’ll be waiting for him. If he comes, I’ll cut his flesh bit by bit in front of you. I’ll have your Chu Feng beg for forgiveness… right before I kill him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha…” Jiang Qisha loudly laughed. His laughter was one of extreme madness, and extreme sinisterness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zi Ling clenched her fists in anger. An indescribable rage surfaced onto her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sister Zi Ling, let’s go.” Just at that moment, Su Rou, Su Mei, Zhang Tianyi, Jiang Wushang, Chun Wu, Yan Ruyu, and the others all ran over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did she discover that the others were running towards Tantai Xue with everything they had. In order to avoid burdening others, Zi Ling didn’t waste her breath on Jiang Qisha anymore and hurriedly ran towards Tantai Xue as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they were the same as Kuang Bainian. Since their cultivations were bound, though they could fly, they were rather slow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, despite their slowness, no matter Kuang Bainian, or Zi Ling and the others, their speed was about the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There weren’t any unexpected incidents that occurred with the hostage exchange. When Kuang Bainian safely arrived at Jiang Qisha’s side, Zi Ling and the others also safely arrived at Tantai Xue’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come behind me. They won’t be able to harm you,” Tantai Xue calmly said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zi Ling and the others didn’t hesitate. Although they didn’t know her, they had heard a bit about Tantai Xue as Jiang Qisha mentioned her quite a few times. They knew she was here to help them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*whoosh*</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, just when one of the guardians of the Misty Peak passed Tantai Xue, he suddenly attacked her. Two glowing talismans filled with boundless power landed onto her body, catching her completely off guard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Tantai Xue did not expect something like that. The distance between him and her was really too short. When she felt something was wrong, the two talismans had already landed on her snow-white skirt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*bzzzz*</span></p>
 <p><span style>*boom rumble rumble rumble*</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the instant of impact, they rapidly transformed. One became chains of lightning that tied Tantai Xue up, while the other talisman kept on exploding on her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Man Liu, what are you doing? Have you gone mad?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chun Wu and the others changed their expressions greatly when they saw that. Chun Wu even pointed at the old man and loudly cursed. As she spoke, she was even about to attack him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, Old Man Liu? Are you sure?” But just at that moment, the old man’s face suddenly changed? No one anticipated that. His complexion was not the only thing that changed—his height did as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… It’s you?!” Initially, Chun Wu and the others were filled with fury. However, after that transformation, fear immediately emerged onto their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did they discover the old man had been secretly swapped. This wasn’t Old Man Liu, a guardian of the Misty Peak, but Jiang Qisha’s junior, Wu Kunlun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh. You think trash like you can see through my disguise?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve had enough with all of you in these days. Other than Zi Ling, all of you will die today!” Wu Kunlun returned to his actual appearance, and he instantly revealed all of his fierceness. As he spoke, he released his rank three Martial King pressure, and was about to start slaughtering them all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The one who will die is you.” But just in that absolutely crucial moment, a hand was suddenly held out, which then grabbed Wu Kunlun’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Tantai Xue. At that moment, blood was all over her body. Her veil was taken down, showing her ugly appearance. Moreover, her aura was extremely weak. In contrast to this weakness, though, she was releasing a very strong killing intent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!” Jiang Qisha’s complexion changed greatly. He never would have anticipated Tantai Xue to live even after using two treasure-level talismans. Jiang Qisha quickly leapt forward, and flew towards Tantai Xue, hoping to change this horrible change in situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No one will save him.” But before Jiang Qisha arrived, chilliness was released from Tantai Xue’s palm. It instantly enveloped Wu Kunlun, and immediately turned him into a statue of ice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, Tantai Xue’s palm shook, and the large piece of ice was shattered. Wu Kunlun’s aura disappeared completely—Tantai Xue had mercilessly killed him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You dare to kill my Junior Wu? I will have your life!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Qisha was enraged when he witnessed Wu Kunlun’s death right in front of his eyes. His furious roar shook the world, and after a flip of his palm, a fiery red halberd appeared within his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An incomparable ruler’s pressure enveloped the world in the instant it appeared. The might was even several times fiercer than Murong Mingtian, a rank seven Martial King.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Despicable thing, the one who will die is you!” Tantai Xue, who fell into the trap, was similarly enraged. Her eyes glinted, and became snow-white.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*boom*</span></p>
 <p><span style>Simultaneously, the sky darkened, and a violent snowstorm came into existence. As it brought forth chaos, it engulfed everything in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*swish* After releasing her divine power, Tantai Xue leapt forward and fought the incoming Jiang Qisha.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*boom boom boom*</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, the sky above a circumferences of several thousand miles was pitch-black. One could only see the pale-white snowstorm and the blood-red blades of energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When those two clashed with each other, horrifying energy shock waves were sent out. Even space itself was shattered, and the sea underneath surged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed as if the sky had crumbled and the earth had collapsed. The world seemed as though it were to be destroyed by the two of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is too terrifying. These are the peak geniuses of the Holy Land of Martialism. This is true destructive strength.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone felt chills go down their spines when they saw such a terrifying battle. All of their hair stood on end; they were completely dumbstruck. Since they were at such a close distance, they were able to feel how powerful the two were.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If they truly used everything they had to fight, it was likely no one within a circumference of several thousand miles would survive. They would be crushed to death by the remnants they released.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the two of them, when fighting in such a life-and-death situation, were able to prevent any injuries upon anyone despite the world-shaking might they exuded. That meant they had complete control over their strength, and had already grasped their respective power to the maximum.</span></p>
