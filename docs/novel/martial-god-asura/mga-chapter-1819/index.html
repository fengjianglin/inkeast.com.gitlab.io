 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1819 - Chu Feng Vs. Xueran</strong></p>
 <p>“Mere human, since when was this a place where you could talk?” Yaojiao Xueran was deeply enraged. As he spoke, invisible oppressive might swept forth toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>However, before that oppressive might even managed to approach Chu Feng, it vanished like smoke into thin air. Chu Feng had stopped it with his own oppressive might.</p>
 <p>“Yoh, rank seven Half Martial Emperor. Chu Feng, you’re even stronger than you are rumored to be, stronger than Yaojiao Tinglei.”</p>
 <p>“However, don’t you dare think that you will be able to contend against me with your mere cultivation. If I were to truly attack, you would not even know how you died,” As Yaojiao Xueran spoke, he revealed an ominous glint and began to walk toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, before he managed to approach Chu Feng, Baili Xuankong and Hong Qiang both stood up and stood before Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on? You all wish to attack me? Let me tell you all this. This place is the King Monstrous Dragon Race’s territory. It is not a place that you humans can act imprudently in!” Yaojiao Xueran shouted.</p>
 <p>Seeing that, Chu Feng walked out from behind Baili Xuankong and Hong Qiang. He looked Yaojiao Xueran in the face and said, “It seems that you really look down on humans?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, that’s precisely it. I look down on humans. In my eyes, you all are nothing more than a despicable bunch. Other than scheming, you all are trash with no usefulness. What’s wrong? Are you unconvinced?” Yaojiao Xueran said with a loud voice.</p>
 <p>“Unconvinced…? Is there any part of you that can convince me?” Chu Feng smiled with contempt. He began to size Yaojiao Xueran up. Then, his smile grew even stronger, and he started to shake his head disappointedly.</p>
 <p>“If you’re unconvinced, then come. Let’s spar. This will also allow me to know exactly how exceptional the human genius is.”</p>
 <p>“However, let me tell you this. If I, Yaojiao Xueran, am to fight, I will definitely make you incapable of standing back up,” Yaojiao Xueran pulled back his sleeves and revealed an appearance of being eager to battle Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Even though I dislike you greatly, you are still a King Monstrous Dragon Beast. Having been invited here by the Clan Chief, I must give him face. Thus, I do not wish to injure you. It’s best that you do not continue to brag before me. Else, I will not be able to even give your Clan Chief face,” As Chu Feng said those words, a flash of coldness shone through his eyes.</p>
 <p>Seeing that cold gaze, the several people behind Yaojiao Xueran all trembled. At that very instant, they, the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts, actually felt as if they had encountered a frightening existence. From the bottoms of their hearts, they actually began to feel fear of Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Even though it was extremely inconceivable, it remained that they indeed felt that way. Merely, Yaojiao Xueran still didn’t notice the cold gaze in Chu Feng’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“Yoh, what arrogance you have. I can see that you are someone who will not shed tears until the coffin is before you. Today, I must let you know how frightening I, Yaojiao Xueran, am.”</p>
 <p>Yaojiao Xueran spoke to the guards in the palace hall. “Listen carefully. I am sparring with Chu Feng. Regardless which of us is injured, none of you are allowed to interfere. Likewise, you are to prevent anyone else from interfering. Understand?”</p>
 <p>Yaojiao Xueran spoke those words with hidden intentions. While he was telling the guards to not interfere, he was also telling them to prevent Baili Xuankong and Hong Qiang from interfering.</p>
 <p>Yaojiao Xueran had made a firm decision to properly teach Chu Feng a lesson, and use this as an opportunity to demonstrate his might as the future Clan Chief.</p>
 <p>After all, Chu Feng was the representative of the human race’s geniuses. If he were to defeat Chu Feng, it would be a rare opportunity for him to become famous.</p>
 <p>“Understood,” The guards did not dare to disobey. One by one, they moved to the side. Furthermore, they tacitly understood Yaojiao Xueran’s intentions, and moved to either side of Baili Xuankong and Hong Qiang to prevent them from interfering.</p>
 <p>However, Baili Xuankong and Hong Qiang were not worried in the slightest. The two of them knew that there was simply no need for them to interfere in this battle between Chu Feng and Yaojiao Xueran. The reason for that was because there was no reason for them to interfere to save that Yaojiao Xueran from Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>At the same time, many of the guards outside the palace hall also walked in. They fixed their gazes on Chu Feng and Yaojiao Xueran.</p>
 <p>They all wished to see how their strongest younger generation, their future Clan Chief, would toy with the human race’s genius.</p>
 <p>This was especially true of the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts of the War Faction. When they looked at Chu Feng, a cold smile emerged on their faces. They all wished to see the scene of Chu Feng being utterly defeated.</p>
 <p>“Heh…” Seeing this scene, Yaojiao Tinglei actually laughed. As he had been present at the Gong Ba Plains, and personally seen Chu Feng’s abilities, he knew very well that regardless of how strong Yaojiao Xueran might be among their King Monstrous Dragon Beast Race, he would only end up being thrashed by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, don’t say that I’m bullying you. I will not dodge, and will allow you to hit me three times.”</p>
 <p>“Come, come, come. Hit me here. I shall see how you will injure me,” Yaojiao Xueran walked over to Chu Feng and patted his chest firmly. He wanted Chu Feng to hit him there.</p>
 <p>“As you wish,” Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, he clenched his hand into a fist and directly landed it on Yaojiao Xueran’s chest.</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~”</p>
 <p>A loud noise was heard as Yaojiao Xueran was knocked flying before firmly crashing into the palace hall’s wall and falling to the ground after that.</p>
 <p>“This…”</p>
 <p>At this moment, all of the guards were dumbstruck. At that moment, not only did Yaojiao Xueran have a pale complexion, he also vomited a mouthful of blood onto the floor.</p>
 <p>“Bastard! You damned bastard!” Yaojiao Xueran quickly wiped away the blood at the corner of his mouth. However, the blood that was on the ground was still there. Even though he had wiped his mouth clean, it could not conceal the fact that he had been wounded by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>[1. I forgot to mention this Yaojiao Xueran’s name is literally Monstrous Dragon, Dyed With Blood. Yaojiao Tinglei’s name is Listen/Hear, Thunder. His sister, Tingyu’s name is Listen/Hear, Rain. Their father’s name, Guang, means vast.]</p>
 <p>Chu Feng fiddled with his fist as he said, “No wonder you had me attack first. You’ve actually hidden a treasure in your chest area. You must really thank that treasure of yours. Else, that fist strike of mine would have been more than capable of killing you.”</p>
 <p>“And here I was thinking how you could dare to have Chu Feng hit you first. It turns out that you’re actually wearing your defensive inner armor.”</p>
 <p>“That inner armor of yours is capable of preventing injuries. Especially against people with cultivations below yours. If they were to launch a sneak attack at you and hit that inner armor, even if they survived, they would be crippled.”</p>
 <p>“Unfortunately, Chu Feng is a Snake Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. He already saw through the fact that you were wearing your inner armor. Furthermore, he undid the defensive ability of that inner armor with his world spirit techniques.”</p>
 <p>“This time around, you have truly thought yourself to be clever only to be utterly humiliated,” Yaojiao Tinglei seized the opportunity and began to mock Yaojiao Xueran from the side.</p>
 <p>“You shut up!” Yaojiao Xueran was extremely angry. The reason for that was because what Yaojiao Tinglei had said was the truth.</p>
 <p>His reaction further verified Yaojiao Tinglei’s accusations. At that moment, all of the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts present turned their gazes to Yaojiao Xueran’s chest and discovered that, sure enough, there was an inner armor hidden there.</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, the King Monstrous Dragon Beasts all felt shamed by Yaojiao Xueran.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you will pay for this,” Yaojiao Xueran’s eyes turned red. Knowing that he had been utterly humiliated, he was in such a rage that steam was coming out of his pores. Overcome with anger, he actually took out a large hammer.</p>
 <p>The hammer was wholly black in color, and nine meters long. Not only was it enormous, it was also covered with scale-like veined patterns. Light was circulating through the veined patterns. The hammer was emitting a boundlessly mighty aura.</p>
 <p>“Incomplete Imperial Armament, Black Scaled Giant Hammer. He actually even managed to obtain the Black Scaled Giant Hammer.”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing that weapon, Yaojiao Tinglei revealed an expression of jealousy. He knew that the Black Scaled Giant Hammer was a top quality weapon that had been in the possession of the elders. For Yaojiao Xueran to obtain that Black Scaled Giant Hammer, he had most definitely been bestowed that weapon by the elders.</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, an overwhelming explosion sounded. Then, boundless black flames began to surge to fatally attack Chu Feng. That Yaojiao Xueran had unleashed his attack.</p>
