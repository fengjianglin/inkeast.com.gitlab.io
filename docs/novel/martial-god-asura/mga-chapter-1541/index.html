 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1541 - Whose Crisis?</strong></p>
 <p>“Who is it?” Hearing those words, the Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster and the others were all shocked. They immediately turned toward the direction of the voice with alertness.</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, a loud explosion was heard. This sturdy cell that was formed by the fusion of many types of metal was actually forcibly broken apart.</p>
 <p>However, this was not the major aspect. More importantly, two rays of light rapidly flew into the cell the moment it was destroyed. Before the Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster and his six fellow martial brothers, Tantai Xue and Tantai Yingming were snatched away.</p>
 <p>As for the two people performing the rescue, they were Dugu Xingfeng and Hong Qiang.</p>
 <p>“Headmaster Sang, I trust you have been well since we last met,” Dugu Xingfeng placed Tantai Xue behind him and then said to the Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster with a beaming smile.</p>
 <p>“It’s you all?” At this moment, the Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster and the others finally managed to see who the uninvited guests were.</p>
 <p>Compared to the time when Tantai Yingming appeared before them, the seven of them were incomparably shocked this time around. Their expressions became very ugly.</p>
 <p>After all, these four people before them were all grand characters. There was no need to mention Dugu Xingfeng. He was reputed to be the strongest headmaster among all of the Nine Power’s current headmasters.</p>
 <p>As for the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master and Miao Renlong, the two of them were also peak Half Martial Emperors, top experts.</p>
 <p>As for that Hong Qiang, even though he was not a headmaster of the Nine Powers, his strength was something that spoke for itself. Even the Jadewater Temple’s headmaster was unable to do anything to him. This meant that Hong Qiang, too, possessed very powerful strength.</p>
 <p>At that moment, those four people all appeared, intruded into their forbidden area, destroyed the prison cell and rescued their enemy. This was not good news at all.</p>
 <p>“My dear friends, why didn’t you all inform us of your coming to our Cursed Soil Sect? I would’ve prepared a feast to properly entertain you all,” The Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster’s expression suddenly changed. He actually clasped his fist respectfully toward Dugu Xingfeng and the others. He seemed to be trying to stall for time.</p>
 <p>“Headmaster Sang is too courteous. We have only come here for a small matter. We are going to bring them away,” Dugu Xingfeng pointed at Tantai Xue and Tantai Yingming, who had been saved by him and Hong Qiang.</p>
 <p>“I’m afraid that won’t do,” The Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster shook his head.</p>
 <p>“Heh…” Dugu Xingfeng smiled lightly. Then, he said, “Regardless of whether you say you’ll allow it or not, we must still bring them away. Sang Kun, today, I might as well speak bluntly with you. Since we’ve come, we do not plan on returning empty-handed.”</p>
 <p>“Not to mention Tantai Xue and Tantai Yingming, we also plan to take away you seven brothers’ lives” Dugu Xingfeng said.</p>
 <p>“Dugu Xingfeng, what arrogance you have. Did you truly think that no one other than Martial Emperors would be a match for you?” The Cursed Soil Seven’s seventh brother pointed at Dugu Xingfeng and cursed.</p>
 <p>“I, Dugu Xingfeng, am one who knows myself very well. I know that I am not yet unparalleled beneath Martial Emperors. However, when facing seven animals like you all, my strength is more than sufficient.”</p>
 <p>After saying those words, Dugu Xingfeng actually started to attack. Dugu Xingfeng actually transformed into seven people who charged toward each of the Cursed Soil Seven.</p>
 <p>“Boasting shamelessly, you are courting death!”</p>
 <p>The Cursed Soil Seven had already activated their Cursed Soil Seven Slaughtering Formation. Their strength had already increased enormously. Thus, how could they fear a single Dugu Xingfeng?</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, Dugu Xingfeng and the Cursed Soil Seven began to fight in one location. As for the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master and Miao Renlong, they began to hurriedly help Tantai Yingming heal his injuries.</p>
 <p>As for Hong Qiang, he did not assist in healing Tantai Yingming, nor did he help Dugu Xingfeng. Instead, he stood to the side and continued to watch the lively show before him.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, how could it be you?” Tantai Xue saw Chu Feng and became both shocked and filled with joy. That sort of expression being shown on her ice-cold face could be said to be dazzlingly beautiful.</p>
 <p>“Why can’t it be me?” Chu Feng smiled.</p>
 <p>“How did you know that I was here? Furthermore, why have you come here?” Tantai Xue asked.</p>
 <p>“I’ve naturally come to save you,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Save me?” Hearing those words, Tantai Xue was startled. A complicated expression began to fill her eyes. Then, she looked to Dugu Xingfeng and the others before saying, “These people, you’ve called them over? You’ve joined the Cyanwood Mountain?”</p>
 <p>“Mn, this person here is senior Hong Qiang. That person there is the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master. That person there is the World Spiritist Alliance’s Elder Miao. As for that person there, he is our Cyanwood Mountain’s……” Chu Feng began to make introductions.</p>
 <p>“I know who he is. He’s the Cyanwood Mountain’s headmaster, Dugu Xingfeng, the person reputed to be the strongest among all of the Nine Power’s headmasters. Some even say that he is hopeful to break through the boundary of Half Martial Emperor within a hundred years and become a Martial Emperor.”</p>
 <p>“To see him in the flesh today, his reputation is truly well-deserved. He is very powerful, much more powerful than my adoptive father,” Tantai Xue exclaimed in admiration.</p>
 <p>Dugu Xingfeng was truly very powerful. Even though the Cursed Soil Seven had unleashed their Cursed Soil Seven Slaughtering Formation that had greatly increased all of their strength, Dugu Xingfeng not only managed to effortlessly fight against them one on seven, he had even managed to obtain superiority over them.</p>
 <p>Dugu Xingfeng was not using any sort of gorgeous attacks. Rather, he was only using his fists and feet, palms and legs. However, his each and every attack possessed enormous might. In his hands, no matter how simple an action was, they would all become remarkable.</p>
 <p>“Headmaster Dugu’s strength has increased once again. If this is to continue, even though the Cursed Soil Seven have joined hands, they will likely not be a match for him.”</p>
 <p>“However, time is of the utmost importance. We cannot sit and watch anymore. Come, let’s join the battle and resolve this as quickly as possible; it’s time for us to retrieve the heads of those seven animals,” said the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master. Miao Renlong had also walked over with him.</p>
 <p>Turning his head back to look, Chu Feng discovered that the paper talisman on Tantai Yingming’s body had been removed, and the Underworld’s Poison Centipedes had also been neutralized. Tantai Yingming no longer faced mortal danger. However, due to the fact that his injuries were too severe, Tantai Yingming had already lost consciousness.</p>
 <p>“You dare to behave so atrociously in my Cursed Soil Sect, none of you shall think about leaving here alive.” Seeing that the situation was bad, the Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster immediately retreated and took out a special talisman from his waist. He grabbed onto it and snapped it apart.</p>
 <p>Once that talisman was snapped apart, a layer of invisible ripples started to spread instantly. However, not long after that ripple began to spread, it was stopped by an invisible barrier.</p>
 <p>“This…” Seeing this scene, the Cursed Soil Seven were all startled. Then, their expressions became extremely uneasy.</p>
 <p>“Heh, trying to cry for help? Cry for reinforcements? If you are, then you’re greatly mistaken.”</p>
 <p>Dugu Xingfeng sneered. Their world spirit formation had been set up perfectly. Thus, this place was an inescapable prison. Not only were the Cursed Soil Seven unable to escape this place, they would not be able to send any information out of this place either.</p>
 <p>“You all actually dared to set up a barrier in our Cursed Soil Sect’s forbidden area and sealed off this region?!”</p>
 <p>“You all actually want to kill us in our Cursed Soil Sect’s forbidden area?!” The Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster came to a sudden realization.</p>
 <p>“You would have to thank these three exceptional royal-cloak world spiritists for that.”</p>
 <p>Dugu Xingfeng pointed to the direction behind the Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster. At this moment, the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master, Miao Renlong and Hong Qiang had all walked over. Together with Dugu Xingfeng, they surrounded the Cursed Soil Seven.</p>
 <p>Although they were only four, a number inferior to seven, they possessed absolute dominance in terms of their imposing might. It was like four fierce tigers had surrounded seven cheetahs. The gap between their strength was enormous. Although they were only four, they still occupied absolute superiority.</p>
 <p>“Hahahaha, wahahahahahaha…” Suddenly, the Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster burst into loud, extremely frantic and abnormally strange laughter.</p>
 <p>“For the sake of dealing with us, you all have truly planned meticulously.”</p>
 <p>“Unfortunately, in the end, you all will have done all this in vain. Today, not only will you all not be able to save anyone, you all will also die here.”</p>
 <p>“Our Cursed Soil Sect is not a place where you can come and go as you please,” The Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster said in a very fierce manner.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Dugu Xingfeng and the others were all confused. They could not understand how this Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster, a fish on the chopping block, managed to find the confidence to say this sort of arrogant words.</p>
 <p>Actually, at the moment when Dugu Xingfeng and the others were fighting against the Cursed Soil Seven, there was a dark and dusky palace hall in the depths of the Cursed Soil Sect. That palace hall was pitch-black and gave off a very frightening sense of eeriness.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a pair of eyes opened. Two deep green lights shone in this dark palace hall.</p>
 <p>It was a pair of human eyes. Yet, that pair of eyes was even more frightening than those of beasts. That was because it was a Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>“Those who dare to intrude into our Cursed Soil Sect shall die!!!!"</p>
