 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1632-1 - Stirring Up Murderous Intention</strong></p>
 <p>The scene earlier had completely stunned the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan, causing them to be at a loss as to what to do.</p>
 <p>However, at the same time, they all felt the same thing -- that their ego had been attacked.</p>
 <p>“Wuuaouuu~~~”</p>
 <p>After that enormous black lightning beast scared the golden dragon away, it suddenly soared toward the sky.</p>
 <p>Following that, the other five enormous lightning beasts also soared toward the sky.</p>
 <p>They did not linger around the sky like that golden dragon. Instead, they charged directly into the Ninth Heaven and the stars.</p>
 <p>It was as if they felt that it was beneath them to stay in this sky, that their actual stage was the Outer World.</p>
 <p>Astonishment. Indescribable astonishment. Even though the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan were all deeply frightened by those six enormous lightning beasts, they were still unable to help themselves from looking up toward the sky to look at those galloping lightning beasts.</p>
 <p>The six enormous lightning beasts galloped in the sky for quite a while before landing back down in the location where Chu Feng was.</p>
 <p>Even though the sky had returned to normal, the hearts of the people from the Nangong Imperial Clan were were in complete unrest, akin to the raging Yangtze River.</p>
 <p>“Lord Clan Chief,” Nangong Huayi and Nangong Rongsheng looked to Nangong Beidou together. At this moment, a deep sense of unease was present within their eyes.</p>
 <p>“Go and investigate who's responsible for this,” Nangong Beidou said.</p>
 <p>“Yes,” Nangong Huayi and Nangong Rongsheng, the two Marital Emperors, left right away. They flew toward the direction of Chu Feng’s residence.</p>
 <p>“Clan Chief Nangong, the abnormal sign from earlier doesn’t seem to have been caused by someone from your clan,” White-browed Immortal had also discovered that something was amiss. The abnormal sign of the Nangong Imperial Clan was that of a golden dragon. It was a dragon formed by golden light.</p>
 <p>However, the enormous lightning beasts from earlier were not only formed by six different colored types of lightning, they also had the appearance of ferocious beasts that possessed enormous killing intent, something that the golden dragon could not compare with.</p>
 <p>If… the truth must be said, then those enormous lightning beasts were existences much more frightening than that golden dragon.</p>
 <p>This was most definitely not a guess. It was something that could be determined by how the golden dragon had been scared away by a roar from the enormous black lightning beast.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, it was not caused by someone from my clan,” Nangong Beidou said.</p>
 <p>“Forgive me for speaking bluntly, regardless of what the abnormal sign from earlier was, it seemed capable of restraining your Nangong Imperial Clan’s Inherited Bloodline.”</p>
 <p>“With a single roar, it managed to scare away that golden dragon. I do not think that is a coincidence,” White-browed Immortal said.</p>
 <p>Nangong Beidou did not say anything. Even though he appeared to be very calm, his eyes had become very complicated, with traces of killing intent flickering within them.</p>
 <p>Not long afterward, Nangong Huayi and Nangong Rongsheng returned. They reported, “Reporting to Lord Clan Chief, it is an outsider by the name of Chu Feng. He possesses the cultivation of a rank nine Martial King. Several days ago, it was this child who obtained first place in the Weaponry Bestowment Assembly held by the Weaponry Refinement Immortal.”</p>
 <p>“Even though that child’s cultivation is not very high, his world spirit techniques are extremely exceptional. Today, he had compared notes with White-browed Immortal’s disciple using world spirit techniques, and won by a bit.”</p>
 <p>“You said that Xiaoyan compared world spirit techniques with that Chu Feng and ended up being defeated?” Hearing those words, White-browed Immortal was not very happy.</p>
 <p>“That is indeed the case. I am absolutely not blabbering nonsense,” Nangong Huayi said.</p>
 <p>“How did he come to our Nangong Imperial Clan?”</p>
 <p>“Exactly what are his origins? How did he create such an abnormal sign?” Nangong Beidou asked.</p>
 <p>“It is Nangong Lian who invited him here. As for his origins, we also do not know,” The two men replied together.</p>
 <p>“Get Nangong Lian here,” Nangong Beidou said.</p>
 <p>“As you wish,” The two men immediately left to get Nangong Lian.</p>
 <p>Not long after, the two men returned. They had returned with another person. It was Nangong Lian.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Nangong Lian’s expression was not very good. She had also seen the scene from before and also felt the might displayed by the six enormous lightning beasts. Thus, she knew very well that Chu Feng had caused an enormous calamity.</p>
 <p>“Sis Lian, you also saw all that happened earlier, right? You should have felt that sensation too, no?” Nangong Beidou asked.</p>
 <p>“Yes,” Nangong Lian nodded.</p>
 <p>“I have heard that Chu Feng was invited over by you, no? Do you know of his origins? Furthermore, why did you invite a person like that to our Nangong Imperial Clan?” Nangong Beidou asked. His tone could still be considered to be calm.</p>
 <p>“Lord Clan Chief, I do not know about Chu Feng’s origins. I only met him on the Immortal Island.”</p>
 <p>“Not only did he save Baihe and Moli’s lives, he also saved my life. I am indebted to him. That is why I invited him to be a guest at our Nangong Imperial Clan,” Aunt Lian said.</p>
 <p>“What did you say? He saved your life? You said that a mere rank nine Martial King saved your life?” Hearing those words, a trace of suspicion flashed through Nangong Beidou’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“He really saved my life. It is a long story to explain. That day…”</p>
 <p>“Enough, you do not have to bother explaining. Since you also saw what occurred earlier, you should know that that child is a threat to our Nangong Imperial Clan. Since you were the one to bring him here, you should be the one to take care of him,” Even though Nangong Beidou said those words very calmly, they were filled with killing intent.</p>
 <p>“Lord Clan Chief, you absolutely must not do that. That child is really a benefactor to all of us. How could I cause harm to our benefactor?” At this moment, Aunt Lian started to panic. She did not expect that Nangong Beidou would be this decisive.</p>
 <p>“Is being your benefactor more important, or is the existence of our Nangong Imperial Clan more important?” Nangong Beidou asked.</p>
 <p>“Lord Clan Chief, Chu Feng really must not be killed. Although I do not know what Chu Feng’s origins are, I know for sure that they are very extraordinary.”</p>
 <p>“That day, when I encountered Evildoer Tie in the Heavenly Law Auction, I planned to kill him, but ended up being no match for him. At the crucial moment when I would have been killed, a mysterious expert helped us repel Evildoer Tie. We only managed to escape that calamity because of that.”</p>
 <p>“As for that mysterious expert, even though he did not reveal his appearance, I was still able to sense how powerful he was. His cultivation is likely not inferior to yours, Lord Clan Chief. Most importantly, he only helped us because of Chu Feng. He was a person tasked with protecting Chu Feng,” Seeing that it was meaningless to speak of benefactors with Nangong Beidou, Aunt Lian could only bring up the person behind Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“You’re saying that there is someone with a cultivation on par with mine protecting that Chu Feng from the shadows?” Sure enough, after hearing those words, the expression in Nangong Beidou’s eyes changed.</p>
 <p>“That is indeed the case. I would not dare to deceive Lord Clan Chief. What happened that day was something that Nangong Ya, Nangong Baihe and Nangong Moli also witnessed. If you do not trust me, you can go and ask them,” Aunt Lian said.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Nangong Beidou grew silent. He started to ponder deeply.</p>
 <p>In the Holy Land of Martialism, the number of rank three Martial Emperors could be counted with one’s fingers.</p>
 <p>The person protecting Chu Feng was likely his senior, and a human too. From the human powers, only the Four Imperial Clans and the Three Palaces possessed rank three Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>The power Chu Feng had revealed earlier was simply not that of an Imperial Bloodline. Thus, it had ruled out Chu Feng being someone from the Four Imperial Clans.</p>
 <p>At this moment, there were only two possibilities. Chu Feng was either someone from the Three Palaces, or a personal disciple of a hidden expert.</p>
 <p>However, regardless of which one it might be, neither of them was something that he could look down upon. Likely, he would not be able to rashly touch Chu Feng.</p>
