 <p><strong> Chapter 2028 - Unfavorable Battle Situation</strong></p>
 <p>The Ancient Era’s Elves, that huge monster, possessed territories all over the Holy Land of Martialism.</p>
 <p>Other than the Elf Kingdom itself, there were a total of twenty-one important territories.</p>
 <p>Currently, the Ancient Era’s Elves had dispatched their top experts from the Elf Kingdom to guard the twenty-one territories.</p>
 <p>However, even with that being the case, they were still forced to an extremely passive and a very hopeless state against the occasional attacks from the Dark Hall.</p>
 <p>Although the Cyanwood Mountain’s army of Martial Emperors led by the Weaponry Refinement Immortal had joined the battle and alleviated a lot of the pressure from the Dark Hall, the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts that the Dark Hall had deployed grew stronger and stronger.</p>
 <p>In fact, many of the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts were no longer the same as they had been when they were unsealed from the Blood Devouring Killing Formation -- they had evolved. Not only had their outward appearance become more ferocious, their strength had also increased.</p>
 <p>Thus, in the battle between the Ancient Era’s Elves and the Dark Hall, the Ancient Era’s Elves were still in a disadvantaged state.</p>
 <p>In this sort of situation, the Little Elf Princess Xian Miaomiao was unable to sit tight and do nothing. She requested to go and guard a territory closest to the Elf Kingdom herself.</p>
 <p>Originally, the Elf King did not accept her request. However, Xian Miaomiao continued to insist. In the end, the Elf King agreed to her request.</p>
 <p>However, it was as if the Dark Hall knew about this beforehand. Right after Xian Miaomiao arrived at that territory, the Dark Hall launched an attack against that territory with their army. This was the most ferocious of all the Dark Hall’s attacks.</p>
 <p>“Damn it! It’s clear that the Dark Hall were prepared, and have come for Your Highness.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, the Elf Lord of that territory was standing inside a grand formation on top of the city wall. He looked to the experts from the Dark Hall and the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts that were attacking the grand formation. His brows were furrowed tightly, and he was feeling extremely uneasy.</p>
 <p>They had fought with the Dark Hall tens of times since the war against them had started. Although they were mostly defeated in the tens of battles, they would always face the Dark Hall head-on.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because they needed to defend their Ancient Era’s Elves’ honor. As such, they had to confront their enemies without cowering.</p>
 <p>However, this time around, the Dark Hall had truly dispatched an enormous amount of Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts. There were even ten rank seven Martial Emperor-level Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts among them.</p>
 <p>As for the Ancient Era’s Elves here, the strongest among them was an Elf Protector. This Lord Elf Protector was dispatched to protect Xian Miaomiao.</p>
 <p>However, even that Lord Elf Protector was only a rank seven Martial Emperor. By himself, it was clear that he would not be able to contend against ten rank seven Martial Emperor-level Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts.</p>
 <p>Thus, this time around, it could be said to be the most ferocious offensive the Dark Hall had dispatched against them. It was simply impossible for them to contend against the Dark Hall. The only thing they could do was guard against the attacks.</p>
 <p>As for that grand formation, it was the final line of defense for the Ancient Era’s Elves here. If that grand spirit formation was breached, they would be met with a disaster.</p>
 <p>It would be one thing if the territory were to fall. However, if Xian Miaomiao was killed, this would not be something that the Elf Lord of this territory could shoulder.</p>
 <p>The Elf Lord of this territory suddenly kneeled to the Elf Protector beside him. With a very sincere expression, he requested, “Lord Protector, if the grand formation is to be breached later, please do not concern yourself with us, and escape with Her Highness.”</p>
 <p>“What are you…” Seeing that Elf Lord kneeling before him, the Lord Protector felt sour to his heart. However, in the end, he nodded. The reason for that was because he also knew how important Xian Miaomiao was to the Ancient Era’s Elves.</p>
 <p>However, right at that moment, a sweet-sounding yet very powerful voice sounded. “Open the entrance to the grand formation. I will go out and kill that bunch of animals!”</p>
 <p>Turning their eyes toward the source of the voice, the Ancient Era’s Elves on the city wall all revealed expressions of shock. The person who had appeared before them was a beautiful young girl. Her blue eyes were clear like water and were extremely charming.</p>
 <p>However, those clear eyes were filled with fiery rage.</p>
 <p>This person was the Ancient Era’s Elves’ Little Princess, Xian Miaomiao.</p>
 <p>“Your Highness, you absolutely must not do that,” Seeing that Xian Miaomiao wanted to go out, the Elf Lord of this territory was so scared that his complexion turned green. Feeling helpless, he turned his gaze to the Elf Protector.</p>
 <p>Although he was the Elf Lord of this territory, there was an enormous gap in status between him and Xian Miaomiao. As such, he simply did not possess the qualifications to speak to Xian Miaomiao. Only that Lord Elf Protector was qualified to urge Xian Miaomiao against it.</p>
 <p>The Elf Protector understood tactily. Like the Elf Lord, he also did not wish for Xian Miaomiao to go out. Thus, he urged, “Miaomiao, don’t mess around now. This is not the time to…”</p>
 <p>However, before that Elf Protector could finish, Xian Miaomiao interrupted him. “Uncle, why did we come here? We have come to protect this territory. But, what are we doing now? We are actually being protected by the territory’s grand formation!”</p>
 <p>“Miaomiao, I know that you detest the Dark Hall. I am like you, I also detest them. However, His Majesty has ordered that your safety surpasses everything else. I absolutely cannot allow anything to happen to you,” The Elf Protector said.</p>
 <p>“I’ll say it again, let me out.”</p>
 <p>“Else, this grand formation will not be able to stop me,” As Xian MIaomiao said those words, her eyes flashed. Immediately, her blonde hair started to flutter wildly.</p>
 <p>At that moment, not to mention the Elf Lord and the soldiers here, even that rank seven Martial Emperor Elf Protector was knocked back.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Xian Miaomiao had unleashed her aura. A rank six Martial Emperor. Even though Xian Miaomiao was clearly only a young girl, she possessed the cultivation of a rank six Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>“Miaomiao, you’ve reached a breakthrough?”</p>
 <p>Sensing Xian Miaomiao’s current cultivation, the Elf Protector was startled.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, let me out. I have come here in order to teach those people from the Dark Hall a lesson. You cannot make me travel so far to this place just to turtle inside the grand formation and resign us to fate.”</p>
 <p>Seeing how determined Xian Miaomiao was, the Elf Protector felt awkward. After hesitating for some time, he said to the Elf Lord, “Open the gate.”</p>
 <p>“Open the gate! We shall battle against the Dark Hall!!!” The Elf Lord did not dare to hesitate. However, he was also unwilling to have Xian Miaomiao go out by herself.</p>
 <p>Thus, he prepared to lead the Ancient Era’s Elves here to battle against the Dark Hall and the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts together with Xian Miaomiao.</p>
 <p>After his order was given, an opening appeared in that grand formation.</p>
 <p>It was a gate, the only gate in that grand formation. They were prepared to go all-out to fight the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right after that opening appeared, a figure charged out. It was Xian Miaomiao.</p>
 <p>Not only was Xian Miaomiao the first to rush out, she waved her sleeve the moment she rushed out. Then, a ray of golden light landed on that grand formation’s exit.</p>
 <p>“Your Highness, you!!!”</p>
 <p>Seeing this scene, the Ancient Era’s Elves were both shocked and frightened.</p>
 <p>It turned out that that ray of golden light was an enormous golden bell. That golden bell was extremely large, and had sealed off the exit, forcing all of the Ancient Era’s Elves within the grand formation to stay inside.</p>
 <p>No matter how hard the Ancient Era’s Elves tried to attack the enormous golden bell, they were unable to cause any damage to it. That golden bell was even sturdier than the grand formation.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the Elf Lord of this place started to panic. Due to the fact that this grand formation was the final line of defense for this territory, there was only a single exit. Now that the exit was blocked, they were unable to go out.</p>
 <p>However, Xian Miaomiao had already gone out. How could he allow Xian Miaomiao to fight against so many experts from the Dark Hall alone?</p>
