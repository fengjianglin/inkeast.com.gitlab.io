 <p><strong> Chapter 2443 - Should Be Beheaded</strong></p>
 <p>“There’s actually no one capable of subduing it? Even senior Zhan Haichuan was unable to do so?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Even Lord Zhan Haichuan was unable to subdue the Ancient Era’s War Sword,” Zhan Lingtong said.</p>
 <p>“Sssss…” Even Chu Feng was unable to contain himself from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.</p>
 <p>That Zhan Haichuan was the publicly accepted strongest expert to have appeared in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm in the past tens of thousands of years.</p>
 <p>Even though Grandmaster Kai Hong had once ruled over the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, his status in the hearts of the people was still inferior to Zhan Haichuan’s.</p>
 <p>From this, it could be seen that Zhan Haichuan’s might was definitely not undeserved.</p>
 <p>Yet, that secret skill called the Ancient Era’s War Sword was something that even Zhan Haichuan was unable to subdue.</p>
 <p>This served to signify even more how powerful the secret skill was.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, this is a great opportunity. Since no one was able to conquer that secret skill, you should conquer it,” Her Lady Queen said in a very excited manner. It was as if she had discovered a treasure.</p>
 <p>“Milady Queen, that is the possession of the Ancient Era’s War Clan. Even if I wanted it, I fear that they will not allow me to have it,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“If they refuse, you can just snatch it,” Her Lady Queen said.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng smiled at those words and did not answer.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng knew very well what sort of personality Eggy had. As long as it was something beneficial to Chu Feng, she would disregard the lives and deaths of everyone and everything else.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng possessed neither hatred nor grievance toward the Ancient Era’s War Clan. As such, he would not go and snatch away their possession in a completely uncalled-for manner.</p>
 <p>Although Chu Feng was also tempted after hearing about how powerful the Ancient Era’s War Sword was, he would not go and snatch the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s secret skill just because of that.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because that was not the sort of person Chu Feng was.</p>
 <p>“Brother, I am truly curious. What is the origin of your Ancient Era’s War Clan?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>As matters stood, Chu feng was certain that the Ancient Era’s War Clan was definitely extraordinary. Likely, they might possess a grand origin.</p>
 <p>“Big brother, I won’t conceal this from you. Actually, our Ancient Era’s War Clan was very powerful. We have existed continuously since the Ancient Era,” Zhan Lingtong said.</p>
 <p>“In that case, do you all know about what happened in the Ancient Era?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>The things that had happened in the Ancient Era was one of the things Chu Feng was most curious about.</p>
 <p>However, faced with that question, Zhan Lingtong shook his head. He said, “We are only a branch family of our Ancient Era’s War Clan. Thus, even we ourselves do not know the history of our Ancient Era’s War Clan very well.”</p>
 <p>“You should also be able to tell that we’ve been trapped in here.”</p>
 <p>“So that’s the case.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng came to a realization. It was as he had guessed, the Ancient Era’s War Clan was indeed very powerful. Perhaps it was a colossus in that vast starry sky that even his clan, the Chu Heavenly Clan, would pale in comparison to.</p>
 <p>As for the Ancient Era’s War Clan in the sealed domain, they were most likely in a similar situation as Chu Feng himself. They had a home that they could not return to. Furthermore… they most likely did not receive their clan’s teachings.</p>
 <p>Else… how could they be so weak?</p>
 <p>“Big brother, are there a lot of experts in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm?” Zhan Lingtong asked.</p>
 <p>“Didn’t you not believe that I came from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm?” Chu Feng said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“I was blind earlier. However, I have managed to experience your strength. Other than the people from our Ancient Era’s War Clan, it is impossible for other humans to possess your sort of cultivation in this War Clan’s Ancient Domain.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, I feel that you should be from the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm,” Zhan Lingtong said.</p>
 <p>“Seems like you’re not stupid,” Chu Feng smiled.</p>
 <p>Then, Chu Feng began to tell Zhan Lingtong a bit about himself and the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p>
 <p>Of course, Chu Feng spoke a lot about the heroic deeds Zhan Haichuan had accomplished in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing that his senior had managed to be completely undefeated in a place filled with experts like the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, Zhan Lingtong became extremely excited.</p>
 <p>Although Chu Feng and Zhan Lingtong were chatting nonstop, Chu Feng’s speed did not slow down in the slightest. Soon, they arrived at the place where Zhan Lingtong’s lover resided.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, this place had already been occupied by the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan. Everyone with a cultivation of Martial Emperor and above had been captured to work as slave miners in the mine.</p>
 <p>All those who remained were a bunch of elderly, weak and disabled individuals. Fortunately, Zhan Lingtong’s lover was still there. Furthermore, she was completely unscathed.</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng and Zhan Lingtong discussed with one another, they decided that they would bring all those people away with them.</p>
 <p>Then, they returned to the mine and brought all the people in the mine with them too.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Zhan Lingtong would always ask Chu Feng to bring away anyone who was suffering hardships that they encountered on their journey.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, several tens of thousands of people were following Chu Feng and Zhan Lingtong.</p>
 <p>While two individuals would not appear to be extraordinary, when several tens of thousands of people flew in the sky together, it was like a vast black cloud, an extremely attention-catching sight.</p>
 <p>For the sake of not catching the attention of the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan, Chu Feng had no choice but to set up a concealment formation to conceal all of them.</p>
 <p>Thus, although they were traveling with a vast amount of people, only three of them could be seen.</p>
 <p>As for the third individual, it would naturally be Zhan Lingtong’s lover.</p>
 <p>Zhan Lingtong had managed to meet his lover again after great difficulty. And now, he was unwilling to part with her and tightly holding her hand.</p>
 <p>“That boy is simply too perverted, no? Look, the girl’s hands have turned red from how tightly he is holding her,” Sure enough, Her Lady Queen was unable to contain herself, and began to criticize Zhan Lingtong’s public display of affection to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng was able to understand Zhan Lingtong’s behavior.</p>
 <p>If he were to encounter Zi Ling, Su Rou and Su Mei, Chu Feng would likely have the same sort of reaction as Zhan Lingtong.</p>
 <p>After journeying for some time, Chu Feng and the others finally arrived at the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s territory.</p>
 <p>It was a vast land. It was also the last line of defense for the Ancient Era’s War Clan.</p>
 <p>Through using his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng was able to see that the vast and boundless land before them was actually isolated by a hidden grand formation.</p>
 <p>To put it simply, there was an invisible wall standing before them. Unless one possessed a special key, one would not be able to pass through the wall.</p>
 <p>It just so happened that Zhan Lingtong actually possessed the key.</p>
 <p>Zhan Lingtong held the key in his hand and started to lead the crowd past the grand defensive formation.</p>
 <p>However, immediately after passing through the grand defensive formation, a large group of people majestically appeared in the sky. Soon, they arrived before Chu Feng and Zhan Lingtong, blocking their path.</p>
 <p>Those people were all wearing armor and holding the same sorts of blades in their hands. They were people from the Ancient Era’s War Clan.</p>
 <p>Their leader was a middle-aged looking man. However, Chu Feng could tell that he was someone who had lived for hundreds of years.</p>
 <p>As for his cultivation, he was a rank seven Half Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>“Zhan Lingtong, where have you been?!”</p>
 <p>When the man leading the group saw Zhan Lingtong, he did not display any feelings of joy, and instead grew furious.</p>
 <p>“Brother-in-law, I… I went out to find Yue’er,” Zhan Lingtong said as he held the hand of his lover.</p>
 <p>Perhaps because he knew very well that his clansmen were against him being together with Li Yue’er, there was no confidence in Zhan Lingtong’s tone as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“You ran out for the sake of that lowly woman?! Do you know how many people you’ve harmed?!” Zhan Lingtong’s brother-in-law spoke in a very furious manner.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was unable to watch this go on anymore. He stood before Zhan Lingtong, pointed at his brother-in-law and said, “I do not know what sort of relationship you have with Zhan Lingtong. However, if you are a man, I hope that you will learn how to respect women.”</p>
 <p>“Who are you?” Zhan Lingtong’s brother-in-law took a very displeased look at Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>His stare contained disdain, contempt, anger and threat.</p>
 <p>“Who I am doesn’t matter. However, I’d urge you to speak with respect,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“What an audacious wicked commoner! You dare speak to me like this?! Do you know who I am?!” Zhan Lingtong’s brother-in-law roared in a very displeased manner. As he spoke, he unleashed his oppressive might to attack Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, to his surprise, Chu Feng’s expression remained unchanged after being attacked by his rank seven Half Martial Ancestor-level oppressive might.</p>
 <p>This caused his gaze to change to one of shock.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong? You want to fight?”</p>
 <p>“Rank seven Half Martial Ancestor, oh how impressive it must be,” Chu Feng laughed mockingly. Then, he said, “If you possess such overwhelming ability, why don’t you go out to take care of the monstrous beasts from the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan? Why are you not seizing back your lost territory, and instead trying to show off your might here?”</p>
 <p>“The way I see it, you are not strong at all. You’re simply someone who can only bully the weak and fear the strong. You’re someone who is meek in public but a tyrant at home. You’re nothing more than trash.”</p>
 <p>“You!!!” Zhan Lingtong’s brother-in-law was left speechless by Chu Feng’s words. That said, he grew more and more furious.</p>
 <p>“Clank~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, he pulled out the Incomplete Ancestral Armament on his waist and pointed it at Chu Feng, “To offend one’s superior, you should be beheaded!!!”</p>
