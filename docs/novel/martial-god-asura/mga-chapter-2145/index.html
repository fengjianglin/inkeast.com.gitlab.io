 <p><strong> Chapter 2145 - Surpassing The Old</strong></p>
 <p>“Mn.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng nodded. He naturally understood his father’s intentions. His father was trying to tell him that the result from his test would not necessarily represent how much he would accomplish in the future. However, the self-blame Chu Feng felt in his heart did not decrease.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, it is late now. You should leave soon. That said, there is one thing that I must remind you of,” Chu Xuanyuan looked to Chu Feng’s Cosmos Sack and said, “That Evil God Sword of yours is special. You will likely not be able to control it. However, you should not discard it either. In short, just make sure to be careful when using it.”</p>
 <p>“Father, is that Evil God Sword really an Imperial Armament?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Imperial Armament? The strength of that weapon cannot be weighed with the ranking of weapons. That said, that sword is very nefarious. If you are able to use it properly, it will become your assistance. However, if you fail to use it properly, it will become a weapon that will end up killing you.”</p>
 <p>“That said, it remains a rare treasure. Since you managed to encounter it, it is your fortune. If you were to discard it, it would be a great pity,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“Father, I understand now. I will not discard the Evil God Sword. Instead, I’ll be careful with it,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“As for whether it would be fortune or misfortune, it will depend on your ability to control it. If you are truly unable to control it, do not force yourself. There is no harm in discarding it,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“I understand,” Chu Feng nodded again.</p>
 <p>“Mn, Feng’er, go ahead. Go and temper yourself in the Outer World,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“Father, Uncle Ape, Zi Ling, I’ll be going now,” Chu Feng looked to the three people there with him. Regardless of whether it was Chu Xuanyuan, the Old Ape or Zi Ling, they all had expressions of reluctance to part in their eyes.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was able to tell that the three of them were unwilling to part with him too. This was especially true for Zi Ling. Even though she had a sweet smile on her face, the rims of her eyes were already red.</p>
 <p>In Chu Feng’s memory, Zi Ling was not a girl fond of crying.</p>
 <p>“I’m going now,” Chu Feng turned around, and then left with the blind old man.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had truly decided to leave. Even though there were many questions left in his heart, Chu Feng did not plan to ask his father about them.</p>
 <p>His father had told him about a lot of things today. From those, Chu Feng was able to tell that his father wanted him to rely on himself. As such, he would comply with his father’s desire.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s martial cultivation path would be very difficult in the days to come. However, Chu Feng was determined to rely on himself. He would no longer rely on his father.</p>
 <p>“Feng’er,” Right at that moment, Chu Xuanyuan’s voice sounded.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng turned around, and saw that Chu Xuanyuan was looking at him still. With a light smile on his face, Chu Xuanyuan said, “Although I am unable to tell you things concerning your mother right now, you must know that your mother loved you deeply.”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s nose started to sting. Tears were about to bubble out of his eyes.</p>
 <p>He naturally knew that his mother loved him deeply. Else, why would she go through great pains to leave behind world spirits for him?</p>
 <p>Merely, when his father personally said those words, Chu Feng felt extremely moved. His longing for his mother started to slightly go out of control.</p>
 <p>“Father, I know. I will work hard in my cultivation so that we can bring mother back,” Chu Feng said those words with a smile. He did not cry. He had made the decision at that moment that he would never cry regardless of what sort of hardships he might end up encountering in the future.</p>
 <p>He must be strong, even stronger than before. The reason for that was because he knew that the road to the future would become even more challenging.</p>
 <p>However, he must continue to move forward, for he had no other choice. For the sake of his family, he must work hard.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng and the blind old man left the forbidden area. However, they did not immediately return. The reason for that was because they must continue onward through the Heavenly Path. Only after entering the Holy Land of Martialism would they be able to use that tunnel to return to the Eastern Sea Region.</p>
 <p>At that moment, it had been some time since Chu Feng and the blind old man had left. However, Chu Xuanyuan, Zi Ling and the Old Ape were still standing there. Their gazes were fixed onto the direction in which Chu Feng had left.</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng left, Zi Ling was unable to contain her tears. Her tears completely drenched her beautiful cheeks.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Xuanyuan, he naturally did not cry. In fact, not even the rims of his eyes grew red. However, there was a great amount of reluctance to part in his eyes.</p>
 <p>“You’re worried, no? If you’re worried, you can call him back right now.”</p>
 <p>“You should know that the Outer World cannot be compared to this place. The perilousness of that place is many times greater than this place,” The Old Ape said to Chu Xuanyuan.</p>
 <p>“I am naturally worried. After all, he is my son. However, it is precisely because I love him that I cannot keep him by my side. Else, I will only be holding him back,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“That’s true too. After all, you have relied on yourself all the way ‘til here too. Your father also did not help you either,” The Old Ape said.</p>
 <p>“Indeed. If he is to have someone to rely on, it is inevitable that his efforts will waver. Even if he possesses even better talent, he would not be able to display it.”</p>
 <p>“Only through having no one to rely on, having no way to retreat, would one’s potential be aroused. I am doing all this for his sake,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“Rest assured. Feng’er’s potential is already very good. After all, the eighth step is not something that just anyone could reach.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, his personality has been tempered very well over the years. With his talent and personality, he would be fine even after entering the Outer World,” The Old Ape said.</p>
 <p>“Who said that was the eighth step?” Suddenly, Chu Xuanyuan spoke with a smile on his face. There seemed to be a hidden implication behind his smile.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on?” At that moment, the Old Ape’s pupils shrunk. He sensed that something was amiss.</p>
 <p>Zi Ling revealed a confused expression. She was perplexed by the conversation between the Old Ape and Chu Xuanyuan.</p>
 <p>“This Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps was personally created by me. Didn’t you notice that there are differences compared to the Chu Heavenly Clan’s Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps when I had you prepare it?” Chu Xuanyuan asked with a light smile.</p>
 <p>“How could I possibly see through your tricks? Quickly, tell me, exactly what did you do?” The Old Ape hurriedly asked.</p>
 <p>“I did not wish for Chu Feng to become overly conceited. Thus, I decided to deliberately strike at his confidence. This will make him more cautious in the Outer World.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, the pressure from that Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps was much stronger compared to ordinary Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps. The eighth step was actually the ninth step,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“In that case, Chu Feng had already stepped onto the ninth step?” The Old Ape asked.</p>
 <p>“Of course. Not only did he step onto it, he also stood there very firmly,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“Then, what about that ninth step? If this Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps’ eighth step is already equivalent to an ordinary Nine Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps’ ninth step, then what about that ninth step? What was with that?” The Old Ape asked.</p>
 <p>“The ninth step would naturally be the tenth step,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“Ah? In that case, the NIne Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps that Chu Feng ascended today was the Ten Levels Heavenly Lightning Steps in that remnant that not even you could ascend?” The Old Ape revealed a face filled with astonishment.</p>
 <p>“Indeed. Although Chu Feng failed to truly ascend it, it remains that he managed to touch it with his foot. The me back then was unable to even touch it,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“Haha, if that is the case, then it would mean that Chu Feng’s talent is not inferior to yours and your father’s. Instead, his talent surpasses both of you,” The Old Ape was very excited. After all, this was no small matter.</p>
 <p>“Strictly speaking, that is the case. Although it is only willpower, that sort of willpower is not something that ordinary people could compare with.”</p>
 <p>“Feng’er has truly surpassed us,” Chu Xuanyuan revealed an expression of pride.</p>
