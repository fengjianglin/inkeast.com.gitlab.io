 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1767 - Killing Zhan Qiankun</strong></p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, it’s actually Chu Feng?”</p>
 <p>It was only after a long while that the crowd managed to react. However, they were still unable to accept this.</p>
 <p>The Chu Feng that they were skeptical and doubtful of was actually even more powerful than he was rumored to be?</p>
 <p>Didn’t they say that Chu Feng was only a rank four Half Martial Emperor? Didn’t they say that Chu Feng only managed to barely defeat Ximen Feixue? In that case, what was going on with this rank seven Half Martial Emperor’s oppressive might?</p>
 <p>However, none of those mattered anymore. While the rumors might be false, the aura of a rank seven Half Martial Emperor that Chu Feng was emitting was definitely real.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was even stronger than he was rumored to be. He was actually a rank seven Half Martial Emperor. This was something that the crowd found extremely difficult to accept. And yet, they still had to accept it.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because Chu Feng was standing in the sky just like that. Not only that, he had defeated Zhan Qiankun who wanted to kill them with only his oppressive might, saving their lives.</p>
 <p>“Chu, Chu, Chu, Chu Feng, Chu Feng is actually Chu Feng?” At this moment, Little Radish was so shocked that his expression became distorted, and he started to stutter as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, he’s actually not someone with the same name, but actually Chu Feng?!!!” Big Radish was also extremely shocked.</p>
 <p>As for Chili Pepper, she did not say anything. However, her hands were tightly wrapped around her chest, and her mouth was slightly open. She was gasping for breath. It was as if she had received an enormous shock. To be exact, she was so shocked that she was having a heart attack.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you… you’re Chu Feng?!” As for the person with the most marvelous expression, it would be none other than Zhan Qiankun.</p>
 <p>Different from Jin Wei’e and the others, he seemed to have seen Chu Feng’s wanted poster before. Thus, he knew Chu Feng’s appearance. After Chu Feng removed his conical bamboo hat, he recognized him immediately.</p>
 <p>However, that Chu Feng he looked down on, why would he be this powerful? He was so powerful that all Zhan Qiankun could do was beg for forgiveness.</p>
 <p>“Thump…”</p>
 <p>“Thump…”</p>
 <p>“Thump…”</p>
 <p>“Thump…”</p>
 <p>………...</p>
 <p>At this moment, standing in midair, Chu Feng began to walk toward Zhan Qiankun slowly. While Chu Feng’s footsteps did not give off any sound, they were like sudden thunderclaps in Zhan Qiankun’s heart. Hearing those thunderclaps, Zhan Qiankun became extremely terrified.</p>
 <p>Finally, Chu Feng arrived before Zhan Qiankun. He was grabbing the Black Flame Whip that Zhan Qiankun had previously held in his hand, but had lost hold of.</p>
 <p>“Ahh~~~”</p>
 <p>“Puutt~~~”</p>
 <p>Right after the Black Flame Whip entered Chu Feng’s hand, Zhan Qiankun’s expression immediately changed. Then, his mouth opened wide, and a mouthful of blood sprayed out of it.</p>
 <p>At the same time, heaven and earth darkened. Violent wind began to rise. All of the marital power in this region started to surge. Then, that martial power all gathered into the Black Flame Whip and began to merge with Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Heavens, that Chu Feng is actually this powerful?!” Seeing this scene, the crowd opened their mouths wide in shock.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because they were seeing with their own eyes that Chu Feng had severed the relationship that Incomplete Imperial Armament had had with Zhan Qiankun, and made that Incomplete Imperial Armament that used to be Zhan Qiankun’s enter absolute submission to him.</p>
 <p>It did not only recognize Chu Feng as its master, it had even entered absolute submission.</p>
 <p>At this moment, when the crowd thought of the rumors before, they began to believe them. Chu Feng had really subdued that legendary Evil God Sword. The reason for that was because Chu Feng possessed the ability to do so.</p>
 <p>“It would seem that this bit of power is too lacking for me now,” Chu Feng sighed. Back then, he had been able to increase his cultivation by one entire level just by making a Royal Armament enter absolute submission.</p>
 <p>Yet now, even after an Incomplete Imperial Armament had entered absolute submission to him, his cultivation was not affected in the slightest. It was not that the Incomplete Imperial Armament that had entered absolute submission toward him did not bestow Chu Feng power. Rather, the power that Chu Feng currently needed was simply too much. Although what had been bestowed by the Incomplete Imperial Armament was not insignificant, it was nowhere near enough.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Then, Chu Feng lashed the Black Flame Whip in his hand and pointed it forward. The whip acted like a spear, becoming perfectly straight as it was aimed at Zhan Qiankun, who was still buried deep underground.</p>
 <p>“I’ll give you an opportunity. As long as you kneel and beg for forgiveness, I’ll spare your life.”</p>
 <p>Zhan Qiankun’s eyes were wide open. In disbelief, he asked, “Are you serious?”</p>
 <p>“Serious,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Thump~~~”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Zhan Qiankun immediately jumped out of the crater in the ground and then, without hesitation, knelt onto the ground the moment he landed. Not only had he knelt to Chu Feng, he was also kowtowing, admitting his mistake and begging for forgiveness from Chu Feng nonstop.</p>
 <p>While Zhan Qiankun was begging to Chu Feng, he was actually smiling coldly in his heart. He thought to himself, “For a nobleman to take revenge, ten years is not too long. While one’s face is important, when placed against one’s life, it is not worth anything.”</p>
 <p>“Today, I, Zhan Qiankun, kneel to you, Chu Feng. In the future, I will definitely return this humiliation ten-fold. Not only will you, Chu Feng, die, but all of your relatives, your friends and anyone related to you will also die.”</p>
 <p>Thinking these things, Zhan Qiankun turned his gaze that concealed murderous intentions toward Chu Feng, Yan Xie and even Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish.</p>
 <p>Even though Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish did not appear to be extremely close with Chu Feng, Zhan Qiankun was a very observant individual. Thus, he was certain that they possessed relationships with Chu Feng. He had already placed Chili Pepper, Big Radish and Little Radish on his list of people he must kill.</p>
 <p>“Puu~~~”</p>
 <p>“Wuuwaaa~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right at this moment, Zhan Qiankun suddenly felt an incomparably sharp pain in his dantian. He lowered his head to look at his abdomen, and discovered that Chu Feng had used the Black Flames Whip to pierce through his dantian.</p>
 <p>Even though only a small bit of his dantian had been pierced through, blood was still flowing from his dantian area. Furthermore, the cultivation that he had painstakingly obtained over the years was also rapidly flowing out from him.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you… you’re unfaithful to your promises,” Zhan Qiankun was extremely shocked. He pointed at Chu Feng and shouted angrily.</p>
 <p>“Zhan Qiankun, it seems like even though you’re someone who has done all sorts of malicious deeds, you are still extremely stupid. You actually didn’t even expect that even if you were to kneel and beg for forgiveness, I would still absolutely not let you live.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng said with a beaming smile. The gaze with which he looked to Zhan Qiankun was filled with contempt and ridicule. To Chu Feng, Zhan Qiankun was nothing more than a clown.</p>
 <p>“You…” Even though Zhan Qiankun was extremely enraged, he was powerless to speak back to Chu Feng. The reason for that was because while what Chu Feng had said was rather shameless, those were the exact same words he had used to insult Yan Xie earlier.</p>
 <p>Merely, being insulted by those words, Zhan Qiankun felt extremely unwell. He was being crushed by an enormous sense of humiliation.</p>
 <p>In this battle, he had not only lost to Chu Feng in terms of martial cultivation, he had also lost to him in terms of intelligence.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, if you are to kill me, my master will definitely not let you live!”</p>
 <p>“If his distinguished self were to show himself, even the management elders from the Three Palaces would have to fear him,” Zhan Qiankun said with an expression of anger.</p>
 <p>“Is that so?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“You don’t have to believe me. However, you’ll know in the future that what you’ve done here today will bring about your destruction,” Zhan Qiankun said while gnashing his teeth in anger.</p>
 <p>“You spoke those words as if you would let me get away should I spare your life.”</p>
 <p>“However, do you really think that I will be as stupid as you are? Do you really think that I’m so stupid that I will believe that you will let me get away should I spare your life today?” Chu Feng asked with his eyes narrowed into a smile.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, I, Zhan Qiankun, swear upon the heavens. As long as you spare me, I will forget all that happened here today. Not only that, I will also befriend you,” Zhan Qiankun raised his hand and vowed.</p>
 <p>“Did you really think that I would trust an untrustworthy vile character like yourself?” Chu Feng’s smile grew even deeper. Suddenly, the Black Flame Whip in his hand thrust forward. “Puu,” it pierced directly into Zhan Qiankun’s dantian.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, my master will definitely not let you get away with this. You will be met with a violent death! Not only you, all those beside you shall be killed!” Seeing that his dantian was pierced through, Zhan Qiankun knew that he would be dead soon. Thus, he no longer bothered to pretend, and instead revealed his true appearance and began to curse out at Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“I know that your master is extremely strong. The head of the Five Great Evildoers would naturally not be someone ordinary. However, what about it?”</p>
 <p>“No matter how strong your master might be now, it does not mean that he will still be strong in the future. One day, that master of yours who has caused countless people to fear him will instead fear me, Chu Feng.”</p>
 <p>“Unfortunately for you, you will not be able to see that day,” Chu Feng sneered.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, don’t do it, we can still talk through this…” Even though Zhan Qiankun knew that Chu Feng was going to kill him, he still didn’t want to die.</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~~”</p>
 <p>However, before Zhan Qiankun could finish his words, his body exploded.</p>
 <p>Other than the Cosmos Sack on his waist, which entered Chu Feng’s hand, not a single hair of Zhan Qiankun’s remained. Zhan Qiankun had exploded into pieces. He was completely dead.</p>
