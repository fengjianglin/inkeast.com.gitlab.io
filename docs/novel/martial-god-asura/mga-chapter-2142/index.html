 <p><strong> Chapter 2142 - Chu Feng’s Mother</strong></p>
 <p>“Resurrect my family?” Chu Feng looked to the spirit formation in his father’s hand with a stunned expression. His heart was tense, and his mind was filled with explosive excitement.</p>
 <p>“As long as you bring this formation to the Golden Purple City and unleash it there, you will be able to gather the souls of your adoptive father and the others. If you are to then create bodies for them, you will be able to resurrect them.”</p>
 <p>“For you, that should not be a difficult task,” Chu Xuanyuan looked to Chu Feng with a smile and said, “Feng’er, you should be capable of accomplishing that, right?”</p>
 <p>“Yes. As long as their souls are gathered, I will be able to revive them.”</p>
 <p>“Merely father, I… I truly don’t know how to thank you for this.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was truly excited upon receiving that formation from his father. He had not expected that his father would prepare such a gift for him.</p>
 <p>An enormous gift. To Chu Feng, this was most definitely an enormous gift. To Chu Feng, his greatest desire was to revive his family.</p>
 <p>He never thought that his father would have already prepared the resurrection technique for him.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Chu Feng had a feeling. Even though he had failed when he attempted to resurrect the Chu Family before, he felt that the spirit formation his father had prepared for him would definitely succeed.</p>
 <p>“Between father and son, there is no need to express thanks. If there are any thanks to be given, it should be me who should thank the people of the Azure Province’s Chu Family. Regardless of how they were, it remains that they were the ones that looked after you and nurtured you as a child,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>Seeing his father like this, Chu Feng felt wholly that his father was a great man.</p>
 <p>The people from the Chu Family had not treated him well. Yet, Chu Feng’s father felt grateful toward the people from the Chu Family.</p>
 <p>This meant his father was someone who could distinguish between gratitude and grudges, someone who possessed a heart that harbored gratefulness toward others.</p>
 <p>It was just like how the Chu Heavenly Clan had clearly abandoned both his father and him. Yet, Chu Feng’s father still told him to not carry out revenge against everyone from the Chu Heavenly Clan.</p>
 <p>He stated that it was not the Chu Heavenly Clan that were in the wrong. Rather, it was only the people that had persecuted the two of them.</p>
 <p>“Feng’er, you said that you have three things that you wished my assistance with, what is the third thing?” Chu Xuanyuan asked.</p>
 <p>“Father, the third thing is about the world spirit in my body,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“You’re talking about that Asura World Spirit by the name of Eggy, right? What about her?” Chu Xuanyuan asked.</p>
 <p>“Eggy was sealed by my mother. Even now, her cultivation remains sealed, and she is unable to recover it. In the Holy Land of Martialism, I coincidentally ran across an energy. I used that energy to help recover a portion of Eggy’s cultivation.”</p>
 <p>“However, even now, Eggy remains asleep. I feel that her condition is a bit fishy. I hope that father can inspect her for me,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Very well, let me have a look.” As Chu Xuanyuan spoke, he placed his finger on Chu Feng’s forehead.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Feng’s heart moved, and he revealed a shocked expression. His father was actually prying into his world spirit space.</p>
 <p>Originally, Chu Feng was planning to release Eggy from his world spirit space and then have his father look at her. However, it would appear that it was unnecessary.</p>
 <p>“Mn, a small problem,” Chu Xuanyuan retrieved his finger and said with a light smile.</p>
 <p>“Father, you’re saying that Eggy will be fine?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Feng’er, there is no issue with your world spirit technique. Merely, the spirit formation that sealed your world spirit is too complicated.”</p>
 <p>“That Asura World Spirit’s original cultivation should be that of a rank seven Martial Emperor, the same level of cultivation as you possessed before.”</p>
 <p>“However, when the world spirit technique is completely undone, and she regains consciousness, her cultivation should at least be that of a Half Martial Ancestor. Do you know why that is the case?” Chu Xuanyuan asked.</p>
 <p>“Why?” Chu Feng hurriedly asked. The reason for that was because he was truly confused.</p>
 <p>“Isn’t the speed at which she increases her cultivation after devouring source energies extremely slow?” Chu Xuanyuan asked.</p>
 <p>“It is,” Chu Feng nodded.</p>
 <p>“That’s the crucial aspect. It is not that she was so extraordinary that she needed more source energy than other world spirits.”</p>
 <p>“Instead, everything was caused by that world spirit technique. That world spirit technique has been devouring the source energies and putting them aside for her.</p>
 <p>“In other words, once that world spirit formation that has sealed her power disappears, that little world spirit will be able to break out of her cocoon, attain rebirth and become much more powerful than before.</p>
 <p>“While it is true that that spirit formation has harmed her by sealing her cultivation and made her, a Martial Emperor, become extremely weak, that spirit formation is actually also helping her.”</p>
 <p>“The reason for that is because if she were to increase her cultivation by herself, it would not necessarily be faster than having the world spirit formation help her accumulate power.”</p>
 <p>“Merely, Feng’er, your World Spirit Techniques are still insufficiently powerful. It is because you tried to forcibly undo her seal without sufficient power that you caused her to enter a deep sleep.”</p>
 <p>“However, there is no major concern. Merely, she will be sleeping for a relatively long time. Your mother did not try to deliberately make things difficult for you. As long as you are determined to remove the spirit formation that sealed her, the spirit formation would eventually be removed. Merely… as you do not possess sufficient strength, it will take a long while for you to undo that spirit formation,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“In that case, the spirit formation will be completely undone after Eggy wakes up? Furthermore, she would have become a Half Martial Ancestor?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“That is the case,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“That’s great,” Chu Feng firmly believed what Chu Xuanyuan said. Thus, he was certain that nothing would happen to Eggy. As such, a major boulder weighing down on his heart was lifted.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Feng asked, “Father, where is my mother?”</p>
 <p>However, right after Chu Feng asked that question, Chu Xuanyuan’s expression changed, and his gaze grew complicated.</p>
 <p>In fact, at that instant. Chu Feng felt as if he had fallen into a glacial-filled ravine. Coldness began to assail his body as it covered his surroundings.</p>
 <p>However, that coldness only persisted for a moment, and did not cause any change to the objects nearby.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng’s heart tightened. The reason for that was because that coldness and his father’s complicated gaze disappeared at the same time. This meant that it was very possible that it was his father that had unleashed that coldness.</p>
 <p>This made Chu Feng realize that the matter concerning his mother… seemed to be somewhat complicated. That was the reason why his father would have such a response when he asked where his mother was.</p>
 <p>“Feng’er, I’ve mentioned to you before that this place is a Lower Realm, that the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm is an Ordinary Realm, and our Chu Heavenly Clan exists in the Upper Realm. Furthermore, I’ve also mentioned that every world is a star, and that the stars of a region form a Starfield.”</p>
 <p>“As for your mother, she is in another Starfield. She is not someone from our Starfield.”</p>
 <p>“As for your mother’s name, I cannot tell you that right now. Likewise, I also cannot tell you where she is now.”</p>
 <p>“However, I’ll promise you this. When you obtain the Chu Heavenly Clan’s acknowledgement, when you are able to allow me to leave this place, I will tell you everything about your mother,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“Very well, father. I understand what I must do,” Chu Feng nodded.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng’s heart felt very heavy.</p>
 <p>Even though his father did not state it clearly, he was able to faintly tell that there seemed to be a need of a certain amount of power in order to take care of his mother’s matters.</p>
 <p>It was likely no longer something on the Chu Heavenly Clan’s level. Likely, it was so important that even his father could not do anything about it.</p>
