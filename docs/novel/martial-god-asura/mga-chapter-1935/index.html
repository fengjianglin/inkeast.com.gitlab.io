 <p><strong> Chapter 1935 - Confronting Enemies Together</strong></p>
 <p>‘The Ancient Era’s Elves are truly powerful,’ After seeing the Ancient Era’s Elves’ army, Chu Feng felt admiration from the bottom of his heart.</p>
 <p>They should have been guarding this place for many years. In fact, it should have been several generations since they started guarding this place.</p>
 <p>To guard this place for so long without the emergence of the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts would inevitably cause one to lower one’s guard. Yet, the Ancient Era’s Elves had not lowered their guard at all. From this, it could be seen how well-trained and disciplined the Ancient Era’s Elves were.</p>
 <p>The Ancient Era’s Elves were like celestial soldiers that descended upon the mortal world to punish demons. Furthermore, these celestial soldiers were all composed of experts.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng felt that, in the entire Holy Land of Martialism, the Ancient Era’s Elves should be the only power capable of doing this sort of righteous thing.</p>
 <p>“Miaomiao, are you alright?”</p>
 <p>At that moment, a blonde-haired old man that emitted airs of immortality arrived before Chu Feng and Xian Miaomiao.</p>
 <p>Although this Ancient Era’s Elf was not one of the Protectors, his aura was extremely powerful, and actually surpassed that of the YinYang Immortal. If Chu Feng guessed correctly, he should be a rank seven Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>That man was not one of the Ancient Era’s Elves who was guarding this place. Instead, he was Xian Miaomiao’s bodyguard. He was someone who would follow Xian Miaomiao everywhere. He had been hiding within the void the entire time. It was also the first time that Chu Feng was meeting him.</p>
 <p>Due to the fact that only the younger generation were capable of entering the central region of the Blood Devouring Killing Formation, he had had no choice but to wait outside of the Blood Devouring Killing Formation regardless of how strong he might be.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, I am fine. Merely, the current situation is very bad,” Xian Miaomiao said impatiently.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, the situation is very bad. I never would’ve expected that the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts that had been sealed for so long would suddenly break through the spirit formation seal. The time is much sooner than His Majesty had anticipated,” In that moment, two more burly middle-aged men wearing green armor flew over to Xian Miaomiao and Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Although the two of them both had appearances of middle-aged burly men, they had actually lived for thousands of years. The two of them both possessed extremely powerful cultivations. Like the YinYang Immortal, they were both rank six Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>They were Ancient Era’s Elves tasked with guarding this place. However, Chu Feng felt that they should not be the only two rank six Martial Emperors tasked with guarding this place. With how enormous this Blood Devouring Killing Formation was, and the fact that there were Ancient Era’s Elves stationed all around it, the number of experts that were stationed here should be numerous.</p>
 <p>After seeing Xian Miaomiao, several more of the Ancient Era’s Elves flew over. Even though their cultivations were all at different levels, the weakest among them were rank four Martial Emperors; they were all extremely powerful individuals.</p>
 <p>It was in that moment, that Chu Feng finally realized why the Ancient Era’s Elves were the strongest power in the Holy Land of Martialism. It turned out that their forces were not only limited to the Four Grand Elders and the Eight Protectors; they possessed many more peak experts. Merely, those experts were tasked with important responsibilities.</p>
 <p>“However, do not worry, Your Highness. Although His Majesty just transferred some of the troops stationed here, those that remain are sufficient to handle the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts. At the moment when the Blood Devouring Killing Formation was destroyed, we immediately sealed this entire region. No matter how numerous the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts might be, not a single one of them will be able to escape,” The other middle-aged burly man said.</p>
 <p>“No, it’s not that simple. You absolutely cannot lower your guard,” Xian Miaomiao said.</p>
 <p>“Your Highness, could it be that you know something?” Hearing this Xian Miaomiao’s bodyguard and the two middle-aged burly men looked to one another. They seemed to have realized something.</p>
 <p>“Allow me to explain,” Chu Feng stepped forward and told them about the Dark Hall.</p>
 <p>“So it’s actually the Dark Hall that did this. How did they know that the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts were sealed here?” After hearing about what had happened, the Ancient Era’s Elves’ experts were all extremely shocked.</p>
 <p>It would be one thing if it was the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts breaking through the seal themselves. However, if it was done by the people from the Dark Hall, the situation would be much more complicated, and much more dangerous.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Xiao Miaomiao’s bodyguard said to Chu Feng, “Little friend Chu Feng, I’ll have to trouble you with one thing. Please take Miaomiao back to our Elf Kingdom safely,”</p>
 <p>“Uncle, you’re not returning with me?” Xian Miaomiao asked.</p>
 <p>“Miaomiao, my duty is to protect you. However, all of our Ancient Era’s Elves here might encounter fatal danger. I cannot disregard them. This time around, I’m afraid that I will not be able to be by your side to protect you,” The old man said with a smile on his face. However, self blame was evident in his eyes.</p>
 <p>He was blaming himself for being unable to protect Xian Miaomiao. However, he knew what was more important.</p>
 <p>If the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts were to escape, countless living things in the Holy Land of Martialism would suffer a calamity. In this sort of situation, he had to choose to stay here and suppress the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts with all his strength.</p>
 <p>“If uncle is not leaving, I am also not leaving. Not only am I an Ancient Era’s Elf, I am also the Elf Princess. I am going to confront these enemies together with you all, and eliminate the Dark Hall.”</p>
 <p>Xian Miaomiao said those words while patting her chest. Even though the situation right now was very bad, excitement filled Xian Miaomiao’s face. She had the appearance of a newborn calf that was not afraid of a tiger.</p>
 <p>“Miaomiao, this is not the time to act headstrong,” Hearing those words, her bodyguard was immediately made anxious.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, Your Highness, it’s better that you leave. This place is too dangerous,” The other Ancient Era’s Elves’ experts also started to panic. The reason for that was because Xian Miaomiao could be said to be the greatest treasure of their Ancient Era’s Elves. While they could lose everything else, they absolutely could not lose Xian Miaomiao.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, you know my temperament. I said that I’m staying, so I’m staying. Right now, even if you left, I would still stay. I must properly teach those scoundrels of the Dark Hall a lesson. They are truly too hateful,” Xian Miaomiao said.</p>
 <p>“But, if you stay, little friend Chu Feng will also not leave. You cannot involve little friend Chu Feng in this,” The old man looked to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Actually, I never planned to leave. The reason for that is because there is already an enormous hatred and grudge of blood between the Dark Hall and I,” Chu Feng said with a smile.</p>
 <p>What Chu Feng said was what he really thought. If the numerous Ancient Era’s Elves’ experts were not here, he would definitely choose to escape. He was not someone who would attempt to strike a stone with an egg.</p>
 <p>However, the current situation was different. All of these Ancient Era’s Elves’ experts were staying here to fight to protect the safety of the Holy Land of Martialism. As such, how could Chu Feng possibly escape by himself?</p>
 <p>“Haha, Uncle, there’s nothing you can do now, right?” Xian Miaomiao laughed. Then, she flew over to a golden bell and struck it hard.</p>
 <p>“I must also help out,” After Chu Feng said those words, he also ran over to help strike the bell. The reason for that was because only the sound of those bells was capable of deterring the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts.</p>
 <p>“Milord, this…” The Ancient Era’s Elves’ experts were at a loss as to what to do. They all looked to the blonde old man.</p>
 <p>“Although you all might not know Miaomiao’s temperament well, I know it very well.”</p>
 <p>“Since she is determined, no one will be able to take her away. If we insist on taking her away, she will even threaten you with her own life,” The old man said helplessly.</p>
 <p>“Ah?” The Ancient Era’s Elves’ experts all opened their mouths wide in shock. At that moment, they started to panic even more.</p>
 <p>“Think of a way to transfer all of the experts that are rank four Martial Emperor and above over here. Gather our strongest forces to protect Her Highness the Princess and little friend Chu Feng,” The old man said.</p>
 <p>“Yes!” After receiving that order, the experts all scattered.</p>
 <p>Later on, more and more Ancient Era’s Elves’ experts began to gather in that location.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng noticed this happening. He knew that this was a measure the Ancient Era’s Elves were taking in order to protect Xian Miaomiao.</p>
 <p>Merely, when there were several tens of rank five Martial Emperors and over a dozen rank six Martial Emperors gathered there with them, Chu Feng was unable to help himself from being astonished.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, this was the strength of the troops stationed here after troops had already been transferred to other places by the Elf King. If those troops had not been transferred away, how many experts would be stationed here?</p>
 <p>If all of the Ancient Era’s Elves’ military strength were to be gathered here, how powerful would they be? The strength of the Ancient Era’s Elves was truly enormous. It was so enormous that it was simply beyond measure.</p>
 <p>Not to mention the Four Great Imperial Clans, it was likely even the strongest human powers, the Three Palaces, would be greatly inferior to the Ancient Era’s Elves.</p>
 <p>At that moment, even Her Lady Queen started to commend the Ancient Era’s Elves’ strength. “The Ancient Era’s Elves are quite powerful. With their strength, they are fully deserving of being declared as the strongest in the Holy Land of Martialism. It is no wonder that the Dark Hall fears them.”</p>
 <p>“Yet, there are actually humans that think that the Three Palaces are the strongest powers in the Holy Land of Martialism. It could only be said that they are simply too ignorant,”</p>
 <p>“Mn, right now, the only ones capable of and willing to contend with the Dark Hall would be the Ancient Era’s Elves.”</p>
 <p>“Before all this, I truly never imagined that the Ancient Era’s Elves would be the ones that would protect the Holy Land of Martialism,” Chu Feng was also gasping with admiration.</p>
 <p>“Merely, Chu Feng, it is clear that the Dark Hall has done all this with a plan in mind. The YinYang Immortal was merely one of their many experts. Even though there are many Ancient Era’s Elves’ experts guarding this place, it does not mean that they will have much of a chance at victory.”</p>
 <p>“Do you really plan to stay here and fight till the end?” Her Lady Queen was worried about Chu Feng’s safety.</p>
