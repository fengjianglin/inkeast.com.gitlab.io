 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1191 - Triggering the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle</strong></p>
 <p>After the elders of the Punishment Department received the order from Elder Ying, they took out the Punishment Blade on their waists one after another as if fearing that Huang Hai would resist. Only after that did they begin to fly toward Huang Hai and encircle him.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the elders of the Orion Monastery that were standing beside Huang Hai had hurriedly moved back. It could be seen that before imminent catastrophe, they feared that they would be implicated by Huang Hai. Thus, they moved aside to avoid arousing suspicion.</p>
 <p>As for Huang Hai, he actually did not fear these elders of the Punishment Department. No matter what, he was, after all, a Half Martial Emperor. Even if these Punishment Department’s elders were to brandish their Punishment Blades, they would still be no match for him.</p>
 <p>Yet, at this moment, Huang Hai was not even trying to argue at all. He had tried to tamper with Chu Feng and attack him in the shadows only to be caught red-handed by a management elder. Thus, how could he possibly dare to refute? All he could do was stand where he was and helplessly await his apprehension by these Punishment Department’s elders.</p>
 <p>“Shameless, the elders of the Orion Monastery are truly shameless.”</p>
 <p>“To actually try to do something behind the scenes, this is simply the conduct of a sore loser. From the way I see it, Chu Feng doesn’t have to continue diving deep anymore. The truth is already clear, the Orion Monastery’s elders are the same as Yuan Qing, utterly shameless individuals.”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. How could these Orion Monastery’s elders possibly have the nerve to remain in our Cyanwood Mountain? It’s better for them to just kill themselves, as they’re unworthy of being our elders.”</p>
 <p>Huang Hai did not resist his arrest; it was as if he was admitting his guilt. Using this opportunity, Bai Ruochen and the other disciples began to loudly rain curses on Huang Hai and the other elders of the Orion Monastery to attack them.</p>
 <p>It was not only because Elder Wei was standing on Chu Feng’s side; it was mainly because the crowd was truly incapable of watching the despicable methods of the Orion Monastery continue on anymore. Thus, more and more people began to join Bai Ruochen’s camp and began to suppress the Orion Monastery.</p>
 <p>At this moment, in this region, curses for the Orion Monastery were being shouted nonstop. Their voices surpassed the sound of thunder; it was truly an intimidating sensation.</p>
 <p>Those people from the Orion Monastery, regardless of whether they might be elders or disciples, were all lowering their heads, not daring to utter a word. If they could, they truly wished to find a hole to hide in because they truly felt so utterly ashamed to face the crowd.</p>
 <p>“Huang Hai, as an elder of the Cyanwood Mountain, you should take it upon yourself to protect the disciples. Yet, for your own selfish desire, you actually secretly planned to harm a disciple. This is an enormous crime that you should be punished severely for. Is there anything that you wish to say?” asked Elder Ying of the Punishment Department in a strict and impartial manner.</p>
 <p>He was originally someone that Huang Hai had asked over to assist him. However, before the greater power of Elder Wei, he was helpless to do anything and could only publicly punish Huang Hai.</p>
 <p>Faced with Elder Ying’s questioning, Huang Hai did not have anything to say. Thus, he did not answer and instead displayed an appearance of one admitting guilt.</p>
 <p>“The punishment for your crimes will be decided later.” As he looked at Huang Hai who had an ashen expression, Elder Wei snorted coldly.</p>
 <p>Then, he turned to the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond and said to Chu Feng. “Chu Feng, you can continue. Go and prove yourself; make all those who have doubted you speechless.”</p>
 <p>“During this time, this old man here will make sure that nothing will bother you. If anyone dares to attack you from the shadows again, this old man will kill that person on the spot.”</p>
 <p>“Ffff~~~” Once Elder Wei’s words were spoken, a huge ruckus immediately burst forth from the crowd. From all directions, sounds of breathing in a mouthful of cold air could be heard.</p>
 <p>That was because the power behind Elder Wei’s words were truly enormous. A grand management elder, one of the Cyanwood Mountain’s pillars, was actually capable of saying these words in order to protect a disciple. How could one not be startled by this?</p>
 <p>Everyone knew now that Chu Feng was likely not someone that could be touched.</p>
 <p>“Thank you Elder.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng was still within the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. However, he was able to hear the words spoken by Elder Wei and had also seen everything that had happened.</p>
 <p>He had not expected that Elder Wei would be assisting him from the shadows. At this moment, he was extremely thankful to Elder Wei. At the same time, he was also extremely confident. After giving his thanks to Elder Wei, Chu Feng turned around and directly proceeded to dive into the deepest region of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.</p>
 <p>The Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond was extremely deep. Even an expert like Elder Wei was unable to keep their spirit power locked on Chu Feng the entire time. When Chu Feng entered the deepest region, nobody’s spirit power was able to continue any deeper. Thus, they lost all connection with Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>In an instant, the sky above the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond entered a strange quietness. It was as if everyone’s heartbeat had started to accelerate. Yet, not a single person said a word.</p>
 <p>They did not know whether Chu Feng might be able to succeed. However, as matters stood, other than the people from the Orion Monastery, the majority of the crowd wished that Chu Feng would succeed.</p>
 <p>That was because this would be an honor, one that would not only belong to Chu Feng but would instead belong to their entire Cyanwood Mountain. As long as they adored the Cyanwood Mountain, they would naturally desire this honor.</p>
 <p>Time slowly passed. The sky turned from white to dusk and then from dusk to black. Yet, not a single trace of Chu Feng’s activity could be seen from the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. This caused the crowd to start to grow anxious.</p>
 <p>After such a long time, the crowd did not know whether an accident might have happened to Chu Feng. After all, Chu Feng had entered a region that no one else was capable of entering. How frightening the energy at that region might be, and what sort of dangers might be there, were all things that none of them knew about.</p>
 <p>Finally, the sky grew completely dark. It was already very late into the night. On top of that, because black clouds covered the sky tonight, causing no star to be seen, this region was frighteningly dark.</p>
 <p>Although it was very late into the night now, not a single person had left. They all wished to see with their own eyes the scene of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle being triggered.</p>
 <p>“Why isn’t he out yet? It’s been so long already, something couldn’t possibly have happened to Chu Feng, right?”</p>
 <p>“I hope that wouldn’t be the case. Although our Cyanwood Mountain possesses numerous geniuses, Chu Feng is one that I admire a lot. In time, Chu Feng will definitely be able to reach the Cyanwood Succession List, and might even be on the top three of that list. A bold and courageous genius like him, I truly do not wish for him to fall from the sky[1.to die] in such a manner.”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Other than the people of the Orion Monastery, who would wish for a genius like him to fall? If Chu Feng truly dies because of this, it would be a great loss to our Cyanwood Mountain.”</p>
 <p>While the crowd was unwilling to leave, they inevitably began to worry about Chu Feng’s life and death, whether he had succeeded or failed. In a short while, sounds of discussion filled the sky. Merely, a majority of the discussions were about their worries for Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Of course, the people from the Orion Monastery were an exception.</p>
 <p>At this moment, their hearts were bursting with joy. Even though the reputation of their Orion Monastery had been ruined, they would naturally be extremely happy if the chief culprit, Chu Feng, were to die. At the very least, it would mean that this confrontation had been won by their Orion Monastery.</p>
 <p>“Rumble, rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at the moment when the majority of the people began to feel that Chu Feng might’ve failed and had died in the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond, rumbling noises began to sound from the depths of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. At the same time, there was a bit of a glimmer shining from the dark pond water.</p>
 <p>“Heavens, this is?”</p>
 <p>The glimmer grew brighter and brighter, clearer and clearer. At this moment, the crowd was finally able to see where exactly this light was coming from. It turned out that it was not the water that was shining. Instead, it was the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle that was shining.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle was no longer peaceful; it was blossoming with a dazzling light. At the same time, numerous lightning serpents were soaring up the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle. At this moment, those lightning serpents had already rushed out of the water’s surface, arriving above it.</p>
 <p>At an instant, the pitch black region turned bright as day. All of this was because of that Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle.</p>
 <p>At this moment, everyone present was displaying shocked expressions like chickens and stood as if petrified. If one was to say that they were shocked stunned, then it would be better to say that they were unable to say that they were not daring to believe that all of this was real.</p>
 <p>The Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle had been triggered!!!</p>
