 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1500 - Great Minds Think Alike</strong></p>
 <p>Dugu Xingfeng’s kick was no ordinary kick. It was also a warning.</p>
 <p>He was warning Crazed Killer Tuoba, as well as reminding Chu Feng who he was planning to support at this moment.</p>
 <p>“Lord Headmaster, I… I… I…” Crazed Killer Tuoba realized that the situation was bad. However, he did not run away. Instead, he ran over to Dugu Xingfeng and kneeled down before him.</p>
 <p>He knew that he could not escape. At the same time, he also knew that Dugu Xingfeng was enraged. Right now, the only thing that he could do was beg for forgiveness.</p>
 <p>“I have thought highly of you and nurtured you. Yet, you have taken me for a fool. Have you not let down all these years of nurture and education that I’ve given you?” Dugu Xingfeng’s eyes were like lightning. His body was giving off a great amount of intimidating might. He appeared like a completely different person from before. At this moment, his murderous intent was overflowing. He was extremely frightening.</p>
 <p>“Lord Headmaster, I did not take you as a fool. How could this subordinate possibly dare to do that? This subordinate would never dare to do that,” Crazed Killer Tuoba continued to beg for forgiveness.</p>
 <p>“You dare continue to lie? I saw all that happened earlier. Crazed Killer, you have truly disappointed me. I had forgiven all of your previous conduct because you have followed me for so long. Yet, today, for your own selfish desire, you actually wanted to kill our Cyanwood Mountain’s hope. That is not something that I can forgive.”</p>
 <p>After Dugu Xingfeng said those things, he pointed his finger at Crazed Killer Tuoba’s dantian. As a flash of light shone past and a ‘puu’ sound was heard, Crazed Killer Tuoba’s dantian had been penetrated.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Crazed Killer Tuoba was stunned. Feeling his seeping cultivation, he appeared as if he had been petrified.</p>
 <p>After a moment, Crazed Killer Tuoba loudly shouted in a very unconvinced manner. “Lord Headmaster, for that Chu Feng, you have actually disregarded our several hundred years of relationship and want to kill me, to cripple my cultivation?”</p>
 <p>“If I had disregarded our relationship of many years, I would have killed you many times already. Did you truly think that I did not know about all of your malicious deeds?”</p>
 <p>“In the past, all of your conduct and deeds were still within the range of my tolerance. However, Chu Feng is different. To me, he is akin to our Cyanwood Mountain’s hope. Yet, you dared to try to kill him. You have crossed my bottom line. As such, I must kill you.”</p>
 <p>Dugu Xingfeng’s expression was ice-cold and emotionless. It was as if he did not feel that what he was doing was wrong at all. In fact, the current Dugu Xingfeng did not have the slightest bit of sympathy for Crazed Killer Tuoba. It appeared as if no one would be able to stop his resolution to kill Crazed Killer Tuoba.</p>
 <p>“But, Lord Headmaster, last night, you… could it be that you have… deliberately?” Crazed Killer Tuoba recalled what Dugu Xingfeng had told him last night. Then, as he looked to Dugu Xingfeng’s current attitude toward him, he came to a sudden realization. He had realized that he had been deceived.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, I knew that you had the intention to kill Chu Feng. That’s why I deliberately said those things to you. I did so to increase your confidence and strengthen your assurance in killing Chu Feng.”</p>
 <p>“In other words, I deliberately placed bait before you. After all, if you did not attack Chu Feng, it would be unsuitable for me to take you, this hidden danger, out for him. However, if you were to attack him, I would have no apprehension in killing you,” Dugu Xingfeng did not conceal anything.</p>
 <p>“Hehe… ha… hahahaha…” Suddenly, Crazed Killer Tuoba started to laugh loudly. At this moment, he was not laughing like a madman. Instead, he was laughing like a fool. At this moment, he felt that he was truly a fool.</p>
 <p>“Dugu Xingfeng, you truly have a heart of stone! I have been loyal and devoted to you for so many years in vain! I followed you not long after I entered the Cyanwood Mountain, and continued to do so for hundreds of years! Yet you… for a little bastard, actually plan to eliminate me! Dugu Xingfeng, I have truly misjudged you!”</p>
 <p>Crazed Killer Tuoba roared in anger. He wanted the entire world to hear those words. He knew that he was doomed to die. Thus, he no longer had any concern for anything anymore and had decided to speak all that he wished to say.</p>
 <p>“Haha…” Hearing those words, Dugu Xingfeng laughed. His laughter was much colder than Crazed Killer Tuoba’s laughter.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>When Crazed Killer Tuoba saw Dugu Xingfeng laughing, his expression changed again. Even though he knew that he was doomed to die, his expression still changed upon seeing Dugu Xingfeng laughing so coldly. He was afraid.</p>
 <p>He was truly afraid of Dugu Xingfeng. His fear was coming from the bottom of his heart. Thus, even at this moment, he was still very afraid of Dugu Xingfeng.</p>
 <p>“I have given you a lot of chances. It is you that refused to cherish them. It is not I, Dugu Xingfeng, who is ruthless. Instead, it is you, Crazed Killer Tuoba, who deserves to be killed.”</p>
 <p>After Dugu Xingfeng said those words, he waved his sleeve. This wave of his sleeve turned Crazed Killer Tuoba to dust. He was completely dead. Although Crazed Killer Tuoba did not scream in pain before his death, he had sunk into incomparable despair.</p>
 <p>“The final thing I can do for him is to let him die without pain. Someone like him is unworthy of being buried in the Cyanwood Mountain. Thus, I decided to not leave him any remains.” When Dugu Xingfeng said those words, he closed his eyes, and a slightly unnatural expression appeared on his face.</p>
 <p>Both Chu Feng and Hong Qiang were able to understand that people were not plants, and could not be ruthless. Dugu Xingfeng was one such individual too. No matter how numerous the malicious deeds Crazed Killer Tuoba might have conducted, Dugu Xingfeng still had a deep sense of affection for him. After all, human hearts were not made out of steel.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng saw Dugu Xingfeng’s other side. As the headmaster of a major power, Dugu Xingfeng was an all-powerful individual. Very rarely would he ever show this side of himself, this side filled with sentimental feelings.</p>
 <p>However, it was precisely by seeing this side of Dugu Xingfeng that Chu Feng’s impression of him grew even better. At the same time, Chu Feng’s confidence and trust in this headmaster of his was even greater too.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Hong Qiang said, “It would seem that Headmaster Dugu, you have followed us since the very beginning,”</p>
 <p>“Heh… I am naturally able to anticipate the same thing as you have. You were worried about Chu Feng’s safety. Naturally, I would be even more worried about Chu Feng’s safety.”</p>
 <p>“In fact, I was unable to be a hundred percent certain that Crazed Killer Tuoba would definitely try to do harm to Chu Feng. If he didn’t do anything this time and did not do anything in the future, I would have given him the chance to continue living. However, alas,” Dugu Xingfeng smiled. After a moment of feeling sentimental, he seemed to be relieved.</p>
 <p>Although Dugu Xingfeng was still human, he evidently surpassed ordinary people, and his ability to adjust himself was very strong.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng walked over and asked, “Lord Headmaster, was that tracking imprint on Crazed Killer Tuoba’s dantian fake?” Chu Feng’s perception was very keen. He had discovered that the tracking imprint had not signalled when Crazed Killer Tuoba’s dantian had been pierced through by Dugu Xingfeng. This meant that it was most likely fake. Merely, Chu Feng did not expect for this tracking imprint to be camouflaged so well, to the point that even he and Hong Qiang could not tell that it was a fake.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, it was fake. It’s an interesting thing. Back then, I had seen two such things from a remnant. Although I knew that they were fake, it remained that they were items from remnants. Thus, Crazed Killer and White Ape both wanted to try them out. As such, I ended up putting one on both Crazed Killer and White Ape.”</p>
 <p>“I truly never expected that even though they were fake, they would appear to be that genuine. As expected of the items from remnants, the things left behind by experts. They are truly extraordinary,” Dugu Xingfeng said.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, it appeared to be extremely genuine,” Both Chu Feng and Hong Qiang expressed their agreement. That was because they had been deceived by Crazed Killer Tuoba because of that fake tracking imprint. The two of them had thought that tracking imprint was real.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Dugu Xingfeng said, “Two sirs, you can come out.”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng and Hong Qiang were startled. However, soon, the space not far from them started to wiggle. Then, two familiar figures appeared before their line of sight.</p>
 <p>These two people were no other than the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master and Miao Renlong.</p>
 <p>“Haha, Headmaster Dugu’s perception is as sharp as always. It is truly a waste for you to not concentrate on training in world spirit techniques,” The World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master said with a laugh.</p>
 <p>“I did not rely on world spirit techniques to know that the two of you were there. Instead, I had relied on a martial cultivator’s intuition,” Dugu Xingfeng said with a smile.</p>
 <p>The World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master and Miao Renlong looked to each other and then said together, “Intuition?”</p>
 <p>“As the saying goes, great minds think alike. I think that the three of us, and this Brother Hong Qiang, although we might not be great minds, we, nevertheless, should have thought of the same thing.”</p>
 <p>“Both Brother Hong Qiang and I were worried about Chu Feng’s safety. Naturally, the two of you should be worried too. It would not be suitable for you two to leave the Cyanwood Mountain like this. I felt that you would decide to protect Chu Feng from the shadows,” Dugu Xingfeng said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Haha…” At this moment, they all started laughing. That was because what Dugu Xingfeng said was correct.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng also had a smile on his face. He was feeling a great deal of warmth in his heart. With how well these four seniors were treating him, Chu Feng felt extremely grateful. However, even though he was feeling grateful, he did not mention it. After all, not all senses of gratefulness must be spoken. Chu Feng felt that sometimes, it would be better and also the most practical to repay one’s gratefulness with actions.</p>
