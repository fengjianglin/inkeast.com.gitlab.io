 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1307 - Pitiful People</strong></p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng’s gaze was fixed below him. He was unable to turn his eyes away because he was extremely excited. It had been a very long time since the last time he had been this excited.</p>
 <p>That was because he was currently standing in the night sky and looking down at the Discarded Bamboo Forest from above, and he had actually managed to obtain an unexpected harvest.</p>
 <p>The Discarded Bamboo Forest, this region of land that was akin to ruins, actually created a mysterious picture. That picture emerged from the ground, hiding itself within the Discarded Bamboo Forest. However, it remained that Chu Feng was able to see an enormous lotus flower. That enormous lotus flower was located at the depths of the Discarded Bamboo Forest.</p>
 <p>While ordinary people might not be able to see it, it was unable to conceal itself from Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Buzz.”</p>
 <p>Sensing that it was strange, Chu Feng began to use his Heaven’s Eyes to inspect it. Once Chu Feng activated his Heaven’s Eyes, his eyesight became extremely amazing; everything was now clearer to his eyes.</p>
 <p>The regions which the lotus flower covered were all emitting a faint golden light. The faint golden light emerged from the earth and extended all the way into the sky. Only when it reached a distance of a thousand meters did it gradually dissipate.</p>
 <p>“Natural Oddity, this sight is definitely because of a Natural Oddity.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, with a light this intense, it means that the Natural Oddity here is no small matter. It has most definitely been in development for a very long time and is about to mature.”</p>
 <p>“Haha, I truly never expected that I would be able to find a Natural Oddity at this place. I have truly not wasted my time journeying so far to come here. This is the will of Heaven, this is most definitely the will of Heaven. Even the heavens are helping me.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng was wild with joy and extremely excited. Natural Oddities were equivalent to cultivation resources. What was it that Chu Feng required the most? It was precisely cultivation resources.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, don’t be careless. This Natural Oddity is much stronger than the ones that you’ve run into before. It is likely that it has already matured. Although it is a Natural Oddity, it is extremely ferocious and not something that you can underestimate,” Eggy warned.</p>
 <p>“Rest assured, I am prepared.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng smiled lightly. With how powerful his current world spirit techniques were, even without Eggy’s warning, he knew that the Natural Oddity in this place was extremely powerful.</p>
 <p>It was so much so that he began to feel an enormous pressure the moment he determined that there was a Natural Oddity hidden in this area.</p>
 <p>The pressure was from the Natural Oddity. It seemed to be trying to tell Chu Feng to not try to do anything to it or else the consequences would be enormous.</p>
 <p>“A Natural Oddity from the Holy Land of Martialism, it is indeed out of the common run, heh…”</p>
 <p>“However, regardless of how powerful you might be, I am still going to get you. I am not going to give up on such a good opportunity, this opportunity bestowed to me by Heaven,” Chu Feng smiled lightly. After that, his body shifted and began to fly toward Li Xiang and the others’ residences.</p>
 <p>As he had discovered the Natural Oddity, Chu Feng would naturally not leave this place before obtaining it.</p>
 <p>However, this Natural Oddity was hidden deep in the ground. As Chu Feng could not create too much of a disturbance, he could only use his Heaven’s Eyes to find the lair of this Natural Oddity and then capture and refine it afterwards.</p>
 <p>As for refining it, that would require time to do. At the very least, it would be impossible to accomplish it in a short period of time. Thus, Chu Feng was planning to blend into the Discarded Bamboo Forest and make it so that the others would not become suspicious of his movements.</p>
 <p>“Junior brother Chu Feng, you’ve returned?”</p>
 <p>“How was it? Did you manage to find Lord Hong Qiang?” Seeing Chu Feng’s return, Li Xiang and the others were overjoyed. None of them appeared to wish for Chu Feng to leave their Discarded Bamboo Forest.</p>
 <p>“No,” Chu Feng smiled and shook his head. Although he did not manage to find Hong Qiang, he had managed to discover a Natural Oddity. Thus, he was no longer depressed. Instead, his mood was extremely good.</p>
 <p>Since his mood was good, Chu Feng became willing to help others. Thus, Chu Feng took a glance at the people present and said, “I am somewhat proficient in world spirit techniques for healing injuries. I can help you all restore your bodies.”</p>
 <p>“Eh… this…” However, after hearing what Chu Feng said, not only did the crippled Discarded Bamboo Forest’s disciples not display the slightest amount of joy, they were instead flustered and even appeared to be a bit frightened.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng thought that they did not believe in his world spirit techniques. Thus, he smiled and said, “Senior brothers and junior brothers, rest assured, I will numb your perceptions with medicines when doing the healing. Thus, you will not sense any sort of pain. I can guarantee you all that I will be able to restore your bodies and help you all be normal again without you feeling any bit of pain.”</p>
 <p>“Junior brother Chu Feng, come with me,” Right at this moment, Li Xiang spoke. As he spoke, he began to walk toward the bamboo forest.</p>
 <p>Seeing this, Chu Feng hurriedly followed over. He knew that Li Xiang wanted to tell him something.</p>
 <p>After stopping, Li Xiang said, “You should forget about it, they do not wish to restore their bodies.”</p>
 <p>“Why not?” Chu Feng was confused.</p>
 <p>“You do not know how they turned into their current states,” Li Xiang said.</p>
 <p>“How?” Chu Feng hurriedly asked. He realized that there must be something difficult for them to mention.</p>
 <p>“They were beaten to their current states,” Li Xiang replied.</p>
 <p>“I can tell that they were beaten; however, who were they beaten by?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Actually, they were beaten by none other than the disciples from the Iron Bamboo Forest and the Copper Bamboo Forest,” Li Xiang replied.</p>
 <p>“What? They were injured by their fellow disciples?” Hearing what Li Xiang said, Chu Feng was greatly surprised.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, they were injured by their fellow disciples. Furthermore, those disciples also said to them that they would not allow the disciples of the Discarded Bamboo Forest to heal their injuries. Otherwise, they would beat them up every time they saw them, and that each and every beating will be crueler than the previous one.”</p>
 <p>“That’s because they believe that the disciples of the Discarded Bamboo Forest can only live like trash, and do not even possess the qualifications to have normal bodies, and thus can only live as cripples,” Li Xiang said.</p>
 <p>“There’s actually such a thing? Are you saying that even the injuries on those children were done by them?”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was enraged. When he thought of the children with missing arms or broken legs, the anger in his heart began to burst out of his body uncontrollably.</p>
 <p>It was one thing for them to bully adults. Yet, they actually bullied even the children. This was truly too excessive.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, they were all beaten by them. They simply do not see us, disciples from the Discarded Bamboo Forest, as people. Regardless of whether it might be adults or children, they would beat them up with no regard or mercy,” Li Xiang said.</p>
 <p>“What nerves they have! They actually refuse to even let the children off, how can they even consider themselves to be people? Are you saying that with the way they acted, the elders actually don’t bother to do anything about it?” Chu Feng asked in a very resentful manner.</p>
 <p>Li Xiang sighed helplessly and said, “Lord Hong Qiang is in closed-door training all year round. Other than him, there is no other elder in our Discarded Bamboo Forest.”</p>
 <p>“Bother to care? Who could possibly care about their actions? The other bamboo forest’s elders? No, they are itching to enjoy the show, so how could they possibly care about us or do anything about it? To them, disciples from the Discarded Bamboo Forest are simply not people at all.”</p>
 <p>“This is truly too inhumane. With the way the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest is treating you all, why are you all still staying here?” Chu Feng was extremely confused.</p>
 <p>“The people here are all pitiful people. We possess neither talent nor background. It is so much so that we don’t even have families. If we are to leave, what can we possibly do? We would not be able to do anything.”</p>
 <p>“However, in the Discarded Bamboo Forest, although we are despised by others and receive their humiliation, we, at the very least, still have food to eat, a place to live, are able to obtain cultivation resources and learn mysterious techniques and martial skills,” Li Xiang said.</p>
 <p>“So that’s the case,” At this moment, Chu Feng finally understood. Although the people of the Discarded Bamboo Forest appeared to be pitiful, they were actually willingly accepting their status.</p>
 <p>As for the reason why they were despised, it was because they themselves had discarded their dignities. Thus, they could not blame others, only themselves.</p>
