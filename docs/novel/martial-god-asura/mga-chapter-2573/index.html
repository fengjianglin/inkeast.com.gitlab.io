 <p><strong>Chapter 2573 - What Are You?</strong></p>
 <p>“Truly animals!” Ying Mingchao shouted furiously.<br>　<br>“If my guess is correct, this should have been done by the Infant Soul Sect,” Chu Feng said.<br>　<br>Based on the information that he knew so far, the first thing that came to his mind was the Infant Soul Sect.</p>
 <p>“The Infant Soul Sect is still in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, still not eliminated?” Ying Mingchao asked.</p>
 <p>“No, they have hidden themselves extremely well the entire time. In fact, many people do not even know of the Infant Soul Sect anymore,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Damn it! What have those so-called righteous powers been doing all these years?!”</p>
 <p>Ying Mingchao revealed a furious expression. Then, he said to Chu Feng, “Actually, back then, I established Hero City precisely to eliminate that Infant Soul Sect. Merely, I never expected to be plotted against by the Kong Heavenly Clan and Zhou Heavenly Clan not long afterward.”<br>　<br>“I had thought that the Infant Soul Sect would’ve already been wiped out after all these years have passed. Never did I expect that even though the four tier one powers are all still here, not a single one of them has bothered to do the righteous thing.”</p>
 <p>“Senior, do you not think that you should accomplish your aspiration that you were unable to accomplish back then?” Chu Feng suddenly asked.</p>
 <p>After seeing the scene before them, Chu Feng felt even more firmly that the Infant Soul Sect should be eliminated immediately.</p>
 <p>Although Chu Feng wanted to personally eliminate the Infant Soul Sect, as it was a mission that his father had entrusted him with, he could not find any reason to allow the Infant Soul Sect to continue to exist, to continue to sin.</p>
 <p>Thus, even if he was unable to accomplish the task entrusted to him by his father, Chu Feng still hoped that the Infant Soul Sect would be eliminated as soon as possible, so as to prevent other innocent infants from suffering such a calamity.</p>
 <p>While he was able to tolerate casualties of innocents caused by disputes between martial cultivators, he was unable to tolerate miserably killing innocent children for the sake of increasing one’s cultivation.</p>
 <p>This was something that the entire world of martial cultivation should not tolerate.</p>
 <p>As of now, Ying Mingchao was the person with the greatest capability in being able to eliminate the Infant Soul Sect. Thus, Chu Feng wanted to join hands with Ying Mingchao. He wanted to borrow Ying Mingchao’s strength to eradicate the Infant Soul Sect, this root of countless evil in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p>
 <p>After hearing what Chu Feng said, Ying Mingchao closed his eyes and started to take deep breaths.</p>
 <p>It was only after a long time that he gradually calmed himself. When he opened his eyes again, his gaze was no longer sunken. Instead, it was brimming with light.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Ying Mingchao removed the Cosmos Sack on his waist and tossed it to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“I’ve said it before. As long as you managed to free me, I would repay you for your help. Those are all yours,” Ying Mingchao said.</p>
 <p>“Senior, there’s no need for this. I did not save you for the sake of obtaining reciprocation from you. It was merely that since I accepted your request, I must abide by it,” Chu Feng planned to hand the Cosmos Sack back to Ying Mingchao.</p>
 <p>“If you want me to eliminate the Infact Soul Sect, you’ll have to accept it,” Ying Mingchao said.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was startled upon hearing those words. Then, he smiled and shook his head, “Senior, it seems that you have given me a reason that I cannot refuse.”</p>
 <p>“In that case, just accept it. Accept it, and then we can re-establish Hero City.”</p>
 <p>“I believe that it should be impossible for all of my brothers from back then to have been killed by the Kong and Zhou Heavenly Clans. They must still be alive in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. I am going to recall them.”</p>
 <p>“This time around, I am not going to wait. I will unite all of the powers in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm to eliminate that Infant Soul Sect as quickly as possible,” Ying Mingchao said.</p>
 <p>“Very well, I will accompany you in this,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>After that, Ying Mingchao returned to the former site of Hero City.</p>
 <p>As they had anticipated, the city had already been razed to the ground. The formerly scenic Hero City had turned into a barren land.</p>
 <p>There was not a single trance of human activity in the surrounding thousands of miles. No one dared to appear there. They were afraid that the people from the Kong and Zhou Heavenly Clan would mistake them to be remnants from Hero City and slaughter them.</p>
 <p>However, both Ying Mingchao and Chu Feng were world spiritists.</p>
 <p>With their abilities, rebuilding a city was a very simple task.</p>
 <p>In accordance with his memories, Ying Mingchao reconstructed Hero City.</p>
 <p>However, compared to the original Hero City, a glorious palace was added to the main city.</p>
 <p>That glorious palace was personally constructed by Ying Mingchao for Chu Feng to use.</p>
 <p>Although Chu Feng had mentioned to him that he did not plan to join Hero City, Ying Mingchao did not mind.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng did not have to join Hero City. However, the gates to Hero City would forever be open to Chu Feng. Hero City would forever be a home to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>One thing worthy of mentioning was that not long after Hero City was reconstructed, people started coming to Hero City.</p>
 <p>Some of them were remnants that had escaped the destruction of the Hero City back then. Others were people unrelated to Hero City who came just to enjoy the excitement.</p>
 <p>From inquiring those people, Chu Feng came to know that they had all come upon hearing the news that Ying Mingchao was still alive.</p>
 <p>Not only did they know that Ying Mingchao was plotted against by the Kong Heavenly Clan and Zhou Heavenly Clan over a thousand years ago, they also knew that Ying Mingchao had completely wiped out the Kong Heavenly Clan.</p>
 <p>All those rumors were beneficial to Ying Mingchao.</p>
 <p>Not only did they return his innocence that was stained for over a thousand years, the rumors stated that Ying Mingchao was forced to eliminate the Kong Heavenly Clan.</p>
 <p>As for the person who was spreading the rumor, it was a person that held an extremely esteemed status in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm -- Grandmaster Prophet.</p>
 <p>As Grandmaster Prophet was the one spreading the rumors, everyone believed him.</p>
 <p>“That Grandmaster Prophet truly knows how to flatter someone.”</p>
 <p>“Seeing that both the Kong Heavenly Clan and Zhou Heavenly Clan are done for, he immediately started hugging Ying Mingchao’s thighs,” Her Lady Queen said.</p>
 <p>“Perhaps it might truly be as he said, and he did what he did because of hidden difficulties?”</p>
 <p>When mentioning Grandmaster Prophet, Chu Feng involuntarily recalled the prophecy that he spoke of.</p>
 <p>When Chu Feng recalled the scene in Grandmaster Prophet’s Prophecy Crystal Ball, he felt a slight familiarity.</p>
 <p>Over the days, Chu Feng had been pondering the entire time. In the end, he came to a conclusion that the frightening aura he felt from the Prophecy Crystal Ball greatly resembled that of the Evil God Sword.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng felt slightly afraid. He feared that the person who would ultimately destroy the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm would be him. Even if he did not intend it, it remained that the Evil God Sword was his possession.</p>
 <p>After that, Chu Feng increasingly felt that the power of the Evil God Sword must be used cautiously. Else, he might bring about an irreversible situation.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>That said, the current situation was better than Chu Feng had anticipated.</p>
 <p>Ying Mingchao’s reputation was extremely good.</p>
 <p>Even though he had disappeared for over a thousand years, and had massacred the entire Kong Heavenly Clan, not many people blamed him. On the contrary, they chose to believe him. They all felt that he had been forced.</p>
 <p>For people to trust a person this much, Chu Feng felt that this was most definitely some sort of charisma.</p>
 <p>After that, more and more former members of Hero City began to return. There were also many newcomers joining Hero City out of admiration for Ying Mingchao.</p>
 <p>Moreover, headmasters from various powers began to arrive at Hero City and started to request to become allies with the Hero City.</p>
 <p>Actually, they all had only one purpose in mind. That was, they wanted to hug Ying Mingchao’s thighs.</p>
 <p>More and more people gathered in Hero City. The people capable of helping Ying Mingchao were also increasing nonstop. Gradually, Chu Feng started to have time for leisure.</p>
 <p>With leisure time, Chu Feng did not choose to appreciate the achievements of those days. Instead, he chose to leave Hero City.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because he still had an important matter that he must attend to. That was, he needed to bring Wang Qiang to Hero City.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng arrived at Mount Cloud Crane. The spirit formation around Mount Cloud Crane had been removed. Mount Cloud Crane had become a place that anyone could enter.</p>
 <p>That said, while there were still people coming to visit Mount Cloud Crane out of admiration, no one dared to set foot onto it. They only dared to linger around outside Mount Cloud Crane.</p>
 <p>They were all people that had come to seek the Golden Crane True Immortal. However, they were also afraid of the Golden Crane True Immortal. Thus, none of them dared to intrude upon Mount Cloud Crane without the Golden Crane True Immortal’s permission.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng entered Mount Cloud Crane. Then, going according to the directions given to him by the Golden Crane True Immortal, he soon discovered Wang Qiang in a cave.</p>
 <p>Actually, one could not see Wang Qiang in the cave. There was only a single stone in that cave.</p>
 <p>That stone was about twice the size of an ordinary coffin. However, it was not a coffin, but rather an oval-shaped rock.</p>
 <p>Judging from its outward appearance, the rock did not appear to be special. It just looked like an ordinary mountain stone. At the very most, it was relatively more smooth than ordinary rocks.</p>
 <p>However, when Chu Feng held the title plate given to him by the Golden Crane True Immortal, the title plate started to shine, and that rock also started shining.</p>
 <p>The originally light yellow rock started turning transparent and dazzling like a crystal.</p>
 <p>When that rock turned transparent, Chu Feng was able to see Wang Qiang.</p>
 <p>Wang Qiang was lying in the center of that rock. At that moment, Wang Qiang had become extremely small. His size was only that of a pinkie finger.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng knew that it was not Wang Qiang who had become small, but rather that stone contained an isolated space.</p>
 <p>It was merely that Wang Qiang appeared to be very small inside of that isolated space.</p>
 <p>Beside Wang Qiang sat the four mysterious yet powerful ferocious beasts.</p>
 <p>Merely, compared to before, they seemed to be in better harmony with one another. Furthermore and most importantly, while holding the title plate in his hand, Chu Feng was able to feel Wang Qiang’s current aura from the title plate.</p>
 <p>Rank nine Martial Ancestor. Wang Qiang’s current cultivation was actually that of a rank nine Martial Ancestor, the same as Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Seeing Wang Qiang within the stone, Chu Feng said with a light smile on his face, “Brother, exactly what are you?”</p>
 <p>He was greatly looking forward to Wang Qiang waking up. He looked forward to finding out what sort of strength Wang Qiang would have.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng firmly believed that Wang Qiang would become many times stronger than before upon awakening.</p>
 <p>After all, the power within Wang Qiang had awakened.</p>
