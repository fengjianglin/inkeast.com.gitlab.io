 <p><strong> Chapter 2389 - Breaking Out The Formation</strong></p>
 <p>Seeing the Evil God Sword in Chu Feng’s hand, Xue Ji originally had a gaze filled with contempt. However, when she saw Chu Feng’s ferocious and murderous-looking appearance and his gaze that viewed death with equanimity, her gaze grew serious.</p>
 <p>“For the sake of that little girl, it seems that you truly are willing to part with everything.”</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>After Xue Ji finished saying those words, she spread open her hand and the crimson sword she held in her hand turned into crimson rays of light that dispersed and entered Xue Ji’s palm.</p>
 <p>This scene caused Chu Feng’s gaze to change.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, Xue Ji’s weapon was extraordinary. It was most definitely not a normal weapon. Rather, it appeared more like a special sort of ability.</p>
 <p>“I was merely joking with you earlier. Being here, I am alone and impoverished. With great difficulty, I came across someone from my hometown. As such, how could she and I try to massacre one another?” Xue Ji said with a beaming smile.</p>
 <p>“Are you planning to honor your promise?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“I can honor my promise. However, I have a condition,” Xue Ji said.</p>
 <p>“Speak away,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Although I do not know how you got in here, since you were able to get in, this means that you’ll be able to get out. Later on… you must bring me away from this damned place,” Xue Ji said.</p>
 <p>“You have already offended the people from the guardian clan for the sake of saving me earlier. Thus, it is only natural that I bring you out. There’s no problem with that,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Good. Since that’s the case, you can bring that little girl out,” Xue Ji said.</p>
 <p>Right after Xue Ji finished saying those words, Her Lady Queen walked out from the world spirit space.</p>
 <p>“You actually dared to use me to threaten Chu Feng. I will settle our debt today sooner or later,” Her Lady Queen stared at Xue Ji with her gaze filled with grievance.</p>
 <p>“I’ll wait for you,” Xue Ji said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Xue Ji’s expression changed. She spread open her arms and closed her eyes.</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~”</p>
 <p>In an instant, violent wind surged forth. As Xue Ji’s long hair fluttered, black gaseous flames began to emit from her body. Like a magnificent army of thousands of men and horses, the black gaseous flames surged toward the sea of bones.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Her Lady Queen also spread open her arms and closed her beautiful eyes.</p>
 <p>As Her Lady Queen’s short black skirt and long black hair fluttered in the wind, the dark black gaseous flames specific to Asura World Spirits was also overflowing out of Her Lady Queen’s body and rushing toward the sea of bones.</p>
 <p>The two streams of dark black gaseous flames were extremely fast. Even though the sea of bones was limitless and covered the ground to the horizon, the black gaseous flames emitted by Xue Ji and Her Lady Queen soon covered the entire sea of bones.</p>
 <p>The next moment, an enormous attractive force was emitted by the dark black gaseous flames as they began to return to Xue Ji and Her Lady Queen’s bodies.</p>
 <p>Although it was something invisible to the naked eye, Chu Feng knew that the source energies originally contained in the sea of bones were currently being refined by Xue Ji and Her Lady Queen in an unending stream.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Xue Ji and Her Lady Queen were like two plunderers scrambling over the treasures of this place.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he had held onto the Evil God Sword the entire time. The reason for that was because he truly did not trust Xue Ji. For the sake of preventing Xue Ji from going against her word, he must remain alert.</p>
 <p>As Chu Feng held onto the Evil God Sword for a long period of time, Chu Feng began to feel the boundless power contained in the Evil God Sword even more.</p>
 <p>That power was very restless in nature. It was like an army eager to battle. As long as Chu Feng gave the order, they would immediately unleash a slaughter.</p>
 <p>Merely, not only did Chu Feng manage to sense how strong that power was, he also managed to sense dense killing intent from it. That killing intent was truly too frightening. From the Nine Provinces Continent to the Eastern Sea Region to the Holy Land of Martialism and then the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, Chu Feng had encountered many fiendish and merciless beings.</p>
 <p>However, the killing intent that those people possessed were all nothing comparable to the killing intent within the Evil God Sword Chu Feng held in his hand.</p>
 <p>The killing intent contained in the Evil God Sword was pure killing intent that did not contain the slightest bit of leniency.</p>
 <p>“Demon Armament, it would seem that you are truly a Demon Armament,” Unable to contain himself, Chu Feng gasped. He became even more certain that the Evil God Sword was a double-edged sword. While Chu Feng might have obtained another method of confronting his enemies with the Evil God Sword, the Evil God Sword also served as a hidden danger.</p>
 <p>Actually, Chu Feng was also a bit scared. He was afraid that he would not be able to control the Evil God Sword.</p>
 <p>However, at the same time, Chu Feng was also filled with expectations. He was never one to be afraid of a challenge. Thus, Chu Feng was looking forward to the day when he would be able to conquer the Evil God Sword.</p>
 <p>Perhaps only an extraordinary Demon Armament like the Evil God Sword would suit an actual expert.</p>
 <p>“Silly little girl, it would seem that I’ve underestimated you,” Right at that moment, Xue Ji’s voice was suddenly heard.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng looked toward the two girls, and discovered that they had managed to completely refine all of the source energies contained in the sea of flames in a short period of time.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Xue Ji’s cultivation had increased. She was no longer a rank nine Half Martial Ancestor, and had instead become a rank one Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>As for Her Lady Queen, she had also obtained a major harvest. From her original cultivation of rank seven Half Martial Ancestor, she was now a rank nine Half Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>Rank nine Half Martial Ancestor. For Chu Feng, he would have to utilize the power of both his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings in order to obtain a cultivation of rank nine Half Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>However, for Her Lady Queen, her actual cultivation was that of a rank nine Half Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>In the Half Martial Ancestor realm, Chu Feng only possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation.</p>
 <p>As for Her Lady Queen, she possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation.</p>
 <p>In other words, Her Lady Queen was currently stronger than Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Don’t think that just because my cultivation is weaker than yours that I will be slower than you in refining source energies. Although we are both Asura World Spirits, this Queen’s bloodline is far superior to yours,” After Her Lady Queen finished saying those words, she did not concern herself with Xue Ji’s reaction, and directly returned to Chu Feng’s world spirit space.</p>
 <p>As for Xue Ji, she did not refute Her Lady Queen. She merely smiled. No one knew exactly what she was thinking about and what her state of mind was.</p>
 <p>This woman was extremely good at concealing everything. Even someone with extremely strong perception like Chu Feng was unable to see through her.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. It’s time to leave this place,” Xue Ji said to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Didn’t you say that people above Half Martial Ancestor would be under restrictions in the Hundred Refinements Stage? Why are you fine now?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“That’s because I broke through to the Martial Ancestor realm in here. Thus, even though I am a Martial Ancestor now, the Hundred Refinements Stage is unable to put restrictions on me,” After Xue Ji finished saying those words, she passed through the spirit formation space and flew outward.</p>
 <p>“This Hundred Refinements Stage’s spirit formation is actually this complicated. I wonder, exactly which senior from our Chu Heavenly Clan set it up?”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng gasped with admiration. Merely by looking at the Hundred Refinements Stage, he was able to imagine that there must be someone with extremely powerful world spirit techniques in the Chu Heavenly Clan.</p>
 <p>The Chu Heavenly Clan was most definitely not only a clan proficient in martial techniques, but also a clan with expert world spiritists.</p>
 <p>With merely that, it once again displayed how powerful the Chu Heavenly Clan was.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Feng’s body shifted. He too began to fly outward.</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng exited the burial grounds, he used his world spirit techniques to completely seal the entrance shut.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. Let’s leave this place,” Chu Feng said to Xue Ji.</p>
 <p>“How do you plan on leaving?” Xue Ji asked.</p>
 <p>“Just follow me,” As Chu Feng spoke, he soared into the sky and began to fly toward the defensive barrier above the Hundred Refinements Stage.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Chu Feng was planning to directly leave through the sky, Xue Ji said, “You couldn’t possibly be planning to directly destroy that spirit formation, right? Don’t be foolish, that spirit formation is not that easily destroyed. This is especially true for the one overhead, it is extremely powerful.”</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng did not bother with Xue Ji. Instead, he continued flying upward.</p>
 <p>When Chu Feng approached the spirit formation, he took out a key and tossed it out toward the spirit formation. After the key collided with the spirit formation, a passage actually appeared in the impregnable spirit formation.</p>
 <p>“This guy!!!” Seeing this scene, even Xue Ji revealed an astonished expression.</p>
