 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1069 - Expectation, Desire</strong></p>
 <p>“No.”</p>
 <p>Faced with Wang Wei’s question, Chu Feng shook his head. He did not tell her the truth. It was not that he wanted to deliberately hide it from her, it was instead because he did not want to hurt her self-esteem.</p>
 <p>Sometimes, there was truly an enormous gap between talents. For example, not everyone possessed Chu Feng’s sensitivity.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng knew that the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond that he sensed ought to be somewhat intrinsically different from the ones that Wang Wei and the others sensed. Chu Feng had sensed the natural energies with his own strength whereas Wang Wei and the others had used the assistance of foreign materials, the medicinal pellets, in order to sense the natural energies. Moreover, what she had sensed was likely not as profound and clear as what Chu Feng sensed.</p>
 <p>Afterwards, Chu Feng also pretended that he didn’t sense anything and swallowed a portion of the medicinal pellets. Although he felt a slight change, it was not a great effect.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng felt that these medicinal pellets were likely capable of temporarily increasing one’s sensitivity so that they could sense the things within the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond in order to assist them in training.</p>
 <p>As for the reason why the effect of these medicinal pellets were very tiny for Chu Feng, it most likely meant that Chu Feng’s sensitivity was already extremely high and did not need these medicinal pellets to increase his sensitivity. Even if he used them, he would not be able to obtain much of a result from them.</p>
 <p>“My medicinal pellets are gone?! What’s going on?! I swear I placed them in my Cosmos Sack, how come I can’t find them anymore?!”</p>
 <p>“Aiya, my medicinal pellets are gone too!”</p>
 <p>“Are you kidding?! Mine are also gone! Who took my medicinal pellets?!”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, many people in the surrounding began to shout in panic. Upon checking, Chu Feng and the others discovered that there were at least three hundred individuals who had lost their medicinal pellets. Moreover, all of them had a single common ground - they were all disciples of the Orion Monastery. Furthermore, the majority of them were the people who had surrounded Chu Feng and were trying to oppress him earlier.</p>
 <p>“Heh…”</p>
 <p>At this moment, the corners of Chu Feng’s lips were slightly raised. That was because he recalled the close to a thousand medicinal pellets given to him by the little girl and seemed to have realized something.</p>
 <p>Compared to Chu Feng, the other disciples of the Southern Cyanwood Forest were unable to contain themselves and started laughing. Moreover, their laughter was extremely vile. Fearing that their vile laughter would be discovered by the people of the Orion Monastery but still being unable to contain themselves, the disciples of the Southern Cyanwood Forest started using their hands to cover their mouths. However, this only made them appear to be even more vile.</p>
 <p>Actually, this couldn’t be blamed on them. That was because even Elder Gongsun, a senior who had lived for over two hundred years, was laughing at this moment.</p>
 <p>As for the reason why they were laughing so happily, it was because they all felt that karma had hit those people from the Orion Monastery.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. Let’s not stay in this place anymore. Let’s go to the center of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. That is the entrance to the deepest region of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond and also the place with the densest concentration of energies. If you all want to train, that place would be the best place for it.” Suddenly, Elder Gongsun called to the attention of the disciples.</p>
 <p>After hearing what Elder Gongsun said, Chu Feng and the others discovered that, at this moment, other than them and the disciples of the Orion Monastery who had lost their medicinal pellets, the majority of the crowd were proceeding towards the center of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.</p>
 <p>Seeing this, Chu Feng and the others did not hesitate and began to follow Elder Gongsun toward the center with rapid speed.</p>
 <p>Everyone was walking through the water. No one chose to fly. That was because there were special energies in the Immortal Pond. Those energies were things that they wanted, so how could they possibly be willing to leave the Immortal Pond and fly?</p>
 <p>The further they went, Chu Feng discovered that the water became deeper and deeper. Even though the water was extremely clear, the bottom of the pond started to become unable to be seen.</p>
 <p>After they arrived at the center region, when they looked downward, what they saw was actually pitch black. It appeared as if what was below them was a bottomless pit. A single glance at that pit would give one shivers.</p>
 <p>However, even though this was the case, people were still swimming toward the center region. None of them dove into the water, they were merely swimming and floating on the surface of the water.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng and the others had also arrived at this place. Although they were still moving about in the water, they were also able to sense that the special energies in this region was many times denser.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng was also able to sense that the dense energies were surging forth from below. In other words, the dense energies originated from the bottomless pit. That was also the so-called deepest region of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.</p>
 <p>At the moment when everyone was basked in the wondrous sensation brought forth by the center of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond, Chu Feng was staring at the colossal Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle that spread from the depths of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond and extended all the way into the boundless white mist above.</p>
 <p>From where he was before, this Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle really did appear like a needle. However, after seeing it up close, calling it a ‘needle’ was truly unbefitting.</p>
 <p>This Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle was enormous. Its diameter was over a hundred meters. It was definitely not something that mortals could create. Even though Chu Feng was unable to use his spirit power, but just by merely looking at it with his eyes, he was able to tell that this Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle was an indestructible item.</p>
 <p>Moreover, the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle was filled with carvings of symbols and runes. They were things that even Chu Feng was unable to decipher. Likely, they were carved onto the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle during the Ancient Era.</p>
 <p>“Rumble~~”</p>
 <p>Not long after the people began to train in the center of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond, faint rumbles sounded from the horizon at the other side of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. Raising their heads to see, Chu Feng and the others discovered that a lotus flower-like item was flying toward them.</p>
 <p>Although the appearance of this item was like a lotus, its size was very big. To be exact, it appeared more like a special kind of warship.</p>
 <p>Roughly six hundred Ancient Era’s Elves were standing on top of the lotus flower warship. Like the other Ancient Era’s Elves, they were all wearing green plant cloaks. It was simply impossible for one to see their facial appearance, determine their gender or their strength.</p>
 <p>However, there were two figures standing at the front most region of the warship. Moreover, one of the two figures actually spoke with an aged yet vigorous voice.</p>
 <p>“The location you’re all in right now is the entrance to the depths of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. In less than an hour, the power within the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond’s depths would start to flow out. At that time, the location that you’re all in now would be the location the densest energy in the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. However, it would also be the most dangerous location.”</p>
 <p>“If you wish to live, then it’s best for you to leave this place as quickly as possible. However, if there are any among you that wish to challenge the power of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond in order to obtain an even better harvest, then continue to stay here.”</p>
 <p>“However, do not blame me for not warning you all that the outflow of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond’s power is extremely fierce. In the past, there had been people who were unable to withstand it and ended up dying on the spot. Thus, I advise you all to assess your own capabilities and act accordingly. You must definitely not lose your lives for the sake of trying to act brave for an instant.”</p>
 <p>Once that Ancient Era’s Elf said those words, the majority of the people began to frantically swim away from the center of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. They were trying to leave this region as quickly as possible. In an instant, at this region that previously had close to four thousand people, only several hundred people remained.</p>
 <p>“Junior brother Chu Feng, are you truly planning to challenge the deepest region of this Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond?” Seeing that Chu Feng did not have the slightest intention to leave, Wang Wei asked worriedly.</p>
 <p>“Since I’ve come here, if I do not give it a try, I would regret it afterwards.” Chu Feng said with a smile on his face. However, one could tell his determination.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, borrowing the words said by that Ancient Era’s Elf, you must assess your capabilities and act accordingly; you must definitely not try to act brave.” Seeing Chu Feng’s determination, Elder Gongsun advised.</p>
 <p>“Elder, please rest assured, this Chu Feng knows about how to act appropriately.” Said Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Mn.” Seeing Chu Feng’s confident appearance, Elder Gongsun smiled and nodded. He then turned to Wang Wei and the others, waved his hand and said, “Let’s go. While Chu Feng could try to challenge this place, I’m afraid you all would not be able to.”</p>
 <p>After saying those, Elder Gongsun began to swim towards the outer region. As even Elder Gongsun had said such a thing, it was naturally unbefitting for Wang Wei and the others to continue to stay here. After taking another glance at Chu Feng, they also began to swim away.</p>
 <p>In their hearts, they knew very well. It was exactly as Elder Gongsun had said, while Chu Feng was able to challenge this place, they were incapable. Thus, not a single one of them dared to continue to stay here and had placed all of their hopes onto Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Although they were a bit worried, they also hoped that Chu Feng would be able to withstand the pressure of this place and win honor for the Southern Cyanwood Forest.</p>
 <p>That was because the current Chu Feng was already no longer merely Sikong Zhaixing’s hope; instead, he had become the hope of everyone in the Southern Cyanwood Forest.</p>
