 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason for that was because the sensations he felt and everything that occurred when he saw his father were so very unrealistic. It was truly like a dream, and most definitely not real.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was a dream. That was most definitely a dream. Chu Feng was determined that it was a dream.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You also dreamed it? You’re saying that you had the same dream as me?” Her Lady Queen was very shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s right, it was the same dream,” Chu Feng said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re kidding. That’s simply too miraculous,” Her Lady Queen grew even more astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Miraculous. Sure enough, this matter was very miraculous. That was the reason why Chu Feng and Her Lady Queen were so astonished and feeling such disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Had it been before, Chu Feng would definitely ponder something like this deeply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Merely, Chu Feng did not have the heart to do so right just then. The reason being, he was very worried. He was worried that the Evil God Sword had done some sort of irreversible thing during the time when his body was occupied by the Evil God Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, to Chu Feng’s joy, after he continued to travel for some time, the ground below was no longer filled with cracks. Instead, living things could be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was able to see emerald-green grass and dark green mountains, as well as waterfalls and streams. Upon seeing those, the unease in Chu Feng’s heart immediately lessened greatly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This meant that even though the Evil God Sword had unleashed massive destruction, the range of the destruction was limited. The entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm had not experienced heavy destruction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This increased the possibility that his friends would be alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Afterward, Chu Feng discovered an Ancient Era’s Teleportation Formation. Using that teleportation formation, Chu Feng was teleported to the vicinity of Hero City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sea of people were gathered outside Hero City. Many of them were kneeling on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Those people were practically all people that had experienced the calamity that day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To those people, the gates of Hero City remained shut.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was understandable too. After all, Hero City had witnessed the true appearances of these people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Likely, the people from Hero City would never show any consideration for those people in the future. Furthermore, they would most definitely not allow them to join Hero City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That said, although the fact that many people were still alive indicated that the Evil God Sword had not unleashed a massacre, Chu Feng’s worry was still not completely eliminated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason for that was because he did not sense Ying Mingchao and the others’ auras upon entering Hero City. He only managed to sense Grandmaster Pocket’s aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the sake of finding out what had happened, Chu Feng decided to go and find Grandmaster Pocket.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Almsgiver Chu Feng, is it really you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Grandmaster Pocket was extremely emotional upon seeing Chu Feng. He, who had always been a calm individual, actually moved toward Chu Feng and started to touch him all over. It was as if he did not dare to believe that it really was Chu Feng who stood before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Grandmaster, it’s me. I’m alright now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Feng smiled faintly. He was emotionally moved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could tell that Grandmaster Pocket was truly worried for him. Otherwise, he would not have reacted in such a manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, Chu Feng came to find out what had happened afterwards from Grandmaster Pocket.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That day, after Chu Feng had been devoured by the Evil God Sword, the calamity came to an end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Ying Mingchao, Wang Qiang and the others were all extremely worried for Chu Feng’s safety. Thus, they did not return to Hero City. Instead, they separated with one another and began to search for Chu Feng separately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, they had all left methods to communicate with one another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, through those methods, Grandmaster Pocket conveyed the news of Chu Feng’s return to Ying Mingchao, Wang Qiang and the others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After some days passed, Ying Mingchao, Wang Qiang and the others that had received news of Chu Feng’s return, all returned to Hero City in succession.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without any exception, they were all shocked and pleasantly surprised upon seeing that Chu Feng was truly safe and sound. The person that reacted in the most exaggerated manner was Wang Qiang. Not only was Wang Qiang so emotional that his speech grew unintelligible, but he even started to weep bitter tears, and rubbed his snot and tears all over Chu Feng’s clothes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Chu Feng did not blame Wang Qiang for his reaction. Instead, he was speechlessly moved by him. It could be seen from Wang Qiang’s reaction that Wang Qiang truly cared about him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After verifying that Chu Feng was safe and sound, the crowd began to ask Chu Feng about where he went, and what happened after his body was devoured by the Evil God Sword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Chu Feng, he answered that he was not sure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Feng was not lying. He was truly unsure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regardless, the crowd was feeling very happy, overjoyed even. After all, Chu Feng, the person that they were worried about the most, had safely returned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After what happened, Chu Feng’s status in their hearts had changed completely. Chu Feng was no longer an ordinary genius. Instead, he was a hero now. He was a great hero who had saved them from a demon’s clutches.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Feng was also feeling very happy. It was not because the crowd viewed him as a hero. Rather, it was because the people that he cared about were all safe and sound.</span></p>

It was not extremely extravagant in appearance. However, it appeared very imposing. A solemn and dignified sensation filled the entire palace hall.</span></p>

Her hair was so long that it reached down to her heels. Perhaps it was because she took great care of her hair, but her hair was emitting a faint shine under the sunshine. It was quite eye-catching.&nbsp;</span></p>

He was over two meters tall, and had a very robust build. There were two scars visible on his face. They seemed to be scars caused by a bladed weapon. Those scars looked very fierce, and made the man look somewhat scary.</span></p>

This was especially true just then, as that man had an apologetic smile on his face. That smile made him even more amiable and approachable.&nbsp;</span></p>

They immediately half kneeled onto the ground and bowed respectfully, “We pay our respect to Lord Vice Hall Master.”</span></p>

His name is Chu Xuanzhengfa. It means Chu Xuan(carry out the law). The Xuan is the same Xuan as Chu Feng’s father’s Chu Xuanyuan’s Xuan.
