 <p><strong>Chapter 2697 - Starfall Holy Daughter</strong></p>
 <p>Through the map, Chu Feng was able to tell that the Starfall Holy Land controlled an extremely large territory.</p>
 <p>Currently, Chu Feng and Song Xi were both within a territory controlled by the Starfall Holy Land. They were not actually at the Starfall Holy Land itself.</p>
 <p>The location that they were at was actually still very far away from the actual Starfall Holy Land. However… it was very close to the Immortal Armament Villa.</p>
 <p>“Do you wish to go and have a look at the Starfall Holy Land?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Since we’ve already come here, I would naturally want to tour the Starfall Holy Land. Reportedly, the Starfall Holy Land is akin to a paradise on earth,” Song Xi said with an expression of anticipation.</p>
 <p>“You’re saying that the Starfall Holy Land is even more beautiful than this?” Chu Feng said as he swept his gaze around.</p>
 <p>The scenery was extremely beautiful. The plants and trees were lush, the sky was blue and the clouds were white. Rarely-seen flowers and plants covered the ground, emitting fascinating aromas.</p>
 <p>This was especially true for a mountain range in the near distance. It was extremely fascinating.</p>
 <p>The peak of that mountain range reached the sky itself, and pierced through the clouds.</p>
 <p>Many silvery-white waterfalls were flowing down from the mountain. They were like white dragons entering the sea, and appeared extremely imposing.</p>
 <p>Moreover, there were purple mists that filled the vast mountain range like a sea of clouds. This made that mountain range appear dreamlike.</p>
 <p>“Although this place is very beautiful already, scenery comparable to this is actually very commonly seen in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.”</p>
 <p>“However, the beautiful sceneries of the Starfall Holy Land are completely unique and unmatched in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm,” Song Xi said in a very certain manner.</p>
 <p>“In that case, we will truly have to go and experience it. However, before that, I must go to the Immortal Armament Villa first,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>Although the two of them were already in the Starfall Holy Land’s territory, the Starfall Holy Land was located in the Southeastern region.</p>
 <p>As for the Immortal Armament Villa, it was located in the West.</p>
 <p>It just so happened that they were in two completely different locations.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was worried that he would not make it to the Immortal Armament Villa’s hunt should he proceed for the Starfall Holy Land first and then return.</p>
 <p>“Mn, let’s go to the Immortal Armament Villa first. After all, proper business comes first. Hehe,” Song Xi chuckled.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, a rainbow suddenly flew down from the direction of the mountain range. It was a martial cultivator.</p>
 <p>“Everyone, follow me. I have heard news that the Starfall Holy Land’s Lady Holy Daughter is currently training at the Purplecloud Immortal Peak. Everyone, let’s go and feast our eyes.”</p>
 <p>Before that martial cultivator even arrived, he shouted in Chu Feng’s direction.</p>
 <p>His voice was very loud and clear. It was like thunder, shaking everything around him.</p>
 <p>After saying those words, he turned around and began to fly toward the mountain range covered with purple mist in the distance.</p>
 <p>In the moments following his shout, the people present all burst into an uproar. Everyone soared into the sky and began to fly toward that mountain range.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, quickly, quickly, we must go and have a look!” Song Xi shouted to Chu Feng with excitement.</p>
 <p>He was even pushing Chu Feng to urge Chu Feng to quickly bring him there.</p>
 <p>When Song Xi’s hand came in contact with Chu Feng, Chu Feng was able to clearly sense that Song Xi was trembling. Song Xi was actually this excited?.</p>
 <p>As such, Chu Feng decided to follow the crowd. He also soared into the sky with Song Xi and began to fly toward the mountain range.</p>
 <p>That said, Chu Feng was very curious as to what was happening.</p>
 <p>Thus, with a smile on his face, Chu Feng teased Song Xi, “Song Xi, who is that that so-called Holy Daughter? She’s actually managed to make you this excited?”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you don’t know about it. The Starfall Holy Land will select a man and a woman with the strongest talent in the Starfall Holy Land.”</p>
 <p>“That man is known as the Holy Son, whereas the woman is known as the Holy Daughter.”</p>
 <p>“As for the Holy Son and Holy Daughter, one among them will definitely become the future Headmaster of the Starfall Holy Land.”</p>
 <p>“As for the other, they will also obtain a very important position within the Starfall Holy Land. Furthermore, their status will be second to only the Starfall Holy Land’s Headmaster.”</p>
 <p>“Originally, the Starfall Holy Land had a pair of Holy Son and Holy Daughter. If they were still alive now, they would be roughly a thousand years old.”</p>
 <p>“However, the two of them suddenly disappeared sixty-three years ago. There was no news from them, and whether they are dead or alive is unknown.”</p>
 <p>“Because of that, the Starfall Holy Land decided to once again select a Holy Son and Holy Daughter.”</p>
 <p>“Sixty-three years ago, Song Yunfei was chosen as the new Holy Son. However, there was no suitable candidate for the title of Holy Daughter.”</p>
 <p>“Finally, ten years ago, a new Holy Daughter was chosen. However, the new Holy Daughter has never revealed herself ever since she was chosen. As such, no one has managed to see what she looks like.”</p>
 <p>“It was only a year ago that the Starfall Holy Land’s new Holy Daughter revealed herself.”</p>
 <p>“When the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter revealed herself, it was an enormous uproar. All the various younger generations from all around the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm gathered to see her. Even those demon-level characters with outstanding talent showed up.”</p>
 <p>“This was especially true for the men. They were all raising their heads to get a better look at her.”</p>
 <p>“The reason for that was because the successive generations of the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Sons and Holy Daughters were not only extraordinarily talented, but they also possessed outstanding appearances.”</p>
 <p>“If all young men have a woman that they yearn for in their hearts, then the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter would be the woman that the majority of young men yearn for.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, it’s said that the Starfall Holy Land’s newest Holy Daughter was so very beautiful that her beauty was simply akin to that of a celestial fairy. She was even said to be the most beautiful Holy Daughter in all of history.”</p>
 <p>“Even the many demon-level geniuses that were present at the time were deeply charmed by her looks.”</p>
 <p>“From that point on, the Starfall Holy Land’s newest Holy Daughter was deemed to be one of the Three Great Beauties in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.”</p>
 <p>“And now, the Holy Daughter is right before our eyes. How could we possibly miss this opportunity to see her?”</p>
 <p>The more Song Xi explained, the more excited he became. When he finished explaining, he was on the verge of drooling.</p>
 <p>“Haha, look at yourself, is this how one should act?” Chu Feng openly mocked Song Xi.</p>
 <p>While the two of them were chatting, they entered the mountain range with the crowd and arrived at the foot of a mountain peak.</p>
 <p>That mountain peak continued deep into the clouds. It was the highest peak in the mountain range.</p>
 <p>Through using his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng was able to see that there was a palace at the top of the mountain peak.</p>
 <p>Through the conversations from the surrounding crowd, Chu Feng came to find out that the so-called Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter was inside that palace.</p>
 <p>Merely, a spirit formation had been placed on that palace. Thus, Chu Feng was unable to see through that palace even with his Heaven’s Eyes.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Chu Feng noticed that there was a spirit formation outside the palace. That spirit formation was invisible. Yet, it was able to prevent others from approaching the palace.</p>
 <p>With that spirit formation there, not to mention entering the palace, the people here would not even be able to approach the top of the mountain peak.</p>
 <p>Apart from the spirit formation, there were eight old men standing around the palace.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was rather shocked upon seeing those eight old men. The reason for that was because the eight of them actually looked exactly the same.</p>
 <p>The eight of them were all wearing snow-white gowns and had ice-cold expressions. The eight of them did not even blink. It was as if they were completely devoid of emotions.</p>
 <p>If it wasn’t for the breeze lifting their long gowns and white beards, one would really end up thinking they were sculptures.</p>
 <p>Although Chu Feng was unable to sense the eight old men’s auras, he was able to guess that the eight of them must be extremely frightening existences.</p>
 <p>Perhaps the people that had shown up had also noticed the eight old men, and that was why none of them dared to ascend the mountain peak.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because they were also afraid. They were not merely afraid of the eight old men. More than them, they were afraid of the Starfall Holy Land.</p>
 <p>“Sure enough, the rumors are true. The Starfall Eight Immortals are actually here. It would appear that the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter is truly as beautiful as she is rumored to be,” Upon seeing the eight old men, Song Xi grew even more excited.</p>
 <p>“What do you mean by that?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“According to the rumors, the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter is protected by the Starfall Eight Immortals,” Song Xi said.</p>
 <p>“Who are these Starfall Eight Immortals? Why do they resemble each other so much?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Of course they resemble one another. The eight of them are biological brothers. They are octuplets,” Song Xi said.</p>
 <p>“Octuplets?” Chu Feng was shocked. He thought to himself, ‘Their mother was truly capable in giving birth.’</p>
 <p>“The Starfall Eight Immortals are extremely famous in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. The reason for that is because not only are they octuplets, but they are also Martial Immortal-level experts,” Song Xi added.</p>
 <p>“Martial Immortal?”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng felt deep veneration for the Starfall Eight Immortals upon hearing those words. He finally realized why the people present were so scared of the eight old men on the mountain peak, and were even whispering when they spoke.</p>
 <p>Above True Immortals were Heavenly Immortals. Above Heavenly Immortals were Martial Immortals. Martial Immortal was an extremely powerful realm of cultivation.</p>
 <p>At the very least, it was a realm of cultivation that Chu Feng and the others present would not be able to contend against in the slightest.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Even though the people present could only stand at the bottom of the mountain peak and were simply unable to see the Holy Daughter, more and more people continued to arrive. The women that arrived soon left upon finding out the situation. However, practically not a single man was willing to leave.</p>
 <p>It was as if being able to be in contact with that Holy Daughter at a close distance for even a short moment was an enormous honor to them.</p>
 <p>“If I am able to see the Holy Daughter, it would be all worth it even if I am to die afterward.” They all thought.</p>
 <p>Many people began to sigh in regret. There were even some shameless individuals that actually started to extend their noses to sniff. It was as if they could sniff the scent of the Holy Daughter.</p>
 <p>“All of you, move aside!”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, a resounding voice sounded from behind Chu Feng and the others.</p>
 <p>Turning toward the sound, Chu Feng could see over a dozen men and women flying toward them from afar.</p>
