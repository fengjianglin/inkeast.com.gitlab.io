 <p><strong> Chapter 2485 - The Outcome Has Been Determined</strong></p>
 <p>The fierce and powerful Six Demons Transformation was still in the sky.</p>
 <p>However, the red gaseous flames that it emitted had grown much dimmer.</p>
 <p>Not only that, but the frightening tentacles it had used to attack Chu Feng had all been cut off.</p>
 <p>Naturally, the one to sever its tentacles was the Ancient Era’s War Axe that currently stood horizontally in the sky.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the golden gaseous flames emitted by the Ancient Era’s War Axe had covered over half of the sky. Its overwhelming power seemed to be telling everyone that regardless of how grand of an origin the Six Demons Transformation might possess, it would still not be able to contend against it.</p>
 <p>“Seems like your secret skill is only of this level,” Chu Feng mocked.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Chu Luxuan turned deathly pale. Raging fury emerged in his eyes.</p>
 <p>“You damned bastard! You dare underestimate me?! I’ll make you pay!!!”</p>
 <p>“Heeeahhh!!!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Luxuan shouted furiously. Then, a steady flow of red gaseous flames started to emit from his body and enter the Six Demons Transformation.</p>
 <p>Soon, the Six Demons Transformation’s severed tentacles were regrown. Its aura also grew more powerful again. Once again, the red gaseous flames it emitted started to increase in size. It once again seemed to be able to contend against Chu Feng’s Ancient Era’s War Axe.</p>
 <p>“Seems like you’re unwilling to give up,” Chu Feng chuckled. Then, a trace of ruthlessness flashed through his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~”</p>
 <p>The Ancient Era’s War Axe moved. It was rushing toward the Six Demons Transformation.</p>
 <p>“Roar~~~”</p>
 <p>The Six Demons Transformation let out a snarl. Then, its body started to transform. In the end, an enormous mouth appeared.</p>
 <p>That enormous mouth was filled with white fangs covered with traces of blood. It was extremely frightening.</p>
 <p>“Snap~~~”</p>
 <p>However, at the moment when the two collided, the Six Demons Transformation was instantly sliced in two by the Ancient Era’s War Axe.</p>
 <p>Like tofu encountering a sharp blade, it was simply powerless to resist.</p>
 <p>“This gap is simply too enormous. Exactly how powerful is Chu Feng’s secret skill?!!!”</p>
 <p>“A secret skill that powerful has simply surpassed the level of Ancestral Taboo Martial Skills. This is truly unbelievable.”</p>
 <p>Waves of exclamation sounded nonstop. It was only at that moment that the crowd realized that there was such an enormous gap even though both of them were powerful secret skills.</p>
 <p>Before Chu Feng’s secret skill, Chu Luxuan’s secret skill simply did not possess the ability to even contend against it.</p>
 <p>“Puu…”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, Chu Luxuan opened his mouth and vomited out a mouthful of blood.</p>
 <p>At the same time, his complexion also became extremely pale. His legs started to grow soft, and he actually half knelt in midair.</p>
 <p>In fact, there were even people that noticed that his body was shivering.</p>
 <p>That one mouthful of blood was most definitely not an ordinary mouthful of blood. Rather, it seemed to be his heart’s blood.</p>
 <p>Chu Luxuan was already seriously injured. It was likely that he would no longer be able to fight.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the crowd revealed more and more admiration in their eyes.</p>
 <p>They had already realized….</p>
 <p>That it was actually not only Chu Luxuan’s secret skill that was unable to contend against Chu Feng’s secret skill.</p>
 <p>Instead, it turned out that even Chu Luxuan himself was unable to contend against Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Huuu~~~”</p>
 <p>After a moment of astonishment, many people were unable to stop themselves from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.</p>
 <p>As matters stood, they were certain that Chu Luxuan had been defeated.</p>
 <p>But, who was Chu Luxuan? He was a genius of the Chu Heavenly Clan. Yet, he was defeated by Chu Feng. What did this signify?</p>
 <p>This meant that Chu Feng’s reputation as a genius was fully justified. His genius was not limited to only the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Even in the Upper Realms, he would be able to establish himself.</p>
 <p>“Snap~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, the Ancient Era’s War Axe swept through the sky. A golden slash landed on the enormous signboard nearby, as well as the cage that had imprisoned everyone from the Sunset Cloud Valley.</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~”</p>
 <p>A loud explosion was heard. Not only was the signboard sliced in two, but the cage was also shattered.</p>
 <p>However, the power of the golden slash was just the right amount. Although it shattered the cage, it did not injure anyone. Everyone from the Sunset Cloud Valley managed to regain their freedom.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, did you really think you could save them today?”</p>
 <p>“Let me tell you this. Today, you will not be able to save anyone. Even you will die here today!”</p>
 <p>Chu Luxuan shouted loudly while fuming with rage between gritted teeth. The gaze with which he looked at Chu Feng was filled with irreconciliation, grievance and killing intent.</p>
 <p>“Humph,” The corners of Chu Feng’s mouth rose as he let out a light snort.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>The next moment, golden radiance began to flicker about as the Ancient Era’s War Axe arrived above Chu Luxuan’s head.</p>
 <p>“Wuuahh~~~”</p>
 <p>Chu Luxuan let out a scream. Then, he lost the ability to fly, and was forcibly knocked from the sky by the power of the Ancient Era’s War Axe.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, he did not even have the strength to raise his head. Like a dying dog, he lay flat on his stomach motionlessly.</p>
 <p>“Hahahaha…”</p>
 <p>However, right at that moment, the crowd were able to hear that Chu Luxuan was laughing.</p>
 <p>That’s right, he was laughing.</p>
 <p>Although his face was buried in the ground and not visible to the crowd, he was still laughing.</p>
 <p>But, how could he still laugh in such a state?</p>
 <p>The crowd was bewildered. They were unable to understand what was happening with Chu Luxuan.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, if you have the ability to do so, then go ahead and kill me,” Chu Luxuan mocked.</p>
 <p>Even with the situation being as it was he actually still dared to provoke Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Did you think that I do not dare to kill you?” Chu Feng’s sharp brows narrowed slightly. Disdain filled his eyes.</p>
 <p>Chu Luxuan wanted him to kill him. Thus, Chu Feng found no reason to spare him. As such, Chu Feng would not even blink an eye at killing Chu Luxuan.</p>
 <p>If Chu Luxuan really thought that Chu Feng would not dare to kill him, he would be gravely mistaken.</p>
 <p>“Go ahead and kill me if you can,” Chu Luxuan let out a mocking provocation.</p>
 <p>“As you wish,” After Chu Feng said those words, the Ancient Era’s War Axe that emitted golden light once again came striking down from the sky. It was aimed toward Chu Luxuan.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng is actually really planning to kill Chu Luxuan!!!”</p>
 <p>The crowd was stunned. After all, no matter what, Chu Luxuan was a genius of the Chu Heavenly Clan. His identity was no small matter.</p>
 <p>It would be understandable for the Chu Heavenly Clan to not look further into it after Chu Feng killed Chu Luyang. However, Chu Luxuan was different. If Chu Feng were to kill him, he would definitely bring a major crisis upon himself.</p>
 <p>At that moment, everyone felt that Chu Feng was being excessively daring.</p>
 <p>However, no one dared to look down on Chu Feng. After all, Chu Feng’s courage and insight were precisely things that they did not possess.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right at that moment, the Ancient Era’s War Axe grew motionless right at the moment when it was about to reach Chu Luxuan.</p>
 <p>Witnessing that scene, the crowd all heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>In fact, some people present revealed smiles on their faces.</p>
 <p>“It would appear that Chu Feng does not dare to really kill Chu Luxuan. He was merely trying to scare him.”</p>
 <p>“This means that Chu Feng is still very rational. Yet, at the same time, this means that Chu Feng is not an out-of-control maverick.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, the crowd all felt that it was Chu Feng who had stayed his hand. However, it was also because of that that the crowd’s respect toward Chu Feng lessened slightly.</p>
 <p>After all, to truly be intent on killing someone and to merely scare someone, there was an enormous difference between the two.</p>
 <p>“Who stopped me?” Right at that moment, Chu Feng spoke.</p>
 <p>“What? It is not Chu Feng who stayed his hand?” The crowd were all astonished. At the same time, they started to feel doubt. After all, they had not felt any aura stronger than Chu Feng’s.</p>
 <p>They were all certain that Chu Feng was the strongest individual there. When even Chu Luxuan was no match for him, who could possibly stop him?</p>
 <p>Thus, it was inevitable for there to be people that felt that Chu Feng was deliberately putting on a play so that he could get out of an embarrassing situation.</p>
 <p>“Young brother Chu Feng, there is not an enormous hatred between the two of you. Is there really a need for you to insist on killing?”</p>
 <p>“How about you give me this face?”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, a voice suddenly sounded. At the same time, a figure appeared out of thin air. That person stood before Chu Luxuan.</p>
 <p>“That is?”</p>
 <p>Seeing that person, the crowd present, with the exception of Chu Feng, all revealed an enormous change in appearance!!!</p>
