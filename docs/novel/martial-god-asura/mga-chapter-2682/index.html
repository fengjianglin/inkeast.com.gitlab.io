 <p><strong>Chapter 2682 - That Is a Sacred Mountain</strong></p>
 <p>“Ghost Sect Hall?”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s heart moved upon hearing that name.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had heard of the Ghost Sect Hall back when he was in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p>
 <p>Chu Bore had personally told him that he had found that mysterious individual at the Ghost Sect Hall.</p>
 <p>It was from that mysterious individual that Chu Bore purchased the scroll containing information about how to find and unseal the Ginseng King of Evil.</p>
 <p>Although a motion had emerged in Chu Feng’s heart, he did not reveal it.</p>
 <p>Instead, with a very composed expression, he asked, “Song Xi, what are the characteristics of those four powers that you spoke of? How are they ranked among each other in terms of power?”</p>
 <p>“The strongest of the four powers is most definitely the Starfall Holy Land.”</p>
 <p>“The Starfall Holy Land has been in existence for a very long time. According to rumors, the Starfall Holy Land was constructed from a meteor that fell from the sky.”</p>
 <p>“That enormous meteor contained extraordinary power. It possessed enormous assistance in the path of martial cultivation. That is also why the Starfall Holy Land became so powerful.”</p>
 <p>“Of course, regardless of how powerful the Starfall Holy Land might be, they will not be able to match up to the Chu Heavenly Clan.”</p>
 <p>Song Xi added that part deliberately. It could be seen that he was truly in reverence toward the Chu Heavenly Clan.</p>
 <p>“As for the Dao Imperial Palace and Paradise Valley, it is unknown which among them is stronger. I think they should be of similar strength.”</p>
 <p>“As for the Ghost Sect Hall, they are relatively more hidden than others. All I know is that they possess vast influence and are extremely strong.”</p>
 <p>“However, I think that when compared to the Dao Imperial Palace and Paradise Valley, they are relatively weaker. At the very least, they have fewer members compared to the Dao Imperial Palace and Paradise Valley,” Song Xi said.</p>
 <p>“You said that the Ghost Sect Hall is rather hidden. Is there a reason for that?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“The other powers will all widely accept new disciples every year. Although their requirements for new disciples are extremely strict, and they will only accept those with superb talent, they, at least, will openly accept disciples.”</p>
 <p>“However, never has anyone seen the Ghost Hall Sect accepting new disciples. They have always selected new disciples by themselves.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, the Ghost Hall Sect does not possess any subsidiary powers. That said, they possess an extremely vast amount of wealth.”</p>
 <p>“There have even been rumors saying that the Ghost Hall Sect’s wealth was, although weaker than that of the Starfall Holy Land, superior to that of Paradise Valley and the Dao Imperial Palace,” Song Xi said.</p>
 <p>“Since they do not possess any subsidiary powers, they do not have anyone to pay tribute to them. As such, how could they obtain such a vast amount of wealth?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>Generally speaking, major powers would all have subsidiary powers under them.</p>
 <p>In exchange for the protection from the major powers, the subsidiary powers would pay tribute to the major powers that they belonged to with treasures every year. This could be said to be a form of transaction.</p>
 <p>Since the Ghost Hall Sect did not have subsidiary powers, this meant they they should not receive any tribute. In that case, their wealth should be relatively weak.</p>
 <p>“According to rumors, they’re doing some sort of business. As for exactly what sort of business they conduct, mere nobodies like myself have no clue.”</p>
 <p>“After all, all those people capable of having dealings with the Ghost Sect Hall are grand characters.”</p>
 <p>“That is why, when compared to the other major powers, the Ghost Sect Hall is relatively hidden and secretive,” Song Xi said.</p>
 <p>“So that’s the case.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had a rough idea of the Ghost Sect Hall now. He felt that the business that they conducted was most definitely not ordinary business.</p>
 <p>That said, merely by the fact that the Ghost Sect Hall was able to provide the scroll containing information regarding the Ginseng King of Evil to Chu Bore, Chu Feng knew that the Ghost Sect Hall most definitely possessed extraordinary strength.</p>
 <p>At the very least… of the four powers that Song Xi had mentioned, Chu Feng was most interested in the Ghost Sect Hall right now.</p>
 <p>…………</p>
 <p>Afterwards, Chu Feng arrived at the Stairway to Heaven connecting to the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p>
 <p>This Stairway to Heaven was controlled by the Chu Heavenly Clan. Thus, Chu Feng had to go through twists and turns in order to obtain information.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, Chu Feng managed to obtain the information that he wanted. Merely, what he discovered was not optimistic at all.</p>
 <p>“How could this be? None of them managed to pass through the Stairway to Heaven to reach this place.”</p>
 <p>“Even the Chu Heavenly Clan has no idea what happened?”</p>
 <p>“This is most definitely not simply a malfunctioning of the Stairway to Heaven. Instead, it seems more like something man-made.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng had discovered that Wang Qiang and the others had all not arrived at the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.</p>
 <p>This made Chu Feng wonder about the situation inside the Stairway to Heaven back then.</p>
 <p>All of this was simply too strange. After entering the light vortex, Chu Feng appeared in that wasteland.</p>
 <p>It was as if someone was deliberately sending him to that place.</p>
 <p>Unable to understand what had happened, Chu Feng found Song Xi again.</p>
 <p>“Song Xi, do you know of the origin of the mountain that we met at?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“You’re talking about the Sacred Mountain? The Sacred Mountain possesses an extraordinary origin,” Song Xi said.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing the name ‘Sacred Mountain’ and seeing Song Xi’s reaction, Chu Feng felt with greater certainty that his guess was correct. Everything was most definitely not a coincidence.</p>
 <p>“Can you tell me about the origin of that Sacred Mountain?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Of course.”</p>
 <p>Song Xi would naturally not try to conceal the origin of the Sacred Mountain from Chu Feng. He began to narrate all that he knew about the Sacred Mountain to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>This Sacred Mountain truly possessed a grand origin. Furthermore, it had appeared a very long time ago.</p>
 <p>The Chu Heavenly Clan had ruled over the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm for some time now.</p>
 <p>However, that Sacred Mountain was already present in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm before the Chu Heavenly Clan had even arrived in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.</p>
 <p>Before the Sacred Mountain appeared, there was a vast body of water at the location of the Sacred Mountain.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, waves began to surge about and batter in all directions.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, these were no ordinary waves. They were capable of cutting through mountains and crushing apart rocks. Everything before their path was destroyed. They possessed extremely powerful destructive capabilities.</p>
 <p>Even martial cultivators were unable to stop these waves.</p>
 <p>All the land that was engulfed by the waves ended up suffering a massive catastrophe. Countless martial cultivators also died to the waves.</p>
 <p>This matter caught the attention of the various experts in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm at that time.</p>
 <p>The experts of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm decided that they would join hands to stop the calamity.</p>
 <p>However, these waves were simply boundless as they surged high into the sky. Not a single person was able to stop those surging waves.</p>
 <p>This was the first time that the people from the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm realized how extraordinary these waves were.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, the waves did not continue to spread endlessly. After they spread a certain distance, they stopped moving forward.</p>
 <p>After many months passed, the waves started to gradually vanish. However, the waves that vanished did not return to the vast sea. Instead, they flew to other locations.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because an enormous mountain had appeared where the vast sea was originally located.</p>
 <p>That mountain was so vast that it practically covered the entire area where the sea used to be.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, that mountain was enveloped by rays of light. As for that light, they were natural energies visible to the naked eye.</p>
 <p>Not only was that vast mountain exceptionally rich in natural energies, but one would also become a lot more quick-witted when training inside. In turn, one would have a high chance of being able to increase one’s cultivation.</p>
 <p>The miraculous natural energies immediately caused this mysterious mountain that suddenly appeared to become a sacred ground for martial cultivation.</p>
 <p>As such, that vast mountain was praised as the Sacred Mountain.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, the natural energies contained in the Sacred Mountain were not endless and inexhaustible.</p>
 <p>As more and more cultivators entered the Sacred Mountain to train, the natural energies contained in the Sacred Mountain began to decrease. It was no longer as rich and intense as it originally was.</p>
 <p>The various powers in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm at the time all discovered what was happening. In order to be able to increase the amount of time they could train in the Sacred Mountain, they began to drive out weak martial cultivators and split up the Sacred Mountain’s lands into territories.</p>
 <p>In the end, the Sacred Mountain was split up and controlled by the several formidable powers that existed in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm at that time.</p>
 <p>As for the others, they were all driven out of the Sacred Mountain.</p>
 <p>That said, the amount of natural energies in the Sacred Mountain still continued to decrease as people continued to train in the Sacred Mountain.</p>
 <p>As time passed, the amount of natural energies contained in the Sacred Mountain grew weaker and weaker.</p>
 <p>Finally, the amount of natural energies in the Sacred Mountain became identical to that of the outside world. It was no longer as rich and intense as it was in the past.</p>
 <p>However, as the Sacred Mountain had brought up countless experts, even though the amount of natural energies in the Sacred Mountain had reached the same level as other places in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, people still subconsciously preferred training in the Sacred Mountain.</p>
 <p>In the end, a very strange matter occurred. The natural energies in the Sacred Mountain grew weaker and weaker. It actually grew much inferior to all the other places in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.</p>
 <p>In the end, the amount of natural energies in the Sacred Mountain grew inferior to even Ordinary Realms.</p>
 <p>Then, the strangest matter occurred.</p>
 <p>A layer of spirit power covered the Sacred Mountain. Not only did that spirit power restrict one’s cultivation, but it also made it so that one could not fly.</p>
 <p>With the situation being like that, those powers that had occupied the Sacred Mountain also began to withdraw from it.</p>
 <p>The Sacred Mountain once again returned to being a place where one could come and go as one wished.</p>
 <p>Although the Sacred Mountain was simply incomparable to before, and could even be said to be lousy, there were still people yearning to enter it.</p>
 <p>After the Sacred Mountain was open to the public again, countless experts arrived seeking its fame. Those experts began to pour into the Sacred Mountain.</p>
 <p>However, right at that moment, a frightening thing occurred. Martial cultivators began to die in the Sacred Mountain. Furthermore, the manner of their deaths was very scary.</p>
 <p>Those that died appeared as if their flesh and blood had been sucked dry. There was no sign of life to them at all. Even their source energies were sucked dry.</p>
 <p>Originally, people thought that it was caused by humans. As such, they were determined to catch the culprit.</p>
 <p>However, gradually, they discovered that such was not the case.</p>
 <p>Even some of the powerful and famous experts suffered that fate.</p>
 <p>With the situation being like that, the crowd grew alarmed, and began to withdraw from the Sacred Mountain.</p>
 <p>After that, there were those that refused to believe in the dangers of the Sacred Mountain that ended up setting foot there. Although not everyone would definitely die upon setting foot there, there would always be those that ended up encountering the misfortune of death.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, as the Sacred Mountain was long since completely different from before, and training in the Sacred Mountain would greatly slow down one’s cultivation growth instead of increasing it, the Sacred Mountain became a forbidden area as time passed.</p>
 <p>Very few people were willing to enter the Sacred Mountain now.</p>
 <p>As time continued to flow, the glory days of the Sacred Mountain were forgotten. Right now… no one thinks highly of the Sacred Mountain.</p>
 <p>“Song Xi, is what you said legends, or are they actually real?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Although those were things that happened very long ago, the things regarding the Sacred Mountain are not legends. Rather, they actually happened.”</p>
 <p>“Lord Chu Feng, you must definitely trust me in this.”</p>
 <p>“Although I, Song Xi, possess a weak level of cultivation, I am fond of places like that. Thus, I have made inquiries about the Sacred Mountain before, There is definitely no mistake. What I’ve said is most definitely reliable,” Song Xi patted his chest as he guaranteed.</p>
