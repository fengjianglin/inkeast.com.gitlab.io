 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1076 - Ancient Era’s Formation</strong></p>
 <p>However, this Ancient Era’s Elf before him did not leave any favorable impression to Chu Feng. Especially his frightened expression and shivering body, it gave Chu Feng a feeling that regardless of how noble a race might be, they still possessed the same characteristic of ordinary martial cultivators -- bullying the good and fearing the evil.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng abruptly waved the Demon Sealing Sword in his hand. “Puchi.” That Ancient Era’s Elf died in Chu Feng’s hand.</p>
 <p>“Regardless of how beautiful your external appearance might be, it would not be able to mask the ugliness of your heart. A person like you ought to be killed.”</p>
 <p>After beheading that Ancient Era’s Elf, Chu Feng said these words. There was not a slightest trace of emotion on his calm face. It was as if he did not take note of the fact that he had just killed several tens of lives.</p>
 <p>After that, Chu Feng did some cleanup of the battlefield. When he determined that there was not a trace of the battle left, Chu Feng cleaned the green cloak that he snatched off from that Ancient Era’s Elf. When he determined that there was not a single bloodstain on the cloak, Chu Feng draped it over himself. Then, using a medicinal pellet that changed his appearance, he changed the colors of his eyes to green. Only then did he start to dive deeper again.</p>
 <p>After experiencing what happened earlier, Chu Feng’s impression of the Ancient Era’s Elves took a huge turn. He discovered that the Ancient Era’s Elves, for the purpose of possessing the privilege to be the only ones capable of triggering the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle, had actually killed all of the other races that managed to reach the depths of the Immortal Pond.</p>
 <p>This sort of behavior appeared to lack any sense of shame and anger. Moreover, this sort of behavior gave Chu Feng an even firmer determination to trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle. He planned to purposely attack the arrogant yet immortal airs of the Ancient Era’s Elves.</p>
 <p>But, in order to prevent any accidents from happening, Chu Feng decided to disguise himself as an Ancient Era’s Elf. That was because he knew there were at least another five hundred plus Ancient Era’s Elves within the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. He was unable to determine whether there might be someone more powerful than him among those Ancient Era’s Elves.</p>
 <p>Thus, as Chu Feng unhurriedly dived deeper into the water wearing the green cloak, he encountered Ancient Era’s Elves in groups of three to five and even several tens training at various levels of water.</p>
 <p>When these Ancient Era’s Elves noticed Chu Feng, they merely took a quick and indifferent glance at him before closing their eyes and continuing to train. The majority of them did not even bother to greet Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Seeing that they did not attack him, Chu Feng did not bother to collide with them either. Instead, he continued to dive deeper. Merely, when Chu Feng began to dive deeper, those Ancient Era’s Elves would always open their eyes and glance at him again.</p>
 <p>Moreover, this time around, their gazes were filled with a bit of admiration and even envy.</p>
 <p>Under this sort of condition, Chu Feng continued to dive deeper and deeper. In the end, even he began to feel a certain degree of pressure. Although the pressure wasn’t weak, it was still within Chu Feng’s range of tolerance. However, he must admit that the pressure at this depth in the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond was definitely something that an ordinary individual would not be able to withstand.</p>
 <p>Finally, another group of Ancient Era’s Elves appeared before Chu Feng. The number of Ancient Era’s Elves in this group was very few, being only nine. Based on Chu Feng’s calculation from the amount of Ancient Era’s Elves he had seen, these nine Ancient Era’s Elves ought to be the final nine of the Ancient Era’s Elves that had entered into the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond this time.</p>
 <p>No, they should be nine of the final ten Ancient Era’s Elves. If Chu Feng’s guess was correct, there should be another Ancient Era’s Elf that he had yet to meet.</p>
 <p>“Mn, you’re actually able to reach this deep? You should be A’lun, right?” Upon seeing Chu Feng, those nine Ancient Era’s Elves simultaneously opened their eyes. Contained within the gazes that they looked to Chu Feng with was surprise.</p>
 <p>Seeing this, Chu Feng did not deny his identity. However, he also did not respond to them. All he did was nod in silence.</p>
 <p>“A’lun, you’re indeed a genius among the younger generations. You actually managed to reach this deep with your age; if you train for a couple more years, you might be able to reach the deepest region and trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle.” Said a man in the group of nine with a slightly teasing tone.</p>
 <p>“A’lun is indeed a rare genius in these past years in our Southern Domain. Unfortunately, the true genius is currently triggering the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle at the deepest region.” Suddenly, a somewhat flirtatious looking female spoke.</p>
 <p>“Sigh, that’s right. Compared to that individual, we truly appear too ordinary. Even though we’re from the same generation, he is truly frighteningly powerful.” At this moment, the other eight Ancient Era’s Elves all expressed their agreement. Seeing this, Chu Feng also nodded his head.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was already able to tell that the person that they spoke of ought to be the final Ancient Era’s Elf in this place. Merely, Chu Feng never imagined that the final Ancient Era’s Elf would truly be in the deepest region of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. Moreover, judging from the tone of these Ancient Era’s Elves, he appeared to have an extremely revered existence.</p>
 <p>As the situation stands, since the Ancient Era’s Elves were discussing about that genius, Chu Feng decided to seize the opportunity to learn a bit about that genius so that he would be mentally prepared. Thus, Chu Feng did not leave and instead stayed in this place to continue to listen to their conversations.</p>
 <p>“How could we possibly compare to him? After all, he’s a genius from the kingdom. Even in the kingdom, he is one of the very best in our generation. How could we possibly compare to him?”</p>
 <p>“With him here, this year, our Southern Domain’s Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle ought to be able to be triggered again.”</p>
 <p>“That’s of course. Unless there are humans or monstrous beasts who are able to reach the deepest region, that area with the extremely frightening pressure, and persist in there for a longer time than Lord Xian Kun, the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle is definitely going to be triggered by Lord Xian Kun.”</p>
 <p>“Haha, in that case, there should be no issue then. After all, the humans and monstrous beasts simply do not possess the strength to reach the bottom of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. No, it ought to be said that since the ancient times to this day, there has never been a human or monstrous beast capable of reaching the bottom.”</p>
 <p>“Hahahaha…” Suddenly, the nine Ancient Era’s Elves burst into a loud laughter. Contained within their laughter was some excitement and the mocking of humans and monstrous beasts.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng had gathered enough information. Firstly, he knew that the final Ancient Era’s Elf’s name was Xian Kun. He ought to not be an Ancient Era’s Elf from this region but had instead come from a very powerful location.</p>
 <p>Moreover, if Chu Feng’s guess was correct, he ought to have already reached the deepest region, the bottom, of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. If there were no other races capable of reaching the bottom of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond, the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle would likely be triggered by him.</p>
 <p>After analyzing the situation, Chu Feng did not dare to stay any longer. With a movement of his body, he began to leave. However, he did not dive deeper and instead flew upwards.</p>
 <p>“A’lun, you’re unable to resist the pressure already?”</p>
 <p>“It would appear that you’re too young still. However, have no fret, after training for a year or two, you would definitely be able to train in this level of water.” Seeing that Chu Feng was leaving, several teasing voices sounded from those nine Ancient Era’s Elves.</p>
 <p>However, who among them would possibly know that the reason why Chu Feng was swimming upwards was because he did not want to alert them.</p>
 <p>After leaving the line of sight of these nine Ancient Era’s Elves, Chu Feng revolved around them and began to dive deeper once more. Chu Feng’s speed also was extremely fast because he had a very clear target in his mind now - the bottom of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.</p>
 <p>Finally, ahead of Chu Feng was no longer a pitch-black darkness. Gradually, his sight began to become clear. He was already able to faintly see that below him was no longer boundless water. Instead, rocks and soil had appeared. Chu Feng knew that this was most definitely the bottom of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.</p>
 <p>“This is…”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng slowly dived downward. He was extremely cautious. However, before he came into contact with the soil and rocks at the bottom of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond, he already felt an attractive force swarming around his body. After that, this attractive force began to absorb Chu Feng’s power.</p>
 <p>However, at the moment when Chu Feng’s power was being absorbed, an even more intense power was channeling into Chu Feng’s body, compensating for the power that was being absorbed.</p>
 <p>This sort of situation could be said to be miraculous. However, it also brought about fear to Chu Feng. After all, that attractive force came too suddenly. Yet, after he carefully examined the surrounding, all he saw was the ordinary soil and rocks.</p>
 <p>In this helpless situation, Chu Feng had no choice but to activate his Heaven’s Eyes once more. He wished to determine exactly what was happening. Without looking with his Heaven’s Eyes, he would have no idea what was going on. However, once he looked with it, he immediately understood what was happening.</p>
 <p>It turned out that above the soil and rocks were numerous, faintly discernible and hard to detect bodies of light. Within the bodies of light flowed countless complicated patterns and symbols.</p>
 <p>Moreover, the amount of such bodies of light was innumerable. These bodies of light interweaved with one another and formed an enormous and boundless net that covered the entire bottom of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.</p>
 <p>That ought to be a formation from the Ancient Era. A formation that contained enormous power but was very hard to detect. Exactly why did such a formation exist in this place? However, Chu Feng knew that this enormous formation ought to be related to the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle and might even be related to the entire Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.</p>
