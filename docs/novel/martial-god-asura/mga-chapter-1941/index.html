 <p><strong> Chapter 1941 - Undoing The Seal?</strong></p>
 <p>“Aiya, this Princess has a lot of lives. Thus, don’t worry too much about it,” Xian Miaomiao said indifferently.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng was feeling an unspeakable sensation in his heart.</p>
 <p>If Xian Miaomiao did not have nine lives, if she only had one life, she would be dead right now.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng could not just pretend that nothing happened just because Xian Miaomiao possessed nine lives. The reason for that was because she had already died twice.</p>
 <p>She had killed herself the first time. She had killed herself for his sake.</p>
 <p>She had been killed the second time. She had been killed because of Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>The two lives that Xian Miaomiao had lost were both related to Chu Feng. As such, Chu Feng truly could not pretend that nothing had happened.</p>
 <p>However, how long had they known one another? Why would Xian Miaomiao be helping him to this extent?</p>
 <p>It was precisely because Xian Miaomiao had done those things, even though there was no reason for her to do so, that Chu Feng felt extremely grateful and indebted to her.</p>
 <p>“Miaomiao, from today on, my life is yours,” Chu Feng said to Xian Miaomiao.</p>
 <p>“What nonsense are you talking about? This Princess is not interested in your life. I don’t want it,” Xian Miaomiao curled her lips. However, she soon said, “Chu Feng, let me tell you something: this Blood Devouring Killing Formation was not only here to seal the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts. There is actually a treasure hidden here too.”</p>
 <p>“Treasure?” Hearing that word, Chu Feng’s heart was moved.</p>
 <p>“Really. Merely, the hidden treasure is very special, and useless to ordinary people. However, I felt that it might be of use to you. In short, just follow me,” As Xian Miaomiao spoke, she entered the place where Lil Red had come from earlier.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng followed after her.</p>
 <p>After entering the tunnel that Lil Red had dug, Chu Feng discovered that tunnel was very deep, truly unimaginably deep.</p>
 <p>After they reached the bottom of the tunnel, Chu Feng’s expression changed enormously as joy filled his face.</p>
 <p>Hidden in the depths of the earth was a vast amount of dazzling golden-bright water. The water seemed to be made of old gold. There was enough water here that it could be called a small lake.</p>
 <p>However, it was not molten gold. Instead, it was a special sort of water, a treasure for world spiritists.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, do you know what that is?”</p>
 <p>“Even though I am not a world spiritist, I am still able to tell that this water is very important. The spirit formation seal of this place should have been maintained using this water,” Xian Miaomiao said.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, the spirit formation seal was indeed maintained by this water.”</p>
 <p>“It is fortunate that it was hidden deep underground, and was not discovered by the people from the Dark Hall.”</p>
 <p>As Chu Feng was a world spiritist, he was naturally capable of telling that the water here had been the core of the Blood Devouring Killing Formation.</p>
 <p>“Miaomiao, you have truly helped me enormously this time around,” Chu Feng said to Xian Miaomiao in a very thankful manner.</p>
 <p>“It’s all because my life pearl teleported me here. Else, I would not have discovered it either.”</p>
 <p>“That said, is this water truly useful?” Xian Miaomiao asked.</p>
 <p>“Useful, extremely useful,” It was not without reason that Chu Feng would be this excited after just experiencing such a painful thing.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng currently possessed a way to help Her Lady Queen break free from the seal that his mother had placed on her. However, he did not possess enough strength himself, nor did he possess treasures that could provide the energy that he needed. That was the reason why Chu Feng felt that undoing the seal on Her Lady Queen would be something that would have to happen far in the indefinite future.</p>
 <p>However, now, this vast amount of unknown golden water had managed to solve the issue that Chu Feng had thought to be impossible to solve.</p>
 <p>Contained within the golden water was extremely powerful world spirit energy. Even if Chu Feng was unable to completely undo the seal his mother had placed on Eggy using this energy, he would still be able to, with the help of the golden water, undo a portion of Eggy’s sealed cultivation.</p>
 <p>“Exactly what use does this water have?” Xian Miaomiao asked curiously. Originally, she had only planned to show Chu Feng the golden water to console him. After all, even if the water was a treasure, there shouldn’t be much use for it other than to use it to set up spirit formations. As such, it couldn’t be considered an actual treasure.</p>
 <p>Xian Miaomiao had never expected for Chu Feng to be this overjoyed upon seeing the golden water. This made Xian Miaomiao very curious as to exactly what the water was, and exactly how it could help Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“It can help me release a little demon,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Little demon?” Hearing those words, Xian Miaomiao became even more confused. However, anticipation filled her face.</p>
 <p>Actually, at that moment, Eggy was also as confused as Xian Miaomiao. She too did not understand what Chu Feng meant by those words.</p>
 <p>“To be exact, it is an Asura,” Chu Feng added. As he spoke, he opened his World Spirit Gate.</p>
 <p>After the World Spirit Gate opened, Lil Red and Xian Miaomiao both turned their gazes to it.</p>
 <p>Before the gazes of the two of them, Her Lady Queen flew out from the World Spirit Gate and arrived before Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Wow! Beauty, beauty, that beauty is truly too beautiful,” After seeing Her Lady Queen, Lil Red immediately cried out in alarm.</p>
 <p>It was not that Lil Red had an exaggerated reaction. In fact, upon seeing Her Lady Queen, even Xian Miaomiao revealed an astonished expression. She reacted this way because of Her Lady Queen’s beauty.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, could she be your world spirit? That legendary Asura World Spirit?” Xian Miaomiao asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“Mn, she is Her Lady Queen,” Chu Feng said by way of introduction.</p>
 <p>“Miaomiao, if you are willing to allow me to call you lil sis Miaomiao, this Queen is willing for you to address me as big sis Eggy,” Eggy said to Xian Miaomiao.</p>
 <p>Before Xian Miaomiao could say anything, Lil Red shouted happily. “Gotcha, Big sis Eggy,”</p>
 <p>“No, you’re not allowed to call me Eggy,” Eggy shook her head.</p>
 <p>“Then what should I call you, beauty?” Lil Red asked.</p>
 <p>“You can only address me as Milady Queen,” Eggy said.</p>
 <p>“Gotcha, Milady Queen,” The shameless Lil Red called Eggy Milady Queen without the slightest hesitation.</p>
 <p>“Mn,” Eggy nodded in satisfaction. Then, she looked to Xian Miaomiao and said with a smile, “Lil sis Miaomiao, come on, call me big sis Eggy.”</p>
 <p>“Okay, lil sis Eggy,” Xian Miaomiao said without any hesitation.</p>
 <p>“Wrong, it’s big sis, not lil sis,” Eggy corrected.</p>
 <p>“But you’re clearly younger than me. You should be the lil sis, no?” Xian Miaomiao said with contempt.</p>
 <p>“What? This Queen is clearly much older than you,” Eggy said.</p>
 <p>“Liar. Your young and tender appearance has already betrayed you,” Xian Miaomiao had an expression of disbelief.</p>
 <p>“Doesn’t matter, I’m more mature than you,” Eggy said.</p>
 <p>“How are you more mature than me? It’s clearly me who’s more mature,” Xian Miaomiao refuted her.</p>
 <p>Seeing these two young girls arguing with one another and declaring themselves to be more mature, black lines began to crease Chu Feng’s forehead.</p>
 <p>That said, although the two girls were arguing, they appeared to be getting along very well. This was the first time that Chu Feng had seen Eggy acting this friendly towards someone other than himself. It seemed that Eggy had truly grown fond of that girl Xian Miaomiao.</p>
 <p>Her Lady Queen and Xian Miaomiao argued the issue of who would be the big sis and who would be the lil sis for a very long time. Neither girl was willing to back down.</p>
 <p>Feeling helpless, Chu Feng spoke to stop them. “Milady Queen, my Princess Miaomiao, it’s enough. Let’s stop arguing so we can talk about some serious matters,”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, could you be implying that that golden water would be capable of helping me undo my seal?” After hearing what Chu Feng said, Eggy ran over to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>When Chu Feng had said ‘little demon,’ she had been confused by what he meant. However, when he said ‘Asura,’ she realized Chu Feng’s intentions.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Xian Miaomiao asked curiously, “Undo her seal? What’s going on?”</p>
 <p>“That’s right, that’s right, tell us,” Lil Red was incomparably curious.</p>
