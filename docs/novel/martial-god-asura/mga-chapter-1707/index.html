 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1707 - Parting Ways</strong></p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you…”</p>
 <p>After hearing what Chu Feng said, Du Wanwu only managed to gradually calm down after a long time had passed. A rare smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.</p>
 <p>He said, “Chu Feng, I, Du Wanwu, have never had a friend my entire life. Even my clansmen distances themselves from me.”</p>
 <p>“Actually, I have been very lonely since my youth. However, never would I have ever imagined that I, Du Wanwu, would be able to obtain a friend like you in my lifetime.”</p>
 <p>“Even if I am to fail in refining this Inherited Gu, I will have no regrets in this life.”</p>
 <p>“It’s enough. You’re a grown man, so stop acting this emotional,” Chu Feng patted Du Wanwu’s shoulder while smiling. Then, he said, “I believe that you will be able to succeed. After all, your name is Du Wanwu.”</p>
 <p>Du Wanwu smiled again at Chu Feng’s words. However, he did not say anything.</p>
 <p>Du Wanwu was planning to find a remote location to refine the Inherited Gu. He feared that he would lose his rationality and become a demon that would willfully slaughter the innocent should he fail. As for exactly where this place was, he did not tell Chu Feng. Chu Feng also did not ask about it.</p>
 <p>Likely, even Du Wanwu had not decided where he planned to refine the Inherited Gu. After all, he was not familiar with the Holy Land of Martialism.</p>
 <p>As for Goudan’er, he planned to stay in the Luo Family for an extended period of time. The reason for that was actually very simple. Goudan’er was a poisonous substance to begin with. In order to cultivate, he would require poisons. As the Five Poisons Mountain was filled with abundant poison gas, it would be an optimal place for him to cultivate.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, in the hearts of the people from the Luo Family, not only was Goudan’er a hero that had saved them, he was also a frightening monster. Thus, if he wanted to stay here, they would not dare to say no.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng felt that even though Goudan’er was a poisonous substance, he possessed a kind-hearted nature. Thus, he was not worried that Goudan’er would do malicious deeds, and was instead relieved that Goudan’er had decided to stay in the Luo Family.</p>
 <p>As such, Chu Feng decided that he would not return to the Luo Family for the time being, and would return to visit Goudan’er in the future when he had the time.</p>
 <p>After all, he was not going to Mooncloud City to do something decent. Instead, he was going to cause trouble. What would he do after he finished causing trouble? Naturally, he would flee.</p>
 <p>As the Five Poisons Mountain was located close to Mooncloud City, it would naturally not be a suitable location for him to stay. Thus, after Chu Feng finished causing trouble, he would quickly leave this place without returning to the Five Poisons Mountain.</p>
 <p>Just like this, Goudan’er was staying in the Luo Family, whereas Chu Feng and Du Wanwu would be parting ways. While Du Wanwu did not know where he was going, Chu Feng had a clear-cut goal.</p>
 <p>Mooncloud City was a place very close to the Five Poisons Mountain to begin with. With the expert Baili Xuankong leading the way, Chu Feng’s speed was extremely fast. In merely the blink of an eye, Chu Feng arrived outside of Mooncloud City.</p>
 <p>Mooncloud City was located above the skies. Vast white clouds drifted over it. Faintly, vast and magnificent buildings could be seen. In fact, one could even see tall mountains, flowing rivers, and red-crowned cranes flying in groups.</p>
 <p>This place was simply equivalent to a palace in the heavens.</p>
 <p>Mooncloud City was originally a very secluded place. No one knew who the first city master was. However, one thing was certain; all of the successive city masters of Mooncloud City were Martial Emperors. As such, Mooncloud City was a power that could not be looked down upon.</p>
 <p>The reason why Mooncloud City was willing to open itself to the public was because Mooncloud City’s city master had been saved by the Four Clans before. After that, Mooncloud City’s city master had been extremely grateful to the Four Clans, and declared that Mooncloud City would be forever open to the Four Clans.</p>
 <p>As matters stood, Mooncloud City had become the place where the Four Great Imperial Clans would regularly gather. Whenever there were events where all Four Great Imperial Clans would participate, they would always choose to conduct those events at Mooncloud City.</p>
 <p>At this moment, there were a lot of people proceeding toward Mooncloud City. Other than the people from the Four Great Imperial Clans and the Nine Powers, the people from the Three Palaces had also come to enjoy the excitement.</p>
 <p>Even though all of the people who came from the Three Palaces were not great and famous people, they were still the representatives of the Three Palaces.</p>
 <p>Other than the Three Palaces, Four Clans and Nine Powers, there were also many non-famous powers and many wanderers that came to enjoy the show. From this, it could be seen that the rallying power of the Four Great Imperial Clans was quite enormous.</p>
 <p>After arriving outside of Mooncloud City, Dugu Xingfeng, Guan Hong and Yin Chengkong entered into Mooncloud City first. After all, they were representatives of the Nine Powers, and could not journey together with Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>As for Baili Xuankong, he disguised himself as a passerby and snuck into Mooncloud City to protect Chu Feng from the shadows.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he had also disguised himself. He had changed his appearance to that of an average-looking young man and entered Mooncloud City.</p>
 <p>Even though Mooncloud City was enormous, due to the fact that it was open to everyone at this time, anyone who arrived was allowed to enter.</p>
 <p>As such, a vast crowd was currently gathered in Mooncloud City. People could be seen all over the place.</p>
 <p>As for the place that Chu Feng planned to go to, it was the place filled with the most people. The reason for that was because it was the place where the Nine Powers’ disciples were fiercely competing with one another.</p>
 <p>Even though this competition would only give rise to a single victor who could compete with the younger generation of the Four Clans, the amount of participants was not few at all. Actually, the number of people from the Nine Powers participating in this competition were not numerous. More than them were the people who didn't belong to any sect or school, who had only come to join in the fun. These people were the main reason why this place was so crowded.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng finally arrived at the location where the competition was being held. However, upon arriving, Chu Feng discovered that there was an announcement post before him. This announcement post was hovering in the sky. Written on the announcement post were the rules of this competition.</p>
 <p>“Enter through the entrance. Exit through the exit. Only one person is allowed to exit through the exit. This person will be the victor, and will be able to contend with the Four Clan’s younger generation for supremacy.”</p>
 <p>The announcement post was enormous, and the words written on it were also gigantic. However, there were only a few sentences.</p>
 <p>Yet, these few sentences had already explained the rules of this competition. No matter how many people were to enter to participate in this competition, there would only be one remaining victor.</p>
 <p>“Dang! With this many people and that small of an entrance, how am I to enter?” After reading the rules, Chu Feng began to search for the entrance. When he discovered the entrance, he found out that entrance was extremely small, and would only allow a single person to enter at once.</p>
 <p>This led to the entrance being completely packed with people at this moment. There were so many people that there were simply six entire layers of people surrounding the entrance. If it wasn’t for the fact that Chu Feng had used his Heaven’s Eyes, he would simply not have been able to find the entrance at all.</p>
 <p>Upon entering the crowd, it would be inevitable for one to push and bump into others. Furthermore, as these members of the younger generation were all very conceited and prideful, this inevitably caused friction among them. At this moment, there were people shouting and making noises all around.</p>
 <p>“Bastard with no eyes, do you know whose chariot this is? This is the Ximen Imperial Clan’s Fifth Prince’s, Ximen Feixue’s, chariot!!!”</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, an angry shout was heard amongst the cacophony. Like a sudden clap of thunder, this shout completely muffled everyone’s voices. This caused everyone to shift their attention to the source of the voice.</p>
 <p>“Ximen Feixue? The person known as the strongest genius in the history of the Ximen Imperial Clan, the person said to have the highest chance of winning the spar between the Four Imperial Clan’s younger generation?”</p>
 <p>“You don’t say! How many more Fifth Princes are there in the Ximen Imperial Clan? Who else would it be other than Ximen Feixue?”</p>
 <p>“Heavens! He’s one of the super geniuses who is said to have the greatest opportunity in becoming the overlord of this era!!!”</p>
 <p>After hearing the name ‘Ximen Feixue’, the crowd that was already making an uproar burst into an even greater uproar. Some people actually stopped crowding the entrance and began to proceed toward the direction where that angry shout sounded from.</p>
 <p>Especially for some women, they actually disregarded everything and began to rush over. It was as if they had gone crazy. The incomparably prideful goddesses had instantly turned into love-struck fools.</p>
 <p>“Ximen Feixue? Interesting name. However, based on this attitude, it doesn’t seem like he’s anyone good either.” [1. Ximen Feixue → West Gate, Flying Snow.]</p>
 <p>Chu Feng smiled. Regardless of how powerful Ximen Feixue might be, it was the first time that he had heard of him. Thus, compared to the others, Chu Feng did not have the slightest interest in this Ximen Feixue.</p>
 <p>However, only people who were planning to participate in the competition would come here. As such, why would someone from the Ximen Imperial Clan be here? Chu Feng felt that this Ximen Feixue was simply coming to flaunt his strength.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng disliked these types of people the most. However, as Chu Feng was not fond of meddling in other people’s business, he did not think too much of it, and instead continued to cram toward the entrance.</p>
 <p>“Senior, I am truly sorry. It is not intentional. I have something that I must take care of, can you let me go please?” Right at this moment, a gentle yet apologetic female voice suddenly sounded.</p>
 <p>“This is!!!” After hearing this voice, Chu Feng immediately turned his gaze toward the direction where the voice had sounded from.</p>
