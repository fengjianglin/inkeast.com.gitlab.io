 <p><strong>&nbsp;Chapter 1920 - Falling Into A Trap</strong></p>
 <p>“Those guys, what happened to them?” Xian Miaomiao had an astonished expression.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he had a very serious expression. As a world spiritist, he naturally knew what was going on.</p>
 <p>The people from the Dark Hall all possessed a self detonation power within them. As long as anyone tried to forcibly remove their masks, or should they say something that they shouldn’t, they would trigger the self detonation and die from the explosion of their bodies.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, even though Chu Feng had restricted their movements and that self detonation power using both his world spirit formation and his oppressive might, he was still powerless before that self detonation power.</p>
 <p>This meant… that there was a world spiritist even more powerful than Chu Feng in the Dark Hall. Furthermore, that world spiritist was not only a little bit stronger than him.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, what were they doing here?” At that moment, Xian Miaomiao walked toward Chu Feng with Lil Red in her hand.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he began to carefully inspect their location. He wanted to find out exactly what sort of thing these fellows were trying to unseal with their unsealing formation that cost the lives of all the Royal Spirit Insects.</p>
 <p>That said, even though Chu Feng was inspecting the surrounding area, he did not dare to use all of his strength to do so. The reason for that was because he knew that the Blood Devouring Killing Formation sealed Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts. He was afraid that what was underneath this place would be the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts.</p>
 <p>That was what came into Chu Feng’s mind the first moment he saw that unsealing formation. He believed that the people from the Dark Hall were trying to release the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts.</p>
 <p>“This is bad,” After inspecting the place, Chu Feng’s frown deepened. He then turned to Xian Miaomiao and asked, “Miaomiao, do you know exactly where the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts are sealed?”</p>
 <p>“No, I don’t,” Xian Miaomiao shook her head. Then, she asked, “Chu Feng, what’s going on?”</p>
 <p>“Below this formation is another formation’s core. If I am not mistaken, the spirit formation below us is related to the spirit formation that sealed the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts. The reason for that is because I am certain that the formation’s core down below is that of a sealing formation.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, what you said is most likely true. There is indeed a frightening thing sealed here. It should be the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts.”</p>
 <p>“Merely, the formation’s core is located too deep. I am unable to determine exactly where those Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts are sealed.”</p>
 <p>“However, one thing is certain. Those people from the Dark Hall set up such a spirit formation here because they wanted to release whatever it is that is sealed in there,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“It must be the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts. This place must be where the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts are sealed. What do we do? They’re actually this wicked.”</p>
 <p>“I will immediately return to report this matter to the others,” Xian Miaomiao said.</p>
 <p>“Report? Didn’t you say that your Ancient Era’s Elves have people guarding this place all the time?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“That is indeed the case. However, my royal father has moved many troops recently. As such, the strength of the guards here are much more inferior to before. If the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts are to be released at such a time, the Ancient Era’s Elves stationed here will not be able to stop them,” Xian Miaomiao said.</p>
 <p>“Did your royal father transfer the troops for the sake of searching for the Dark Hall?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Yes,” Xian Miaomiao nodded.</p>
 <p>“Crap, he fell for their trap,” Chu Feng became alarmed. Evidently, the secret that the Ancient Era’s Elves knew about was something that the Dark Hall knew too. All of this was deliberately done by the Dark Hall.</p>
 <p>“This is bad, I must go and notify them right away,” As Xian Miaomiao spoke, she prepared to leave.</p>
 <p>“I’m afraid it’s too late,” Chu Feng grabbed Xian Miaomiao.</p>
 <p>“Then… then what do we do?” Xian Miaomiao realized that if the people from the Dark Hall were truly prepared, it would truly be too late for her to return and notify the Elf Kingdom about this matter and then have them deploy their troops.</p>
 <p>“Since it’s too late, we must seize the moment and do what we should,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“You’re saying that we should continue searching for the Ancient Era’s Immortal Flowers?” Xian Miaomiao asked.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Else, we would’ve journeyed here in vain, no?” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“But the Ancient Era’s Immortal Flowers are too hard to find. Furthermore, with the people from the Dark Hall here, this place is now extremely dangerous,” Xian Miaomiao said.</p>
 <p>What Xian Miaomiao said was actually also what Chu Feng was worried about. Without mentioning anything else, merely that formation the ten Dark Hall’s experts were controlling was something set up by a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist.</p>
 <p>This meant that the Dark Hall had dispatched many experts. The ten rank four Martial Emperors Chu Feng had killed were already extremely powerful experts in the Holy Land of Martialism. After all, the Four Great Imperial Clan’s Supreme Elders were all only rank four Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>They were super experts that could cause an entire region of the Holy Land of Martialism to tremble with a light tap of their feet.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng felt that these ten rank four Martial Emperors were only small fry among the experts dispatched by the Dark Hall.</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, Lil Red who had been silent for a very long time spoke, “I know where the Ancient Era’s Immortal Flowers are. I’ll bring you two there.”</p>
 <p>“You’re still trying to deceive us?” Xian Miaomiao asked with a cold voice. Even though Lil Red’s clan had been exterminated, Xian Miaomiao still possessed resentment toward Lil Red for deceiving her.</p>
 <p>“I’m not deceiving you two. I really know where the Ancient Era’s Immortal Flowers are. I can bring you two there. Merely… you two might not necessarily be able to obtain them,” Although Lil Red was much calmer than before, it was instead still very low-spirited. Looking at Lil Red, one could only feel pity for it.</p>
 <p>“Lil Red, if you truly know where the Ancient Era’s Immortal Flowers are, then go ahead and lead the way,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Mn,” Lil Red turned into a ray of red light and began to fly into the distance.</p>
 <p>“Wait,” However, Chu Feng suddenly spoke to stop it.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong? Great sir, I am truly not deceiving you two,” Lil Red returned and revealed an expression of pleading for Chu Feng to believe it.</p>
 <p>“I trust you. However, we cannot leave this place like this,” The corners of Chu Feng’s mouth rose. He revealed a smile of trust in Lil Red. Then, he destroyed the spirit formation that the Dark Hall’s experts had set up.</p>
 <p>Even though the spirit formation underneath this place was merely one of many sealing formations, Chu Feng felt that it would be of some use should it remain sealed. Thus, he had to destroy the unsealing formation.</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng destroyed the unsealing formation, he set up another spirit formation in its place. That spirit formation he set up was merely there to fool others.</p>
 <p>When looking at it from the outside, the Dark Hall’s unsealing formation would appear to still be present. Furthermore, it looked as if the ten Dark Hall experts who had died were still there controlling and maneuvering the spirit formation.</p>
 <p>However, that was all because of Chu Feng’s spirit formation. Those ten Dark Hall’s experts were definitely all dead. They were all killed by Chu Feng. The unsealing formation was also destroyed, destroyed by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>After finishing that, Chu Feng said, “Lil Red, go ahead and lead the way.”</p>
 <p>“Gotcha,” Lil Red turned into a ray of red light and began to guide Chu Feng and Xian Miaomiao.</p>
 <p>After seeing Lil Red’s astonishingly fast speed, Chu Feng began to ponder. Lil Red was very powerful. At the very least, Lil Red was extremely special.</p>
 <p>However, its race, no matter how Chu Feng looked at it, did not appear to be powerful at all. Else, how could they be that easily exterminated? [1. Because those were 10 rank 4 Martial Emperors yo! Your Cyanwood Mountain would also be easily exterminated.]</p>
 <p>Furthermore, while Lil Red’s clansmen were killed, Chu Feng was still able to tell from their corpses that there were differences between them and Lil Red.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had a thought. Lil Red was not a Royal Spirit Insect. Even if Lil Red was… it was very likely that it was a variant.</p>
 <p>…………</p>
 <p>Under Lil Red’s guidance, Chu Feng and Xian Miaomiao traveled for an entire day before they finally arrived at a large mountain.</p>
 <p>“We’re here. That’s it,” Lil Red pointed at a very small crack in that large mountain.</p>
 <p>“There are indeed Ancient Era’s Immortal Flowers there. I am able to sense their aura. Let’s go in,” At this moment, Xian Miaomiao revealed an overjoyed expression because Lil Red had not deceived them this time around.</p>
 <p>“See, I didn’t deceive you all. Merely… the Ancient Era’s Immortal Flowers are not that easy to obtain. I can go in there, but cannot bring them out,” Lil Red said.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Xian Miaomiao started to frown. While the large mountain might not appear to be extraordinary, it was actually extremely tough. Even she was unable to carve a path through it.</p>
 <p>As for that crack, it was extremely small. Only Lil Red was able to pass through it. That said, Xian Miaomiao was also able to sense that there was a power inside the mountain protecting the Ancient Era’s Immortal Flowers. As such, it was true that the Ancient Era’s Immortal Flowers were very hard to obtain.</p>
 <p>“If we could take them out, we would’ve already done so. How could the Ancient Era’s Immortal Flowers possibly remain there?” Lil Red added.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that the Ancient Era’s Immortal Flowers that we painstakingly found cannot be obtained?” Xian Miaomiao revealed an expression of unwillingness. To not be able to get the Ancient Era’s Immortal Flowers after finding them was even more painful than not being able to find them.</p>
