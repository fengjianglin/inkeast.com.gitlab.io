 <p><strong> Chapter 2255 - Toying Methods</strong></p>
 <p>Finally, Chu Feng was brought to the outside of the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master’s residence. Merely, before he was even able to approach that mansion, he was stopped by an old man.</p>
 <p>That old man actually possessed the cultivation of a rank seven Martial Ancestor. Furthermore, he was looking at Chu Feng with a gaze filled with anger.</p>
 <p>Even without others mentioning it to him, Chu Feng was able to guess that old man must be Li Rui’s master, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Head Law Enforcement Elder.</p>
 <p>“We pay our respects to Lord Head Law Enforcement Elder,” Sure enough, those Law Enforcement Elders all hurriedly saluted to Li Rui’s master upon seeing him.</p>
 <p>Li Rui’s master completely ignored his henchmen. Instead, he directly walked toward Chu Feng and arrived before him. With a low voice, he said to Chu Feng, “I know what you’re thinking. You must be trying to use your identity as an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist to plead for your life and escape this calamity.”</p>
 <p>“However, I’ll tell you this. You are truly underestimating me. Since I have dared to allow you to meet Lord Valley Master, I will naturally have made preparations to make you meet certain death.”</p>
 <p>“Lord Valley Master does not know that you’re an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, nor does he know about the trifle that Su Jingrui had with Luyang’s Pavilion and the Red Butterfly Society.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, later on, as long as I report to Lord Valley Master about you killing Chu Luyang, Lord Valley Master will let me execute you.”</p>
 <p>“As long as I manage to kill you, even if Su Jingrui is to come out from his closed-door training and explain the situation, it will be useless.”</p>
 <p>“After all, it will be Lord Valley Master who will have personally killed you, and not me.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, at that time, I will, at the very most, receive some verbal reprimand as a punishment. However, you, on the other hand, will be dead,” Li Rui’s master said coldly and sinisterly.</p>
 <p>“Head Law Enforcement Elder, your tricks are truly vile. No wonder you were capable of nurturing a disciple as sinister and treacherous as Li Rui,” Chu Feng mocked.</p>
 <p>“Courting death,” Hearing what Chu Feng said, Li Rui’s master was furious. He directly grabbed Chu Feng’s neck with his aged yet powerful hand.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng felt as if he was about to suffocate, that his body was about to explode.</p>
 <p>After all, his opponent was a rank seven Martial Ancestor. That level of cultivation was truly powerful. He was someone capable of instantly killing Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, even with that being the case, Chu Feng was still not afraid. He said, “What’s wrong, Head Law Enforcement Elder? Could it be that you’re so eager to avenge your disciple that you’re planning to kill me right now? Could it be that you’re not planning to allow me to meet your Lord Valley Master?”</p>
 <p>“No, you naturally have to meet him,” Li Rui’s master released his hand. He said, “However, I’ll let you suffer true despair before meeting Lord Valley Master.”</p>
 <p>As Li Rui’s master spoke, he took out a medicinal pellet and then said to Chu Feng, “As you are an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, you should know what sort of medicinal pellet this is, no?”</p>
 <p>“After you take this medicinal pellet, you will become a mute that is unable to speak. Even your world spirit power will be sealed, and unable to be released from your body.”</p>
 <p>“At that time, you will not be able to argue with anything that I say. As such, you will have no choice but to admit guilt.”</p>
 <p>“You wish to prove yourself as an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist so as to draw support from Lord Valley Master to escape a calamity?”</p>
 <p>“Haha, that’s not going to happen.”</p>
 <p>“You shameless and despicable little man! You!!!” At this moment, Chu Feng was furious.</p>
 <p>However, before Chu Feng could finish his words, Li Rui’s master grabbed his mouth and force-fed him that medicinal pellet.</p>
 <p>“Wuu~~~”</p>
 <p>The next moment, Chu Feng felt an enormous medicinal power sealing his throat and body.</p>
 <p>That was not a poisonous medicinal pellet. Rather, it was a medicinal pellet that used enormously formidable world spirit power to seal one’s body.</p>
 <p>Thus, even though Chu Feng possessed a body immune to poison, he was unable to resist that medicinal pellet’s effect.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was truly incapable of speaking. Furthermore, he was also unable to release his world spirit power.</p>
 <p>He had already lost the ability to prove himself as an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist.</p>
 <p>At this very moment, Chu Feng’s complexion turned ashen.</p>
 <p>Seeing such a Chu Feng, Li Rui’s master revealed a complacent smile. He said, “You must’ve never expected to meet such a sullen death, right? However, even if this is the case, it will still not be able to alleviate the hatred I have for you killing my disciple.”</p>
 <p>“Men! Bring him over!” Li Rui’s master said.</p>
 <p>Then, being led by Li Rui’s master, the Law Enforcement Elders began to advance toward the entrance of the Valley Master’s residence.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, what are we to do? Are you truly unable to speak? Are you truly unable to release your spirit power?” At this moment, Her Lady Queen started to panic.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master had no clue as to the situation at all. Not only does he not know Chu Feng was a rarely seen Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, he also did not know about the agreement between Luyang’s Pavilion and the Red Butterfly Society.</p>
 <p>And now, as Chu Feng was unable to speak, he would not be able to justify his actions.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Elder Ning Shuang had been brought to the Law Enforcement Department.</p>
 <p>As such, there was simply no one that could exonerate Chu Feng. Therefore, Li Rui’s master could say whatever he wanted to right now. Chu Feng was truly facing a great catastrophe, truly about to be killed.</p>
 <p>“This medicinal pellet is indeed very powerful. If I were still a Royal-cloak World Spiritist, I would really not be able to do anything to that medicinal pellet.”</p>
 <p>“However, I am an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist now. As such, I possess certainty in being able to undo the effect of the medicinal pellet,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Then how long will it take?” Eggy asked anxiously. She feared that there would not be enough time.</p>
 <p>“Rest assured, it will not be long,” Chu Feng said confidently.</p>
 <p>Although that medicinal pellet was capable of preventing Chu Feng from releasing his world spirit power outside of his body, it was unable to prevent Chu Feng from using spirit power within himself.</p>
 <p>At this moment, although Chu Feng still had a dejected and despair-filled expression on the surface, he was actually using his spirit power to undo the effect of that medicinal pellet within his body.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Chu Feng was brought to the entrance of the residence of the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master.</p>
 <p>After arriving at the entrance, Chu Feng was forced to kneel on the ground.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Li Rui’s master and the other Law Enforcement Elders all kneeled on the ground.</p>
 <p>“Subordinate Tuoba Shangshui request to see Lord Valley Master!!!” Li Rui’s master said respectfully.</p>
 <p>Not long after he said those words, the entrance to that palace slowly opened.</p>
 <p>Looking through the entrance, Chu Feng was able to see that there was a middle-aged looking man sitting on the main seat in the palace.</p>
 <p>He had a very handsome and youthful appearance. However, his airs and manners of bearing were extraordinary.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was able to sense the aura of someone who had lived for thousands of years. It was not something that could be hidden with merely his youthful face.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the same sort of twilight as Xu Yiyi’s master was lingering on his body. That was an abnormal sign.</p>
 <p>Evidently, this person was the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master.</p>
 <p>“Elder Tuoba, for you to come to my place at such a time, could there be some important matter?” The Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master asked.</p>
 <p>“Elder Tuoba, who is that youngster?” Suddenly, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master turned his gaze to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Lord Valley Master, this man is called Chu Feng. He killed Luyang’s Pavilion’s Pavilion Master Chu Luyang. This subordinate wishes to request Lord Valley Master to convict him of his crimes,” Li Rui’s master said.</p>
 <p>“What? Chu Luyang was killed?” Upon hearing that Chu Luyang was killed, the Sunset Cloud Valley’s Valley Master’s expression changed slightly. Then, in a skeptical manner, he asked, “You said that Chu Luyang has been killed by this youngster?”</p>
