 <p><strong>&nbsp;Chapter 2394 - Feeling Of Danger</strong></p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, truth be told, although we have come for the sake of saving Kong Cheng, there would not be a need to trouble our Lord Supreme Elder for something like that.”</p>
 <p>“If it wasn’t for the fact that we heard you were here, our Lord Supreme Elder would simply not have come here.”</p>
 <p>“He has not come for the sake of taking care of that so-called monster. Rather, he has come to invite you to be a guest of our Kong Heavenly Clan.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, little friend Chu Feng, we hope that you will be able to disregard our former hatred and give our Kong Heavenly Clan face.”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Little friend Chu Feng, our Lord Supreme Elder rarely ever invites others; you must give him face.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, the experts from the Kong Heavenly Clan began to urge Chu Feng with kind words.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, we were in the wrong back then. I hope that little friend Chu Feng will be magnanimous, and not take those things earlier to heart.”</p>
 <p>In fact, the ones from the Kong Heavenly Clan that ended up clashing with Chu Feng at the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds were actually also present.</p>
 <p>They took the initiative to walk forward and apologize to Chu Feng. Evidently, the Kong Heavenly Clan had already prepared beforehand so as to successfully invite Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Kong Cheng, Kong Zheng, little friend Chu Feng is our Kong Heavenly Clan’s honored guest. The two of you actually offended him enormously earlier. Why are you still standing there? Quickly, apologize to little friend Chu Feng,” Someone shouted at Kong Cheng and Kong Zheng.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>At that moment, Kong Cheng and Kong Zheng looked to one another.</p>
 <p>The two of them were no fools. They were able to tell that their Kong Heavenly Clan was truly planning to rope in Chu Feng and the others.</p>
 <p>As for the two of them, they absolutely could not become obstacles to their Kong Heavenly Clan’s intention to rope in Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Thus, even though it was definitely damaging to their ego for the two of them to apologize to Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong, they were not the only ones with egos.</p>
 <p>When even their seniors and their Supreme Elder were willing to apologize to Chu Feng, what could their small egos possibly amount to?</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, Zhao Hong, Wang Qiang, we truly did not know about your previous accomplishments and deeds earlier.”</p>
 <p>“However, we have now know been made aware of them. We brothers feel admiration for you all from the bottom of our hearts. As people of the younger generation, you three have truly honored us.”</p>
 <p>“We will not bother with superfluous words; please accept a bow of respect from us brothers.”</p>
 <p>After deciding, Kong Cheng and Kong Zheng bowed respectfully to Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.</p>
 <p>“N-never w-would I have i-imagined that you a-all a-actually possess a bit of s-sincerity. S-since that’s the case, b-brother, let’s j-just go a-and stroll a-around the Kong Heavenly Clan,” Wang Qiang said to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you should go. How could you catch the tiger cub without entering the tiger’s lair?” Her Lady Queen’s voice sounded in Chu Feng’s ear again.</p>
 <p>As matters stood, Chu Feng had actually already made his considerations. If the Kong Heavenly Clan truly planned to do something to them, they were totally capable of attacking them right now. There was simply no need for them to spend that much effort to invite them to the Kong Heavenly Clan.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng felt that while it was true that the Kong Heavenly Clan would be dangerous to go to, the danger was relatively small.</p>
 <p>To put it differently, even if they were truly plotting something by inviting Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong to be their guests, Chu Feng was capable of contending against them with his Evil God Sword.</p>
 <p>To put it briefly, even if they were to encounter danger after reaching the Kong Heavenly Clan, it would only be about as dangerous as facing the experts present here.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, Chu Feng was truly anxious to reach a breakthrough in cultivation. If he wanted to obtain Grandmaster Kai Hong’s treasures, he would have to proceed for the Kong Heavenly Clan sooner or later.</p>
 <p>If he were to refuse the Kong Heavenly Clan’s invitation this time around, he might end up displeasing the Kong Heavenly Clan. In the future, even if he wanted to go to the Kong Heavenly Clan, it would become extremely difficult to do so.</p>
 <p>Rather than being discriminating like that, it was better to resolve their conflicts now.</p>
 <p>It was as Her Lady Queen said, how could one catch a tiger cub without entering the tiger’s lair? A risk that must be taken would have to be taken sooner or later.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng said, “Actually, I have heard about the fame of the Kong Heavenly Clan, and have always wanted to pay a visit. For seniors to be willing to invite me over today, I, Chu Feng, am truly honored.”</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng is currently a mighty genius-level character in our Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. For our Kong Heavenly Clan to be able to invite little friend Chu Feng over as a guest is the honor of our Kong Heavenly Clan,” After seeing that Chu Feng agreed to it, that Kong Heavenly Clan’s Supreme Elder revealed a joyous expression.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the others from the Kong Heavenly Clan, those people that previously all had conflicts with Chu Feng, all heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>After all, if they were unable to successfully invite Chu Feng this time around, they would definitely not be able to escape responsibility, and would become sinners.</p>
 <p>“Then, little friends, might the two of you also be willing to come to our Kong Heavenly Clan as guests?” Kong Shunlian turned to Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang.</p>
 <p>After all, Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang had also shown off their abilities at the Extremely Remote Unmarked Burial Mounds. The Kong Heavenly Clan also did not dare neglect these two geniuses.</p>
 <p>In fact, it was not only the Kong Heavenly Clan. At that moment, the entire Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm was discussing these three geniuses: Chu Feng, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was, at the very least, already slightly famous before all this. Thus, at that moment, the people of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm were even more interested in Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong. After all, compared to Chu Feng, the two of them were even more mysterious.</p>
 <p>“I’ll g-go w-wherever my b-brother goes,” Wang Qiang said indifferently. However, he had declared his standpoint.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the crowd all cast their eyes to Zhao Hong. As Wang Qiang had declared his standpoint, the only person remaining was Zhao Hong.</p>
 <p>“Everyone, might you all please give the three of us some personal space?” Zhao Hong said to the people from the Kong Heavenly Clan.</p>
 <p>“Of course,” How could someone of Kong Shunlian’s calibre possibly not understand what Zhao Hong meant with those words? He immediately ordered the people of the Kong Heavenly Clan to withdraw. Then, he himself also withdrew.</p>
 <p>At that moment, only Chu Feng, Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang remained in that region of space.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Zhao Hong waved her arm. As her sleeve fluttered, a burst of sweet aroma arrived as a layer of spirit formation covered the three of them.</p>
 <p>That was a concealment formation. Being inside it, it would be very difficult for anyone outside to hear their conversation.</p>
 <p>Even a True Immortal-level expert who possessed the ability to survey heaven and earth from afar would be unable to hear their conversation.</p>
 <p>After all… this concealment formation was a technique from Grandmaster Kai Hong’s inheritance; it was a very powerful spirit formation.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, husband, the two of you must be extremely careful when you go to the Kong Heavenly Clan.”</p>
 <p>“It is not that I do not trust that Kong Shunlian. Merely, I truly do not trust the Kong Heavenly Clan,” Zhao Hong said to Chu Feng and Wang Qiang.</p>
 <p>“Zhao Hong, you’re not planning to go with us?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, my husband has managed to successfully retrieve the treasures and obtained a bountiful harvest.”</p>
 <p>“Right now, you are proceeding toward the Kong Heavenly Clan for the sake of obtaining your treasures too.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, I am also very interested in seeing exactly what the treasures that belong to me would be like,” Zhao Hong said.</p>
 <p>“That’s a good plan. Wang Qiang… why don’t you accompany Zhao Hong instead?” Chu Feng said to Wang Qiang.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need. It’s better that my husband accompany you. Compared to my destination, the Phoenix Flame City, I feel that the Kong Heavenly Clan is a much more dangerous place. I feel that it is better for the two of you to go together so that you can look after each other,” Zhao Hong said.</p>
 <p>“It is precisely because this journey is very dangerous that I do not wish for Wang Qiang to accompany me.”</p>
 <p>“Let alone, the Phoenix Flame City is also a dangerous location. I will feel more relieved for the two of you to journey together,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“B-brother, you a-are a-acting very boringly here. Do I, W-Wang Qiang, look like s-someone who will abandon my b-brother?” Wang Qiang said in a slightly displeased manner. He had made it clear that he wanted to accompany Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Zhao Hong did not show the slightest bit of displeasure from Wang Qiang’s desire to accompany Chu Feng. Instead, she said, “My husband has already made his decision. Chu Feng, you don’t have to urge him against it anymore; just allow him to accompany you.”</p>
 <p>“Zhao Hong, since you’re by yourself, you must be extra careful. After all, the Phoenix Flame City is one of the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm’s forbidden areas” Seeing that Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang had made their decisions, Chu Feng stopped trying to urge them against it. Merely, he was worried for Zhao Hong from the bottom of his heart.</p>
