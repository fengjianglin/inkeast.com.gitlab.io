However, as Chu Feng continued to put forth effort, increased his cultivation and brought honor and protection to the Chu Family, Chu Feng was finally acknowledged by the people of the Chu Family.</span></p>

It was a past that belonged to him. Compared to the youthful and inexperienced him, Chu Feng had grown into a much stronger man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Back when he was bullied and humiliated, Chu Feng had hatred in his heart.

After a bit of observation, Chu Feng headed toward the Azure Dragon School.</span></p>

Its sceneries were very pleasant. It was like an immortal mountain. One could tell from a single glance that it was a place where martial cultivators gathered.</span></p>

If one had to find a change, then it would be that the Azure Dragon School had become much more prosperous.</span></p>

Instead, it had become the strongest sect in the entire Nine Provinces Continent.</span></p>

They were proceeding toward the entrance of the Azure Dragon School.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What excitement. Could it be that it’s the time when the Azure Dragon School accepts new disciples?” Her Lady Queen asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That must be the case,” Chu Feng had a smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally, Chu Feng was planning to fly directly to the entrance. However, he suddenly changed his mind, and descended to the ground. He began to climb the mountain with the crowd. Slowly, he began to approach the entrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big brother Chu Feng.”</span></p>

Someone actually called out Chu Feng’s name.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was a disciple from the Azure Dragon School.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Feng knew right away from the outfit that this disciple was wearing that he was an inner court disciple.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, judging from his appearance, he should be a couple years younger than Chu Feng. That said, Chu Feng was certain that he did not know this person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big brother Chu Feng, it really is you! Heavens! You’ve finally returned!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After verifying that it was Chu Feng, that inner court disciple quickly walked over to Chu Feng. He had an extremely excited expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Chu Feng? He seemed to be saying that that person is Chu Feng?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heavens, he really does look like him. He couldn’t possibly really be Lord Chu Feng, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Originally, Chu Feng did not draw any attention whilst traveling with the crowd. However, after that inner court disciple called out to him, he immediately caught the attention of the surrounding crowd.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, the people that were climbing the mountain all stopped and surrounded him. They were staring at him as if they were surveying a rare animal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That said, their gazes were not only those of curiosity. They were also filled with reverence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, Chu Feng’s name was already renowned throughout the entire Nine Provinces Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, Chu Feng could even be said to be the most legendary individual to have ever appeared in the Nine Provinces Continent after Qing Xuantian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing someone as legendary as Chu Feng, the crowd were, apart from feeling excited, wondering whether what they were seeing was real.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They began to doubt if they were truly so fortunate to be able to see the legendary Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That said, Chu Feng did not pay attention to the crowd’s pleasantly surprised yet skeptical gazes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chu Feng had grown used to that sort of gaze. Thus, he was only looking at the man before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Big brother Chu Feng, you must’ve forgotten about me, no?” That inner court disciple asked Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You are?” Chu Feng tried to remember the people he had met. However, he truly did not recall this man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, it’s very normal for you to not remember me. After all, we only met once,” that inner court disciple smiled embarrassedly.</span></p>
