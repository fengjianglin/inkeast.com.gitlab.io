 <p><strong> Chapter 2034 - Breaching The Camps</strong></p>
 <p>“Sigh…” When mentioning this matter, Zhang Ming started to sigh.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, that matter is truly difficult,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said as he shook his head. As for the Snow-haired Immortal, she lowered her head silently.</p>
 <p>They had begun to search for the Dark Hall’s camps ever since they had arrived at this place. However, even now, their search had come up empty-handed.</p>
 <p>“Seniors, truth be told, I was in closed-door training the entire time before you all arrived so that I could prepare some things.”</p>
 <p>As Chu Feng spoke, he took out four masks. Those were all masks that the people from the Dark Hall wore.</p>
 <p>“Those are!!!”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing the masks, the three Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists’ eyes all shone as they revealed expressions of shock. Unable to contain themselves, they took the masks from Chu Feng and began to inspect them carefully. After a careful inspection, the shocked expressions on the faces of the three Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists grew even denser.</p>
 <p>“Unbelievable, truly unbelievable!!!”</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, your abilities have reached a godly level!!!” At that moment, Zhang Ming praised Chu Feng without holding anything back.</p>
 <p>“And I even thought about taking Chu Feng as my disciple before. Looking back at it now, I was truly overestimating my capabilities. Chu Feng, I should instead ask you to become my master. Please accept me as your disciple,” The Snow-haired Immortal was overjoyed. She who possessed an honest nature actually started to joke around with Chu Feng, requesting him to take her as his disciple.</p>
 <p>“It would seem that the Dark Hall will likely end up suffering now,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal stroked his beard. A smile filled his face.</p>
 <p>“Everyone, exactly what use do those masks have?” At that moment, it was the Elf King who was completely confused.</p>
 <p>Although he was extremely powerful, he was not a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. Thus, even though he possessed many detection methods, he was unable to discover what was so fantastic about the masks.</p>
 <p>“These masks were deliberately left behind by me when I was massacring the Dark Hall’s army that day.”</p>
 <p>“The reason why I was in closed-door training for the past days was to work on these masks. Right now, as long as a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist is urging it, one could discover the people from the Dark Hall through the use of those masks,” Chu Feng explained.</p>
 <p>“It’s not ‘could’. Rather, it’s absolutely able to. Upon finding the people from the Dark Hall, no matter how well-hidden their camps might be, they will still be exposed.”</p>
 <p>“Your Majesty, little friend Chu Feng is truly your lucky star. Not only did he bring back the stone army that greatly increased our battle power, he has also found the method for us to strike back at the Dark Hall,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said happily.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, it would appear that the person that will determine victory or defeat in the battle against the Dark Hall will be you instead of me,” At that moment, the Elf King was also overjoyed.</p>
 <p>He had to stay in the Elf Kingdom to protect it because he was worried that the Dark Hall’s Hall Master would mount an attack against it. As such, there were very few things that he could do to contribute to the battle.</p>
 <p>Even though they were forced into a passive state when fighting against the Dark Hall, there was nothing he could do. Other than worrying about it, the only other thing he could do was worry more.</p>
 <p>However, today, Chu Feng had brought enormously great news to him. As such, how could he not be overjoyed?</p>
 <p>His bellyful of fury was finally able to be released.</p>
 <p>After that, Chu Feng and the three other Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists began to move about separately. By relying on the masks, they began to search for the Dark Hall’s camps around the various Elf territories.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, the masks were useful. One after another, they managed to scope out the Dark Hall’s base camps. All those base camps that were discovered would be met with ruthless attacks by them. Even if there were people from the Dark Hall that managed to escape, their numbers were not very large.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the Ancient Era’s Elves obtained absolute dominance in the battle against the Dark Hall.</p>
 <p>With no other option, the Dark Hall’s armies all started to retreat. However, they suffered disastrous casualties even in retreat.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>At that moment. In a pitch-black location. Only several torches were burning.</p>
 <p>Although the light from the torches was dim, it managed to roughly illuminate the general composition of the area.</p>
 <p>It was an enormous area. It looked like a palace hall, yet also like an underground tomb. However, one thing was certain; this was an extremely well-hidden location.</p>
 <p>As the torches burned, crackling sounds began to be heard nonstop. This caused this dimly lit place to appear somewhat eerie.</p>
 <p>However, the eerie sound of the burning torches fell short to the voices that occasionally sounded from below. Although those sounds sounded like yelling, they resembled anguished wailing even more. Those anguished wails contained endless rage and dense killing intent. It was as if demonic chanting were sounding from below. Hearing those sounds, one could feel one’s hair stand on end.</p>
 <p>At that moment, there were several people in that place. One was the Dark Hall’s Hall Master. He was currently sitting on an extremely imposing seat and looking at two people down below. Standing beside him was a beautiful woman. That woman was the mysterious woman by the name of Xue Ji.</p>
 <p>As for the two people that the Dark Hall’s Hall Master were looking at, they were currently kneeling on the ground and shivering in fear. Upon closer inspection, they were the World Devastator Immortal and the Immeasurable Immortal.</p>
 <p>“I had thought that the two of you had died. It turns out that you’re still alive. If I were you, I would have definitely not dared to show my face again,” The Dark Hall’s Hall Master said to the two men.</p>
 <p>“Lord Hall Master, please listen to me, please listen to me.”</p>
 <p>“You really cannot blame this matter on us. I never expected Chu Feng to be that cunning. He had already seen through my identity before we set off for the Wonderstone Dao Ground. His bringing me to the Wonderstone Dao Ground was a trap to begin with.”</p>
 <p>“Fortunately, Lord World Devastator arrived promptly. Otherwise, I would definitely have been killed,” The Immeasurable Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“Rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, coldness flashed through the Dark Hall’s Hall Master’s eyes. Then, chilliness began to sweep across the ground. That burst of chilliness blew the World Devastator Immortal and the Immeasurable Immortal away, sending them rolling and crawling on the ground. They were ruthlessly blown tens of thousands of meters away, only stopping after they crashed into a wall.</p>
 <p>At that moment, that Dark Hall’s Hall Master left his seat. He slowly descended from mid air and stood before the two men.</p>
 <p>He said, “Chu Feng led the stone army to many of my Dark Hall’s camps. The battlefield that was completely controlled by us was reversed because of a single Chu Feng.”</p>
 <p>“The reason why this happened is because the two of you did not promptly notify me of what had happened. I am able to understand your defeats. But, since you had successfully escaped, why did you not promptly come back to report what had happened to me, so that I could guard against what was to come?”</p>
 <p>“Lord Hall Master, this is all my fault. The stones from the Wonderstone Dao Ground were truly too powerful. That day, I was injured by the stones, and was simply unable to journey nonstop. I was forced to quickly heal my injuries. Otherwise, it would end up being detrimental to my future cultivation.”</p>
 <p>“As for Immeasurable, his physical body was destroyed by Chu Feng. Only his spirit remained. His situation was even worse than mine.”</p>
 <p>“After I healed my injuries, I ended up creating a new physical body for him, and tried my hardest so that he could retain his cultivation.”</p>
 <p>“That was why we ended up being delayed for some days. But, we truly never expected so many things to happen in such a short period of time,” The World Devastator Immortal explained.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Lord Hall Master, even if Chu Feng had obtained those Wonderstone Dao Ground’s stones, he should have only been able to increase the Ancient Era’s Elves’ battle power.”</p>
 <p>“As for those camps that we constructed around the various Ancient Era’s Elves’ territories, they were personally constructed by you. No matter what, they shouldn’t have been able to discover them. Thus, how was it that those camps were attacked?” The Immeasurable Immortal asked in a very puzzled manner.</p>
 <p>He had attempted to search for the camps before with his world spirit techniques. However, even though the camps were clearly nearby, he had been unable to sense anything.</p>
 <p>Camps like that should have been impossible to be discovered. Yet now, they were all attacked. How did that come to be?</p>
 <p>“The camps are hidden because of world spirit techniques. The fact that the camps were discovered naturally means that someone broke through my world spirit techniques.”</p>
 <p>“I, to a greater or lesser degree, know the abilities of the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the others. With their abilities, it’s definitely impossible for them to break through my world spirit techniques,” The Dark Hall’s Hall Master said.</p>
 <p>“Could it be… the Heaven Reaching Immortal? Could the Heaven Reaching Immortal be helping the Ancient Era’s Elves?” The World Devastator Immortal asked.</p>
 <p>Upon thinking closely, he felt that the only person in the Holy Land of Martialism with world spirit techniques comparable to their Lord Hall Master would be the person who was ranked first among the Ten Immortals, the Heaven Reaching Immortal.</p>
 <p>Although he was ranked second, and the Heaven Reaching Immortal was only a single rank above him, he knew that the difference between him and the Heaven Reaching Immortal was akin to the difference between heaven and earth; they were simply at two different levels.</p>
