 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although using gambling as a form of entertainment was a method permitted by the Starfield Master Realm, there was a time limit where it was allowed - merely an incense stick’s worth of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After an incense stick’s worth of time had passed, the crystal pillars were sealed, and people were no longer able to place bets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The final result of the betting ended up with an overwhelming dominance for Chu Feng. Chu Feng became the most supported individual in winning the competition.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This outcome was very dramatic. After all, before the betting session began, no one had anticipated such an outcome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ones that had changed the situation were Grandmaster Liangqiu and the others. Not only did they give enormous support for Chu Feng, but their enormous support also changed the opinions the crowd held of him, and led to many people that did not know how strong Chu Feng really was to choose to place their bets on him too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the betting ended, the curtains were lifted for the actual show.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man with the enormous writing brush was called Wuming Ken. Wuming Ken had been the person presiding over the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars for many years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he was not a peak expert amongst the experts of the Starfield Master Realm, he possessed great prestige. He was someone with a very high status. Thus, he was acknowledged to be the one presiding over the selection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, Wuming Ken took an item from his Cosmos Sack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a gate. The gate was very small, and looked like a card.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Woosh~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Wuming Ken raised his arm, not only did that gate soar into the sky, but it also began to rapidly expand in size. In the end, it turned into an enormous gate over ten thousand meters tall, and landed on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once the gate appeared, some people became excited, whereas others started feeling nervous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of the people of the younger generation that would be participating in the selection would have to enter that gate. The first hundred people that managed to exit the gate would be qualified to enter the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound to receive the true test.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for all the others, they would be eliminated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wuming Ken began to give the crowd details regarding the usage of the gate, as well as its rules.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What he stated was precisely what the crowd was thinking. The gate was the spirit formation that would select the one hundred people that would advance from a crowd of several hundred thousand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In the martial cultivation world where the weak are prey to the strong, any sort of selection would be a cruel one. However, we will try our best to have fairness within the rules. As long as you possess the strength, you will definitely succeed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“For the sake of fairness, everyone will be able to challenge the ten people on the Apex Pillars before entering the grand formation. As long as you succeed in your challenge, you will be able to stand atop the Apex Pillar and directly obtain the qualifications to enter the next round. However, should you fail your challenge, you will be directly eliminated.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Now then, if there is anyone that is unwilling to accept any of the ten individuals on the Apex Pillars, you can directly ascend onto the Apex Pillars,” Wuming Ken said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Woosh~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once Wuming Ken’s words left his mouth, over a dozen figures flew out and arrived on Chu Feng’s Apex Pillar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those were all the geniuses from the Gong Heavenly Clan. They were all feeling extreme unwillingness to accept Chu Feng the entire time. Thus, the challenge for the Apex Pillars served as the best opportunity for them to defeat him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Gong, it seems that there are a lot of your clan’s younger generations that are unwilling to accept that Chu Feng,” An old friend of the Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief that stood beside him teased him with a smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They are truly too insensible,” The Gong Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief did not look good. As matters stood, he no longer wanted to continue to offend Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he could not stop the challenge of the Apex Pillars. After all, that was presided over by the Starfield Master Realm. No one would dare to unleash their martial power at will in that place, even if it was toward their own clan’s younger generations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the Gong Heavenly Clan’s younger generations flew over, there were many other people from the younger generation that flew over and landed on Chu Feng’s Apex Pillar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the blink of an eye, there were close to ten thousand people that landed on Chu Feng’s Apex Pillar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, the area above the Apex Pillar was quite large. However, after all those people landed on it, his Apex Pillar seemed to be quite crowded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, of the ten Apex Pillars, only Chu Feng’s Apex Pillar was packed full with people. As for the remaining nine Apex Pillars, there was not a single challenger on them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sort of scene created a clear-cut contrast!!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one dared to challenge Linghu Yueyue and the others. In fact, no one dared to even challenge Wuma Shengjie.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, there were many people that came forth to challenge Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their behavior was openly showing contempt toward him!!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s going on? How could so many people look down on Chu Xuanyuan’s son in such a manner?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many people revealed puzzled looks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What's confusing about that? Isn’t it rumored that Chu Feng’s only a rank one True Immortal? Many people have come to participate in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars in the hopes of making gains in the chaos with their luck. They simply have no chance of obtaining any rank with their own strength.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As for that Chu Feng, he is a great opportunity for them to make gains among the chaos. If Chu Feng is truly a genius, they will, at the very most, be eliminated. To people like them, it would not affect them at all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, if Chu Feng is trash, it would mean that their chance has arrived,” Someone analyzed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That person’s analysis was correct. Amongst the people that went up to challenge Chu Feng, there were those that looked down on Chu Feng. For example, the people of the Gong Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were like that. They had personally witnessed Chu Feng being weak, and were confident that they would be able to defeat him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, more than those sort of people, the majority of them were trying to take advantage of the chaos.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One thing worthy of mentioning was that the Xu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations that had conflicts with Chu Feng seemed to have made some sort of agreement, as there was not a single one of them that went up to challenge Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Move aside! I was the first to arrive on this Apex Pillar!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This sort of thing must be first come, first served. He who defeats that Chu Feng first will be able to stay here. The rest shall all scram.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Due to the fact that there were very few people that would dare to challenge the Apex Pillars in the past, something completely unprecedented had happened. With all those people on Chu Feng’s Apex Pillar, they actually began to argue amongst themselves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop fighting! Challenging the Apex Pillar is not a matter of first come, first served. Nor is it that he who defeats the master of the Apex Pillar first shall stay. Instead, the person who is standing on the Apex Pillar in the end is the person that’s qualified to remain on the Apex Pillar,” Wuming Ken suddenly spoke and presented an answer to the crowd</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah? The person who manages to stay on the Apex Pillar till the end?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hearing those words, many of the people that went up to the Apex Pillar with the intention to take advantage of the chaos started to feel headaches.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their strength was lacking to begin with. It was definitely impossible for them to defeat all those people and be the last person standing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, that’s right. There’s a matter that this old man will have to add.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound will be the next challenge. Inside, there are nine keys. Those who obtain the nine keys will be able to gain dominance inside the Nine Dragons Abnormal Sign Mound.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As for the nine keys, they are held by the people on the Apex Pillars. However, as there are only nine keys, one person is destined to be unable to obtain one.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“For the sake of fairness, we will hold a match and randomly select two people on the Apex Pillars to fight. The loser will lose the chance to obtain a key.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As for the random selection, it will be done by this old man.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Wuming Ken spoke, he began the random selection, and took out two slips of paper from the ten slips of paper with the names of the people on the Apex Pillars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apart from Linghu Yueyue, Linghu Tiemian and several others, some people on the Apex Pillars started to grow nervous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were afraid of being selected. If they were unlucky enough to be selected and matched with opponents like Linghu Yueyue, they would definitely be screwed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, they knew very well how powerful Linghu Yueyue was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chu Feng and Linghu Mingye,” Wuming Ken raised the two slips of paper and spoke loudly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Milord, when will their match start?” Asked the people of the younger generation standing on Chu Feng’s Apex Pillar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Their match will begin at once. Including all of you, the final victor will be qualified to obtain the key,” said Wuming Ken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? Wouldn’t that mean that our opponent is not Chu Feng, but rather Linghu Mingye?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, the people of the younger generation that went up to challenge Chu Feng all felt despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Linghu Mingye was the fifth ranked of the Ancestral Martial Decastars. He was very powerful. The people that went up to challenge Chu Feng all knew that they would be no match for Linghu Mingye. In fact, many people felt that he was a target that they couldn’t possibly surmount.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, not to mention the people of the younger generation that went up to the Apex Pillars, even the bystanders felt that those people of the younger generation that went up to challenge Chu Feng were truly unlucky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were also people that sighed, thinking that Chu Feng was the one that was truly unlucky. He had managed to stand atop the Apex Pillar with great difficulty, yet he was immediately met with this many challengers. It would be one thing if that were all there were. Yet, he now had Linghu Mingye as his opponent too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that sort of situation, many people began to worry for Chu Feng. This included not only the people that bet on Chu Feng, but also included people that were sincerely worried for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example, Gong Qing was one such person. At that moment, she was holding her hands tightly, so tightly that they were sweating, out of worry for Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, right at that moment, a voice sounded. That voice shocked everyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I admit defeat,” Linghu Mingye said loudly.</span></p>
