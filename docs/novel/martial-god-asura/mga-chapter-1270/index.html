 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1270 - Prisoners</strong></p>
 <p>“Wuuuaoooouuu~~~~~~~~~”</p>
 <p>A snarl, a hissing toward the sky churned the vast sea of blood into great waves.</p>
 <p>After the snarl from the Monstrous Dragon Beast king, the body of water that was dyed red with the Monstrous Dragon Beasts’ blood began to surge and rage.</p>
 <p>At the same time, all of the Monstrous Dragon Beasts opened their enormous mouths and began to emit ear-piercingly strange snarls in order to express their anger.</p>
 <p>Their snarls sounded like both the roars of tigers and also the howls of wolves. It was extremely strange. However, if one thing must be admitted, it would be that their snarls were extremely threatening.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, everybody present were cultivators with an extraordinary cultivation. If ordinary people had heard those snarls, they would have been scared to death.</p>
 <p>“Puuu~~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a change occurred to the Monstrous Dragon Beast king’s mouth. It suddenly shot a mouthful of black liquid toward Bai Yunxiao from within its enormous mouth.</p>
 <p>“Woosh, woosh, woosh.”</p>
 <p>Seeing this, Bai Yunxiao immediately began to brandish the Royal Armament spear in his hand to block the incoming black liquid.</p>
 <p>“Pow, pow, pow.”</p>
 <p>As the spear swept through the air, its swings formed an indestructible shield. Even though that black liquid was extremely frantic, it ended up being blocked by Bai Yunxiao’s Royal Armament.</p>
 <p>However, after Bai Yunxiao blocked the attack, before he could feel pleased with himself, his eyebrows began to frown. He was shocked to discover that although the attack from the Monstrous Dragon Beast king was easily blocked, a stink continued to linger on his Royal Armament.</p>
 <p>“Haha, little bastard from the Cyanwood Mountain, how do you like the smell of this monstrous king’s saliva?” The Monstrous Dragon Beast king emitted an ear-piercing laugh.</p>
 <p>“Hahahaha…” Following that, all of the Monstrous Dragon Beasts that had their mouths wide open did not snarl in rage anymore. Instead, they all began to emit ridiculing laughter.</p>
 <p>It turned out that the black liquid that the Monstrous Dragon Beast king had shot out from its mouth was not an amazing attack at all. Instead, it was only a mouthful of spit.</p>
 <p>For a mouthful of spit to be warded off so seriously by Bai Yunxiao was something that caused people to inevitably feel funny, as a mouthful of spit could not be considered to be much.</p>
 <p>“The ones courting death are you all.”</p>
 <p>Being ridiculed by a group of animals in front of this many people caused Bai Yunxiao to become extremely angry. His eyes turned strange, and then a very powerful aura began to emerge from his body like a hurricane. It began to twist the surrounding space and cause the water’s surface below him to form ripple after ripple.</p>
 <p>At this moment, he, a genius disciple of the Cyanwood Mountain, had decided to go all out.</p>
 <p>“Kill this bunch of animals, leave not a single one alive.”</p>
 <p>“Kill~~~~~~~~”</p>
 <p>Finally, Bai Yunxiao gave the order. Once he spoke those words, Tao Xiangyu and the others all took out their respective Royal Armaments and prepared to massacre once again. They planned to completely eliminate this bunch of Monstrous Dragon Beasts.</p>
 <p>“Hualalalala.” [1.splashing sfx]</p>
 <p>However, right at the moment when Bai Yunxiao and the other were planning to attack, the Monstrous Dragon Beasts, under the leadership of their king, overturned their bodies and dove deep into the water. They looked as if they were planning to flee.</p>
 <p>“Regardless of where you try to flee, you all will definitely die,” Seeing this, Bai Yunxiao and the others also dove into the water to chase after the fleeing Monstrous Dragon Beasts.</p>
 <p>“Earlier, they acted with such grandeur. Yet, it turns out that they’re only a bunch of cowards. This bunch of Monstrous Dragon Beasts will definitely be killed.”</p>
 <p>“It’s not that the Monstrous Dragon Beasts are weak. Instead, it’s that the Cyanwood Mountain’s disciples are too strong. Who could possibly be able to contend against them? I suspect that there is no one among the Martial Kings that can contend against these six disciples.”</p>
 <p>Seeing this scene, cheers began to sound once again. Those disciples who were not from the Cyanwood Mountain were praising Bai Yunxiao and the others as if they were gods.</p>
 <p>Hearing these cheers, the elders and disciples of the Cyanwood Mountain were extremely pleased. That was because this was precisely the result that they wanted; they wanted to have everyone realize how powerful their Cyanwood Mountain’s disciples were.</p>
 <p>“Is this for real? Isn’t that Monstrous Dragon Beast king a bit too weak? He actually started fleeing already?” However, when Bai Ruochen and Sima Ying saw this, both of them were extremely disappointed.</p>
 <p>The two of them had both hoped that the Monstrous Dragon Beasts would shame Bai Yunxiao and the others, and thus appease their hearts’ resentments. However, the result before their eyes was completely different than what they had wanted.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be so anxious, the show is just starting,” Compared to the others, Chu Feng only smiled lightly. His eyes were fixed on the body of water. It was as if he was waiting to watch a grand show.</p>
 <p>“Buzz.”</p>
 <p>Sure enough, not long after Bai Yunxiao and the others dived into the water, wave upon wave of motion began to sound from the depths of the lake. The water’s surface, which was dyed red by blood, began to flare up.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, layer upon layer of energy that could be seen with the naked eye began to boil over from that region of water. In the blink of an eye, that region of previously peaceful water turned extremely frightening.</p>
 <p>“Crap, the water’s a trap.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, the expressions of the management elders on the master viewing platform changed greatly. They possessed very powerful strength and sharp perception. Thus, they had already discovered that this region of water was changing.</p>
 <p>“Eeeeaahhhhh~~~~~~”</p>
 <p>However, it was already too late. By the time they discovered the change, the hysterical yells of their Cyanwood Mountain’s disciples had already sounded from the depths of the water. While the voice sounded like a roar, it simultaneously sounded like a scream.</p>
 <p>When they were unable to see what was happening in the depths of the water even after using all of their observation techniques, the elders began to feel even more uneasy.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the elders of the Punishment Department were unable to sit tight anymore. One by one, they stood up and seemed to be prepared to interfere.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be flustered, if you are to interfere now, wouldn’t it only disgrace our Cyanwood Mountain?”</p>
 <p>Right at the moment when many elders were planning to act, one of the Punishment Department’s management elders shouted with a soft voice.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, the Punishment Department’s elders hesitated and ultimately sat back down.</p>
 <p>That was because what that elder said was correct. They had invited all these people so that they could display their might to them, display how powerful their Cyanwood Mountain’s disciples were.</p>
 <p>However, if the disciples were to fail this mission and the elders were required to resolve the matter, then it would all be for naught. This would no longer be the perfect opportunity to cow all of the powers in the Cyanwood Mountain. Instead, it would be a show of disgrace.</p>
 <p>Thus, unless absolutely necessarily, the elders could not interfere, and had to allow Bai Yunxiao and the others to settle this on their own.</p>
 <p>“Hualala.”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, motion sounded from the bloody water once again. In the end, a crimson-colored gaseous substance surged into the the sky. Several thousand crimson-colored rays of light shot out from the bloody water.</p>
 <p>Finally, under the leadership of the Monstrous Dragon Beast king, several thousand Monstrous Dragon Beasts emerged onto the water surface once again. Merely, at this moment, a strange light was being emitted from their crimson-colored eyes. And it was not only their eyes that had changed. Their bodies that were covered with black scales were actually emitting crimson-colored marks.</p>
 <p>Those marks were not only on their body, they were also spilling out from them and linking to one another like chains.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the Monstrous Dragon Beasts had formed a ring. In the center of the ring was a cage formed by their strange crimson-colored marks.</p>
 <p>The bloody cage was sealed extremely tightly, and could be said to be inescapable. However, it was actually translucent. Therefore, everyone was able to clearly see that there were six people in the cage.</p>
 <p>As for those six people, they were precisely Bai Yunxiao, Tao Xiangyu, Zhao Jingang, Qi Yanyu, Ben Leihu and Wang Jingzhi, the six disciples tasked with eliminating the Monstrous Dragon Beasts.</p>
 <p>Earlier, the six of them had been extremely imposing. They had chased after the Monstrous Dragon Beasts to massacre them, yet now, they had become prisoners.</p>
