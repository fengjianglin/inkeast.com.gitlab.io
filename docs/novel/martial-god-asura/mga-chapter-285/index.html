 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 285 - Looking for the Path of Death</strong></p>
 <p>“A tooth for a tooth, so that means that it was intentional?” After hearing Chu Feng’s words, the Lingyun School crowd was even more furious. Killing intent was revealed one after another, and they hated to be unable to rip Chu Feng into shreds.</p>
 <p>“Hmph. How did Dugu Aoyun treat my school head at first? As the host of the Hundred School Gathering, why didn’t you stand out to talk that time?”</p>
 <p>“The people from your Lingyun School are people, but other people aren’t people? I harm someone from your Lingyun School and you need me to pay the price, but where did you run off to when your Lingyun School injured my school head?”</p>
 <p>“As the number one school in the Azure Province, where is your fairness?” Chu Feng was not afraid even as he faced danger, and he even severely&nbsp;questioned back.</p>
 <p>“You...” As they faced Chu Feng’s consistent questioning, the faces of the crowd from the Lingyun School turned ashen and indeed, they could not retort.</p>
 <p>Accordingly, as long as Chu Feng did not kill Fenghao, they should not surround and attack Chu Feng. After all, Dugu Aoyun was the first to dislocate off Li Zhangqing’s arms.</p>
 <p>*bam bam bam...* Suddenly, a burst of clear and loud clapping sounds rang out.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha… Good good good.” Following that, abnormally strange laughter rang out as well. It was the head of the Lingyun School, Yan Yangtian.</p>
 <p>At that instant, he was standing on top of the tall stage with the might of a lord descending down to the world. As he looked down, he clapped and smiled while looking at Chu Feng but his eyes were filled with oddness.</p>
 <p>“It seems like quite an impressive disciple has appeared in the Azure Dragon School. Chu Feng, the title of the strongest disciple in this Hundred School Gathering belongs to you.” Yan Yangtian loudly declared after laughing.</p>
 <p>“Hu~”</p>
 <p>After Yan Yangtian spoke, even though the people from the Lingyun School were not willing to, they had no choice but to quickly retreat and they didn’t dare to attack Chu Feng anymore. Even the surrounding and observing schools were stunned.</p>
 <p>Yan Yangtian did not attack, and that caused them to think of a lot of things. First, it was possible that Yan Yangtian cherished Chu Feng’s talent. After all, Chu Feng’s battle power defied common sense so much, and from a certain angle, Chu Feng was a genius who had not appeared in the Azure Province before. If that battle power continued to be developed, one day, he would surpass Dugu Aoyun and become a huge character.</p>
 <p>However, after some more careful thinking, Yan Yangtian was not such a kindhearted person. The reason why his Lingyun School had grew to this current stage was because the methods of the Lingyun School had always been ruthless. Those who offended the Lingyun School would usually not end well.</p>
 <p>However, in front of so many people, Chu Feng cut off Fenghao’s arms. He slapped the Lingyun School’s face. He slapped Yan Yangtian’s face, so how was it possible that he so easily forgave him?</p>
 <p>So, the only possibility why Yan Yangtian did not do anything was because of Qi Fengyang. In the Azure Province, the only thing that Yan Yangtian feared was the Qilin Prince’s Mansion.</p>
 <p>Who was Chu Feng’s sworn elder brother? It was Qi Fengyang, the number two character in the Qilin Prince’s Mansion. No matter how much stronger Yan Yangtian’s strength was, no matter how much higher his position was, he still had to give some face to Qi Fengyang.</p>
 <p>If it was at first, people would still suspect why Qi Fengyang had to become sworn brothers with a boy like Chu Feng. However, after seeing Chu Feng’s super strong battle power, almost everyone understood Qi Fengyang’s intentions.</p>
 <p>That also meant that not only did Chu Feng have Qi Fengyang behind him, he also had the Qilin Prince’s Mansion, and under those situations, even if Yan Yangtian wanted to take care of Chu Feng, he naturally had to think for a while first.</p>
 <p>“Impressive. This Chu Feng has such talent and he also has the protection of the Qilin Prince’s Mansion behind him. How outstanding will his future achievements be like?”</p>
 <p>“The Azure Dragon School will really rise in power. Since the Azure Dragon School has such a disciple, the rising will only be a matter of time.”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, he gained the title of the strongest disciple in the Hundred School Gathering at this age. This is the first time it has happened in history, and Chu Feng is an unprecedented genius!”</p>
 <p>At that instant, other than the people from the Lingyun School, almost everyone was praising Chu Feng’s strength. They were predicting Chu Feng’s future, as though they saw the birth of a great character who would rule over the Azure Province.</p>
 <p>The various school heads felt envy towards the Azure Dragon School as such a disciple appeared, but at the same time, as they were also people from the Azure Province, they felt proud that such a genius appeared in the Azure Province.</p>
 <p>Almost everyone put their previous prejudices away from Chu Feng as nothing else remained in their eyes other than shock. Chu Feng already used his strength to prove to everyone that he was not trash. He was a genius.</p>
 <p>“No. the title of the strongest disciple is empty. I, Chu Feng, do not want it.” But just at that time, he pushed the title away because of dislike as he spoke.</p>
 <p>“What? Chu Feng doesn’t want the title of the strongest disciple?”</p>
 <p>After speaking, it was as if a frightening thunder exploded next to their ears and it caused everyone on scene to be greatly shocked. The title of being the strongest disciple that were the wishes in countless disciples’ dreams was unwanted by Chu Feng. What was he doing?</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, what do you mean?” Yan Yangtian lightly furrowed his brows and he spoke to ask.</p>
 <p>“Since the title is named as the strongest disciple, of course, it would be for the strongest disciple out of all the schools in the Azure Province.”</p>
 <p>“However, Dugu Aoyun, as the number one disciple of your Lingyun School, has not fought against me. So, my title of the strongest disciple is hollow. It’s fine if I don’t take it.” Chu Feng looked at Dugu Aoyun who was currently standing next to Yan Yangtian.</p>
 <p>“Haha, Chu Feng, you are challenging me?” Dugu Aoyun laughed loudly, and within his laugher was disdain and mock.</p>
 <p>“I, Chu Feng, will challenge you, Dugyu Aoyun. Do you dare to come down to fight against me?” Chu Feng’s gaze was like a torch as he pointed at Dugu Aoyun and loudly yelled.</p>
 <p>“Heavens! Is Chu Feng insane? He is actually going to challenge Dugu Aoyun?”</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng spoke, almost all the faces of the people on scene changed greatly and they were astounded. What level of strength did Dugu Aoyun have? He was the character who defeated the various school heads from the Azure Province and gained the title of the strongest school head!</p>
 <p>Even if Chu Feng had better talent, his cultivation still currently remained in the Origin realm. He might have been too insane since he challenged Dugu Aoyun because he was different than Fenghao. He was publicly recognized as the number one genius in the Azure Province</p>
 <p>Even the various school heads could not defeat him and he was almost invincible within the Profound realm. Some people even suspected Dugu Aoyun was the strongest person in the Azure Province other than the head of the Lingyun School and the lord&nbsp;of the Qilin Prince’s Mansion.</p>
 <p>Even the school heads were afraid of such a person, yet Chu Feng wanted to challenge him. Naturally, it caused people to be endlessly shocked and it was hard for them to accept it.</p>
 <p>“Haha, truly shameless big words. Is it even possible that I, Dugu Aoyun, am afraid of you?” Dugu Aoyun coldly smiled, and after that, he flashed and became a blur. He shot towards the fighting stage that Chu Feng was on and stood in front of Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“If we’re going to fight, why not make it a bit more interesting? Today, me and you will fight in front of all the school heads for the title of the strongest disciple in the Azure Province. The winner receives the glory, and the loser destroys their own cultivation. What do you think?” Chu Feng closely questioned.</p>
 <p>“Heavens! He’s insane! He has gone completely insane!” At that instant, almost everyone couldn’t help but take in a breath of cool air and they were deeply agitated by Chu Feng’s words.</p>
 <p>Not only was Chu Feng challenging Dugu Aoyun who had the cultivation of the 8th level of the Profound realm with his own cultivation of the 9th level of the Origin realm, he even set the rule so that the loser had to destroy their own cultivation. Wasn’t he just digging his own hole to fall back in it, and looking for a path to death?</p>
