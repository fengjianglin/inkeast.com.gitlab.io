 <p><strong>Chapter 2555 - Dearly Loved Individual</strong><br>　　<br>“Let’s go,” As Zi Xunyi spoke, she began to continue journeying with Chu Feng. At that moment, even the voice that she spoke with had changed. It was no longer lifeless, but rather filled with spirit.<br>　<br>“It seems that this Zi Xunyi deeply loved that Ying Mingchao.”<br>　<br>“I am truly curious as to what sort of story there was between the two of them,” Her Lady Queen said with a curious expression.<br>　<br>Even a fool could tell that Zi Xunyi had deliberately changed her appearance to meet Ying Mingchao.<br>　<br>Yet, when she was in the Demon Elimination Cave, Zi Xunyi clearly had the appearance of an old granny. Even though it was the day of her marriage, she still did not change her appearance.</p>
 <p>However, she immediately changed her appearance when she was about to meet Ying Mingchao. She even put great care into dressing herself up.</p>
 <p>From this, it could be seen how deeply she cared about her appearance in Ying Mingchao’s heart.</p>
 <p>If Zi Xunyi did not possess any love toward the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief, then she most definitely deeply love Ying Mingchao.</p>
 <p>“That’s an easy task. I’ll ask her for you.”<br>　　<br>After saying those words, Chu Feng said to Zi Xunyi, “Senior, I’ve heard that you’ve never been out of the Demon Elimination Cave. If that’s the case, how did you come to know Senior Ying Mingchao?”</p>
 <p>“You want to know our story?” Zi Xunyi took a glance at Chu Feng. She had managed to see through Chu Feng’s intentions.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng smiled awkwardly. Then, he said, “Senior, is it suitable for you to tell me?”</p>
 <p>“Actually, it’s nothing to conceal. After all, if you are to ask him, with how big-mouthed he is, he will definitely tell you,” Zi Xunyi gave a faint smile. It was very beautiful. It was as if she suddenly recalled what she had experienced back then.<br>　<br>Then, Zi Xunyi began to tell Chu Feng the story of her and Ying Mingchao.<br>　　<br>It turned out that it was not true that Zi Xunyi had never left the Demon Elimination Cave. She had left the Demon Elimination Cave and entered the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm before.<br>　　<br>It was also precisely at that time that she encountered Ying Mingchao by chance.</p>
 <p>At that time, Ying Mingchao was still a bandit. However, his outspoken and straightforward character immediately gained Zi Xunyi’s favorable impression.</p>
 <p>After that, Zi Xunyi experienced many things together with Ying Mingchao. The two of them entered many remnants together and explored many treasure deposits. Naturally… they also experienced life and death together.</p>
 <p>In fact, for the sake of protecting Zi Xunyi, Ying Mingchao nearly forfeited his life.</p>
 <p>At that time, Ying Mingchao was seriously injured. Even using all of her world spirit techniques, Zi Xunyi was unable to cure him.<br>　<br>At that time, Zi Xunyi’s tears were falling like rain. She was truly frightened. Even though he was so seriously injured, Ying Mingchao still had a smile on his face. With great difficulty, he raised his arm filled with wounds and wiped away the tears on Zi Xunyi’s face.</p>
 <p>Zi Xunyi fell deeply in love with Ying Mingchao. She decided to devote herself to this man.</p>
 <p>It was actually also Zi Xunyi who informed Ying Mingchao about the topography of the Demon Elimination Cave.</p>
 <p>As for the taboo technique that Ying Mingchao used, it was something that he and Zi Xunyi obtained together in a remnant.</p>
 <p>Thus, Zi Xunyi was the only person capable of helping him undo the taboo technique.</p>
 <p>As for why the two of them separated from one another, it was because their opinions differed.</p>
 <p>Zi Xunyi was not fond of the mutual deceptions of the world and wanted to retreat into the mountains with Ying Mingchao to live by themselves.</p>
 <p>However, at that time, Ying Mingchao had held magnificent aspirations. As such, he would naturally not be willing to retire.</p>
 <p>Afterwards, Ying Mingchao created Hero City, and Zi Xunyi left him and returned to the Demon Elimination Cave.</p>
 <p>Actually, Ying Mingchao had sought after Zi Xunyi before. Merely, he was driven away by Zi Xunyi’s master.</p>
 <p>In short, after that time, the two of them had never once seen each other again.</p>
 <p>“Since you were always in love with Senior Ying Mingchao, why did you decide to get married to the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>According to what Zi Xunyi said, she had only ever loved one man in her life, Ying Mingchao. As such, she should not be marrying herself to another man.</p>
 <p>Moreover, judging from Zi Xunyi’s attitude in the Demon Elimination Cave, she was truly not fond of the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng was unable to understand why the marriage was being conducted.</p>
 <p>“Back then, after the news of Ying Mingchao being killed by the Kong Heavenly Clan and the Zhou Heavenly Clan spread forth, my master imprisoned me in the Demon Elimination Cave.”</p>
 <p>“He knew my temperament, and knew that I would definitely find the Kong Heavenly Clan and Zhou Heavenly Clan for revenge. Even if I were to die, I would not have cared.”<br>　　<br>“At that time, although I was already an Insect Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, my cultivation was only that of a rank eight Martial Ancestor.”</p>
 <p>“As such, I was simply unable to contend against the Kong Heavenly Clan and Zhou Heavenly Clan.”</p>
 <p>“Because of that, my master imprisoned me and refused to allow me to take another step out of the Demon Elimination Cave. Upon being imprisoned, I was imprisoned for over a thousand years.”</p>
 <p>“Over a thousand years is enough time to change a lot of things. Not only did it change my appearance, but it also made me gradually forget about the pain in my heart.”<br>　<br>“Over the past thousand years, Xuelin Zhenping has treated me extremely well. As for me, I am, after all, a woman. As such, I was moved many times by his actions.” [1. Xuelin means Bloodscale. Seems like all the monstrous beasts have the same surname as their race/clan?]</p>
 <p>“However, when you appeared, when you mentioned the name Ying Mingchao, when you said that he was still alive, I suddenly realized that the man that I deeply loved in my heart was still Ying Mingchao.”</p>
 <p>“In fact, the reason why I’ve trained so hard over the past thousand plus years was subconsciously also because I’ve wanted to avenge him.”<br>　<br>“And now, he is actually still alive. Furthermore, he needs my help. As such, I have no reason to not help him.”</p>
 <p>“It was also at that time that I discovered that my feelings for Xuelin Zhenping were merely gratefulness and not love. In fact, it cannot even be regarded as liking him.”<br>　<br>“Actually, I also know how cruel my decision today was for Xuelin Zhenping.”</p>
 <p>“However, I cannot ignore this matter, I cannot disregard Ying Mingchao.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, this time around, not to mention finding myself utterly isolated, even if I am to die, I will still not turn around,” Zi Xunyi said.</p>
 <p>“Senior is daring to love and hate, this junior is in admiration,” Chu Feng said as he clasped his fist.</p>
 <p>“You have merely met Ying Mingchao once. Yet, you are willing to charge into the Demon Elimination Cave by yourself for him. I can also tell that you are also an individual daring to love and hate,” Zi Xunyi said to Chu Feng with a smile on her face.</p>
 <p>She had a very good impression of Chu Feng. The reason for that was precisely because Chu Feng and Ying Mingchao were unfamiliar with one another, yet Chu Feng was willing to pass on this message for him.</p>
 <p>Of course, it could also be said that she held a favorable impression toward Chu Feng because Chu Feng had transmitted the message to her, making it possible for her to go and save Ying Mingchao.</p>
 <p>After all, no matter what, Chu Feng’s message had not only helped Ying Mingchao, it had also helped her.</p>
 <p>“When mentioning it, I am quite ashamed.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng laughed bitterly. The reason for that was because he recalled his lovers Zi Ling, Su Rou and Su Mei.</p>
 <p>The situation for Zi Ling was still alright. She was training in the Eastern Sea Region’s Heavenly Road. With his father instructing her, Chu Feng felt that Zi Ling’s cultivation would definitely advance by leaps and bounds.<br>　　<br>However, Su Rou and Su Mei’s bodies were seized by the Moon Immortal. Even now, Chu Feng had no idea where they were. In fact, he didn’t even know if they were dead or alive.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng felt extremely guilty toward the sisters Su Rou and Su Mei.</p>
 <p>“In this world, there are a lot of things that one has no way to control.”</p>
 <p>“In short, it would be fine as long as you hold a clear conscience.”</p>
 <p>Zi Xunyi had most likely seen through Chu Feng’s heartache. However, she did not ask about it. She merely spoke comforting words to him.</p>
 <p>On their journey to the Kong Heavenly Clan, Chu Feng continued to chat with Zi Xunyi. The two of them were getting along very well.</p>
