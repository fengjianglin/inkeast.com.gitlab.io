 <p><strong> Chapter 2038 - Bearing Dangers To Save People</strong></p>
 <p>Seeing this scene, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal smiled. “It would appear that they have indeed deliberately spread the information of their headquarters’ location. They plan to conduct a final battle with us,”</p>
 <p>Hearing what he said, the other people also revealed relaxed smiles on their faces.</p>
 <p>It turned out that the Dark Hall had not set a trap for them, unlike what they had thought. Instead, they had decided to face them head-on. To them, this was something that they wished for.</p>
 <p>“Something’s amiss!” Right at this moment, Chu Feng started to shout.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Hearing Chu Feng’s shout, the Elf King hurriedly looked over.</p>
 <p>“Everything before us is an illusion formed by a spirit formation. There is actually nothing before us,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, are you certain?” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the other world spiritists asked.</p>
 <p>No matter what, they were also Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists. Thus, they all possessed special and exceptional observation abilities. However, they had not noticed anything wrong.</p>
 <p>In their eyes, regardless of whether it was the buildings, those slaughtering formations or the Dark Hall’s army and the Ancient Era’s ferocious beasts, they were all really before them.</p>
 <p>“Rumble, rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, an explosion sounded from above. As the crowd turned to the sky, they were shocked to discover that a torrential rain had suddenly started.</p>
 <p>The rainwater was green. It sprinkled lightly down toward them. Not only was the Ancient Era’s Elves’ army covered, the rainwater covered a range of a thousand miles around them.</p>
 <p>“Use world spirit techniques,” In response, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, the Snow-haired Immortal, Zhang Ming and Chu Feng all unleashed their world spirit techniques, instantly forming spirit formations. They covered the sky with the intention to block the green rainwater.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because the rainwater was emitting a suffocating stink. Merely by looking at it, one could tell that it was no ordinary rain water. Instead, it was liquid poison.</p>
 <p>However, the liquid poison was too powerful. It surpassed everyone’s imagination, and pierced through the many layers of spirit formations Chu Feng and the others set up. Then, they landed on the crowd.</p>
 <p>“Ahhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”</p>
 <p>“Nooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”</p>
 <p>“Damn it! What the hell is this?!”</p>
 <p>At this moment, all sorts of screams could be heard. Practically everyone was corroded by the poison.</p>
 <p>Their clothes started to melt, and their skins started to burn. Blood and flesh started to become indistinct. Those that were struck by the poison rain were all left in tragic states.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the only people that were fine was Chu Feng and the Elf King. Even the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the other world spiritists were being tormented by the poison. Even though they used all of their abilities, they were only able to slow down the corrosion of their bodies from the poison, and were unable to remove it completely.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was fine because he possessed a body that was immune to poisons. As for the Elf King, he was forcibly blocking the attacks of the poison by relying on his peak Martial Emperor’s strength.</p>
 <p>However, others were unable to accomplish the same thing. Those with high levels of cultivation like the Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the Four Grand Elders were relatively fine. Although they were being corroded by the poison, they were still able to tolerate and resist the poison with their abilities.</p>
 <p>However, the situation was worse for those with weaker strength.</p>
 <p>For some people, their bodies had already melted completely and only their white bones remained.</p>
 <p>Not to mention the army of flesh and bone, even the stone army was uttering howls of grief.</p>
 <p>The poison was actually able to corrode even stones. There was simply nothing that could stop it.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the Elf King shouted angrily, “Dark Hall’s Hall Master, do you dare to come out and fight against me honorably?” Space itself shattered as his shout rang out. It could be seen that he was extremely furious right now.</p>
 <p>Even though he already knew that a trap awaited them here, he had not expected the trap to be this powerful. It had managed to directly erase all of their battle power apart from him and Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the Elf King was filled with regret. If he had known that the trap in this place would be this powerful, he would definitely not have led the Ancient Era’s Elves’ elites here. How could this possibly be a battle to determine the outcome? No, this was simply throwing their lives away.</p>
 <p>“You wish to fight against the Hall Master? I’m afraid you’ll have to be disappointed. Lord Hall Master has simply never been here.”</p>
 <p>A mocking voice sounded. It was a female’s voice. It was that Xue Ji’s voice.</p>
 <p>Merely, it was only Xue Ji’s voice that was heard. She had not revealed herself.</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~”</p>
 <p>Right after that voice was heard, the Elf King shot out a fist. Immediately, a blaze filled the area where his fist strike passed, and the space there started to shatter into pitch darkness.</p>
 <p>The Elf King had determined Xue Ji’s location through the sound of her voice, and unleashed an attack in that direction.</p>
 <p>“Yoh, you’re actually throwing a sneak attack at me? Truly despicable,” However, that Xue Ji’s voice soon sounded again. It was filled with mockery. It was clear that the Elf King’s attack had not managed to hit Xue Ji.</p>
 <p>“Damn it!” At that moment, the Elf King was gnashing his teeth in anger. He who was always calm was unable to remain calm anymore.</p>
 <p>His subordinates, his clansmen and his friends were all suffering.</p>
 <p>The reason for all of this was his mistaken judgement. In fact, even though he was fine now, he was actually also being slowly corroded by that poison rain. If this were to continue, even he would end up sustaining injuries.</p>
 <p>He did not care about his own death. However, he did not wish for his clansmen to die. Most importantly, if they were to suffer a complete wipeout here, the people remaining in the Elf Kingdom would die sooner or later too. They would truly be devastated.</p>
 <p>That was why he was so anxious. However, regardless of how anxious he was, there was nothing he could do. In this sort of situation, no one would be able to remain calm.</p>
 <p>“Go on, be angry. However, your anger will be useless. You will only be able to watch as all those you care about are corroded and killed by the poison.”</p>
 <p>“Then, you yourself will be seriously injured. Your cultivation will be damaged. In the end, you will only be able to watch as your Elf Kingdom is wiped out and your beloved daughters are killed.”</p>
 <p>“You wished to save the people of the world. However, you’ll only end up dying yourself.”</p>
 <p>“Hero? It’s not that easy to become one,” Xue Ji’s mocking voice sounded in succession. It held the air of having an absolute certainty of victory.</p>
 <p>“That’s not for certain.”</p>
 <p>However, at that moment, Chu Feng’s voice sounded. It was at that moment that the crowd noticed that Chu Feng was standing in midair with golden light emitting from his body.</p>
 <p>It was world spirit power. Furthermore, Chu Feng had a light smile on his face.</p>
 <p>It was… a smile of confidence.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, what are you planning to do?”</p>
 <p>The Weaponry Refinement Immortal and the others were all startled by Chu Feng’s appearance; they were all able to tell that Chu Feng had sealed himself with world spirit techniques. Even though they were unable to know what Chu Feng’s intention was, they all knew that Chu Feng planned to do something.</p>
 <p>“Bang~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a muffled explosion sounded from Chu Feng’s body. Then, his body actually exploded. Blood began to sprinkle down from the sky like rain.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng!!!”</p>
 <p>Seeing this scene, the Elf King and the others all revealed extremely shocked expressions.</p>
 <p>However, when Chu Feng’s blood sprinkled down and landed on the army, they were shocked to discover that the poison that came into contact with Chu Feng’s blood actually started to dissipate.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s blood was actually capable of detoxifying the poison!!</p>
 <p>Chu feng was using his blood to detoxify the poison for the crowd. Merely, there was too much poisonous liquid, and Chu Feng’s blood was limited. Thus, the amount of poison that his blood was capable of detoxifying was pathetically minute.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, he actually…” After finding out Chu Feng’s intention, the Elf King felt endless pain in his heart. For the sake of saving everyone, Chu Feng had sacrificed himself.</p>
