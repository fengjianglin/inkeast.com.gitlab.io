 <p><strong> Chapter 2472 - Acting On Behalf Of Justice</strong></p>
 <p>“You’re still not leaving? Do you all insist on having me teach you a lesson?”</p>
 <p>Seeing that their opponents were still thinking about continuing to tangle with them, Liu Xiaoli revealed an impatient expression.</p>
 <p>“What arrogance! Our Jade Mountain Sect shall see exactly how you’re going to teach us a lesson.”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, a stern shout was heard from outside the mountain.</p>
 <p>Immediately afterward, a group of people majestically charged toward the mountain.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing that group of people, the five powers that'd grown fearful immediately revealed joyous expressions. Evidently, their reinforcements had arrived.</p>
 <p>As for that group of people, they were precisely the group that Chu Feng had followed over, the Jade Mountain Sect’s troops.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had already known that those people from the Jade Mountain Sect were there to take care of Liu Xiaoli.</p>
 <p>Merely, he did not expect that the Jade Mountain Sect was actually the main force in the expedition against Liu Xiaoli.</p>
 <p>However, upon thinking about it, Chu Feng found it reasonable. After all, that Jade Mountain Sect’s Sect Master was a rank four Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>Although a rank four Martial Ancestor was simply unworthy of being mentioned before the current Chu Feng, a rank four Martial Ancestor was someone that Liu Xiaoli and the others from the Butterfly Society could not look down upon.</p>
 <p>Thus, upon seeing that group of people, even Liu Xiaoli was unable to remain calm and collected.</p>
 <p>“Big brother, you’ve finally arrived.”</p>
 <p>“This De-cocoon Sect is simply too stubborn. I’m afraid that I will have to inconvenience you, big brother.”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing the Jade Mountain Sect’s Sect Master, the masters of the five powers reacted as if they were seeing their own father.</p>
 <p>They immediately discovered backing and grew confident. One by one, they started to voice their grievances to that Jade Mountain Sect’s Sect Master.</p>
 <p>“Don’t mention it anymore, I’ve already seen everything,” The Jade Mountain Sect’s Sect Master waved his hand. Then, like an emperor moving out to personally investigate, he arrogantly arrived before Liu Xiaoli and looked at her with a gaze filled with contempt.</p>
 <p>As for what left Chu Feng the most speechless, it was that when the Jade Mountain Sect’s Sect Master stopped, the elders behind him actually took out a jade seat and placed it behind him.</p>
 <p>That Jade Mountain Sect’s Sect Master was actually not even planning to stand in this confrontation against Liu Xiaoli. Instead, he was planning to confront her while sitting. He was acting as if he was truly an emperor holding a trial against an ordinary commoner.</p>
 <p>Rarely had Chu Feng ever encountered such an arrogant individual in his entire cultivation history.</p>
 <p>Liu Xiaoli spoke to ask, “Jade Mountain Sect, I seem to recall that this matter is unrelated to you all, no?” Merely, she no longer possessed the confidence she did earlier. It could be seen that Liu Xiaoli was afraid of that Jade Mountain Sect.</p>
 <p>“Unrelated? How could it be unrelated? The five of them are my sworn brothers,” As the Jade Mountain Sect’s Sect Master spoke, he took out a long tobacco pipe.</p>
 <p>He began to casually light his tobacco while speaking indifferently, “Liu Xiaoli, since you’re a woman, I do not wish to make things difficult for you. Immediately take your bunch of shrimp soldiers and crab generals and scram from here. Do that, and I’ll consider nothing to have happened.”</p>
 <p>“You!!!” Hearing those words, Liu Xiaoli and the crowd beside her all revealed angry scowls. However, they did not break out in anger. Instead, they forced themselves to contain their anger.</p>
 <p>“What is this? Seeing from your unreconciled expressions, could it be that you want to fight against me?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t say that I am looking down on you, but even if you possess heaven-defying battle power that allows you to contend against rank four Martial Ancestors, so what? In the end, you are still not a rank four Martial Ancestor. Thus, you are destined to not be a match for me.”</p>
 <p>“Even if you are to be enormously fortunate to fight me to a draw and make me retreat today, have you considered tomorrow?”</p>
 <p>“This old man has a vast amount of friends here. If you are to truly offend me, the next time I come, I will definitely not be coming alone.”</p>
 <p>“At that time, I will not be simply driving you all out of here. Instead, I will be exterminating your entire De-cocoon Sect,” The Jade Mountain Sect’s Sect Master spoke those words filled with threatening intent.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Liu Xiaoli and the people beside her all had a change of expression. Their faces started to twist, and fear emerged in their eyes.</p>
 <p>They were actually really scared by that old man’s threats.</p>
 <p>“Clap, clap, clap~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, clapping sounds were suddenly heard.</p>
 <p>“Great. Your ability to boast is truly great.”</p>
 <p>Following the clapping, a voice filled with mockery was heard.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the Jade Mountain Sect’s Sect Master grew furious, whereas Liu Xiaoli and the others were greatly surprised.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because that voice came from their side. All of them subconsciously thought that someone from Liu Xiaoli’s side was mocking the Jade Mountain Sect’s Sect Master.</p>
 <p>“You all are truly ones to refuse the face given to you!”</p>
 <p>The Jade Mountain Sect’s Sect Master was extremely furious. He stood up abruptly and unleashed his rank four Martial Ancestor’s oppressive might to cover the entire sky. At the same time, his overwhelming killing intent caused the sky to darken, and black clouds to surge about.</p>
 <p>Witnessing that scene, the crowd from the Red Butterfly Society all started to panic.</p>
 <p>They had heard about the Jade Mountain Sect’s Sect Master before. That was the reason why they did not wish to fight against him. Yet now, with what had just happened, it would appear that they must fight against him. As for that, it was not what they desired.</p>
 <p>“I am the one who spoke earlier. If you have the ability, come and settle it with me.”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, a figure suddenly appeared out of thin air. That figure appeared beside Liu Xiaoli.</p>
 <p>Seeing that person, the crowd present all revealed an astonished expression.</p>
 <p>That person was naturally Chu Feng. Merely, Chu Feng did not wish to unleash a massacre. Thus… he did not reveal his true appearance.</p>
 <p>Not to mention the people from the Jade Mountain Sect and the other five powers, even Liu Xiaoli and the others from the Red Butterfly Society had no idea who Chu Feng was.</p>
 <p>“Who are you?” The Jade Mountain Sect’s Sect Master asked with a cold voice.</p>
 <p>“Who I am is not important. You all merely need to know that you are to immediately scram from this place and never cause trouble for the De-cocoon Sect again. If you are to do that, you all can still live. Else… you shall shoulder the consequences yourself,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“What arrogance. Who do you think you are? What makes you think…” The Jade Mountain Sect’s Sect Master spoke mockingly.</p>
 <p>“Rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>However, before he could finish his words, Chu Feng unleashed his aura.</p>
 <p>Although Chu Feng’s rank seven Martial Ancestor level aura was formless, it was an impressive display of power. Chu Feng’s aura lingered in the mountain and covered all of heaven and earth.</p>
 <p>“This aura… you… you… you’re a rank seven Martial Ancestor?”</p>
 <p>Upon sensing Chu Feng’s aura, not to mention the others, even the Jade Mountain Sect’s Sect Master turned pale with fright.</p>
 <p>“Putt~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, that previously extremely arrogant Jade Mountain Sect’s Sect Master actually knelt before Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Milord, I was blind, I have eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai. Earlier, I spoke rudely, and actually spoke against Milord.”</p>
 <p>“Milord, please be magnanimous and take into consideration that this lowly one has managed to recognize his mistake and spare me this once,” The Jade Mountain Sect’s Sect Master actually began to beg for forgiveness.</p>
 <p>“Milord, please spare us. We will no longer dare to create trouble for the De-cocoon Sect again.”</p>
 <p>The others of the Jade Mountain Sect, as well as everyone from the other five powers, all knelt on the ground and began to kowtow to Chu Feng. With extremely apologetic expressions, they began to beg Chu Feng for forgiveness.</p>
 <p>They were already covered with tears and shivering nonstop. They were truly frightened by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, that could also not be blamed on them. Although they acted so tyrannically, they were still only a bunch of third rate powers.</p>
 <p>To them, a rank seven Martial Ancestor was someone that they absolutely could not afford to provoke.</p>
 <p>As Chu Feng did not plan to bicker with them, he did not make things difficult for them and merely said one word, “Scram.”</p>
 <p>Hearing that word, those people reacted as if they had been saved. They did not dare to stay any longer. They began to express their thanks toward Chu Feng for sparing their lives and then hurriedly soared into the sky to escape far away.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, the vast group of people had all disappeared from the mountain. They had all escaped far away.</p>
 <p>That said, the people from the Red Butterfly Society all had dumbfounded expressions on their faces.</p>
 <p>They truly could not understand why that expert would help them. After all, they did not believe that they knew someone so powerful.</p>
 <p>Thus, they felt that it must be that an expert had coincidentally passed by and was unable to tolerate what was happening. That was why he had decided to act righteously to help them.</p>
 <p>Thus, Liu Xiaoli arrived before Chu Feng and said to him with an extremely grateful expression on her face, “Junior Liu Xiaoli, the De-cocoon Sect’s Sect Master, thanks senior for saving us.”</p>
 <p>“De-cocoon Sect?” At that moment, Chu Feng chuckled. Then, he said, “Aren’t you all the Red Butterfly Society?”</p>
