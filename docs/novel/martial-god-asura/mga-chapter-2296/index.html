 <p><strong> Chapter 2296 - The Tragic Death Of Wang Qiang</strong></p>
 <p>Actually, being given the advantage by the demonic woman like this, Chu Feng would feel that it would be an unfair victory even if he did manage to win.</p>
 <p>However, this was the only opportunity Chu Feng had at defeating the demonic woman. Thus, Chu Feng must grasp it.</p>
 <p>“Haaah!” Thinking of that, Chu Feng did not hesitate any longer. He shouted loudly, and then a majestic aura began to emanate from his body.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the demonic woman’s eyes shone. Her lips were actually raised into a smile.</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng shouted loudly, he closed his mouth and then opened it abruptly. Then, with a ‘puu,’ scarlet colored blood sprayed out from Chu Feng’s mouth like a pillar.</p>
 <p>Seeing this scene, the demonic woman was stunned. Evidently, she was greatly surprised by Chu Feng’s sudden vomit of blood.</p>
 <p>However, this was only the beginning.</p>
 <p>After spraying out a mouthful of blood, blood began to flow from the corners of Chu Feng’s eyes, as well as his nose and ears.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng’s expression became exceptionally ugly. His aura also began to weaken and his entire body grew more and more unstable.</p>
 <p>It was as if he was under enormous pressure, and was about to explode and die at any moment.</p>
 <p>“Hey, what is with your condition?”</p>
 <p>At that moment, even that demonic woman was unable to remain calm. The reason for that was because this simply did not resemble Chu Feng using any ability. Instead, he was clearly mutilating himself.</p>
 <p>“Girl, do not be careless,” Suddenly, the Fairy World Spirit summoned by that demonic woman warned her loudly.</p>
 <p>The very next moment, Chu Feng’s clothes began to flutter. At the same time, five bodies of energy shot out from Chu Feng’s body.</p>
 <p>Gold, wood, water, fire and earth.</p>
 <p>After the five bodies of energy left Chu Feng’s body, they took humanoid forms. They turned into five enormous and extremely imposing Immortals.</p>
 <p>Like celestial soldiers and divine generals, they stood before Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Those five were precisely the Gold Immortal Profound Technique, Wood Immortal Profound Technique, Water Immortal Profound Technique, Fire Immortal Profound Technique and Earth Immortal Profound Technique.</p>
 <p>“These... are secret skills?”</p>
 <p>When the demonic woman saw the Five Elements Secret Skills, she also revealed a shocked expression. After all, the five immortals currently possessed the cultivation of rank six Martial Ancestors.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing the five immortals, that Fairy World Spirit gasped, “This is going to be a bit difficult now.”</p>
 <p>“How is it? Can you handle them?” That demonic woman asked.</p>
 <p>“They’re merely difficult. It doesn’t mean that I will not be able to handle them.”</p>
 <p>“Crash~~~”</p>
 <p>Immediately after saying those words, that Fairy World Spirit spread of its hands wide. Two golden-bright and dazzling long whips appeared in his grasp.</p>
 <p>“Pa, pa, pa~~~”</p>
 <p>Immediately after that, the two golden whips began to whistle and spiral in the sky like two golden dragons.</p>
 <p>Although the five immortals all possessed the cultivation of rank six Martial Ancestors now, they were actually unable to prevail against that Fairy World Spirit’s whips in the slightest.</p>
 <p>They were completely restricted.</p>
 <p>“This is bad. That demonic woman’s world spirit is actually stronger than I had anticipated. The five immortals will likely not be a match for it,” Sensing that the situation was bad, Chu Feng felt that it would be best that he take care of this matter himself.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because if the demonic woman were to be defeated, her world spirit would not be able to do anything anymore.</p>
 <p>“Puu~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right after Chu Feng took a step, he immediately felt that his blood was surging over. Then, a mouthful of blood sprayed out from his mouth.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng felt that his surroundings were swaying left and right. He had become dizzy, and his vision blurred. Not to mention fighting, even walking a single step had become extremely difficult.</p>
 <p>“Damn it.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng gnashed his teeth angrily. He never expected there to be such an enormous burden on his body after using the Five Elements Secret Skills.</p>
 <p>“It seems that you’ve paid considerably in order to unleash those five secret skills.”</p>
 <p>“It is impossible for the current you to defeat me. Even though I am being restricted by the Demon Subduing Spring Water, you will still not be able to defeat me,” The demonic woman said to Chu Feng with a beaming smile.</p>
 <p>After hearing what the demonic woman said, Chu Feng’s frown grew deeper. Not only did this demonic woman possess overwhelming strength, her power of observation was also extremely strong. It was as if she had noticed what Chu Feng was planning before he even acted upon it.</p>
 <p>“I have a question. Why do you insist on killing me? I seem to have had no conflicts with you before,” The demonic woman said.</p>
 <p>“You killed my brother. Naturally, I will have to avenge him,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“I have truly killed many people. However, among them, only a few left an impression. However, that brother of yours should likely not be an ordinary individual, right?” The demonic woman asked. Evidently, as she had a whole new level of respect for Chu Feng, she became interested.</p>
 <p>“Of course,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Then what sort of characteristics did your brother possess? Why don’t you tell me about it,” The demonic woman asked curiously.</p>
 <p>Then, Chu Feng began to describe Wang Qiang’s characteristics to that demonic woman.</p>
 <p>“It’s actually him?” Hearing those words, the demonic woman’s expression changed slightly. Evidently, she remembered Wang Qiang.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was not surprised. After all, compared to other people, Wang Qiang truly possessed many distinguishing features. He was the sort of person that would leave a deep impression on others.</p>
 <p>“Did you eat him?” Chu Feng asked. At that moment, Chu Feng felt that it was impossible for him to defeat the demonic woman. Thus, he wanted to verify whether or not Wang Qiang was truly dead.</p>
 <p>“No, I felt that guy to be disgusting,” The demonic woman said.</p>
 <p>“In that case, he’s still alive?” Hearing what the demonic woman said, Chu Feng was overjoyed.</p>
 <p>“No, he’s dead. Furthermore, due to how vulgar he is, he has no doubt met a miserable death,” The demonic woman said.</p>
 <p>“You killed him?” Chu Feng’s expression changed instantly. Boundless rage began to bubble up in his heart.</p>
 <p>“I sliced off his flesh piece by piece while he was still alive. Then, I fed them to dogs.”</p>
 <p>“After his flesh was all sliced off, I extracted all of his source energy. Thus, he died in miserable pain.”</p>
 <p>“Thinking about his heart-tearing and lungs-splitting screams from that day, it is still a very pleasurable feeling.”</p>
 <p>As that demonic woman said those words, she smiled in an overjoyed manner. It was as if what she had described was something that gave her immense pleasure.</p>
 <p>From the appearance of the demonic woman, it appeared that she was not joking around.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the scene of Wang Qiang dying miserably appeared in Chu Feng’s mind.</p>
 <p>Anger filled Chu Feng’s heart, and killing intent started to soar.</p>
 <p>“I’ll kill you!”</p>
 <p>After a loud shout of anger, the weather started to change. Chu Feng’s body moved. He passed by the battle between the five immortals and that world spirit. Like a humanoid beast that carried intense killing intent, Chu Feng rushed rapidly toward that demonic woman.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s speed was so fast that he arrived before that demonic woman in an instant.</p>
 <p>With his Magma Emperor Sword in hand, Chu Feng slashed at the demonic woman.</p>
 <p>“You?”</p>
 <p>Seeing the current Chu Feng, the demonic woman had an astonished expression.</p>
 <p>The way she saw it, it should be impossible for Chu Feng to unleash such overwhelming power with how seriously injured he was.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng had accomplished exactly that feat. He had managed to accomplish it through anger.</p>
 <p>In other words, Chu Feng had forgotten about the enormous pain of his body because of the anger caused by Wang Qiang’s death. He disregarded everything, and unleashed strength what should have been impossible for him to unleash.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right at the moment when Chu Feng’s Magma Emperor Sword was about to hack down toward the demonic woman, a world spirit gate appeared before the demonic woman.</p>
 <p>At the moment when Chu Feng’s Magma Emperor Sword hacked down toward the demonic woman, a giant hand extended out from that world spirit gate and grabbed Chu Feng’s Magma Emperor Sword.</p>
 <p>“This?”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng was greatly alarmed. Even though it was merely a hand, and had not completely unleashed all of its aura, Chu Feng was able to sense that the world spirit from this world spirit gate possessed strength that surpassed his own.</p>
 <p>“Oh no, someone’s coming.”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the demonic woman’s gaze flashed. She took a serious glance toward the distance. Then, she turned to Chu Feng and smiled lightly.</p>
 <p>She said, “I have remembered your appearance. I am only letting you live for a while longer. The next time we meet shall be the time of your death.”</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>After the demonic woman finished saying those words, she smiled meaningfully at Chu Feng. Then, she turned around and started flying away.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the world spirit that the demonic woman let out earlier also left with her.</p>
 <p>As for the world spirit that had blocked Chu Feng’s sword strike, it did not appear. Instead, after the demonic woman turned to leave, it returned to its world spirit gate.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng looked to the direction where the demonic woman had left. However, he did not give chase.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because he knew he was no match for that demonic woman.</p>
 <p>If he decided to chase after her, he would undoubtedly be killed.</p>
