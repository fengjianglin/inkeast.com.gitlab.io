 <p><strong> Chapter 2478 - Sky Dyed With Blood</strong></p>
 <p>“Heavens, how could this be?!”</p>
 <p>Liu Xiaoli also noticed the appalling devastation all around. Her face instantly turned pale from shock. Unable to contain herself, she covered her mouth with her hands.</p>
 <p>As the Red Butterfly Society’s Society Master, Liu Xiaoli had experienced a lot, and seen many massacres.</p>
 <p>Yet, that scene had still frightened her.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because the Three Stars Hall were truly left in a miserable state.</p>
 <p>“The Ying Heavenly Clan is truly ruthless,” Chu Feng said as he gnashed his teeth.</p>
 <p>Then, Chu Feng took a deep breath and closed his eyes. He grew silent. No one knew what he was thinking.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you are actually still alive. Great, this is great. Truly even the heavens are helping me.”</p>
 <p>“It seems that the heavens have deliberately let you live all so that I can personally kill you and avenge my son.”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, today, I will settle this debt of blood with blood. I will dismember your body into ten thousand pieces.”</p>
 <p>The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief revealed a malevolent expression. He waved the Ancestral Armament Sword in his hand many times in succession, sending forth many sharp blade rays toward Chu Feng like a meteor shower.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, look out!!!” The Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster hurriedly shouted.</p>
 <p>At the same time, everyone from the Three Stars Hall started to narrow their brows. They were all extremely worried.</p>
 <p>After all, the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s attacks were no small matter. Everyone was able to tell how frightening the blade rays that filled the sky were.</p>
 <p>He was not joking around. He was really planning to take Chu Feng’s life and dismember him into ten thousand pieces. Even Liu Xiaoli who stood beside Chu Feng would not be able to escape the onslaught.</p>
 <p>“Zzzzzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at the moment when the blade rays were about to reach Chu Feng, lightning suddenly emerged from Chu Feng’s body.</p>
 <p>That lightning was exceptionally fierce, and managed to completely shatter all of the incoming sword rays. At the same time, Chu Feng’s aura was also released.</p>
 <p>When Chu Feng’s aura reached the crowd, their bodies all trembled. They were all astonished.</p>
 <p>At that moment, everyone present was able to sense Chu Feng’s aura, and realized Chu Feng’s cultivation.</p>
 <p>“Rank seven Martial Ancestor. Chu Feng’s cultivation is that of a rank seven Martial Ancestor!!!”</p>
 <p>Although the people from the Three Stars Hall were riddled with wounds, they still revealed joyous expressions.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng’s cultivation has actually reached such a level?”</p>
 <p>The Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster felt disbelief. After all, when he had first met Chu Feng, Chu Feng had still only been a Half Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>Yet, in such a short period of time, he had actually become a rank seven Martial Ancestor. It was simply unimaginable.</p>
 <p>“Sure enough, one cannot judge the world of geniuses with the lenses of ordinary people. It would appear that our Three Stars Hall will be saved today,” The Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster revealed a smile.</p>
 <p>Both Chu Feng and the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief possessed Heavenly Bloodlines.</p>
 <p>As for the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief, he was able to defeat him as a rank five Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>Then, how powerful would Chu Feng, as a rank seven Martial Ancestor, be? The Three Stars Hall’s Headmaster was able to imagine it very well.</p>
 <p>Since Chu Feng had come to save them, it meant that all of them would be saved.</p>
 <p>“This is impossible! This is absolutely impossible! It’s only been such a short period of time, you… how could you possibly have obtained your current cultivation?”</p>
 <p>At the moment when everyone from the Three Stars Hall was overjoyed, that Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief had an expression of disbelief.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng completely ignored the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief. Lightning flashed in Chu Feng’s eyes, and then his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings appeared.</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng’s cultivation increased from rank seven Martial Ancestor to rank nine Martial Ancestor, lightning was no longer the only thing present in Chu Feng’s eyes. In addition to them, there was also ice-cold killing intent.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, like Chu Feng’s oppressive might, that killing intent of his completely surrounded the region, permeating into everyone’s bodies.</p>
 <p>“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, everyone from the Ying Heavenly Clan floated into the sky. They were present all over the sky.</p>
 <p>Like a bunch of sheep, they were hung in midair.</p>
 <p>“Lord Clan Chief, save us! Save us!!!”</p>
 <p>The Ying Heavenly Clansmen realized that the situation was amiss. However, they were still unable to control their bodies, and could only allow themselves to be controlled by Chu Feng like puppets. Helpless, they could only turn to ask their Clan Chief for help.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, what are you planning to do?!” The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief started to panic.</p>
 <p>“It seems that the lesson of losing your son was still insufficient for you. In that case, I will allow you to experience the pain of having your entire clan exterminated,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, don’t you mess with me! Else, Lord Chu Luxuan will definitely not spare you!!!” The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief shouted in panic.</p>
 <p>“Heh…”</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng only laughed disdainfully at the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief’s threat.</p>
 <p>Then, lightning flashed in Chu Feng’s eyes.</p>
 <p>The next moment, all of the Ying Heavenly Clansmen that were hanging in midair revealed extremely ugly expressions.</p>
 <p>Following that, ‘bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,’ muffled explosions began to sound nonstop.</p>
 <p>Blood filled the sky. Like rain, it sprinkled downward, dyeing the earth.</p>
 <p>In that one split second, all of the Ying Heavenly Clansmen exploded. They had all died without even an intact corpse.</p>
 <p>The rain of blood was formed with their flesh.</p>
 <p>“Noooo!!!!”</p>
 <p>The Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief started to shout hysterically. He wanted to attack Chu Feng, but discovered that Chu Feng’s oppressive might was still enveloping him. Like his clansmen that were killed by Chu Feng, he was powerless to resist.</p>
 <p>“Lord Chu Feng, please spare us. Lord Chu Feng, please spare us.”</p>
 <p>“We are unrelated to the Ying Heavenly Clan. We only came here because we were ordered to do so. Please, please spare us.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, all of the Ying Heavenly Clan’s guest elders began to beg Chu Feng for forgiveness.</p>
 <p>Those people were all Martial Ancestors. They were all members of the older generation that had trained for many years.</p>
 <p>Yet, at that moment, they simply did not possess the bearings of the older generation. Instead, they were all shivering in fear. They were already in complete panic.</p>
 <p>“If I had not arrived today, would you all have spared the people of the Three Stars Hall?” Chu Feng asked coldly.</p>
 <p>“We…” Those guest elders grew quiet. They did not know how to respond.</p>
 <p>“Bang, bang, bang, bang~~~”</p>
 <p>At that moment, muffled explosion sounds were heard once again.</p>
 <p>With the muffled explosions came flowers of blood that scattered about in all directions.</p>
 <p>Several more people were killed. This time around, they were not the Ying Heavenly Clansmen, but rather those guest elders.</p>
 <p>“Lord Chu Feng, please spare me. Please spare me. I will never dare to go against you again. I will never dare to go against you again.”</p>
 <p>“Lord Chu Feng, please, please spare me, please spare my life. I truly did not know you possessed this sort of relationship with the Three Stars Hall. If I had known, even if I was to be given a hundred times the nerve, I would not have dared to attack the Three Stars Hall.”</p>
 <p>The guest elders that were still alive completely crumbled before Chu Feng. They actually disregarded their status and identity to kneel before Chu Feng, kowtowing to him and begging for forgiveness. Furthermore, many among them were already crying in fear.</p>
 <p>Their reactions were understandable. After all, Chu Feng’s method were truly ruthless. They were truly frightened by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>In fact, it was not only them. Even the people from the Three Stars Hall were frightened by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>No matter what, those were all living people. Yet, they were all instantly killed by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Chu Feng showed absolutely zero emotion after killing them. Such coldness was something that terrified even them.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng was already no longer human in their eyes. Rather, he was more like a cold-blooded demon that viewed human life as grass.</p>
 <p>“All those that I’ve killed earlier are people that raised their weapons at the Three Stars Hall.”</p>
 <p>“As for you all, I did not see you try to kill the people from the Three Stars Hall. Thus, I will spare you all this once. Scram,” Chu Feng waved his hand at those Ying Heavenly Clan’s guest elders.</p>
 <p>“Thank you Lord Chu Feng, thank you Lord Chu Feng.”</p>
 <p>Those guest elders that were still alive began to thank Chu Feng for not killing them. At the same time, they started to flee in disarray. They were so flustered by what had happened that they were actually unable to stand firm in midair, and started to roll and crawl as they frantically escaped. Their appearance was truly sorry.</p>
 <p>“Next, it’s your turn now.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng turned his gaze to the Ying Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief.</p>
