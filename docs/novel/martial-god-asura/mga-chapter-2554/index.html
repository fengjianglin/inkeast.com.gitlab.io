 <p><strong>Chapter 2554 - Break All Ties</strong></p>
 <p>The Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen were no longer capable of tolerating Zi Xunyi.<br>　<br>Their Lord Clan Chief had clearly treated Zi Xunyi very well. Yet, Zi Xunyi deeply loved a human instead.<br>　　<br>They all wanted Zi Xunyi to die.</p>
 <p>It was as if only Zi Xunyi’s death could alleviate the hatred in their hearts.<br>　<br>However, there was a single Bloodscale Monstrous Clansman that did not say anything. He was the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief.</p>
 <p>Although he did not say anything, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief was clenching his fists tightly. The veins throughout his entire body were bulging. His appearance was truly frightening.<br>　　<br>Most importantly, wave upon wave of oppressive might was surging forth from his body like tornadoes. They were truly frightening.</p>
 <p>His eyes were filled with hatred and irreconciliation. If all of the Bloodscale Monstrous Clansmen were feeling pain in their hearts because of Zi Xunyi, then the person feeling the greatest pain would be none other than the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief.</p>
 <p>“Clank~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief flipped his wrist.</p>
 <p>In an instant, a weapon over ten meters long appeared in his hand.</p>
 <p>It was a blade, a crimson blade. That blade was covered in crimson scales.</p>
 <p>That was an Ancestral Armament, a very high quality Ancestral Armament.</p>
 <p>“Ahh!!!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief let out a roar.</p>
 <p>That roar was even more ear-piercing, even more frightening, than roars from ferocious beasts.</p>
 <p>At the same time, he roared, he also raised the crimson blade in his hand.</p>
 <p>He was planning to attack!!!<br>　　<br>At that moment, Chu Feng noticed that two purple daggers had appeared in Zi Xunyi’s hands.</p>
 <p>Those two purple daggers were two top quality Ancestral Armaments.</p>
 <p>Zi Xunyi was not planning to resign herself to death.</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief’s blade landed.</p>
 <p>However, the direction in which his blade landed was not toward Zi Xunyi. Rather, it was toward the depths of the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s headquarters.<br>　　<br>“Boom~~~”<br>　　<br>The next moment, a loud explosion was heard. A palace was destroyed. However, that was the only palace that was destroyed.</p>
 <p>“You can go. Don’t return again.”</p>
 <p>“From today on, our Bloodscale Monstrous Clan will break all ties with you, Zi Xunyi,” The Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief said to Zi Xunyi.</p>
 <p>It turned out that the palace that the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief had destroyed was Zi Xunyi’s palace.<br>　　<br>“My thanks,” Zi Xunyi said those words and then brought Chu Feng and Li Yue’er and flew toward the outside.</p>
 <p>Zi Xunyi knew the Demon Elimination Cave like the back of her hand. Furthermore, her cultivation was that of a rank two True Immortal. Going all-out in fleeing, she soon arrived at the exit of the Demon Elimination Cave with Chu Feng and Li Yue’er.<br>　　<br>It was at that moment that Chu Feng noticed that there was indeed a large group of Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s elites gathered at the entrance of the Demon Elimination Cave.</p>
 <p>Leading them were two True Immortal-level experts.<br>　<br>In other words, apart from Zi Xunyi and the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief, the Bloodscale Monstrous Clan possessed four other rank one True Immortals.<br>　<br>Their strength was truly powerful.</p>
 <p>However, upon seeing Zi Xunyi, they immediately moved aside.<br>　　<br>No one dared to obstruct Zi Xunyi. Of course… with their strength, none of them would be able to stop Zi Xunyi.</p>
 <p>After leaving the Demon Elimination Cave, Li Yue’er said, “Let me go.”<br>　　<br>However, Zi Xunyi did not immediately release Li Yue’er. Instead, she looked to Chu Feng.<br>　　<br>“You can let her go. She is unrelated to this matter,” Chu Feng said.<br>　<br>“Buzz~~~”<br>　　<br>After Chu Feng said those words, with a thought, Zi Xunyi created an entrance to her spirit formation.<br>　<br>“With this, we are truly even now,” Li Yue’er said those words to Chu Feng. Then, she started flying toward the distance. In the blink of an eye, she disappeared.<br>　　<br>“How deeply does this girl not want to owe me a favor?” Chu Feng shook his head with a smile.<br>　<br>He noticed that Li Yue’er’s tone was very ice-cold when she said the words ‘we are truly even now.’ It was the same as when she first knew Chu Feng.<br>　　<br>However, at the same time, Chu Feng also noticed that Li Yue’er revealed a slightly relaxed expression on her icily arrogant face when she said those words. It was as if she was finally able to lay down a heavy burden.<br>　　<br>It could be seen that this girl was truly not fond of owing another a favor.<br>　　<br>After Li Yue’er left, Zi Xunyi did not linger. She continued to journey toward the Kong Heavenly Clan with Chu Feng.<br>　　<br>On the journey, Zi Xunyi suddenly asked, “You two must have jointly set up the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation, right?”<br>　<br>“That is right, senior,” Chu Feng answered.<br>　<br>“To have this sort of level at such young ages, it would appear that the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm has once again entered a period where talents come forth in large numbers,” Zi Xunyi said with admiration.</p>
 <p>“Senior, I am very curious. How did you manage to see through her Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation?” Chu Feng asked curiously.<br>　<br>Although Zi Xunyi was a very powerful Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, it would remain very difficult for one to see through the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation. After all, not even True Immortals could detect the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation.<br>　<br>Logically, Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritists should also not be able to detect the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation.<br>　　<br>If one was unable to detect the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation, it would be practically impossible for one to breach it.</p>
 <p>“There is a defensive spirit formation surrounding the palace that I reside in. That is a spirit formation that I spent a thousand years to set up.”<br>　　<br>“That defensive spirit formation will be activated as long as I am in that palace. As for what it did, it was capable of detecting practically all concealment formations, including even the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation,” Zi Xunyi said.<br>　<br>“So that’s the case,” Chu Feng did not doubt Zi Xunyi’s explanation. Instead, he absolutely believed her.<br>　　<br>The strength of martial cultivators originated from within them. They were able to unleash overwhelming battle power in a split second.<br>　　<br>As long as a martial cultivator was there, they would be able to bring their strength there.<br>　　<br>As for world spiritists, they too grasped a power capable of utter destruction. Merely, the power of world spiritists needed spirit formations to unleash.</p>
 <p>The stronger a spirit formation was, the more time was needed to set up the spirit formation. Furthermore, that sort of spirit formation could not be moved, and could only be active at designated locations.</p>
 <p>In fact… with Chu Feng’s current world spirit techniques, if he was given sufficient time, he would also be able to set up a spirit formation capable of withstanding True Immortals at a designated place.</p>
 <p>As for Zi Xunyi, she had used a total of a thousand years to set up her spirit formation. As such, the might of her spirit formation would naturally be no small matter.<br>　<br>Thus, it would not be surprising for Zi Xunyi to have set up a spirit formation capable of detecting the Immortal-avoiding Concealment Formation.<br>　<br>Suddenly, Zi Xunyi asked, “How is he right now?”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng knew that by ‘he,’ she meant Ying Mingchao.</p>
 <p>“Senior Ying Mingchao is doing very well. Apart from being unable to move, there is nothing serious,” Chu Feng said.<br>　<br>“That’s good,” Zi Xunyi said faintly.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Zi Xunyi stopped. She said to Chu Feng, “Wait here for a bit.”</p>
 <p>After saying those words, with a thought, a wave of spirit power emerged from Zi Xunyi’s body. Then, like a whirlwind, it began to spin while revolving around her. Soon, it covered her completely.</p>
 <p>That spirit power only stayed on her for a short moment before disappearing.<br>　<br>When the spirit power dissipated, Chu Feng’s gaze changed when he saw Zi Xunyi again.<br>　　<br>The current Zi Xunyi was no longer that old woman with wrinkles all over her face. She had turned into a pretty young woman.</p>
 <p>She possessed fair skin, a signature oval face, large spirited eyes, sexy red lips and an enchanting figure.<br>　　<br>The current Zi Xunyi was simply a beauty.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, even her clothes had changed. She was now wearing a long purple skirt.</p>
 <p>Beautiful. At the very least, her outward appearance was that of a beauty, a rarely seen beauty.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was also able to tell that Zi Xunyi’s beauty was most definitely not a disguise. Rather, she was naturally this beautiful. At least, she was this beautiful when she was young.</p>
