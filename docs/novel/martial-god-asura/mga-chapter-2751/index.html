 <p><strong>Chapter 2751 - Crystal Invitation Title Plate</strong></p>
 <p>“The strongest among the younger generation should be Chu Qing. However, he is unable to participate in the next Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition. Thus, he will not be my competitor, and I will not have to worry about him.”</p>
 <p>“However, the two that pose the greatest threat, Chu Ruoshi and Song Yunfei, were both rank seven True Immortals two years ago. Who knows whether or not they might be rank eight True Immortals now?”</p>
 <p>“Even if they’re not rank eight True Immortals now, they might become rank eight True Immortals by the time the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition begins.”</p>
 <p>“Assuming that their cultivation will be rank eight True Immortal, it remains that I only have a year’s time to reach that. It will be very difficult for me to surpass them in a year.”</p>
 <p>“After all, they are the actual geniuses of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm. Chu Xianshuo is simply incomparable to them,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“In that case, do you plan to give up on it? You’re not planning to participate in the Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition?” Her Lady Queen asked.</p>
 <p>“Of course not. No matter what, I will still do my best. Regardless, I will determine whether or not to participate based on my own strength.”</p>
 <p>“I’d like to participate. However, if I am to participate, I must amaze everyone,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. That’s what you have to do. If your strength still hasn't reached theirs by the time the next Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition starts, don’t participate, and wait till the following Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition.”</p>
 <p>“If the following Heavenly Beloved Martial Competition is still not good, then you can wait till the one after that. After all, you’re still very young and very talented. Sooner or later, you will overtake them and surpass them.”</p>
 <p>“After all, the way this Queen sees it, regardless of how talented those people might be, they will still be inferior to you. Sooner or later, you will surpass them. It will only be an issue of time,” Her Lady Queen was filled with confidence toward Chu Feng as she said those words.</p>
 <p>While Chu Feng and Eggy were chatting, Chu Feng had managed to approach the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain. He was now able to see it clearly.</p>
 <p>The Spirit Formation Immortal Domain was a vast forest. There were occasional mountains protruding out of the vast forest, however, the location that was the most eye-catching was located deep within the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain. Located there was a mountain range that reached directly into the sky. It was extremely eye-catching.</p>
 <p>Not only was that mountain range very large, but it was also very tall. It pierced through the clouds. Only a small portion of the mountain range was visible underneath the clouds.</p>
 <p>Of course, as Chu Feng was a world spiritist, the clouds were simply unable to block his line of sight. Thus, Chu Feng was able to see the appearance of the mountain range above the clouds.</p>
 <p>The mountain range extended far past the clouds. Due to the fact that it was so high above them, it seemed to extend above the clouds into the heavens themselves.</p>
 <p>That mountain range was simply too spectacular and miraculous. At a glance, it resembled an extremely enormous Stairway to Heaven. Looking at it, one would exclaim in admiration.</p>
 <p>Apart from the mountain range that led directly into the sky, the other locations inside the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain also possessed spectacular scenery. The trees inside the forest were all exotic trees. Some stood so tall that they were about to touch the clouds. Others were glistening with light.</p>
 <p>From time to time, birds and cranes would fly over the forest. This made the region resemble a fantasy in one’s dream, an actual paradise.</p>
 <p>Even in a place like the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, a place filled with beautiful scenery, Chu Feng was still able to feel carefree and relaxed upon seeing such a scene.</p>
 <p>“This is strange.”</p>
 <p>Upon reaching the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain, Chu Feng started to frown. A puzzled expression emerged in his eyes.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because he discovered that a defensive formation had been placed around the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain. That defensive formation extended from high above the sky and reached deep underground. It had completely sealed off the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain. As such, it was simply impossible for one to enter it.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng had heard from the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master that there wasn’t a defensive spirit formation around the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain. One could enter and leave as one wished.</p>
 <p>“Are those people from the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan?”</p>
 <p>Soon, Chu Feng discovered that there was a spirit formation gate outside of the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain. Standing outside of the gate were several people.</p>
 <p>No, to be exact, they were not people, not humans. While they were humanoid, they did not have human appearances.</p>
 <p>They were very thin, yet very tall. They were each over a dozen meters tall. They were tall and thin like bamboo poles.</p>
 <p>Although their appearances resembled humans as they also possessed human-like facial features, their skin was covered with blue scales. Looking closely, their appearances were very frightening.</p>
 <p>By comparison, that snake-tailed little girl Chu Feng had saved earlier was much more adorable.</p>
 <p>That being said, Chu Feng felt that those people should be from the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan. The reason for that was because their auras were very powerful. Not even Chu Feng was able to determine their cultivation. Chu Feng felt that they must be experts with cultivations above the True Immortal realm.</p>
 <p>That was the reason why Chu Feng felt that they were from the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing them, Chu Feng was unable to help himself from exclaiming in admiration. Sure enough, the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm was a place with experts like clouds. No matter where he went, he would always encounter people much stronger than himself. Chu Feng was truly weak and small in the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.</p>
 <p>Even though Chu Feng could already be considered to be very outstanding among the younger generation, when compared to the entire Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm, Chu Feng was still a very weak existence.</p>
 <p>It would not even be excessive to say that Chu Feng was amongst the cultivators at the bottom of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm.</p>
 <p>After all, like Song Xi, he would not be able to withstand a single blow before Heavenly Immortal-level experts, much less Martial Immortal-level experts.</p>
 <p>“What is going on? There’s actually a defensive spirit formation around the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain this year?” Right at that moment, Li Xiang and his two companions also arrived.</p>
 <p>The three of them were also very surprised upon seeing this scene. It would appear that the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain this year was truly different from previous years.<br>　<br>“It would appear that it would be very difficult to try to mingle our way in this year around. No, it would simply be impossible.”</p>
 <p>“Hey, outsider brat, although I do not know how you came to know of the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain, I can tell you with certainty that this Spirit Formation Immortal Domain is not a place that you can enter just because you want to.”</p>
 <p>“If you want to enter the Spirit Formation Immortal Domain, you’ll need to possess an invitation title plate,” Li Xiang said. As he spoke, he took out his invitation title plate from his Cosmos Sack.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng noticed that Li Xiang’s invitation title plate had the same appearance as his own. Merely… the color of Li Xiang’s invitation title plate was completely different from his own.</p>
 <p>Li Xiang’s invitation title plate was golden. It seemed to be made of gold.</p>
 <p>Of course, his title plate would naturally not be made of gold. Rather, it was formed with spirit power. There were even veined patterns flowing through it.</p>
 <p>“You see this? This is a invitation title plate. Do you have one? If you don’t, then beat it. Go find yourself a cool place to stay. After all, the Ancient Era’s Serpent Clan is not something you can afford to provoke,” Li Xiang said to Chu Feng as he fiddled with his invitation title plate.</p>
 <p>He seemed to be wanting to deliberately make others notice his invitation title plate, as his hand movements were very exaggerated.</p>
 <p>“It’s actually a Golden Invitation Title Plate. Big brother Li Xiang, Lord Villa Master truly adores you.”</p>
 <p>Seeing this, the two other men from the Sacred Pellet Villa both revealed envious gazes in their eyes. At the same time, they also took out their respective invitation title plates from their Cosmos Sacks.</p>
 <p>Their title plates were slightly different from Li Xiang’s title plate.</p>
 <p>While the shape was the same, their invitation title plates seemed to be made of silver.</p>
 <p>“Humph, humph, of course,” Seeing the envious gazes of the two men, Li Xiang revealed a big smile. He was feeling extremely pleased.</p>
 <p>Then, he turned his tiny eyes to Chu Feng again. With a mocking tone, he asked, “Hey, I’m asking you if you have an invitation title plate. If you don’t, then get the hell out of here.”</p>
 <p>In response, Chu Feng took out the invitation title plate handed to him by the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master. “You’re talking about this?”</p>
 <p>“That is?!!!”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing the glass-like invitation title plate Chu Feng held in his hand, Li Xiang and his two companions immediately opened their mouths wide in shock.</p>
 <p>At practically the same time, the three of them uttered in shock, “Heavens! That’s a Crystal Invitation Title Plate, the highest invitation title plate!”</p>
