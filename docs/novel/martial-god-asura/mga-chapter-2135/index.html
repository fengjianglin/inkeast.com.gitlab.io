 <p><strong> Chapter 2135 - Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique</strong></p>
 <p>“Divine Punishment?”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s heart immediately shivered.</p>
 <p>Merely by listening to the name, Chu Feng was able to tell how frightening it would be.</p>
 <p>“By Divine Punishment, it means that it is a Self-punishing Mysterious Technique above Heaven Punishment.”</p>
 <p>“If Mortal Punishment draws upon the lightnings from one’s bloodline, Earthen Punishment from the earth and Heaven Punishment from the sky...”</p>
 <p>“Then, Divine Punishment will no longer only be drawing upon lightning at all. Instead, a Divine Tribulation will descend upon you.”</p>
 <p>“The descent of a Divine Tribulation will cause destruction to both heaven and the earth. It is a sort of power that surpasses one’s ability to endure.”</p>
 <p>“However, if you wish to reach a breakthrough, you must withstand that sort of power. You will only be given two choices, success or failure. Furthermore, if you are to fail… not even your soul will remain.”</p>
 <p>“If the other Self-punishment Mysterious Techniques unleash punishments that are still within one’s ability to endure.”</p>
 <p>“Then, the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique will unleash punishments that surpass one’s ability to endure.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, those that train in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Techniques will all obtain a true transformation with every breakthrough,” Chu Xuanyuan explained.</p>
 <p>“Father, has there been anyone that has successfully practiced such a powerful Self-punishment Mysterious Technique before?” Chu Feng asked in a serious manner.</p>
 <p>“The Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique is not something that just anyone can attempt. As far as I know… only two people have ever trained in it,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“Who are they?” Chu Feng hurriedly asked.</p>
 <p>“Those two people…”</p>
 <p>“One is your grandfather, Chu Hanxian.”</p>
 <p>“As for the the other, it is I, your father, Chu Xuanyuan,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“Ah,” Chu Feng was startled upon hearing those words. Originally, he had thought about finding an excuse to refuse. However, upon hearing those words, he was unable to find any excuse to refuse.</p>
 <p>Both his grandfather and father had trained in that Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. Furthermore, they had both succeeded. If he were to choose to cower at this point, he would truly be an utter disappointment.</p>
 <p>Not to mention how others would view him, he himself would also feel that he had disgraced the honor and reputation of his grandfather and his father.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, after knowing that his father and grandfather had both trained in that Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, Chu Feng also started to feel interest toward the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique from the bottom of his heart.</p>
 <p>“Feng’er, back then, your grandfather did not force me to train in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. As such, I will also not force you.”</p>
 <p>“The reason I mention this to you right now is so that you are given the opportunity to choose. Heaven Punishment and Divine Punishment, you decide which one you want to train,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“Divine Punishment,” Chu Feng said without the slightest hesitation. He had long since made the decision in his heart.</p>
 <p>“Why? Are you not afraid of death?” Chu Xuanyuan asked.</p>
 <p>“I am. I don’t think there’s anyone that would not fear death,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Then, why did you still insist on choosing the Divine Punishment?” Chu Xuanyuan asked.</p>
 <p>“Father, I am not arrogant, conceited or acting recklessly. I merely wish to obtain better achievements. I wish to prove myself.”</p>
 <p>“The path of martial cultivation is a double-edged sword to begin with. If one wishes to reach a greater distance, one will have to undergo greater danger.”</p>
 <p>“Although the path that I plan to take is a dangerous path, I am not the first one to take this path. Before me, my grandfather and my father have already walked that path. Thus, by comparison… the path is already much safer now that it has come to me.”</p>
 <p>“At the very least, I know how to walk the path. Thus… there is no reason for me to not choose the Divine Punishment,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Well said. As expected from my son,” At that moment, a smile filled Chu Xuanyuan’s face.</p>
 <p>“Feng’er, your way of thinking is correct. Although the Divine Punishment is very dangerous, one will also be able to obtain a greater harvest from it.”</p>
 <p>“The wielders of Heavenly Lightning Bloodlines all possess identical characteristics. I believe you’ve also seen that brat from the Ying Heavenly Clan. He possessed all the power that you possess right now. For example, there is the Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings that can increase one’s cultivation. Then, there’s the heaven-defying battle power.”</p>
 <p>“However, the power of Heavenly Lightning Bloodlines will be transformed in the Martial Ancestor realm. After reaching the Martial Ancestor realm, the nine Heavenly Lightning will fuse into one. This is commonly referred to as the Nine Lightnings Fusion.</p>
 <p>“After the Nine Lightnings Fusion, one will be able to form a Lightning Mark. Those that trained in Mortal Punishment Mysterious Techniques will form a Mortal Mark. Earthen Punishment Mysterious Techniques will form an Earthen Mark, and Heaven Punishment Divine Techniques will form a Heaven Mark.”</p>
 <p>“As for Divine Punishment Mysterious Techniques, it will form a Divine Mark.”</p>
 <p>“The different sorts of Lightning Marks will show others how powerful the possessor of the Heavenly Lightning Bloodline is, as well as what sort of Self-punishment Mysterious Technique they trained in.”</p>
 <p>“However, that is not the important aspect. Most importantly, the more powerful one’s Lightning Mark, the stronger the power it will bring to its master. Their future accomplishments will also be greater.”</p>
 <p>“In other words, one’s Lightning Mark symbolizes one’s status and strength. When you form a Divine Mark, very few people will dare to disrespect you.”</p>
 <p>“The reason for that is because not everyone possesses the courage to train in Divine Punishment Mysterious Techniques, nor are they something that just anyone can practice, or something that one can learn just because one wishes to learn it,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“Father, I understand.” After hearing of the profoundness of the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, Chu Feng had become extremely impatient to know exactly what the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique was like.</p>
 <p>“Feng’er, have you really made your decision?” Chu Xuanyuan asked.</p>
 <p>“I’ve decided. I am going to train in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Since that’s the case, I, your father will teach you the cultivation method for the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique,” As Chu Xuanyuan spoke, he placed his finger onto Chu Feng’s forehead.</p>
 <p>“There will be a slight pain. You’ll have to bear with it,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“Mn,” Chu Feng nodded.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, light shone on Chu Xuanyuan’s finger. Then, a boundless power entered Chu Feng’s head from Chu Xuanyuan’s finger.</p>
 <p>“Wuu~~~”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng immediately felt a sort of unbearable pain entering his head. It was a sensation where he felt as if his head was about to explode.</p>
 <p>However, that was only the beginning. The pain in his head soon spread through his entire body.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng realized that the pain didn’t seem to be as simple as entering his body. Instead, it seemed more like it was trying to fuse with his soul and his bloodline. From today on, it would be destined to live and die together with him by becoming part of him.</p>
 <p>Finally, everything stopped. Chu Feng was covered with sweat and gasping for breath. Even though the pain had passed, Chu Feng still felt lingering fears.</p>
 <p>“Father, is that the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique?” Chu Feng asked Chu Xuanyuan.</p>
 <p>He discovered that the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique was different from all the mysterious techniques that he had trained in before. For other mysterious techniques, one would merely need to follow a designated cultivation path with one’s martial power. With that, one would be able to stabilize one’s cultivation and increase one’s strength.</p>
 <p>However, the so-called Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique was completely different. It was a method that completely fused with one’s soul.</p>
 <p>In other words, Chu Feng had yet to attempt to train in the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. However, if he were to train in it, he felt that his Inherited Bloodline would definitely become completely different.</p>
 <p>“That is the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. How are you feeling?” Chu Xuanyuan asked with a smile.</p>
 <p>“This feeling is extremely good. I feel that my Inherited Bloodline, my soul and even my physical body were all promoted.”</p>
 <p>“I truly wish to experience the true charm of the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique right now,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>What Chu Feng said was the truth. He was truly impatient to completely grasp the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique. He wanted to further increase the strength of his Inherited Bloodline.</p>
 <p>“Since you wish to experience the charm of the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique, go ahead and train in it,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“Father, doesn’t this Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique require one to become a Half Martial Ancestor to train?” Chu Feng asked in astonishment.</p>
 <p>Although the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique had fused with Chu Feng’s soul and bloodline, it had yet to completely fuse with Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was able to sense that it was not up to him to decide if the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique fused with him. Instead, it was decided by his cultivation.</p>
 <p>With Chu Feng’s current cultivation, it was impossible for him to completely fuse the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique with his bloodline. However, should he reach the Half Martial Ancestor level of cultivation, even if he were then to be against it, the Divine Punishment Mysterious Technique would automatically fuse with his body. At that time, he would not be able to stop it even if he wanted to.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, you need to become a Half Martial Ancestor,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
 <p>“But, my cultivation is still insufficient,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“That’s simple. I, your father, will help you set foot into the Half Martial Ancestor realm right away,” Chu Xuanyuan said.</p>
