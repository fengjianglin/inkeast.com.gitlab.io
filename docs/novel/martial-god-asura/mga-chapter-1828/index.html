 <p><strong>&nbsp;MGA: Chapter 1828 - Extremely Heaven-defying</strong></p>
 <p>“Mn, this is all because of your blessings. If I hadn’t accompanied you here, it would have be impossible for me to reach a breakthrough this quickly,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Great! Great! Great! This is truly great! This is simply two joyous events happening simultaneously! Let’s go out and let that senior who is waiting for us enjoy the joy too,” As Yaojiao Tingyu spoke, she leapt out of the Inheritance Pond.</p>
 <p>“Succeeded?” That Peace Faction’s Martial Emperor had a pleasantly surprised expression. After all, the change that had happened to Yaojiao Tingyu was extremely evident.</p>
 <p>“Succeeded. Senior, I’ve really managed to successfully obtain the inheritance. Our Peace Faction will be able to continue to maintain the authority in our King Monstrous Dragon Race. All of this is because of Chu Feng. He is our King Monstrous Dragon Race’s great benefactor,” Yaojiao Tingyu said.</p>
 <p>“Great, great, great!” That Martial Emperor was extremely excited, and said three ‘greats’ in succession. Then, with a ‘putt,’ he actually knelt before Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Senior, what are you doing?” Chu Feng hurriedly tried to help him back up.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, your enormous kindness is not something that I can thank with words. The benevolence you’ve shown our King Monstrous Dragon Race is something that we must definitely repay. If you are to ever need me in the future, please don’t hold back. Even if I am to go through water and tread on fire, even if I am to throw my measly life away, I will be willing to do so,” That Martial Emperor spoke with a serious expression, and refused to get back up.</p>
 <p>“Senior, you’re taking this too seriously. Princess Tingyu and I knew one another to begin with. We are friends. I, Chu Feng, am never one to seek for returns when helping my friends,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, your benevolence is something that our King Monstrous Dragon Race must repay. You do not know how important this is to our King Monstrous Dragon Race,” That Martial Emperor insisted.</p>
 <p>“You actually kneeled to a human. You are truly a disgrace to our King Monstrous Dragon Race,” Right at this moment, a familiar voice sounded from the distance</p>
 <p>“You’re still alive?” Upon seeing that person, Yaojiao Tingyu and the Peace Faction’s Martial Emperor were both shocked. The two of them both revealed expressions of panic. The person that had arrived was precisely the rank two Martial Emperor from the War Faction.</p>
 <p>He had actually survived the siege of the Underworld Fire Bugs.</p>
 <p>“Tingyu, no matter what, I am still your senior. Do you really wish for my death that much?” That man sneered as he proceeded to walk toward Chu Feng and the others.</p>
 <p>“What do you want?” Yaojiao Tingyu asked.</p>
 <p>“Very simple. You wished for my death. Thus, I am going to kill you. Especially the current you. You actually managed to obtain Lord Dragon King’s inheritance. As such, you must be killed,” The War Faction’s Martial Emperor said coldly.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, Tingyu, quickly escape,” At this moment, that Peace Faction’s rank one Martial Emperor suddenly leapt forth. He turned into an enormous black monstrous dragon and pounced at the War Faction’s rank two Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>He had revealed his true form. He was planning to use his life to buy time for Chu Feng and Yaojiao Tingyu’s escape.</p>
 <p>“Humph, overestimating your capabilities,” The War Faction’s Martial Emperor snorted coldly. As a rank two Martial Emperor, how could he possibly fear a rank one Martial Emperor?</p>
 <p>With a thought, his oppressive might swept forth. He was planning to use his oppressive might to crush that Place Faction’s Martial Emperor to death.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right at the moment when his oppressive might crushed down toward the Peace Faction’s Martial Emperor, a golden-bright and dazzling spirit formation suddenly appeared out of nowhere. It turned into a wall and blocked his oppressive might.</p>
 <p>“Dragon Mark world spirit formation?” As the golden spirit formation filled with dragon marks appeared, not to mention the War Faction’s Martial Emperor, even the Peace Faction’s Martial Emperor and Yaojiao Tingyu were shocked.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you’re actually a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist?” The War Faction’s Martial Emperor looked to Chu Feng with a gaze filled with astonishment. He knew that that spirit formation had been unleashed by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Your life is quite tough. You must’ve used some sort of treasure to survive, right?” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Answer my question!” The War Faction’s Martial Emperor shouted. The shocked expression he revealed did not decrease, and instead increased.</p>
 <p>“You are able to see my spirit formation. Aren’t you just asking a question that you already know the answer to?” Chu Feng smiled coldly. Then, he said, “Actually, it is quite good that you were able to survive. For scum like you, I have always been fond of personally taking care of them.”</p>
 <p>As Chu Feng finished saying those words, he had already walked to the Peace Faction’s Martial Emperor’s side. Then, he said to the Peace Faction’s Martial Emperor, “Senior, allow this junior to take care of this scum of the King Monstrous Dragon Race.”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you…” The Peace Faction’s Martial Emperor was worried. Although Chu Feng’s cultivation had increased, he was still only a rank eight Half Martial Emperor. As such, how could he possibly fight against a rank two Martial Emperor?</p>
 <p>“Senior, please trust me,” Chu Feng said confidently.</p>
 <p>“Be careful,” The Peace Faction’s Martial Emperor gave in. After all, he did not possess the ability to contend against that War Faction’s Martial Emperor. Yet, Chu Feng had blocked that War Faction’s Martial Emperor’s oppressive might with his spirit formation.</p>
 <p>Although he wasn't very confident in Chu Feng, it remained that Chu Feng’s strength surpassed his own. If he were to fight the War Faction’s Martial Emperor, only death would await him. However, if Chu Feng were to fight, they might really be able to live.</p>
 <p>Thus, the Peace Faction’s Martial Emperor arrived beside Yaojiao Tingyu and brought her to a distant and sufficiently safe location.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he stood in confrontation against the War Faction’s Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>“Ridiculous. A mere rank eight Half Martial Emperor actually dares to speak nonsense about taking care of me? Humans are truly ignorant,” The War Faction’s Martial Emperor did not place Chu Feng in his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Enough of your rubbish. I’ll let you attack me first,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, even if you are a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, you are definitely no match for me. I am not a rank one Martial Emperor. Rather, I am a rank two Martial Emperor. Furthermore, I am an elite of our King Monstrous Dragon Race. I will let you know the meaning of fear with my King Monstrous Dragon Beast’s Bloodline,” The War Faction’s Martial Emperor said as he stared at Chu Feng ferociously with his crimson eyes.</p>
 <p>“I’ll tell you this. To fight against you, I’m not going to use spirit formations. Instead, I will only use my martial power,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“What did you say?” The War Faction’s Martial Emperor’s expression changed. He did not dare to believe what he had just heard.</p>
 <p>“You will understand soon enough,” Immediately after Chu Feng finished saying those words, a buzzing sound could be heard. Lightning flashed through his eyes, and then his Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings appeared together. In a flash, Chu Feng’s cultivation went from rank eight Half Martial Emperor to rank one Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~”</p>
 <p>Then, Chu Feng’s body shifted, and he instantly arrived before that War Faction’s Martial Emperor. Furthermore, his fist was shot explosively at that War Faction’s Martial Emperor. [1. What happened to letting him attack first?]</p>
 <p>“Damn it!”</p>
 <p>The War Faction’s Martial Emperor immediately raised his arm to block Chu Feng’s fist. However, while he managed to block Chu Feng’s fist strike, the aching pain that was being transmitted from his arm made him feel disbelief.</p>
 <p>It was one thing for Chu Feng’s cultivation to increase from rank eight Half Martial Emperor to rank one Martial Emperor. However, his battle power was actually capable of contending against him.</p>
 <p>One must know that he possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. For Chu Feng to be able to threaten him as a rank one Martial Emperor, it meant that Chu Feng’s battle power was capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation.</p>
 <p>“Prepare to die,” Chu Feng did not give him time to consider. As his fists and feet crisscrossed one another, his attacks grew increasingly more ferocious. The War Faction’s Martial Emperor had been caught unprepared, and was incapable of dealing with Chu Feng’s attacks. At this moment, all he could do was dodge, block and be thrashed upon.</p>
 <p>“This is truly inconceivable. Little friend Chu Feng’s talent is actually this heaven-defying?!!!!”</p>
 <p>Both the Peace Faction’s Martial Emperor and Yaojiao Tingyu were exclaiming in astonishment. They felt this to be extremely unimaginable. It was extremely unbelievable that Chu Feng actually possessed a method to break through from Half Martial Emperor to a rank one Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>Martial Emperors and Half Martial Emperors were intrinsically different. Many people and monstrous beasts possessed special methods to increase their cultivations for a short period of time when they were Half Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>For example, there were Imperial Bloodlines and Divine Powers as well as special Inherited Bloodlines for certain monstrous beasts. All of them were capable of accomplishing this feat.</p>
 <p>However, after reaching the Martial Emperor level in their cultivation, it would be extremely difficult and practically impossible to accomplish that.</p>
 <p>While one could increase one’s cultivation through the use of one’s bloodline or Divine Power at the Half Martial Emperor level, it was no longer possible once one became a Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>For example, the Supreme Elders of the Four Great Imperial Clans, as well as those Martial Emperors that possessed Divine Bodies, were all extremely talented individuals.</p>
 <p>When they were rank eight Half Martial Emperors, they had all been able to use their respective methods to increase their cultivations to rank nine Half Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>However, upon reaching rank nine Half Martial Emperor, they were no longer capable of using special methods to increase their cultivations to rank one Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>After becoming Martial Emperors, it was also impossible for them to use their methods to increase their cultivations from rank one Martial Emperor to rank two Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>Regardless of whether it was Divine Powers or Inherited Bloodlines, they were only capable of raising their battle power by a certain amount when they reached the Martial Emperor level of cultivation, and it was impossible for these methods to actually increase their cultivation itself.</p>
 <p>In other words, no matter what sort of method one possessed, it was impossible to increase one’s cultivation from Half Martial Emperor to Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>Half Martial Emperors and Martial Emperors were completely different. There was an intrinsic gap between them, as well as an unbreakable confinement. It was an insurmountable disparity.</p>
 <p>However, this sort of thing that was impossible to accomplish was actually done by Chu Feng. What others could not accomplish had been accomplished by Chu Feng. That enormous gap that could not be surmounted was actually crossed by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>As such, how could Yaojiao Tingyu and the others not be shocked?!!!</p>
