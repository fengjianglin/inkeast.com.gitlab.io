 <p><strong> Chapter 2382 - I Am Going To Force My Way Through</strong></p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you… you… exactly what sort of demonic technique did you use?!” Kong Zheng was so furious that he started to shiver. He was still unable to accept the truth Chu Feng had revealed to him.</p>
 <p>“You can say whatever you want. However, the truth remains as it is. You are unable to accomplish what I can accomplish.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, even if I did use a demonic technique like you keep insisting, so what? It would only mean that I know that demonic technique, whereas you do not. To put it simply, you are inferior to me,” Chu Feng knew that Kong Zheng was extremely egotistical. Thus, he showed no quarter, and ruthlessly attacked Kong Zheng’s ego.</p>
 <p>“You!!!” Sure enough, after being insulted by Chu Feng, Kong Zheng was unable to find a way to refute Chu Feng. and grew so furious that he began to step back repeatedly. Then, his complexion turned pale, and his mouth opened. “Puu,” he sprayed out a mouthful of blood.</p>
 <p>He… was actually so angered by Chu Feng that he vomited blood!!!</p>
 <p>“Ssss~~~”</p>
 <p>Seeing all the things that were happening before them, the crowd sucked in a mouthful of cold air.</p>
 <p>They were shocked to discover that not only did Chu Feng possess extraordinary strength, he also possessed dreadful eloquence, and was actually capable of angering someone to the state of vomiting blood with words. This was simply something that they’d never seen before.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha… hahahaha…”</p>
 <p>After vomiting blood, Kong Zheng burst into a strange laughter.</p>
 <p>The crowd were all perplexed by his laughter. They had no idea what Kong Zheng was thinking.</p>
 <p>The situation at hand could be said to be completely humiliating for Kong Zheng. As such, there shouldn’t be any reason for him to burst into such wild laughter, no?</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, so what if you can move the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone? Don’t you forget that on the way here, you were beaten fleeing by this great young master!” Kong Zheng said to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“What? Chu Feng was beaten fleeing by Kong Zheng?” Hearing those words, the first reaction of the crowd was astonishment. The reason for that was because they did not feel that Chu Feng would be defeated by Kong Zheng.</p>
 <p>“Haha…” Faced with what Kong Zheng declared, Chu Feng chuckled.</p>
 <p>“What are you laughing about?! Is what I said not the truth? Did you not flee from me?” Kong Zheng continued. He became more emotional. The reason for that was because he truly wanted to retrieve his lost face.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. I fled. So what?” Chu Feng had a smile on his face. He remained completely calm the entire time.</p>
 <p>“You’re kidding! That Chu Feng was actually really beaten fleeing by Kong Zheng? Could it be that Kong Zheng’s strength surpasses Chu Feng’s?”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s answer immediately cause an enormous commotion among the crowd. Originally, with what happened earlier, they all felt that Chu Feng possessed strength above Kong Zheng.</p>
 <p>However, they were surprised to discover that their previous guesses had been wrong.</p>
 <p>After all, even Chu Feng himself admitted to having been beaten fleeing by Kong Zheng.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the crowd had an enormous drop in elevation toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“It’s good that you admitted to it,” Kong Zheng was listening to the conversations of the crowd. When he heard their conversations, his previously pale complexion finally became a bit more rosy.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because he felt that he had finally retrieved a bit of the face that he had lost earlier.</p>
 <p>Like that, Kong Zheng planned to continue to retrieve his lost face. He wanted to trample Chu Feng underneath his foot and reveal himself to be the true genius.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, I have admitted to it. That said, I am very curious. What exactly are you planning?” Chu Feng said to Kong Zheng with a beaming smile. Even though he was asking a question, his composed appearance made it seem as if he had already seen through Kong Zheng.</p>
 <p>“What am I planning? Isn’t it obvious?”</p>
 <p>“Very well, I’ll inform you right now what I plan to do. Even if I am unable to move the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone, I am still going to be the one to win in this competition. After all, I merely need to defeat you and then bring you back,” Kong Zheng said to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“So that’s what you’re planning. If that’s the case, then I’m afraid that I’ll end up disappointing you,” Chu Feng shook his head with a smile. This was undisguised mockery. He was ridiculing Kong Zheng for being ignorant.</p>
 <p>“Disappoint me? Why?” Kong Zheng was surprised. He did not understand what Chu Feng meant.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, Chu Feng’s body suddenly shifted. Like a phantom, he arrived before Kong Zheng. Then, Chu Feng shot forth a punch.</p>
 <p>“Bang!” That punch landed onto Kong Zheng’s abdomen.</p>
 <p>“Wuuah.”</p>
 <p>Everything happened too quickly. Before Kong Zheng could react, he was knocked flying. When he landed, he rolled on the ground repeatedly.</p>
 <p>“This…” At that moment, the crowd’s expressions all changed once again. They all revealed shocked expressions.</p>
 <p>What was going on?</p>
 <p>Wasn’t it made known earlier that Chu Feng was no match against Kong Zheng? That Chu Feng was beaten fleeing by Kong Zheng.</p>
 <p>Thus, what was with this situation now? How did Chu Feng manage to knock Kong Zheng flying with his punch?!!!</p>
 <p>“You… your cultivation, how did it become rank seven Half Martial Ancestor?!!!” Kong Zheng held his abdomen with one hand and propped himself up from the ground with his other hand. He had a painful expression on his face. He had barely managed to crawl back up. Merely, at that moment, his eyes were filled with astonishment.</p>
 <p>“Who told you that I’m not a rank seven Half Martial Ancestor?” Chu Feng smiled. His gaze was filled with contempt.</p>
 <p>It was as if Chu Feng was an experienced old cat that was toying with a newborn rat. Everything… was within Chu Feng’s grasp.</p>
 <p>“You… you actually concealed your cultivation. No wonder… no wonder!!!”</p>
 <p>“You despicable bastard. You dared deceive me by concealing your cultivation!!!” Kong Zheng started to gnash his teeth furiously. At that moment, he had determined that Chu Feng had been a rank seven Half Martial Ancestor instead of a rank five Half Martial Ancestor from the very start. Merely, for the sake of making him underestimate Chu Feng, Chu Feng had deliberately concealed his cultivation.</p>
 <p>Seeing Kong Zheng’s current appearance, the smile on Chu Feng’s face grew denser and denser.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng knew best what had happened to his cultivation. Before entering the Hundred Refinements Stage, he had indeed only been a rank five Half Martial Ancestor. His current rank seven Half Martial Ancestor-level cultivation was something that he had obtained through successive breakthroughs in the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.</p>
 <p>However, for the sake of not causing unnecessary trouble, he deliberately made Kong Zheng believe that he had been a rank seven Half Martial Ancestor from the very beginning. And now… he had evidently succeeded in his goal.</p>
 <p>“Hu Xuanyi, why are you still standing there? This man has trespassed into the Hundred Refinements Stage and snatched away the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. As an elder of this place, shouldn’t you execute him on the spot?!”</p>
 <p>That Kong Zheng was truly vengeful. Sensing that he was no match for Chu Feng, he turned to demand that Hu Xuanyi attack. In fact, he even wanted Hu Xuanyi to directly kill Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, how did you reach this place?” At that moment, Hu Xuanyi stood forth and questioned Chu Feng with an ice-cold tone. It was clear that he did not possess good intentions.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, tell him your identity. Since this place was established by the Chu Heavenly Clan, he will definitely not dare to make things difficult for you should he know your identity,” Her Lady Queen said.</p>
 <p>“I came here for the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. As for how I entered this place, I’m afraid I cannot tell you,” Chu Feng said to Hu Xuanyi.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, why didn’t you tell them your identity?” Her Lady Queen was astonished by Chu Feng’s refusal to do as she had said.</p>
 <p>“Eggy, I, Chu Feng, can no longer be considered to be a part of the Chu Heavenly Clan right now. Thus… even if I am to encounter difficulties, I cannot borrow the name of the Chu Heavenly Clan to break free from my predicament. Else… I will have let down the expectations my father has for me,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“You…” Her Lady Queen was so furious that her face turned deep red. However, she soon heaved a long sigh and shook her head, “I truly don’t know what to do with you. What do you plan to do now?”</p>
 <p>“If they decide to reconcile with me, it would naturally be for the best. Otherwise… I will force my way through,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“You really refuse to tell? In that case, do not blame me for being impolite!!!”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Elder Hu Xuanyi asked again. At the same time, the other guardian clan’s elders had already surrounded Chu Feng, sealing off his escape.</p>
 <p>Seeing that scene, Chu Feng facepalmed and then shook his head. He smiled lightly and said, “Seems like I’ll have to force my way through.”</p>
