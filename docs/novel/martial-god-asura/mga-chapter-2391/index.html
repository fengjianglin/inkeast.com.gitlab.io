 <p><strong> Chapter 2391 - What Is It?</strong></p>
 <p>As Chu Feng was very worried for Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong’s safety, he did not delay, and immediately proceeded directly toward the Drought Demon’s Damned Pond after Xue Ji left.</p>
 <p>Finally, Chu Feng returned to the location where Wang Qiang, Zhao Hong and that Kong Cheng had been captured.</p>
 <p>Even though Chu Feng’s cultivation had increased compared to that day, he still did not dare to act carelessly upon arriving at that place.</p>
 <p>After all, even Zhao Hong was no match for that humanoid clay monster. As such, Chu Feng would naturally not be a match for it either.</p>
 <p>The only option would be to use the Evil God Sword. However, the Evil God Sword was also what Chu Feng did not wish to use the most.</p>
 <p>“I’ve returned. I’ve also brought back the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone,” Chu Feng raised his hand that held the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone and spoke loudly.</p>
 <p>“Crash~~~”</p>
 <p>Right after Chu Feng said those words, that region of pond water started to surge, forming a whirlpool.</p>
 <p>Soon, the humanoid clay monster Chu Feng had met that day appeared at the center of the whirlpool.</p>
 <p>“I’ve brought back what you want, quickly release my friends,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“How should I know whether or not the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone you hold in your hand is real or fake. Toss it over so I can inspect it first,” The humanoid clay monster said.</p>
 <p>“Allow me to see my friends first,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Very well. I’ll let your desire be fulfilled,” After the humanoid clay monster said those words, another figure appeared from the pond water.</p>
 <p>It was Kong Cheng. Although Kong Cheng was still trapped, his complexion had grown much better compared to that day.</p>
 <p>It could be seen that during the period of time when Kong Zheng and Chu Feng were away, this humanoid clay monster had kept its promise, and had not deliberately made things difficult for Kong Cheng.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng continued to observe that region of water. He was waiting for Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong to appear. However, after a short while passed, he did not discover either of them.</p>
 <p>“Where are my friends?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Isn’t this your friend?” The humanoid clay monster said.</p>
 <p>“You’re trying to play with me?” Chu Feng revealed an angry expression.</p>
 <p>Before Chu Feng left, this humanoid clay monster had told Chu Feng and Kong Zheng to compete in obtaining the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. The person to bring back the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone first would have their friends released.</p>
 <p>Thus, this humanoid clay monster already knew that Chu Feng and Kong Zheng were enemies instead of friends.</p>
 <p>Yet now, it actually said such words. It was clear that it was deliberately toying with Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Oh, I know what you’re talking about now. You’re talking about that stutterer and that delicate and pretty woman, right?”</p>
 <p>“After you left, I questioned them about their reasons for coming here. After discovering their purpose, I decided to release them.”</p>
 <p>“As for exactly where they went, I have no clue,” That humanoid clay monster said.</p>
 <p>“......” Chu Feng felt startled. If Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong were to have truly left, Chu Feng naturally knew what the two of them planned to do. Naturally, they would have gone to search for Grandmaster Kai Hong’s treasures according to the map that Wang Qiang had.</p>
 <p>Merely, Chu Feng did not believe that this humanoid clay monster would release Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong for no reason at all.</p>
 <p>“Although I do not know why you need this Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone, but, with how insincere you are, I will not hand this Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone to you,” Chu Feng put the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone away.</p>
 <p>“You plan to have me snatch it away from you by force?” That humanoid clay monster revealed an ill-intended gaze from its empty eye sockets.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was not to be outdone, and directly took out his Evil God Sword. He fixed his eyes at the humanoid clay monster and said, “Tell me where my friends are. Else, even if you do not attack me, I will definitely not spare you either.”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, it did not lie to you! Your friends were indeed released by it! They have gone deep into the Drought Demon’s Damned Pond!” Kong Cheng shouted.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng completely ignored Kong Cheng, and pointed his Evil God Sword at the humanoid clay monster. With an extremely cold tone, he asked, “Where are my friends?!”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, don’t be impulsive,” Her Lady Queen sensed that the situation was amiss, and spoke to console Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he knew very well how dangerous the Evil God Sword was. If Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong were to have suffered bitter encounters, then even if the price he must pay would be death, Chu Feng would still definitely use the Evil God Sword to fight the monster before him.”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, stop.”</p>
 <p>“Brother, we’re f-fine.”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, Zhao Hong and Wang Qiang’s voices suddenly sounded from deep within the Drought Demon’s Damned Pond.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng turned his gaze over. Sure enough, he discovered that Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong were rapidly proceeding toward his location from the depths of the Drought Demon’s Damned Pond.</p>
 <p>Soon, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong arrived before Chu Feng. Most importantly… when the two of them passed by the humanoid clay monster, the humanoid clay monster did not try to prevent the two of them from moving onward. Just like that, Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong arrived before Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Wang Qiang, this cultivation of yours, could it be that you’ve succeeded?” Chu Feng was both surprised and delighted upon seeing Wang Qiang.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because Wang Qiang’s cultivation was no longer that of a Half Martial Ancestor. Rather, he had become a Martial Ancestor. Although he was only a rank one Martial Ancestor, it still remained that his cultivation was much stronger than when Chu Feng had left.</p>
 <p>“Hehe. W-we’ve su-succeeded. T-that guy d-didn’t lie to you, it really released us. Furthermore, I’ve a-already obtained what I wanted,” Wang Qiang said with a beaming smile. At that moment, he was feeling extremely good.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng looked to that clay humanoid monster with a complicated expression. He was confused as to what exactly that humanoid clay monster had in mind.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at the moment when Chu Feng was confused, that humanoid clay monster actually tossed Kong Cheng over too.</p>
 <p>“That guy seems to have had no intention to kill to begin with. Could it be that it was deliberately toying with you?”</p>
 <p>“Damn it, we have wasted all that effort to retrieve the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone. Yet, this guy simply never planned to kill them to begin with.”</p>
 <p>“Never have I ever been treated like this in my entire life. Once this Queen’s cultivation becomes stronger, I will definitely tear this guy apart,” Her Lady Queen was so furious that her little face turned a deep red. The way she saw it, she and Chu Feng had been played for fools by the humanoid clay monster.</p>
 <p>For the sake of the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone, Chu Feng had placed even his life on the line. Only she and Chu Feng knew about all of the hardships he had had to go through.</p>
 <p>Thus, how could the hot-tempered Queen possibly willingly accept all this?</p>
 <p>“That’s not true. If I did not return with the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone successfully, then even if Wang Qiang and Zhao Hong had obtained the treasures, they would not necessarily be able to stand before me safely like this,” Chu Feng said to Her Lady Queen.</p>
 <p>“That’s true,” Her Lady Queen nodded in agreement.</p>
 <p>“I have given you what you want. What about what I want?” That humanoid clay monster said to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Here,” Even though Chu Feng had a lot of questions in his heart, he still tossed the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone to the humanoid clay monster.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Chu Feng also fixed his gaze tightly on that humanoid clay monster.</p>
 <p>As matters stood, Chu Feng possessed a slight understanding of the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone, and knew how powerful it was.</p>
 <p>Thus, he was very curious as to why this humanoid clay monster demanded the Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.</p>
 <p>“Paa~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, a shocking scene occured before Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>The Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone that only the people from the Chu Heavenly Clan were capable of moving was effortlessly caught by the humanoid clay monster.</p>
 <p>What happened immediately after that was even more shocking.</p>
 <p>A gust of special power suddenly burst from within the body of that humanoid clay monster. That power actually dissolved the miraculous Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone.</p>
 <p>Everything happened too quickly. In merely a short moment, the indestructible Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone had been completely dissolved into the hand of that humanoid clay monster.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, like martial power, the dissolved Hundred Refinements Jadeite Stone was sucked into the humanoid clay monster’s body.</p>
 <p>“This guy, exactly what is it?!!”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng and Her Lady Queen were both endlessly astonished.</p>
