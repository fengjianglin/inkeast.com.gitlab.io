 <p><strong> Chapter 2218 - Get Along Peacefully</strong></p>
 <p>The sudden unforeseen event caused the crowd from the Red Butterfly Society to be at a complete loss.</p>
 <p>Only Chu Feng, who had kept his eyes open the entire time, managed to see what had happened. All of this was caused by the appearance of an old man.</p>
 <p>It was an old man whose body was giving off an abnormal sign.</p>
 <p>A sunset-like glow was lingering around his body. He emitted an extremely domineering air. Especially his cultivation, it was so unfathomably powerful. However, one thing was certain; he was stronger than every person present here.</p>
 <p>Faced with this old man, not to mention the others, even the seemingly undisciplined and out-of-control Chu Luyang had an expression of humbleness.</p>
 <p>All of this demonstrated that the old man was an extraordinary existence.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, a beautiful woman was following beside him.</p>
 <p>After seeing that woman, Chu Feng’s eyes immediately shone. The reason for that was because that woman was Xu Yiyi.</p>
 <p>“It’s her?” Chu Feng was extremely surprised to see Xu Yiyi. Although he knew that she was a member of the Sunset Cloud Valley, he had not expected her to appear here.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng felt that this was definitely not a coincidence. At the very least, he felt that that elder had not ordered the armies from Luyang’s Pavilion and the Sunset Cloud Valley to stop for no reason.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, long time no see,” Xu Yiyi said to Chu Feng with a smile on her face. Her attitude was very amiable. It was as if she had just met a friend that she had not seen for a very long time.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, you know her?” At that moment, everyone from the Red Butterfly Society looked to Chu Feng with astonished expressions.</p>
 <p>Their gazes were both of shock and joy. They all faintly realized that the reason why they were still alive might be because of that young lady.</p>
 <p>“It doesn’t seem to have been that long a time since we last met, no?” Chu Feng said with a light smile. His reply brought extreme joy to all of the people in the Red Butterfly Society.</p>
 <p>Evidently, their guesses were correct. Chu Feng knew that woman. Furthermore, judging from the appearance of that woman, she was most definitely not someone ordinary. Perhaps they would be able to escape a calamity today.</p>
 <p>“To me, it’s been a long time,” Xu Yiyi said with a light smile.</p>
 <p>“Why would you be here?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“I originally only came here to enjoy the show. However now, you should be thanking me,” Xu Yiyi said.</p>
 <p>“Thank?” Upon hearing that word, the crowd were all startled.</p>
 <p>“Master, it’s time for you to speak, no?” Xu Yiyi shook that Elder Su’s arm coquettishly.</p>
 <p>“Rest assured,” That Elder Su smiled lightly. Then, he looked to the Red Butterfly Society and said, “Who is the leader of the Red Butterfly Society?”</p>
 <p>Liu Xiaoli took several steps forward, then bowed respectfully as she answered, “Milord, junior Liu Xiaoli is the President of the Red Butterfly Society.”</p>
 <p>It was not that Liu Xiaoli was scared. Rather, when facing someone like that, Liu Xiaoli did not dare to be neglectful. Furthermore, she realized that this old man might be able to save their Red Butterfly Society.</p>
 <p>“Luyang’s Pavilion’s Pavilion Master and the Red Butterfly Society’s President, listen up.”</p>
 <p>“From today on, Luyang’s Pavilion and the Red Butterfly Society must get along peacefully. You are not allowed to fight anymore.”</p>
 <p>“If any party is to do otherwise, our Sunset Cloud Valley will personally extinguish that party,” Xu Yiyi’s master declared.</p>
 <p>“Elder Su, this… this…” Chu Luyang had an astonished expression. He was stunned completely speechless.</p>
 <p>The Sunset Cloud Valley had clearly come here to assist his Luyang’s Pavilion in eliminating the Red Butterfly Society. Why would it turn out this way?</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong? Do you have any objections with what I said?” Xu Yiyi’s master turned his displeased gaze toward Chu Luyang.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing that gaze, Chu Luyang’s heart trembled. In the end, even though he was filled with unwillingness, he could only lower his head and make this compromise. Respectfully, he said, “Luyang wouldn’t dare.”</p>
 <p>“Since you do not dare, then make sure to implement this rigorously. If I am to discover that Luyang’s Pavilion still dares to attack the Red Butterfly Society, I will definitely make your Luyang’s Pavilion cease to exist.”</p>
 <p>“Red Butterfly Society, this holds the same for you too. Understand?” Xu Yiyi’s master declared.</p>
 <p>After he finished saying those words, Xu Yiyi’s master turned around and entered the war chariot. He was planning to leave.</p>
 <p>“Catch,” As for Xu Yiyi, she waved her sleeve and tossed a title plate to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“What is this?” Chu Feng caught the title plate and asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“That is our Sunset Cloud Valley’s Death Exemption Title Plate. With that title plate in hand, no one in our Sunset Cloud Valley or our Sunset Cloud Valley’s subsidiary powers will dare to do anything to you. Else, it would mean that they are disrespecting my master,” Xu Yiyi said.</p>
 <p>“It’s actually a Death Exemption Title Plate?” After hearing those words, the expressions of all the crowd present changed enormously. Even the people from the Sunset Cloud Valley had a change in expression. After all, not even they possessed a Death Exemption Title Plate.</p>
 <p>‘Exactly where did that Chu Feng obtain his dog shit luck to be able to receive this sort of treatment?!’ Chu Luyang was most definitely the most furious person of everyone here.</p>
 <p>They were clearly here to eliminate the Red Butterfly Society. Yet, it turned into a forced peaceful coexistence. He was willing to disregard all of that.</p>
 <p>However, that Sunset Cloud Valley’s Death Exemption Title Plate was something that he was unable to accept.</p>
 <p>He had spent an enormous amount of wealth and tried to make connections all for the sake of obtaining one such Death Exemption Title Plate. However, even after spending all that effort, he had still not obtained one.</p>
 <p>Yet, Chu Feng had actually managed to obtain one that easily. How could he possibly accept that?</p>
 <p>“Yiyi, let’s go,” Xu Yiyi’s master’s voice sounded from within the war chariot.</p>
 <p>Xu Yiyi smiled sweetly at Chu Feng and then flew into the war chariot.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng truly wanted to express his thanks to Xu Yiyi. He had truly never expected that Xu Yiyi would do this sort of thing for him.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, Xu Yiyi left too quickly, and simply did not give him the time to thank her.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Xu Yiyi had already entered the war chariot. With a beaming smile, she said to her master, “Thank you master. I never expected that you would agree to my unreasonable demand.”</p>
 <p>“Unreasonable? Indeed, it is a bit unreasonable.”</p>
 <p>“However, something like this is something that I can settle with a single sentence. Since it is beneficial to you, there is no reason for me to not do it,” Her master said.</p>
 <p>“Master, you are the best to me,” Xu Yiyi smiled very happily. Then, she raised her head and said, “Why didn’t you ask me why I wanted to help that Chu Feng?”</p>
 <p>“What if I did, and what if I didn’t? As long as you’re happy, it doesn’t matter,” Her master said.</p>
 <p>“Master, you are the person who treats me the best in this entire world!!!” Xu Yiyi hugged her master’s arm tightly.</p>
 <p>As for her master, he started to gently caress Xu Yiyi’s long hair with a smile on his face. His gaze was filled with pampering love. It was as if he was a gentle father looking at his daughter.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>The army from Luyang’s Pavilion and the Sunset Cloud Valley withdrew from the Red Butterfly Society’s headquarters.</p>
 <p>However, the people from the Red Butterfly Society were still in a panicky state. They were still unable to calm themselves. It was as if they were unable to believe that the Luyang’s Pavilion army would’ve really left, that they really managed to escape a calamity.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, please accept my respect,” Suddenly, Liu Xiaoli publicly half kneeled and bowed to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Society President, what are you doing?” Chu Feng asked in confusion.</p>
 <p>“If it wasn’t for you, today, our Red Butterfly Society would’ve definitely been extinguished. It was you who saved us,” Liu Xiaoli said.</p>
 <p>“Thank you little friend Chu Feng for saving us,” At that moment, everyone from the Red Butterfly Society half knelt in the sky and bowed to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Society President, Senior Liu, seniors, please get up,” Chu Feng hurriedly helped Liu Xiaoli up.</p>
 <p>After Liu Xiaoli got back up, the elders and elites from the Red Butterfly Society stood up in succession.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you do not have to be embarrassed. We know that if it wasn’t for you, our Red Butterfly Society would have been eliminated today.”</p>
 <p>“Merely, I have one thing that I am very curious about. Do you know who your friend’s master is?” Liu Xiaoli asked. The other elders also raised their ears to wait for Chu Feng’s response.</p>
 <p>They were all able to tell that Xu Yiyi’s master was most definitely an extraordinary character.</p>
