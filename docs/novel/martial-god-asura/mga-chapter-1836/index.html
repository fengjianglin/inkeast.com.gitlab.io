 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1836 - Lovers’ Worry</strong></p>
 <p>Currently, what the people of the Holy Land of Martialism were discussing the most were the grudges and grievances between Chu Feng and the Four Great Imperial Clans. However, as for the Immortal Island, what they were concerned about the most was Baili Xinghe’s death.</p>
 <p>Baili Xinghe had disappeared on the day of the Strongest Younger Generation Battle Assembly and had not shown himself afterward either. While others were not worried about his life and death, his master, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal, was extremely worried.</p>
 <p>Seeing that his disciple still had not returned after a long time had passed, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal personally left for the Gong Ba Plains again. Although Zhang Ming and Zhang Tianyi were no longer present on the Gong Ba Plains and only that fort remained, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal had managed to obtain some clues after making inquiries and investigations.</p>
 <p>Right now, he was certain of one thing. That was that his disciple, Baili Xinghe, was definitely dead.</p>
 <p>As for the culprits who had caused the death of his disciple, they were two people: Chu Feng and Leng Yue.</p>
 <p>…………</p>
 <p>On the Immortal Island. The Weaponry Refinement Immortal was standing before a grave. Four characters were written on the tombstone -- Baili Xinghe. However, this grave was empty.</p>
 <p>“Xinghe, your master has let you down. Even though you met a violent death, I was unable to even preserve your corpse.”</p>
 <p>“But, your master will definitely avenge you. You can rest assured,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal looked to the empty grave. Guilt filled his aged eyes.</p>
 <p>“Senior,” Suddenly, a gentle voice sounded. The Weaponry Refinement turned around to look. There were three beautiful women standing there.</p>
 <p>These three beauties were Chu Feng’s three lovers; Zi Ling, Su Rou and Su Mei.</p>
 <p>Su Rou was sexy. Su Mei was adorable. As for Zi Ling, she was much more attractive than Su Rou and Su Mei in all aspects; being both sexy and adorable. She gave off an extremely distinguished air yet was still very attractive. She was a beauty capable of causing the downfall of a city or state.</p>
 <p>Su Rou and Zi Ling had been on the Immortal Island since long ago. As for Su Mei, she had originally been staying in the World Spiritist Alliance. However, in recent days, she had been personally taught by the Weaponry Refinement Immortal.</p>
 <p>The three sisters were originally supposed to be extremely happy to reunite with one another. However, at this moment, the three of them all had worried expressions on their faces. The three of them already knew that Baili Xinghe had died, and that there were two suspects that could have caused the death of Baili Xinghe. One was Leng Yue, and the other was Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“So you all have come,” Although the Weaponry Refinement Immortal was extremely sentimental, he did not reveal his sadness to the three of them. Instead, he showed the same sort of amiableness when facing them.</p>
 <p>“We wish to burn incense sticks for Senior Brother Baili,” Zi Ling and the others said. [1. Burning incense sticks to the dead is a form of paying respect to the dead.]</p>
 <p>“Mn, go ahead,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal waved his hand.</p>
 <p>After that, Zi Ling, Su Rou and Su Mei all offered incense sticks to Baili Xinghe. Actually, Zi Ling, Su Rou and even Su Mei, who had just arrived here, all deeply loathed Baili Xinghe.</p>
 <p>However, it remained that the Weaponry Refinement Immortal had taught them a lot of things, and spent a great amount of effort to completely remove the backlash which they were suffering from. Thus, taking the Weaponry Refinement Immortal into consideration, they still had to offer incense sticks to Baili Xinghe.</p>
 <p>“Senior, the dead cannot be revived. Please don’t grieve anymore,” After offering their incense sticks, the three girls said together.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, the dead cannot be revived. However, this hatred must be avenged,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“Senior, could it be that you’ve determined who senior brother Baili’s murderer is?” Zi Ling asked in a deeply concerned manner. She was not concerned about Baili Xinghe’s death. Rather, she was extremely concerned about who his murderer was, whether or not his death was related to Chu Feng. She naturally hoped that his death was not related to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>The three of them had lived on the Immortal Island for quite some time now. As such, to a greater or lesser degree, they already knew how powerful the Weaponry Refinement Immortal was. As Chu Feng was currently wanted by the Four Great Imperial Clans, and their master refused to show his face the entire time, if the Weaponry Refinement Immortal were to attack Chu Feng at such a moment, it would be very difficult for Chu Feng to escape death.</p>
 <p>“I’ve ascertained who his murderer is. It was the Heavenly Law Palace’s disciple, Leng Yue,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“Leng Yue?” Hearing those words, Zi Ling, Su Rou and Su Mei all heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>“Senior, Leng Yue is the most highly regarded disciple of the Heavenly Law Palace. If you are to touch her, the Heavenly Law Palace will definitely not let you get away,” Su Rou said.</p>
 <p>“I naturally know that the Heavenly Law Palace is hard to deal with. But, my disciple is also not someone that anyone can kill.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, Xinghe was entrusted to me by my close friend before his death. I was entrusted with taking care of him.”</p>
 <p>“Now that Xinghe has been killed, I have let my close friend down. If I am to do nothing about it, how could I still be considered to be human?” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“You all do not have to concern yourselves with this matter anymore. I am definitely going to avenge Xinghe,” The Weaponry Refinement immortal waved his hand to indicate to Zi Ling and the others that they did not have to urge him against it anymore. Then, he looked to Su Mei and asked, “Lil Mei, are you used to this place yet? How is it compared to the World Spiritist Alliance?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, I’ve grown very used to this place. Senior treats me like his own relative. I also consider senior to be my relative. Furthermore, my sisters are also here. This place feels like home to me. It is much better than the World Spiritist Alliance,” Su Mei said with a beaming smile.</p>
 <p>What she had said was the truth. Even though the Left Reverend and the others were extremely good to her in the World Spiritist Alliance, there were too many people there. As such, there had always been people who were trying to court her favor. She disliked that very much.</p>
 <p>“That’s good. If you like this place, then stay here longer. Your big brother Chu Feng has currently offended the Four Great Imperial Clans. If people were to know that you all are related to him, you all will definitely be implicated. At that time, even the World Spiritist Alliance will not be able to protect you.”</p>
 <p>“As for me, although I have entered seclusion to refine weapons for years, and I have not killed anyone for years, the Four Great Imperial Clans would still have to consider deeply should they wish to intrude upon my Immortal Island,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“Senior is extremely formidable,” Su Mei nodded and smiled sweetly.</p>
 <p>Afterwards, they chatted for a bit longer. Then, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal left.</p>
 <p>When the Weaponry Refinement Immortal left, the smiles on Zi Ling, Su Rou and Su Mei’s faces all disappeared.</p>
 <p>“It would seem that senior has already determined the murderer to be Leng Yue. This matter is unrelated to big brother Chu Feng. Merely… if this matter is related to big brother Chu Feng, I wonder what senior will do,” Zi Ling was still worried.</p>
 <p>“Whenever senior mentions big brother Chu Feng, he reveals an extremely appreciative expression. Furthermore, we can tell from his tone that he is worried about big brother Chu Feng.”</p>
 <p>“It is only because of certain things that he decided to not help big brother Chu Feng. I think… that even if Baili Xinghe’s death is caused by big brother Chu Feng, senior would also not look into it.”</p>
 <p>“After all, I’ve heard from others that Baili Xinghe is a scoundrel. With how wise and sensitive senior is, how could he not know about the character of his disciple?’ Su Mei said.</p>
 <p>“I’m afraid that wouldn’t necessarily be the case. Baili Xinghe was only able to become senior’s disciple because of his ancestor’s relationship with senior. I’ve heard that senior and Baili Xinghe’s ancestor were life and death brothers. Furthermore, his ancestor only died because he was saving senior.”</p>
 <p>“With that special relationship, even if it was big brother Chu Feng that killed Baili Xinghe, senior would likely not spare him either,” Su Rou said.</p>
 <p>“Rather than worrying blindly in here, I really wish to be able to go out and see him. Unfortunately… I am not strong enough. Even if I were to see him, I would only become his burden, and not be able to help him at all,” Thinking of those things, Zi Ling’s eyes grew a bit reddened.</p>
 <p>At this time, Su Rou and Su Mei both revealed expressions of deep worry on their faces. What the three of them were most concerned about was none other than Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>…………</p>
 <p>“Achoo!”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was on the way to the World’s Hidden Valley when he suddenly sneezed a loud sneeze.</p>
 <p>“One sneeze is someone thinking about you, two sneezes is someone cursing you, and three sneezes is talking about you. With such a loud sneeze, little friend Chu Feng, it would seem that someone is thinking about you deeply,” Yaojiao Guang said with a smile.</p>
 <p>[Editor’s note: the sneezing is an old wives’ tale in China and is still commonly referred to.]</p>
 <p>“Never would I have thought that even senior would joke around,” Chu Feng wiped his nose and smiled.</p>
 <p>“Haha, even though we are monstrous beasts, we still possess the seven emotional states and six desires like humans. Naturally, we know how to joke around too. Else, our lives would’ve been very boring.”</p>
 <p>Yaojiao Guang was currently in a very good mood. At this moment, he stopped and pointed to the vast, borderless forest before them, “We’ve arrived at the World’s Hidden Valley.”</p>
