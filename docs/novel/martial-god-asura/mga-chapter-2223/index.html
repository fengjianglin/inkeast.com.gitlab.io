 <p><strong> Chapter 2223 - Gathering Of Experts</strong></p>
 <p>“Jiang Hao, enough of your bad mouthing,” Xu Yiyi was truly unable to endure Jiang Hao anymore. She actually raised her foot and kicked Jiang Hao, trampling him so hard that he tumbled on the ground.</p>
 <p>Seeing this scene, the three women from the Sunset Cloud Valley began to chuckle.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because they knew that Jiang Hao possessed a cultivation above Xu Yiyi’s. If he had wanted to dodge, Xu Yiyi would simply not have been able to kick him.</p>
 <p>However, he did not dare to dodge. In fact, he did not even dare to guard against her kick. That was why such a humiliating scene occurred.</p>
 <p>Indeed, it was humiliating. After all, Jiang Hao had been kicked to the ground in public, which was seen by many people. Thus, at that moment, Jiang Hao had a furious expression. Merely, his anger was not aimed at Xu Yiyi. Rather, it was all aimed at Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“He’s definitely hopeless. Do you all know how many Royal-cloak World Spiritists have come to participate? All of those that were able to obtain invitation title plates possess extraordinary strength.”</p>
 <p>“I dare to guarantee that it is definitely hopeless for Chu Feng,” Jiang Hao said angrily.</p>
 <p>“If you continue on with your bullshit, do you believe that I won’t cut you down?” As Xu Yiyi spoke, she actually took out her Incomplete Ancestral Armament.</p>
 <p>“Junior sister Yiyi, don’t be so impulsive,” Upon seeing that, the three female disciples hurriedly moved to stop Xu Yiyi. They were afraid that Jiang Hao would not dodge Xu Yiyi’s attack. Should that happen, Jiang Hao might end up dying.</p>
 <p>“Yiyi, although what Jiang Hao said is somewhat excessive, it is not without justification. If it is true that only four people will be allowed to enter the spirit formation, then not to mention Chu Feng, even Elder Ning Shuang and Li Rui will have practically no hope.”</p>
 <p>“After all, practically all of the most famous Royal-cloak World Spiritists in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm have gathered here. They all possess extremely powerful world spirit techniques,” One of the three elders said.</p>
 <p>“That’s true. I even saw the Four World Spiritist Emperors earlier. Furthermore, I’ve heard that the world spiritist experts from the Zhou Heavenly Clan, Kong Heavenly Clan, Immortal Sword School and Buddha’s Heavenly Temple have all arrived. Especially the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple, I’ve heard their world spiritists are extremely powerful.”</p>
 <p>“No, no, no, in terms of being most powerful, it would definitely be the Four World Spiritist Emperors. After all, the four of them have dedicated their entire lives to world spirit formations.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, the people from the Sunset Cloud Valley began to spiritedly discuss the people that had arrived.</p>
 <p>As for Xu Yiyi, she grew quiet. The reason for that was because she had heard about all those people that they were talking about. They were indeed people that possessed extremely high academic attainments in world spirit techniques.</p>
 <p>Thus, she could only quietly look to the entrance of Mount Cloud Crane. Then, with a low voice, she muttered, “It’s this difficult. Wouldn’t this mean that Chu Feng and the others have entered in vain?”</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng and the others were proceeding toward Mount Cloud Crane’s summit.</p>
 <p>The journey toward the summit was not easy at all. If one wanted to arrive there safely, one must pass through many layers of difficulties.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, Li Rui, Liu Xiaoli and Elder Ning Shuang were following Chu Feng the entire time. Else, with their world spirit techniques, they would most definitely not have been able to continue onward so smoothly.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, may I know who your master might be?” Elder Ning Shuang asked curiously. He discovered that even though they were both Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists, Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques greatly surpassed his own. It could be said that there was an enormous difference in mastery between Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques and theirs.</p>
 <p>Thus, he truly wanted to know exactly who it was that had managed to nurture such a powerful world spiritist genius like Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“I have two masters. One is called Zhuge Liuyun, and the other is called Qiu Canfeng,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Zhuge Liuyun, Qiu Canfeng?” Both Elder Ning Shuang and Li Rui were startled upon hearing those names. The reason for that was because they’d never heard of them before.</p>
 <p>Although they had never heard of them before, the two of them unanimously came to the conclusion that Zhuge Liuyun and Qiu Canfeng must be the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm’s hidden experts, or even experts from the Upper Realm.</p>
 <p>However, only Chu Feng knew that his two masters were respectively in the Nine Provinces Continent’s Azure Dragon School and the Eastern Sea Region’s Crippling Night Demon Sect.</p>
 <p>If one were to determine one’s strength with cultivation, then his two masters would definitely be laughingstocks in the eyes of countless people should they be placed in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p>
 <p>However, his two masters possessed incomparably high status in Chu Feng’s heart. This was especially true for Zhuge Liuyun, because he could be considered to be the person who had guided Chu Feng onto the path of a world spiritist.</p>
 <p>Regardless of how powerful Chu Feng might end up becoming, the two of them would forever be his greatly respected masters.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chu Feng said, “There seems to be problems ahead.”</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because there was a layer of purple fog ahead. Many people were gathered in the fog.</p>
 <p>To be exact, all of those people were being blocked by the purple fog.</p>
 <p>Although no one could tell what was inside the purple fog, Chu Feng was able to guess that it must be a spirit formation.</p>
 <p>“Elder Ning Shuang, look, it’s the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple’s Grandmaster Pocket, and the Immortal Sword School’s Daoist Three Swords.” [1. Koudai means pocket. Not sure if it’s a name or a title. Felt it is more likely a title though.]</p>
 <p>“The Four World Spiritist Emperors. Even the Four World Spiritist Emperors are here,” Li Rui revealed an astonished expression. It was as if he had just seen his idols.</p>
 <p>Turning his gaze toward the direction of Li Rui’s gaze, Chu Feng saw a monk wearing a world spiritist cloak and a white-haired old man.</p>
 <p>The world spiritist cloak that monk was wearing was somewhat special; it was actually covered with pockets. Likely, he must be that Grandmaster Pocket.</p>
 <p>As for that white-haired old man, although his hair was as white as snow, his skin was smooth like jade and tender like a baby’s skin.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, he carried three long swords on his back. Those three swords were all different from one another. However, they were all Incomplete Ancestral Armaments. Likely… he was that Daoist Three Swords.</p>
 <p>These two individuals were both very strong. Chu Feng was unable to see through their cultivations. Thus, Chu Feng felt that they were very likely to be peak Martial Ancestor-level experts.</p>
 <p>However, the ones that gave Chu Feng the greatest impression were those so-called Four World Spiritist Emperors.</p>
 <p>They were four fatties. Each of them were two meters tall. However, they were also two meters wide. They were truly fat, so fat that they resembled balls, four giant balls.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, other than all of them being fat, the four of them also possessed the same appearance.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Chu Feng felt that their same appearances were not obtained from the alteration of their appearances. Rather, they were born this way.</p>
 <p>In other words, they were quadruplets.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng truly wondered to himself what sort of mother would be able to give birth to four brothers like them? How enormous must her stomach have been to contain all of them?</p>
 <p>“With only four people being allowed in the spirit formation, it would appear that it is practically hopeless for us,” Upon seeing so many world spiritist experts, Liu Xiaoli revealed a worried expression.</p>
 <p>“Who are those people?” Chu Feng asked curiously.</p>
 <p>“Brother Chu Feng, you don’t know them?” Li Rui asked in astonishment.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng shook his head.</p>
 <p>“Then, I’ll skip the others and tell you about the Buddha’s Heavenly Temple’s Grandmaster Pocket and the Immortal Sword School’s Daoist Three Swords.”</p>
 <p>“When they were young, the two of them were both world spiritist geniuses whose names were renowned throughout the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. I’ll say it this way, even without this assembly, the two of them will sooner or later become Immortal-cloak World Spiritists by relying on themselves. This is something that everyone firmly believes will happen.”</p>
 <p>“Merely, the two of them are more infatuated with martial cultivation. That is why they ended up delaying their world spirit talents. That is also the reason why the two of them possess extremely strong cultivations.”</p>
 <p>“If their world spirit techniques cannot be said to be among the peak in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, their martial cultivations would definitely place them among the peak experts in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.”</p>
 <p>“As for the Four World Spiritist Emperors, they are even more exceptional. Their mother is one of the few Immortal-cloak World Spiritists in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, the four of them also possess extremely powerful world spirit techniques. Reportedly, the four of them have competed against an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist with world spirit techniques, and managed to defeat that Immortal-cloak World Spiritist even though they were only Royal-cloak World Spiritists.”</p>
 <p>“Although their victory must also be attributed to their mother using her treasures to assist them, it remains that it should be impossible for Royal-cloak World Spiritists to defeat an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, treasures or not.”</p>
 <p>“However, the four of them accomplished it. From this, it could be seen how powerful their world spirit techniques were. If it were only comparing one’s attainments in world spirit techniques, the four of them would likely be even more powerful than Grandmaster Pocket and Daoist Three Swords. The four of them are true world spiritist geniuses,” Li Rui said.</p>
 <p>“Hearing what you said, it seems like they are truly amazing. However, it seems that they have all been stopped by that thing,” Chu Feng pointed to the purple fog ahead.</p>
 <p>It was as he had said; there were over two hundred world spiritists gathered here right now. Furthermore, their numbers were increasing nonstop. The reason why they had all stopped here was because they were unable to pass through the purple fog.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a man from the Zhou Heavenly Clan shouted, “I refuse to believe that I will be blocked by a mere spirit formation after training for so long!” Following that, he unleashed his boundless aura.</p>
 <p>Rank one Martial Ancestor. He was a rank one Martial Ancestor-level expert.</p>
 <p>“Zzzzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, multicolored lightning began to flicker as Thunder Armor appeared on his body, and Thunder Wings extended from his back.</p>
 <p>At that moment, his cultivation was no longer that of a rank one Martial Ancestor. Instead, it had increased to that of a rank three Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, he possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation, an entire level above Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Thus, at that moment, his true battle power was actually on par with ordinary rank seven Martial Ancestors. His strength could be said to be extremely powerful.</p>
 <p>After all, even when placed in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm, rank seven Martial Ancestors were extremely powerful individuals.</p>
