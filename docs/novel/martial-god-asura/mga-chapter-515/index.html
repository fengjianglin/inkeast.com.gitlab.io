 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 515 - Panic and a Cold Smile</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph. Brat, don’t even think of being arrogant. Even if they don’t help out, I can still easily kill you and avenge my son.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The old ancestor of the Zhao Dynasty flipped his palm. A silver-coloured pike then appeared within his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pike was covered with symbols. As the symbols and radiance swirled, they emitted a unique powerful aura. It was a Mastered Elite Armament.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quickly after, the Zhao Dynasty’s old ancestor waved both of his arms. The tip of the pike trembled, then tens of thousands of pike tips shot out. Like a pointed white-coloured storm, they densely flew towards Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The stronger one was, the greater they could show the might of the Elite Armament, and in the hands of the Zhao Dynasty’s old ancestor, the expert in the 9th level of the Heaven realm, the Elite Armament could be said to have shown its strongest power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, when the tens of thousands of pike tips appeared, the sky and earth trembled, the weather changed, and the might shown was extremely frightening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, almost everyone in the Jiang Dynasty broke out in a cold sweat for Chu Feng because the attacks of the Zhao Dynasty’s old ancestor were indeed very terrifying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Chu Feng did not evade nor dodge. He clenched to form a fist, then the Asura Ghost Axe was grasped within his hand. Afterwards, he waved his arm, and countless black-coloured blades of light surged out from his axe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the black-coloured blades of light interweaved with the tens of thousands of pike tips, instantly, explosions burst out, ripples spread endlessly, and even the remnants themselves caused several people to die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*boom* But suddenly, within the ripples, there were actually more pike tips shooting out and flying towards Chu Feng. The attacks that the Zhao Dynasty’s old ancestor made actually broke through Chu Feng’s black-coloured blade of light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*whoosh* In a situation like that, Chu Feng also lightly furrowed his brows. He hurriedly used the Dragon Travelling Through Nine Heavens and became a blur of light. He flew towards the distance and avoided the attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed, although this brat’s battle power is extremely powerful, after all, his aura is unstable and his cultivation is one level weaker. He will definitely not beat that old Zhao guy.” Seeing that scene, the corners of the Liu Dynasty’s old ancestor’s mouth rose to form a hint of a relieved smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he did not interfere, in reality, he was hoping that the Zhao Dynasty’s old ancestor would win because right now, he, the Liu Dynasty, and the Ji Dynasty, were being threatened by the Jiang Dynasty, so they were unable to attack them. The ones able to attack the Jiang Dynasty was only the Zhao Dynasty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as the Zhao Dynasty’s old ancestor could defeat Chu Feng, within the Jiang Dynasty, there would be no one who could hold the Zhao Dynasty back. Even if the two of them didn’t do anything, the Zhao Dynasty itself could easily eradicate the Jiang Dynasty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Arrogant brat, let me see where you are escaping to!” Seeing his attacks were pressuring Chu Feng, the Zhao Dynasty’s old ancestor even became conceited. The silver-coloured pike in his hand endlessly waved, madly stabbing towards Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it was useless as he underestimated Chu Feng’s speed. The speed of Chu Feng’s Dragon Travelling Through Nine Heavens climbed by many times along with the great rise of his cultivation. In a situation like that, no matter how much stronger the Elite Armament of the Zhao Dynasty’s old ancestor was, he was unable to harm Chu Feng in the slightest, and the attacks were all evaded by Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damned brat, are you the reincarnation of a monkey? Do you only know how to run everywhere?” After the old ancestor’s attacks were dodged several times, his eyes could spit fire from being furious as he gnashed his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old bastard, your abilities are inferior so you start insulting people? You have truly wasted so many years of living and you lack any good qualities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This young master here has quick speed, but what can you do about it? If you can do something about it, go ahead; if you can’t, then just accept it. Just from running, I can run you to death!” Chu Feng didn’t feel shame from escaping. Rather, he mocked the inferior speed of the Zhao Dynasty’s old ancestor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ignorant brat, don’t even think of being arrogant! Do you truly think only you have bodily martial skills?” The Zhao Dynasty’s old ancestor coldly snorted, then stepped on air, and while holding the silver-coloured pike, he became a blur of light and rushed towards Chu Feng. His speed was actually a lot quicker than Chu Feng’s Dragon Travelling Through Nine Heavens.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is bad! After all, he is truly in the 9th level of the Heaven realm, a character who infinitely nears the Martial Lord realm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“With Chu Feng’s currently unstable cultivation of the 8th level of the Heaven realm, I’m afraid he will not be able to defeat the old ancestor.” Seeing the Zhao Dynasty’s old ancestor who was speedily chasing and approaching Chu Feng bit by bit, Jiang Yini and the others all tightly knitted their brows, breaking out in cold sweat for Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All of you don’t understand my Junior Chu Feng.” But just at that time, Zhang Tianyi who had appeared along with Chu Feng smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wha-what do you mean by that?” After hearing Zhang Tianyi’s words, they revealed puzzled expressions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just look. Although this person has very powerful strength, when he is against my Junior Chu Feng, he will definitely be defeated.” On the corners of Zhang Tianyi’s mouth, he still wore the light smile that was filled with confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And after hearing his words, although Jiang Yini and the others still had their doubts, it had to be said that their tense hearts did indeed calm down quite a bit. They didn’t say anything more and continued casting their gazes towards the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just at that moment, the Zhao Dynasty’s old ancestor was less than a hundred meters away from Chu Feng. Furthermore, the pike in his hand quivered once again, and like storms and pear blossoms falling from trees, they shot out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crap.” Seeing that, Chu Feng’s face changed greatly as he revealed an unsettled expression. Because, at such a distance, he was already unable to dodge the attack of the Zhao Dynasty’s old ancestor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll kill you!” In a situation like that, Chu Feng furiously howled and endlessly waved the Asura Ghost Axe in his hand. He actually rushed towards the old ancestor, akin to a fish doing whatever it took to break the net surrounding it, and appearing as if he wanted to die with the old ancestor by dragging him down with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ignorant brat. If you want to bet your life, you must also have the strength to do so.” However, seeing the many black-coloured blades of light flying from the Asura Ghost Axe, the smile on the face of the Zhao Dynasty’s old ancestor became wider and wider because there was simply no way of fighting against his pike tips by only relying on attacks such as the black-coloured blades of light. Chu Feng’s current action was simply suicidal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he didn’t notice that despite having a panicking expression on his face, the corners of Chu Feng’s mouth formed a hint of an unperceivable cold smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the pike tips were going to break through Chu Feng’s black-coloured blades of light, he suddenly put away the Asura Ghost Axe that was in his hand, then, opened his palm, and suddenly pushed forward, towards the Zhao Dynasty’s old ancestor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“White Tiger Slaughtering Technique.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>*wuaooooo~~~~~~~~~~~~*</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cry of a tiger resounded as white-coloured gas explosively shot out from Chu Feng’s palm. The white-coloured gas kept on changing, and at the end, it transformed into a huge striped white tiger’s claw. That move was precisely Chu Feng’s offensive Secret Skill, the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The White Tiger Slaughtering Technique was peerless in offensive power. Especially as Chu Feng’s cultivation grew, its power rose accordingly as well. In front of it, the pike tips that the Elite Armament gave off was actually extremely feeble. Before it even neared, it was forcefully fragmented.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crap. This might… Is it possible that it’s a Secret Skill from the legends?!” At that instant, the face of the Zhao Dynasty’s old ancestor changed greatly. The calm expression he had before could no longer be seen, and he turned around with his feet and wanted to escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because, within the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique, he was able to feel extremely horrifying power. So horrifying that even he didn’t dare to block it head-on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But presently, it was too late. At that moment, the distance between him and Chu Feng was only dozens of meters. As the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique’s shape was already formed, it was impossible for him to dodge at such a distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*boom*</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, just as the Zhao Dynasty’s old ancestor turned around, the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique already flew over, and it ferociously collided into his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>*poof*</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, the Zhao Dynasty’s old ancestor immediately cried out in pain. He opened his mouth, and fresh-red blood shot out his mouth like a pillar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, crackling sounds came from various places on his body. The bones and organs in his entire body at many places were forcibly shattered from the shock.</span></p>
