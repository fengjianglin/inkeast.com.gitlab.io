 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1543 - Came Together, Leave Together</strong></p>
 <p>“What’s going on? To be able to create such devastating destruction, exactly who is it that’s fighting?” Inside the forbidden area, the Cursed Soil Seven’s seventh brother spoke with a tone of unease.</p>
 <p>“You all… you all actually invited a Martial Emperor.” Suddenly, the expression on the Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster changed. His extremely complacent expression became one of incomparable terror.</p>
 <p>He finally realized how serious of a situation he was in. It turned out that not only did he possess backup, Dugu Xingfeng and those with him also possessed backup.</p>
 <p>Upon thinking about how the Fiend Emperor was being hindered by that Martial Emperor, his heart immediately sunk to the valley floor. That was because they were no match for Dugu Xingfeng. If the Fiend Emperor was unable to quickly arrive to save them, the only thing awaiting them would be death.</p>
 <p>“Since you’ve discovered it, I can only send you on your journey now. Remember, in your next life, make sure to be a good person,” Dugu Xingfeng did not answer him. Instead, he smiled a smile with a very strong killing intent.</p>
 <p>“Kill them!” Dugu Xingfeng shouted. Following that, an Incomplete Imperial Armament appeared in his hand. Although the Incomplete Imperial Armament was a copy, its might greatly surpassed that of Royal Armaments. Especially when being used by Dugu Xingfeng, the might of that Incomplete Imperial Armament had increased by an enormous amount.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, it’s time to end this,” Following that, Miao Renlong, Hong Qiang and the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master also took out their respective weapons. They were no longer planning to hold back anymore. Instead, they were going all out so that they could eliminate the Cursed Soil Seven as quickly as possible.</p>
 <p>That was because they all knew very well that even with the Yan Clan’s Ancestor stopping the Fiend Emperor for them, they still had to leave this place as quickly as possible. Otherwise, if they were to alarm those old monsters of the Cursed Soil Sacred Assembly, the situation would be extremely bad.</p>
 <p>“Dugu Xingfeng, you dare to kill us? Are you planning to incite a war between our Cursed Soil Sect and your Cyanwood Mountain?”</p>
 <p>“I shall tell you all this. Our Cursed Soil Sect does not fear your Cyanwood Mountain. If our powers are to go to war, your Cyanwood Mountain will have to bear the consequences.”</p>
 <p>“However, you can still stop your actions now. I can pretend that nothing has happened and will allow you all to leave.”</p>
 <p>The Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster and his six fellow martial brothers were putting forth all of their strength to block the fatal attacks coming their way from Dugu Xingfeng and the others. At the same time that they blocked the incoming attacks, the Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster tried to alleviate the situation so that they could live.</p>
 <p>“That talisman clone of yours, at the very most it’ll be able to signal for help and give your whereabouts. It is definitely impossible for it to be able to tell others what you have seen and heard. Did you really think that we are fools who do not even know about that?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t forget, I am the Alliance Master of the World Spiritist Alliance. Regarding things like that, I understand a lot more than you,” The World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master sneered.</p>
 <p>“Sang Kun, you should give up on trying to con us. Not to mention that your Cursed Soil Sect does not possess the courage to wage war against us, even if it does, do you really think that we will be afraid of you? If your Cursed Soil Sect dares to wage war against us, it will not only be against our Cyanwood Mountain. Instead, it will be against both our Cyanwood Mountain and the World Spiritist Alliance. At that time, the only end waiting for your Cursed Soil Sect would be utter extermination.”</p>
 <p>“Moreover, even if you really managed to inform others that it was us who did this, if you cannot capture us and do not have proof, how would your Cursed Soil Sect dare to wage war against us? If you dare, with the connections that our Cyanwood Mountain possesses, we will definitely not fear your Cursed Soil Sect.”</p>
 <p>Dugu Xingfeng was not at all threatened. It was not that he did not fear that the Cursed Soil Sect would wage war against their Cyanwood Mountain. Rather, it was that he firmly believe that the Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster had not managed to inform the Fiend Emperor of their identities. As long as the Fiend Emperor did not know who they were, they would have no fear in killing the Cursed Soil Seven.</p>
 <p>As for what he must do now, it was to precisely attack the Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster’s confidence and force him into a corner.</p>
 <p>“You…” After hearing what Dugu Xingfeng said, the Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster’s expression took a huge change. He was so enraged that his body grew stiff. He realized that Dugu Xingfeng was determined to kill him regardless of what sort of price it might end up costing him. Likely, he would end up dying here today.</p>
 <p>“Puu~~~”</p>
 <p>At the moment the Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster was distracted by Dugu Xingfeng’s determination to kill him, Dugu Xingfeng’s Incomplete Imperial Armament pierced into his dantian.</p>
 <p>Then, Dugu Xingfeng’s wrist trembled and a stream of berserk energy entered into the Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster’s body. “Bang!” The Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster exploded, and his blood splattered all over his six fellow martial brothers.</p>
 <p>“Dugu Xingfeng, you shall die miserably!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Sang Kun had been killed, Sang Kun’s six fellow martial brothers were all incomparably enraged. With an attitude of not fearing death, and a desire for mutual destruction, they charged toward Dugu Xingfeng.</p>
 <p>“The ones who are going to die are you all,” Dugu Xingfeng’s expression grew even colder. He slashed his Incomplete Royal Armament in the air. “Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~” Six rays were shot out in a flash. The remaining six of the Cursed Soil Seven were all sliced in half by those rays. Both their bodies and consciousnesses had been exterminated. They had all been killed.</p>
 <p>The only reason why the Cursed Soil Seven had been able to contend against Dugu Xingfeng was because of their Cursed Soil Seven Slaughtering Formation. As for their Cursed Soil Seven Slaughtering Formation, it would not be able to unleash its real power the moment they lacked a single person.</p>
 <p>Thus, after the Cursed Soil Sect’s headmaster was killed, the remaining six would not be able to contend against Dugu Xingfeng. With merely a single strike, Dugu Xingfeng had killed all of them.</p>
 <p>Seeing this scene, not to mention Chu Feng and Tantai Xue who were watching from the side, even Hong Qiang, Miao Renlong and the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master displayed stunned expressions.</p>
 <p>They were clearly all of the same level of cultivation. Yet, Dugu Xingfeng possessed the strength to utterly crush others of the same cultivation. Truly, Dugu Xingfeng’s reputation as the strongest headmaster was fully well-deserved.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Dugu Xingfeng extended his hand and made a grabbing motion. The treasures and weapons, as well as the Cosmos Sacks from the Cursed Soil Seven, all entered his hand. Then he opened his palm, and a burst of martial power surged forth. That martial power completely shattered the corpses of the Cursed Soil Seven, leaving not a single trace behind.</p>
 <p>“Take them,” At this time, the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master took out several medicinal pellets and handed them to everyone.</p>
 <p>After Chu Feng and the others took the medicinal pellets, their appearances began to change. They had come in disguise. Naturally, they would have to leave in disguise too.</p>
 <p>After all of their appearances changed, they set up a spirit formation and turned it into the appearance of the prison cell. They made it so that it seemed as if nothing had happened in this battlefield. Only then did they proceed to leave.</p>
 <p>When Chu Feng and the others left the forbidden area, they discovered that the entire Cursed Soil Sect was a mess. Countless people were running for their lives and shouting in fear. In the distance were thick clouds, and in the sky was an extremely frightening and surging pressure that sealed the entire sky.</p>
 <p>It was the Yan Clan’s Ancestor and the Fiend Emperor. Although their battle had yet to be able to determine a victor, they had caused enormous damage to the Cursed Soil Sect. Not only had they destroyed many buildings, they had also killed a lot of the Cursed Soil Sect’s disciples and elders.</p>
 <p>At this moment, all of the disciples and elders were fleeing from the range of their battle in fear of being impacted by it. That was because, if they were to be impacted, regardless of what level of cultivation they might have, so long as they were underneath Martial Emperor, they would definitely be killed.</p>
 <p>“Martial Emperors are truly frightening indeed,” Seeing the distant battlefield, with the earth covered with craters and drenched with blood, even Chu Feng’s heart trembled. Those were all formed by the aftermath of the attacks of the two Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>When merely the aftermath had caused this sort of destruction, how much more frightening would it be if they really planned to massacre the people? Perhaps even the Cursed Soil Sect, the seemingly boundless grand power with a territory that stretched for tens of thousands of miles, would be destroyed in an instant.</p>
 <p>“Chuy Feng, you all leave first. I’ll go and support senior Yan,” Dugu Xingfeng said via voice transmission.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng refused. “No, we came together, thus we must leave together.”</p>
 <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
 <p>Ehh… might as well translate this I guess…</p>
 <p>Ps; Wish everyone a happy new year. Thank you all for accompanying Martial God Asura as we head for 2015 from 2014. In the past year, Martial God Asura has had a very dazzling performance. It could be said that it has been an uphill journey the entire time, and has managed to reach the top of the charts many times.</p>
 <p>The brothers of the Asura Palace Hall have been constantly increasing in size. A lot of new readers have joined us. Right now, we are extremely large.</p>
 <p>Thus, I firmly believe that in the upcoming year, Martial God Asura’s performance will be even greater and attract even more attention. The banner of our Asura Palace Hall will be inserted in many more locations. Everyone, let us all strive for even more glorious sections for Martial God Asura.</p>
 <p>Other than that, the new month has begun. For the final result of last month’s monthly ticket chat, with everyone’s support, we managed to reach seventh place. According to the promise, Bee should release 8 chapters today.</p>
 <p>As Bee did not manage to release 3 chapters yesterday, the missing chapter should have been released today. Thus, there should be 9 chapters released today.</p>
 <p>Truth be told, Bee’s current state is not very good. I have very bad headaches. It is not only my head, the right side my face is also hurting. The medicine that the doctor prescribed me did not work. I had been dealing with the pain using analgesic the entire time. However, it’s still very painful.</p>
 <p>Thus, as of right now, I have not finished a single chapter. I cannot guarantee that I will be able to release 9 chapters today. However, everyone, please rest assured. Even if I cannot release 9 chapters today, I will make up what I missed within this week.</p>
 <p>However, no matter what, I will still place 9 chapters as my goal and work hard toward it. It’s quite late now. Everyone, you should all go rest. After I wake up, I hope that my status will be a bit better. Good night.</p>
