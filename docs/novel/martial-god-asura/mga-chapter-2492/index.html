 <p><strong> Chapter 2492 - Fair Match</strong></p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, are you willing?” The Golden Crane True Immortal asked.</p>
 <p>“This junior is willing,” Chu Feng answered decisively without the slightest hesitation.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng freely admitted that Young Master Li Ming was very strong. He could be said to be the strongest person of the younger generation Chu Feng had met so far.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng would not cower when facing him.</p>
 <p>While Chu Feng had indeed been defeated by Young Master Li Ming earlier, Chu Feng also felt that he was defeated because of his carelessness.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng felt that if he were to fight him again without holding anything back, the outcome of the battle would not be determined.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, Chu Feng had no choice. This seemed to be the only path that he could take to save Wang Qiang.</p>
 <p>“Very well, you have courage and insight, and are frank and straightforward enough.”</p>
 <p>“Although Li Ming is stronger than you, you can rest assured, for I will provide the two of you with a platform for a fair match,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“What does this old fart mean by that? Why is he saying that Young Master Li Ming is stronger than you?” Hearing those words, Her Lady Queen revealed a displeased expression. She felt that the Golden Crane True Immortal was looking down on Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, a flash of light suddenly streaked past Chu Feng. The next moment, a figure appeared beside him.</p>
 <p>It was none other than Young Master Li Ming.</p>
 <p>Young Master Li Ming noticed Chu Feng. However, his expression did not change. It was as if he was seeing a stranger. From beginning to the end, he showed a proud and arrogant expression.</p>
 <p>“You need me for something?” Young Master Li Ming looked in the Golden Crane True Immortal’s direction.</p>
 <p>Even though he was facing the Golden Crane True Immortal, there was no trace of respect in his tone.</p>
 <p>“This brat is truly arrogant. If I were that Golden Crane True Immortal, I would definitely not be able to tolerate him,” Her Lady Queen curled her lips.</p>
 <p>However, the Golden Crane True Immortal was exceptionally calm. He asked indifferently, “Have you finished considering what I mentioned to you earlier?”</p>
 <p>“I have called for you in Mount Cloud Crane for three entire days. Did you not hear me?” Young Master Li Ming spoke in a very displeased manner. His tone was that of someone who did not place the Golden Crane True Immortal in his eyes at all.</p>
 <p>“Heh…” Faced with Young Master Li Ming’s attitude, the Golden Crane True Immortal was actually not angry. On the contrary, he chuckled and said, “I have indeed heard you. Merely, those three days have already passed. As such, how would I know if your decision today will remain the same as those three days?”</p>
 <p>“You know the result now. Can I be let out now?” Young Master Li Ming asked.</p>
 <p>“I’m afraid not. You have a competitor now,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“You’re talking about him?” Young Master Li Ming looked to Chu Feng. He was a bit surprised. However, his surprise soon turned to contempt. He looked to the Golden Crane True Immortal again and said arrogantly, “No wonder you ignored me before. So you were waiting for him.”</p>
 <p>“Are you still willing to continue now?” The Golden Crane True Immortal asked.</p>
 <p>“How do you want us to compete?” Young Master Li Ming asked.</p>
 <p>“The two of you are to confront one another. The victor shall obtain the opportunity,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“If that’s the case, there is no need to compete. I have already confronted him earlier. He is absolutely no match for me,” Young Master Li Ming said.</p>
 <p>“This brat is truly arrogant. Chu Feng, beat him up! You must teach him a lesson!” Her Lady Queen spoke in a very displeased manner.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng had a very calm expression. He kept silent, and looked on with a smile on his face.</p>
 <p>“I am the one who gets to decide the outcome of this match. The victor and loser is yet to be determined,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“Even if we are to compete in world spirit techniques, he will not be able to defeat me,” After Young Master Li Ming finished saying those words, a layer of spirit power began to hover around him.</p>
 <p>Not only was that spirit power Immortal-cloak spirit power, it was also Snake Mark.</p>
 <p>“Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist?” Chu Feng was rather surprised. He had only experienced how amazing Young Master Li Ming was in terms of martial cultivation before. He had truly never expect for his world spirit techniques to also be quite strong.</p>
 <p>“As I’ve said, this match is up to me to decide,” After the Golden Crane True Immortal finished saying those words, a body of light suddenly flew over. That body of light began to rapidly grow larger.</p>
 <p>In a blink of an eye, it turned into an enormous crystal-like cage that surrounded Chu Feng and Young Master Li Ming.</p>
 <p>“This feeling?” Chu Feng’s heart tightened.</p>
 <p>After being enveloped by that body of light, he discovered that all of his power was restricted.</p>
 <p>Both his martial cultivation and world spirit techniques were restricted.</p>
 <p>Standing here, Chu Feng felt as if he were an ordinary commoner without any special ability at all.</p>
 <p>“Seems like I’m not the only one restricted,” Chu Feng noticed that Young Master Li Ming’s expression had also changed. He too revealed a surprised gaze.</p>
 <p>“What is this?” Young Master Li Ming said to the Golden Crane True Immortal.</p>
 <p>“Since it’s a match, it must naturally be fair,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“You’ve sealed both of our powers. Could it be that you want us to determine a victor by punching and kicking like ordinary people?” Young Master Li Ming asked.</p>
 <p>“Naturally not. If that were the case, it would be too senseless,” The Golden Crane True Immortal smiled profoundly.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>The next moment, Chu Feng suddenly discovered that a pillar of light had appeared behind him.</p>
 <p>This pillar was golden in color. It seemed to be made of crystal. It was a meter tall, and emitted an unusual sort of power.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, an identical pillar of light had also appeared behind Young Master Li Ming.</p>
 <p>“I have restricted both of your powers. Right now, you two are like two pieces of blank paper. The two of you now possess the same starting point.”</p>
 <p>“However, those two pillars will change the situation. Your superiority over one another might change because of that,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“Exactly what are you planning?” Young Master Li Ming spoke in an annoyed manner.</p>
 <p>“I will explain the rules. The pillars behind you two are respectively what you must protect.”</p>
 <p>“If the pillar behind you is to be touched by your opponent, it will be your opponent’s victory.”</p>
 <p>“The pillars behind the two of you contain a certain amount of energy. By placing your hand on the pillar behind you, you will be able to absorb its energy.”</p>
 <p>“The more energy you absorb from your pillar, the smaller your pillar will become. In turn, it will be more difficult for your opponent to touch your pillar.”</p>
 <p>“Of course, the amount of power you will obtain and the size your pillar will shrink to will all depend on yourself,” The Golden Crane True Immortal said.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Right after the Golden Crane True Immortal finished explaining, that Young Master Li Ming immediately leapt into the air. With a beautiful flip, he landed beside the pillar that he had to protect.</p>
 <p>While his cultivation had been restricted, and he was left in a same state as ordinary people, his movement and agility were not something that ordinary people could compare with. This was the foundation of an expert. Even if they were to have their cultivation seized, they would still possess strength surpassing that of ordinary individuals.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Young Master Li Ming placed his hand onto the pillar. The next moment, that radiance from the pillar began to assimilate into Young Master Li Ming’s body.</p>
 <p>It was as if Young Master Li Ming was depriving the pillar of its radiance. As the pillar grew dimmer, Young Master Li Ming started to shine.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, that pillar actually really began to shrink. In the blink of an eye, it shrunk from a meter to a foot. Furthermore, it was still shrinking.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Chu Feng was able to sense that Young Master Li Ming’s aura was growing extraordinary too. He had obtained power from that pillar.</p>
 <p>…...</p>
 <p>At the same time as all this was happening, there was a golden crane in a place where Chu Feng and Young Master Li Ming could not see. That golden crane was currently observing everything.</p>
 <p>Naturally, that golden crane was the Golden Crane True Immortal. At that moment, the Golden Crane True Immortal revealed an expression of surprise and joy.</p>
 <p>“This brat truly does have some skills. It is no wonder you thought that highly of him.”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a voice sounded. That voice was something that only the Golden Crane True Immortal could hear.</p>
 <p>At the same time as that voice sounded, a figure also emerged. As for that individual… he was that plain-clothed old monk.</p>
