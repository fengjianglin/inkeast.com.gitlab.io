 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 879 - Unfinished</strong></p>
 <p><span style>When the destructive slash exploded, it was as if there were nothing that could stop its destruction. Blood-red energy ripples spread out everywhere, as though it were a huge pool of blood, and also as if it were a bloody mouth. Amidst the ear-piercing howls, it engulfed everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That sea region had become hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*gulp*</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was not a single person who </span><i><span style>wasn’t</span></i><span style> shocked upon seeing the strange and horrifying blood-red ripples. Xia Yu, Dong Xue, and the others even paled from fright, and couldn’t help gulping.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had never seen such a horrifying martial skill. No matter the atmosphere it exuded, or its power, both aspects were horrifying. If they hadn’t personally seen it, they definitely wouldn’t believe such a slash was cast by Chu Feng, a Martial Lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In reality, not only them, even Qiushui Fuyan, who was quite experienced, couldn’t help deeply gasping. She said with an extremely astonished tone, “He’s actually succeeded. In two short months, he cultivated a legendary Earthen Taboo martial skill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Qiushui, you’re saying Chu Feng used an Earthen Taboo martial skill just now?” Xia Yu and Dong Xue both widened their mouths in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was actually a Mortal Taboo martial skill free to cultivate on the Misty Peak, but since it was too difficult, even they weren’t successful in their attempts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for an Earthen Taboo martial skill, that was a martial skill from the legends. It was said its cultivation difficulty was a dozen times a Mortal Taboo martial skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They couldn’t even control a Mortal Taboo martial skill, yet Chu Feng grasped an Earthen Taboo martial skill. How could they </span><i><span style>not</span></i><span style> be shocked?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have either of you seen a martial skill with such power?” Qiushui Fuyan did not give them a direct reply, but her question had indirectly told them the answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you two deaf? Didn’t you hear what my Junior Chu Feng said just now? Before using that slash, he clearly yelled ‘Firmament Slash’. Is there any room for doubt?” Zhang Tianyi coldly mocked. He was already quite displeased with Xia Yu and Dong Xue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, the two of them were speechless. With everything that had happened, they had no choice but to admit Chu Feng had grasped an Earthen Taboo martial skill within a short two months.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that fact was too astounding. If it were known, it would definitely create quite a commotion amongst the population once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*aooo—*</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just at that moment, within the berserk blood-red ripples, another furious roar rang out. Although that voice was quite a bit weaker, it was undoubtedly from the huge tortoise—it hadn’t died yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*hmm*</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, as the blood-red ripples gradually dissipated, they were able to see the huge tortoise slowly appearing within their sights. The enormous monster truly hadn’t died yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although it hadn’t died, on its indestructible shell, there were several cracks that appeared. From those cracks, large amounts of blood kept on flowing out, dying the sea water red. Even though the huge tortoise hadn’t died yet, it was still heavily injured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah!” Suddenly, Chu Feng, in the sky, coughed out a mouthful of blood. Then, his body started swaying and he nearly fell down from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng!” Qiushui Fuyan was the first to react. She leapt forth and came up to Chu Feng, supporting him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she did, the lightning armour on Chu Feng’s body as well as the wings made by black flames started disappearing. As such change occurred to him, not only did Chu Feng’s aura return to rank five Martial Lord, it was several times weaker than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even, at that instant, Qiushui Fuyan could feel all the bones in Chu Feng’s body shattered, and his skin all cracked. Nearly half of his physical body was damaged. From that, even though it could be seen that Chu Feng had successfully cast the Earthen Taboo martial skill, he had indeed paid a huge price.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Qiushui, this… Earthen Taboo martial skill is truly difficult!” After Chu Feng saw Qiushui Fuyan, he first bitterly smiled, then his head went limp and he lost consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… The Earthen Taboo martial skill, something even a Martial King doesn’t dare to easily touch, was successfully cultivated within the short span of two months. Yet you’re still saying it’s difficult? What about us then?” Qiushui Fuyan felt quite helpless at Chu Feng’s words before he lost consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Qiushui, is Chu Feng fine?” At the same time, Zi Ling and the others went up. As they looked at the pale and unconscious Chu Feng, they felt very worried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, he’s fine. To use the Earthen Taboo martial skill with his current cultivation, a backlash like this is already very light. There’s no need for you to worry. He’ll be back to normal after a few days of resting.” Qiushui Fuyan smiled, then led Chu Feng out of the Tower of Martial Skill Cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Feng went unconscious for several days. When he woke up, there was still a bit of pain on his body, but it was not as bad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Supreme genius, you’ve finally woken up?” Just as Chu Feng awoke and before he even got hold of his bearings, a gentle voice entered his ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Turning his head to the side, he saw Qiushui Fuyan walking towards him. However, at that moment, she did not use her veil to cover her appearance. Her beautiful complexion was revealed before him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Qiushui Fuyan had already entered the middle-ages, she still looked like a lady in her mid-twenties. Moreover, the experienced and mature aura around her made her even more enchanting; the former number one beauty of the Eastern Sea Region indeed lived up to her name.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior, don’t joke with me…” Chu Feng smiled as he scratched his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What joke do you mean? In two months, you cultivated a legendary Earthen Taboo martial skill. The title of ‘Supreme Genius’ is completely deserving!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To be honest, even Huangfu Haoyue back in the day was far inferior to you,” Qiushui Fuyan said with great praise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cultivated? How have I even cultivated it? I’ve merely just started.” However, Chu Feng shook his head at Qiushui Fuyan’s praise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just started? You haven’t completely grasped the Earthen Taboo martial skill?” Qiushui Fuyan felt a bit surprised at those words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course not. This Firmament Slash is really too difficult. There are in total nine slashes, and every single slash has double the power of the previous one. However, the pressure it puts on the body doubles as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Due to my current physical body, I can only use the first slash. If I were able to use the complete ninth slash, how would that huge tortoise merely be injured? It would have been turned into dust already,” Chu Feng said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From what you said, the power in the Earthen Taboo martial skill truly isn’t something a Mortal Taboo martial skill can be compared to. It is truly terrifying.” Qiushui Fuyan was shocked after hearing Chu Feng’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah! But sadly, I, right now, am still unable to grasp it completely. Moreover, when using it, the preparation time is too long. It’s very difficult to use it in battle,” Chu Feng said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry. Completely grasping this Earthen Taboo martial skill is only a matter of time with the aptitude you have. You don’t need to rush,” Qiushui Fuyan consoled with a smile when she saw Chu Feng a bit downcast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Qiushui, were you able to find Senior Huangfu?” Chu Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qiushui Fuyan shook her head, but then very quickly said, “Although I haven’t found Huangfu Haoyue’s whereabouts, I have discovered one thing in my journey. I’m sure you will really want to know this as well.”</span></p>
