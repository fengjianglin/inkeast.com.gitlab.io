 <p><strong> Chapter 1899 - A Miracle</strong></p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you’re truly amazing! I have not misjudged you!” Xian Miaomiao was still jumping up and down, shouting and screaming in excitement.</p>
 <p>Although she was extremely happy because the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle had been triggered, she was even more happy because Chu Feng was safe and sound right now.</p>
 <p>Xian Yuyin carefully observed the cheerful and happy expression that Xian Miaomiao had. He had taken it to heart. Although he did not say anything while standing there, he was emitting dense jealousy from head to toe.</p>
 <p>Because of that jealousy, Xian Yuyin muttered, “So what?”</p>
 <p>“Xian Yuyin, Chu Feng has already triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle, what else do you have to say?” Xian Miaomiao said to Xian Yuyin complacently.</p>
 <p>“Humph, it’s merely a single Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle. What could this possibly signify? Did you really think that Chu Feng would be able to trigger seven Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle to surpass me?”</p>
 <p>“I’ll tell you this. He doesn’t even have to trigger seven Ancient Era’s Immortal Needles. As long as he can trigger six, the same amount that I have, I will consider it his victory,” Xian Yuyin said complacently.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Right after Xian Yuyin’s words left his mouth, five more Ancient Era’s Immortal Needles emitted dazzling golden light.</p>
 <p>Five more Ancient Era’s Immortal Needles were triggered. Chu Feng had triggered five more Ancient Era’s Immortal Needles in succession. Adding on the one from before, he had triggered exactly six.</p>
 <p>He had triggered the same amount of Ancient Era’s Immortal Needles as Xian Yuyin.</p>
 <p>“What? This… how could this be?”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Xian Yuyin was stunned. He deeply wished for the scene before him to be fake.</p>
 <p>“Zzzzz~~~”</p>
 <p>The very next moment, five more golden bolts of lightning shot out from the five Ancient Era’s Immortal needles, joining the army of lightning in the sky. In an instant, the golden lightning in the sky grew even brighter and more magnificent. As it swept across the horizon, it gave off an unparalleled power.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, he actually managed to trigger six Ancient Era’s Immortal Needles like Yuyin?”</p>
 <p>At that moment, not to mention the others, even the grand characters present by the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond were stunned by the scene before them.</p>
 <p>However, this was merely the beginning. When the six Ancient Era’s Immortal Needles were triggered, the seventh and eighth Ancient Era’s Immortal Needles were also triggered in succession.</p>
 <p>“This… this is impossible! Absolutely impossible!” Xian Yuyin’s gaze was flickering, and his expression became extremely dejected. He was unable to believe the scene before him.</p>
 <p>A mere human actually managed to trigger eight Ancient Era’s Immortal Needles. This was truly something that one could not dare to imagine.</p>
 <p>At that moment, even Xian Miaomiao and Princess Lingyue were stunned. Their bodies were trembling with excitement, and their breathing had become hurried. Truly, the two of them were completely awestruck.</p>
 <p>A total of eight Ancient Era’s Immortal Needles, this was truly too astonishing a feat. Even for Ancient Era’s Elves, if one of them was able to trigger that many Ancient Era’s Immortal Needles, that would cause the entire Elf Kingdom to flare up with excitement. As such, there was no need to mention how they were feeling to see a human accomplishing such a feat.</p>
 <p>After a moment of being stunned with excitement, Princess Lingyue said, “One left, could Chu Feng be able to trigger all nine Ancient Era’s Immortal Needles and recreate the scene of nine lightnings soaring into the skies?”</p>
 <p>“Nine Ancient Era’s Immortal Needles, would he?” Xian Miaomiao also revealed an expression of intense expectation.</p>
 <p>Would he? This simple question was present in the hearts of everyone here. Would a human really be able to trigger the abnormal sign of nine lightnings soaring into the skies?</p>
 <p>Although it was extremely unimaginable, the Elf King, the Four Grand Elders, the Protectors and even the Immeasurable Immortal revealed the same sort of expression of intense expectation like Xian Miaomiao.</p>
 <p>Even though they knew that it would be extremely inconceivable for such a thing to happen, that such a thing occurring was simply impossible, they all hoped for it to happen, they all hoped to be able to bear witness to a miracle.</p>
 <p>Thus, at that moment, the crowd did not turn their gazes to the night sky covered densely with the overwhelming golden lightnings. Instead, their gazes were all fixed onto that single Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle yet to be triggered.</p>
 <p>They all wanted to bear witness to the miracle as it happened.</p>
 <p>“Zzzzzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, that last Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle started to blossom with dazzling light. Then, a golden bolt of lightning soared into the sky.</p>
 <p>“Rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>After that lightning bolt soared into the sky and mixed with the lightnings that already filled the sky, all of the golden lightning that covered the sky started to move with extreme unrest. Earlier, they were like a magnificent army that was ordered to show off their might in the sky.</p>
 <p>Yet, in that moment, it was as if life was given to them. They actually separated into nine enormous golden lightning armies and stood in the sky. They covered the entire sky as far as the eye could see. Their might was simply indescribable. They were not like nine ordinary bolts of lightning. Instead, they looked more like nine living beasts of lightning that emitted overwhelming dominance.</p>
 <p>“It’s the nine lightning bolts soaring into the skies, nine lightning bolts soaring into the skies. Chu Feng has actually triggered all nine of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needles and revealed this abnormal sign,” At that moment, Xian Miaomiao was so excited that even her voice started to tremble. Even back when she herself had triggered the nine lightnings soaring into the skies, she was not as excited as this.</p>
 <p>“No, this is fake, absolutely fake!” At that moment, Xian Yuyin was completely dumbfounded. It was not only him, his father was also dumbfounded. How could a human possibly accomplish this sort of thing? Was he really a human?</p>
 <p>“Roar~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, a roar suddenly sounded from the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. When that roar was heard, the entire world started to tremble violently. It actually surpassed the sound of the golden lightnings that covered the sky.</p>
 <p>“What is that sound?” At that moment, the crowd all cast their eyes to the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. They had all heard that shocking roar.</p>
 <p>“Roar~~~”</p>
 <p>The very next moment, that roar sounded again. Merely, this time around, it was not a single roar. Rather, there were seven roars sounding together.</p>
 <p>At the same time as those roars sounded, seven enormous lightning beasts covered, and flickering lightning shot out of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond and into the skies.</p>
 <p>“Heavens, what are those?!”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing those seven enormous lightning beasts, even the Ancient Era’s Elves’ grand characters started to panic.</p>
 <p>As absolute experts, they all possessed exceptional perception that surpassed those of ordinary people. At that moment, they all felt unprecedented pressure from those seven enormous lightning beasts.</p>
 <p>At that moment, not to mention the others, even the Elf King started to frown slightly.</p>
 <p>Before those seven enormous lightning beasts, he was able to feel an unprecedented sensation. That sort of sensation could be described with one word: small.</p>
 <p>When even the grand Elf King, the Elf King that was known to be the strongest expert in the Holy Land of Martialism, felt he was small before these seven enormous lightning beasts, there was no need to mention what the others were feeling.</p>
 <p>“What is that?! I’ve never seen that sort of abnormal sign before! It doesn’t seem to have come from the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needles, but instead come from the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond!” At that moment, cries of shock began to resound nonstop. Most importantly, those cries of shock were from those grand experts.</p>
 <p>“It’s an abnormal sign emitted by Chu Feng,” Xian Miaomiao said.</p>
 <p>“What? Miaomiao, what did you say? You’re saying that abnormal sign was caused by Chu Feng?” Princess Lingyue was extremely shocked. She was also astonished by that abnormal sign. However, she did not expect that abnormal sign to be related to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“That’s indeed the case. It greatly resembles what happened in the Cyanwood Domain’s Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. Merely, compared to back then, it’s much more terrifying this time around,” Xian Miaomiao said.</p>
 <p>“Miaomiao, what sort of nonsense are you talking about?! That abnormal sign surpassed the nine lightning bolts in the sky! How could it possibly be something emitted by that Chu Feng?!” Xian Yuyin shouted loudly. At that moment, he was extremely nervous. The reason for that was because he was afraid. He feared that this abnormal sign was truly caused by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>That was why he had to deny, deny everything regarding Chu Feng. Else, it would truly be too shocking for him to handle. If this matter were to spread, there would likely not be a single person from the Holy Land of Martialism’s younger generation who could surpass Chu Feng in terms of talent. Even Xian Miaomiao would not be able to.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng! Is it really Chu Feng?!!!” At the moment when Xian Yuyin was refusing to believe this, the other people started to associate the abnormal sign with Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>They had all heard before that the reason the Four Great Imperial Clans wanted to kill Chu Feng was because they were scared by the abnormal sign that he had caused. If they were to consider that, and consider the abnormal sign that caused even them, the grand experts, to feel scared, then it might really be caused by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“No, that’s impossible! Absolutely impossible!” Xian Yuyin shook his head repeatedly. He did not dare to acknowledge this to be true.</p>
 <p>At that time, Xian Yuyin’s father was also tightly clenching his fists. He was drenched in sweat and nervous to the extreme. Like his son, he also did not wish for all this to be related to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Splash~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, the water of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond suddenly started to surge with waves. Like water dragons, the multi-colored waves reached the skies.</p>
 <p>Then, a silhouette broke through the water dragons. He stood in midair before the gazes of the crowd.</p>
 <p>This man possessed long hair that trailed over his shoulders and a bright gaze. He was none other than Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>It was really Chu Feng. Merely, when the crowd looked to Chu Feng again, their expressions all changed. The reason for that was because Chu Feng was completely different from before.</p>
