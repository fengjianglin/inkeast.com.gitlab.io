 <p><strong> Chapter 2054 - Such An End</strong></p>
 <p>“I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you!! Ahhh!!!”</p>
 <p>“You damned bastard! If I survive today, I will definitely make everyone related to you meet a miserable death by my hands!!!”</p>
 <p>Suffering from pain that was growing more and more intolerable, the World Devastator Immortal started to rain more and more curses upon Chu Feng. He felt that he would definitely die today. However, he did not wish to be tormented to death. Since it would be death anyways, he’d rather anger Chu Feng so that Chu Feng would kill him and end his suffering.</p>
 <p>“You wish to make me kill you?”</p>
 <p>“Haha…”</p>
 <p>“Rest assured, I will definitely kill you. However, I will definitely not kill you now.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had seen through the World Devastator Immortal’s thoughts. As he spoke, he put away the world spirit sword, and then began to form hand seals with one hand. At that moment, dazzling light began to shine from the places pierced by Chu Feng’s world spirit sword.</p>
 <p>“Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Following the light, the Blazing Poison Heart Insects that were biting the World Devastator Immortal’s body soon entered the light. They reached the insides of the World Devastator Immortal’s body, as well as his bones and organs, and began to continue to bite him.</p>
 <p>“Ahh~~~”</p>
 <p>“Noo~~~”</p>
 <p>“You damned animal!!!”</p>
 <p>“No! You’re a demon!!”</p>
 <p>“You damned demon!!!”</p>
 <p>The World Devastator Immortal who had finally realized Chu Feng’s intentions let out screams of despair.</p>
 <p>“Rumble~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, the ground started to tremble violently, as if an earthquake had struck the region. Even the frost and ice that covered the ground started to shatter.</p>
 <p>Seeing this scene, Chu Feng immediately started to frown. He subconsciously turned his gaze to the snowy valley where the Dark Hall’s headquarters was located. He was able to tell that the trembling had originated from the Dark Hall’s headquarters.</p>
 <p>However, they were truly too far away. As such, Chu Feng was unable to see what was happening over there, and ended up having to use his Heaven’s Eyes.</p>
 <p>“Oh no,” After using his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng’s expression changed enormously. An uneasy gaze involuntarily appeared.</p>
 <p>His Heaven’s Eyes were fixed onto the summit of the snowy valley, on the Dark Hall’s Hall Master.</p>
 <p>An enormous change had actually occurred to the Dark Hall’s Hall Master. At that moment, dark black organisms covered his entire body. They were actually fusing with his body. As the dark black organisms fused with his body, his power began to rapidly increase.</p>
 <p>Most frighteningly, from the depths of the snowy valley, countless such black organisms were flying out and fusing with the Dark Hall’s Hall Master.</p>
 <p>Faced with that situation, not to mention the Alliance Army, even the Elf King was unable to stop the Dark Hall’s Hall Master. They could only watch as that scene continued to unfold.</p>
 <p>At that moment, everyone from the Alliance Army that saw this scene revealed alarmed expressions.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because the Dark Hall’s Hall Master’s aura had already surpassed that of the Elf King. Furthermore, it was still increasing. If this were to continue, he would likely reach the legendary Half Martial Ancestor realm. At that time, there would likely not be anyone capable of stopping him in the entire Holy Land of Martialism.</p>
 <p>“Why is this happening?”</p>
 <p>“Could it be that that guy trained in some demonic technique?”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng also felt extremely uneasy. The reason for that was because it was not only the Elf King and the others that were powerless to do anything to stop this, even Chu Feng was powerless. He did not know how he could change the current situation.</p>
 <p>“Roar~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master uttered a demon-like snarl. That voice was most definitely not the voice of a human, nor should it be emitted from the mouth of a human.</p>
 <p>However, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master had clearly uttered that sort of roar.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, after that snarl was heard, the black organisms coming from the depths of the snowy valley grew more and more numerous. In merely the blink of an eye, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master had turned into a several hundred meter-tall giant monster.</p>
 <p>Monster. He was most definitely a monster now. His entire body was black. He possessed countless hands, countless legs and even countless enormous eyes.</p>
 <p>His original body was long gone. It had been buried deeply by the monster that now covered him. In other words, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master was simply a monster now.</p>
 <p>“You shall all die!!!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master let out a hoarse voice. Even his voice had changed. It had become more frightening than the voices of monstrous beasts. Not only was it hoarse, it was also emitting dense killing intent.</p>
 <p>After his voice sounded, a powerful oppressive might swept forth. Not to mention the Alliance Army that was close to him, even Chu Feng who was far away from him was enveloped by that oppressive might.</p>
 <p>“This oppressive might, could it be that he….”</p>
 <p>After being enveloped by that oppressive might, even Chu Feng started to panic. The reason for that was because his body was actually unable to move. Furthermore, his cultivation had been bound. In fact, for Chu Feng and the others, they all felt as if they were suffocating.</p>
 <p>In fact, it was not only Chu Feng and the others. Even the Elf King, a peak Martial Emperor, was restricted by that oppressive might.</p>
 <p>Most frighteningly, it was only the people from the Alliance Army that were bound by that oppressive might. All the people from the Dark Hall were completely fine.</p>
 <p>In other words, they who had held superiority in this battle were powerless to fight back now. They were like fishes atop the chopping block, waiting to be trampled upon by the people from the Dark Hall.</p>
 <p>Such powerful oppressive might most definitely could not have been unleashed by a Martial Emperor. This meant that the Dark Hall’s Hall Master’s current cultivation had reached the level of Half Martial Ancestor.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng’s reaction was relatively better when compared to the others. The reason for that was because the other people possessed dejected expressions. They all felt that they were going to undoubtedly be killed.</p>
 <p>“A bunch of trash dared to come and fight against me? Do you all finally realize what it means to strike a stone with an egg?”</p>
 <p>“Very good. This is precisely the expression I wanted to see. Go ahead and despair. To dare become my opponent, you all are destined to despair.”</p>
 <p>Seeing the expressions of panic and despair on the faces of the Alliance Army, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master uttered a complacent laugh. His laugh resounded through heaven and earth, seeping into the hearts of the crowd.</p>
 <p>“Wuu~~~”</p>
 <p>However, suddenly, the Dark Hall’s Hall Master’s expression changed. He actually uttered an anguished wail. Then, enormous hands began to grab his ugly head as he continued to let out painful snarls.</p>
 <p>Even though he had obtained a power comparable to that of Half Martial Emperor after being covered with the black organisms, he didn’t seem to have absolute control over that power. That was the reason why he was suffering a backlash right now.</p>
 <p>In that sort of situation, the oppressive might that he emitted started to fluctuate in strength repeatedly. However, even with that being the case, Chu Feng and the others were still unable to move.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you must’ve never expected this sort of ending, right?”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, a cold and gloomy voice sounded. Chu Feng knew that it was most definitely the World Devastator Immortal.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng put forth great effort to turn his head around. He discovered that the World Devastator Immortal was actually managing to endure the pain from the Blazing Heart Poisoning Insects, and was walking toward him one step at a time. Furthermore, he held an Imperial Armament in his hand.</p>
 <p>“Damn it!” At that moment, Chu Feng started to frown. Even though he was able to turn his body around, he was simply unable to unleash any of his strength. If this were to continue, he would only be waiting for death.</p>
 <p>As for the World Devastator Immortal, it seemed that he feared that something unexpected would happen. As he endured the pain, his footsteps grew faster and faster. In the blink of an eye, he had arrived at a distance only ten meters away from Chu Feng.</p>
