 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1079 - Lightning Breaking Through The Heavens</strong></p>
 <p>“Could it be that the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle has not been triggered?” Seeing their reactions, Xian Kun started to frown deeply. He realized that his speculation might’ve been wrong.</p>
 <p>“It hasn’t. Lord Xian Kun, ever since you entered into the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond, we have been observing from here the entire time. All this time, the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle did not have any sort of reaction, much less being triggered.” The Southern Elf Lord shook his head.</p>
 <p>“Such a thing actually happened?” Hearing those words, Xian Kun was deeply surprised. Then, he sighed and said, “Southern Elf Lord, if this is the case, then I’m afraid that no one would be able to help you. It isn’t that no one is able to trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle. Instead, the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle you have here is already damaged.”</p>
 <p>“What? Lord Xian Kun, what do you mean by that? You said that our Southern Domain’s Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle is already damaged?” Hearing what Xian Kun said, the Southern Elf Lord as well as the various management elders all displayed extremely shocked and disturbed expressions.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. It is most definitely damaged. Generally, as long as one stays in the bottom for sixteen hours, the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle would be triggered. However, I have stayed in the bottom for over sixty hours. Yet, the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle still didn’t trigger. What might be the reason for that? Is there even a need for me to explain it to you all?”</p>
 <p>“Without a doubt, your Southern Domain’s Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle is damaged. I can guarantee that.” Said Xian Kun with an expression of absolute certainty.</p>
 <p>“Heavens! This…” Hearing those words, everyone from the Southern Domain displayed extremely dejected expressions. Especially the Southern Elf Lord, his body even swayed and he almost fell. It was evident that he had been greatly shocked.</p>
 <p>As the Elf Lord of the Southern Domain, he was the person in charge of everything here. However, he knew very well that the true ruler of everything here was the Elf King. He was merely a person in charge of watching over this region, a powerful guard. However, before the King, he was only a subordinate.</p>
 <p>As the Elf Lord in charge of this region, the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle and the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond were his everything. Yet now, the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle that he was in charge of was actually damaged. Then, he, as the Elf Lord, would have to bear the responsibility of the damage and be punished severely.</p>
 <p>“Master Elf Lord, what do we do now?”</p>
 <p>In fact, it was not only the Southern Elf Lord that was worried. At this moment, the many management elders from the Southern Domain were also panicking. Although this matter should not be related to them and no one knew how the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle became damaged, they were, after all, people who served this region. If their master was to be punished, they would naturally be unable to escape the punishment either. Thus, they all felt that a great catastrophe was imminent.</p>
 <p>“Lord Xian Kun, are you truly certain that the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle is damaged? This sort of thing cannot be joked about.” After calming down a bit, the Southern Elf Lord asked.</p>
 <p>“Absolutely certain.” Said Xian Kun with a determined expression. His gaze was cold and detached. It was as if what he had said was the unquestionable truth.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing his words, the Southern Elf Lord and the management elders were all struck dumb.</p>
 <p>However, they would never have thought that, at this moment after Xian Kun had left the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond’s bottom, a scene was happening at that very same location.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng stood in the bottom of the Immortal Pond. Layers upon layers of powerful energy was channeling into his body unceasingly. Most importantly, this sort of powerful energy created a chain reaction. The enormous formation hidden in the bottom of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond was currently emitting a dazzling light.</p>
 <p>It was not only that enormous formation that was emitting light all over, even that Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle was emitting a dazzling silvery light. Moreover, the ancient runes and symbols on the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle were all emitting light right now, as if they had been imbued with life, the light was rapidly squirming around.</p>
 <p>“Haha, sure enough. After that guy left, you immediately triggered this Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle. Chu Feng, you’ve succeeded. You’ve successfully triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle.” Seeing this scene, Eggy was so excited and overjoyed that she started jumping and hopping around.</p>
 <p>However, the current Chu Feng did not have the time to think about all those things. He had his eyes closed and did not bother to care about anything. He was wholeheartedly projecting his consciousness to his dantian. That was because he was able to clearly sense how significant the power being channeled into him by the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond’s mysterious formation was. This might actually be the crucial moment when he would be able to breakthrough to become a Martial King.</p>
 <p>As the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle triggered, light started to rush up from the bottom of the Immortal Needle. Gradually, the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle started to shine. In the end, the change arrived on the surface of the water and rushed all the way into the skies above. At this moment, everyone noticed the change.</p>
 <p>“Heavens! Quickly, look! The Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle is shining!”</p>
 <p>“What sort of situation is this? Could it be that the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle has been triggered?”</p>
 <p>Seeing the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle that was currently shining with countless number of runes and symbols flowing through it as if living, everyone was shocked. Regardless of where they’re from, whether they’re humans or monstrous beasts, at this moment, they all soared to the sky.</p>
 <p>Not only did they leave the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond, they also rushed to flee into the distant places in fear of being affected by the power of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle.</p>
 <p>That was because the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle was not only emitting light all over, it also emitted an ancient, mysterious and unapproachable divine aura.</p>
 <p>At this moment, within the boundless white mist, the Southern Elf Lord and the others were completely rejected and filled with worries because of what Xian Kun had said.</p>
 <p>However, who would’ve thought that, all of a sudden, the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle actually started to shine. Even they who were within the boundless white mist were able to clearly see the change that had happened to the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle.</p>
 <p>“Heavens, this is…”</p>
 <p>“It’s the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle! The Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle has been triggered! Master Elf Lord, the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle has been triggered!”</p>
 <p>“Good gracious! The Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle is not damaged! This sort of light, this sort of change, isn’t this precisely what happens after the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle is triggered?”</p>
 <p>Seeing the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle that was emitting light all over, the various management elders of the Southern Domain were all overjoyed. It was as if they had found paradise after entering a boundless abyss; they were truly emotional.</p>
 <p>With even the elders acting like this, there was no need to mention how emotional the Southern Elf Lord was. Merely, because he was, after all, the lord of this region; although he was overjoyed, he still had a composed expression.</p>
 <p>He looked to Xian Kun and said, “Lord Xian Kun, it would appear that you have made a misjudgement. Our Southern Domain’s Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle has not been damaged at all. Otherwise, how would it be triggered?”</p>
 <p>Actually, Xian Kun had truly thought that this Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle was broken. Otherwise, it would be impossible for it to not be triggered by him. However, after seeing what was happening, he too was surprised. That was because this was most definitely the reaction of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle being triggered.</p>
 <p>“Ha, it’s reaction being so slow, is this not a sign of damage?” Although he felt that he was mistaken, Xian Kun refused to admit it. Not only that, he even arrogantly said to the Southern Elf Lord. “However, regardless of that, you must still thank me. If it wasn’t for me, how could this Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle possibly be triggered?”</p>
 <p>“That’s of course, that’s of course.”</p>
 <p>Although Xian Kun’s tone was arrogant, the Southern Elf Lord did not take offense to it. That was because to him, everything would be well as long as his Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle was not damaged. Moreover, the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle had not been triggered for many years. For it to be triggered now, it was a long-time desire of his happening. The current him was overjoyed. Regardless of how unpleasant Xian Kun’s words were, he would not take any offense to it.</p>
 <p>“The long awaited green lightning, you are finally going to grace your presence before my Southern Domain once more. I truly missed you to death!”</p>
 <p>At this moment, the Southern Elf Lord raised his head to look to the sky. His hope-filled gaze was fixed on top of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle.</p>
 <p>In reality, it was not only him. Practically all of the Ancient Era’s Elves, including the humans and the monstrous beasts, had all raised their heads to wait for the arrival of the scene of the green lightning covering the entire horizon.</p>
 <p>“Rumble.”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, an ear-piercing thunder exploded from the topmost region of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle, shaking this entire region. The rumble was truly too ear-piercing. Not only that, it was also awe-inspiring. Practically everyone was intimidated by that rumble.</p>
 <p>“Zzzzz”</p>
 <p>Right after the thunder rumble that shook everything passed, a dazzling lightning appeared from the topmost region of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle.</p>
 <p>The thickness of that lightning was enormous. It was a magnificent sight. It appeared like an enormous dragon composed of countless smaller lightnings. Bringing about an unparalleled power, it spread throughout the entire sky, covering the horizon.</p>
 <p>The dense lightning created a net in the sky. Moreover, it was expanding in size unceasingly. Even though a boundless white mist covered the sky, the people below still managed to see the incomparable might displayed by it.</p>
 <p>At this moment, everyone was stupefied. Their eyes were wide open and their mouths agape. Their gazes were flickering and their lips were shuddering. They were all suffering from an inconceivable and unprecedented shock.</p>
 <p>That was because, at this very moment, the lightning that covered the sky, the lightning that was emitted by the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle was not green in color. Instead, it was golden</p>
