 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1021 - Three items</strong></p>
 <p>At this moment, both Chu Feng and Eggy’s gazes were also fixed upon that treasure box. They were already deeply attracted by the items within the treasure box.</p>
 <p>There was a total of three items within the treasure box. It could be said that every single one of them were invaluable treasures. It was so much that if one was to randomly take either one of those three items out, they would be able to create a carnage of blood.</p>
 <p>The first item was a fruit the size of a walnut. This fruit was light blue in color. On the surface of this fruit was a scale-like layer. On the center of that scale-like layer were patterns. The patterns were emitting a light glimmer.</p>
 <p>Other than the light glimmer, the patterns were also emitting a light aroma. The aroma was not very heavy. However, it gave off a fascinating sensation that was hard to resist.</p>
 <p>The most important matter was that Chu Feng sensed an extremely powerful natural energy. That sort of energy was even stronger than the energy of the Natural Oddities that Chu Feng had refined in the past.</p>
 <p>However, this fruit was clearly not a Natural Oddity. Instead, it appeared more like an ordinary medicinal fruit for cultivation, an ordinary cultivation resource. However, the natural energy that it contained within it was truly marvelous.</p>
 <p>One must say that this first item had already caused Chu Feng’s heartbeat to accelerate. It was not that Chu Feng had never experienced such a thing before, it was just that the amount of energy contained within this fruit was truly too terrifying. It was likely even possible for Chu Feng to make a breakthrough of a single rank using that fruit.</p>
 <p>“Eggy, do you know what this is?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“No idea. However, I know that it’s a good item that could allow your cultivation to increase.”</p>
 <p>“Other than that, judging from its appearance, it looks like a kind of fruit. Although the shape that it had condensed to is relatively complicated, it is absolutely not as complicated as that of Natural Oddities. If my guess is correct, there ought to be a lot of fruits like this one here. It seems like a fruit that was picked from a tree.” Eggy said while blinking her large eyes.</p>
 <p>“A lot more of these?” Hearing those words, even Chu Feng was unable to help himself from gulping a mouthful of saliva. If Chu Feng wanted to increase his cultivation, what was it that he needed the most? What he needed the most was cultivation resources!</p>
 <p>Currently, just this mysterious fruit had caused Chu Feng to become this emotional. If there was truly a lot more of this kind of fruit, then what would it mean for Chu Feng?</p>
 <p>“If my guess is correct, this fruit has yet to ripe. It could be said that it is an immature fruit. If it is half matured or fully matured, then the energy contained within it would definitely surpass your imagination even more.” Eggy added with a smile on her face.</p>
 <p>“Gulp.” When he heard that, Chu Feng once again gulped down a mouthful of saliva. His desire, the desire to search for this sort of fruit, had been completely evoked by Eggy.</p>
 <p>“Perhaps that map might contain the location for this sort of fruit.” Said Eggy as she pointed to the second item in the treasure box.</p>
 <p>That’s right. In this treasure box, the first item was this fruit that contained an extremely astonishing amount of natural energy. As for the second item, it was a map. Well, at the very least, it appeared like a map.</p>
 <p>It was an extremely ancient map. It was made out of kraft paper. At this moment, it was folded and placed within the treasure box.</p>
 <p>As for the final item, it was a completely dark golden colored little dagger. No, accurately describing, it was not a dagger. Instead, it appeared more like a cane. However, it was not a cane.</p>
 <p>In short, this item was extremely beautiful. It emitted a light glimmer. As long as one took a glance at it, one would be able to tell that it was an extraordinary treasure. However, it was not a weapon. No one knew what exactly it was for. It could be said that it was a mystery.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng opened the kraft paper and discovered that it was indeed a map. Furthermore, this map was extremely complicated and there were actually two versions of the map on the map. The first version was a version that everyone could see.</p>
 <p>This version was located in a place called Cyanwood Mountain. On this version was a large tree. That large tree was filled with gorgeous fruits. When one carefully looked at it, the fruits on the tree were exactly the same as the fruit in this treasure box.</p>
 <p>Moreover, a weapon was stuck underneath this tree. Next to that was an enormous treasure chest. This was simply a hint to everyone that there were treasures in the Cyanwood Mountain. Not only was there a large amount of cultivation resources, there was also an unknown treasure chest and a powerful weapon.</p>
 <p>“It’s actually the Cyanwood Mountain? Never would I have ever imagined that the treasure recorded in the treasure box that I obtained at a location far away would actually be so close to my hometown.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Grandfather Luo had already come over. When Chu Feng opened the map, he too had carefully inspected it. When he discovered that the treasure was hidden somewhere in the Cyanwood Mountain, he became extremely emotional.</p>
 <p>“Senior Luo, could that Cyanwood Mountain be one of the Nine Powers that you have spoken of, the strongest power within this region of land?” Asked Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Due to the fact that the Cyanwood Mountain on the map was extremely large, it meant that it was an extremely vast mountain range. As for exactly how vast it was, it would likely be something that Chu Feng had never experienced before.</p>
 <p>Moreover, the location of the Cyanwood Mountain was very good. It was impossible for there to not have someone occupying such a place. Thus, Chu Feng felt that this Cyanwood Mountain was the same as the Cyanwood Mountain, one of the Nine Powers.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. There is only a single Cyanwood Mountain in the Holy Land of Martialism. It is one of the Nine Powers.” Grandfather Luo nodded.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing Grandfather Luo’s words, Chu Feng started to frown. He began to carefully inspect the map once again. He was using his Heaven’s Eyes to inspect the other portion of the map. This portion was a portion that Grandfather Luo cannot see. That was because this was the version that was hidden.</p>
 <p>If the version that everyone could see indicated that the treasure was hidden within the Cyanwood Mountain, then the version that was hidden indicated the exact location of the treasure.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was able to determine from the hidden version that the treasure was hidden in a very vast world. That place was filled with traps and mechanisms and contained a lot of things that surpassed Chu Feng’s imagination. Moreover, some of those things were also hidden.</p>
 <p>In other words, while this hidden version of the map had let Chu Feng know about some things, there were still things that were hidden from him. Even if Chu Feng was able to accurately find the location of this treasure, it was still extremely dangerous should he want to enter it.</p>
 <p>Using his Heaven’s Eyes, Chu Feng carefully inspected the map numerous times in succession. Only when he was certain that he did not miss anything did he move his hand and create a layer of flame on his palm. Using that, he burned the map into ashes.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, have you remembered all the contents of this map?” Grandfather Luo was not very shocked by Chu Feng’s action. That was because if it was him, he too would do such a thing.</p>
 <p>These three items in the treasure box, if one was to say which one would cause others to covet for it the most, then it would definitely be that map. That was because anyone could tell that it was a treasure map. If one was to place this treasure map on them, it would be extremely unsafe. Thus, it was better for one to remember the contents of the treasure map in their head.</p>
 <p>“I’ve remembered everything. Merely, this treasure is not as simple as it seems.” While he said those words, Chu Feng had already placed away that cane-like yet dagger-like item. He was unable to be certain what use this item had. However, he was certain that it was definitely related with the treasure. Thus, it would definitely be of use for him to have it on him.</p>
