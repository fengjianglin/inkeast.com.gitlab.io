 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Damn it! This thing is actually so powerful?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, Chu Feng’s heart sunk. Although he was prepared for it, he did not expect that a random Evil Spirit would already put him in a predicament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One must know that Chu Feng was, after all, a Saint-cloak world Spiritist. He possessed battle power on par with a rank one Exalted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It would appear that I can only risk it all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eggy, I hope that you do not blame me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng opened one palm. Boundless spirit power continued to be released from his body in an unceasing manner, forming a spirit formation that moved to defend against the Evil Spirit’s attack. As for his other hand, it moved towards his Cosmos Sack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Faced with such a situation, Chu Feng had no choice but to seek the help of the Evil God Sword, even though he didn’t know if the Evil God Sword would be able to handle an Evil Spirit of such a caliber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the Evil God Sword had displayed practically unparalleled power when he used it back then, it remained that the opponents that Chu Feng had to deal with back then were very weak by his current standards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Things had changed. As Chu Feng’s strength increased, his opponents also became countless times stronger than before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng was uncertain as to exactly what sort of power the Evil God Sword might possess. All he knew was that the Evil God Sword was very strange, very dangerous and not something to be used rashly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, at that moment, Chu Feng was already forced with no alternative. He had no choice but to use the Evil God Sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This guy?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, right at that moment, Chu Feng’s expression changed. He was able to sense that the Qilin’s Egg in his Cosmos Sack was actually reacting. It was becoming restless. Although he was uncertain, Chu Feng felt that the Qilin’s Egg seemed to have taken an interest in the Evil Spirit before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huu, huu~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the Qilin’s Egg in Chu Feng’s Cosmos Sack exploded with boundless attractive force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the attractive force swept forth, it instantly covered the enormous Evil Spirit’s claw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Roar~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, screams began to sound from the depths of the hidden path. That sharp claw started to shiver. It was trying to retract.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was already too late.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng was able to personally witness the enormous sharp claw becoming distorted before his eyes. Very quickly, it changed beyond recognition, and turned into boundless gas, which was then sucked into Chu Feng’s Cosmos Sack by the attractive force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To be exact, it was sucked into the Qilin’s Egg inside Chu Feng’s Cosmos Sack.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is going on here? Why would that claw suddenly disappear?” Wuma Shengjie looked towards the location where the claw had disappeared with astonishment. The unease in her eyes increased instead of decreasing. She felt that things were simply too strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng was surprised to see such a reaction from Wuma Shengjie. “Girl, are you unable to sense it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re the one who did this? You were the one that destroyed that claw?” Wuma Shengjie looked to Chu Feng with astonishment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, it wasn’t me,” Chu Feng shook his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng had verified that the attractive force released by the Qilin’s Egg was something that only he was capable of sensing. Apart from him, no one else was able to sense it. Otherwise, Wuma Shengjie would not have reacted in such a manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, it seems that we possess a treasure capable of dealing with those Evil Spirits,” he added.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What sort of treasure?” Wuma Shengjie asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t have to conceal things from you,” as Chu Feng spoke, he took out the Qilin’s Egg and told Wuma Shengjie about it refining that Evil Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why Chu Feng was willing to tell Wuma Shengjie all this was because he trusted her. After all, she had only ended up in this place while trying to save him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you certain? Are you certain that it’s this so-called Qilin’s Egg that refined that Evil Spirit?” Wuma Shengjie was skeptical toward Chu Feng’s words. It wasn’t that she didn’t believe him. Merely, no matter how she looked at it, Chu Feng’s Qilin’s Egg did not look like a real Qilin’s Egg.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Actually, I also do not exactly know what this egg is capable of. That’s why you should wait for me here. I’ll go and test things out,” after Chu Feng finished saying those words, his body shifted, and he began to fly downward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng was planning to penetrate deeper into the hidden path by himself so that Wuma Shengjie could wait for him safely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the path below was truly safe, he would then inform her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, at practically the same moment Chu Feng started moving, Wuma Shengjie followed him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It would appear that nothing I say will be of use,” Chu Feng realized that Wuma Shengjie wouldn’t obediently stay and wait for him. Even though she knew the path down would be very dangerous, she was still planning to accompany him in his investigation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since you know that nothing you say will be of use, don’t bother saying anything. Just bring me out of this place,” Wuma Shengjie said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll try my best,” Chu Feng smiled. Then, he increased his speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Roar~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, they encountered another Evil Spirit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That Evil Spirit resembled a snake. Yet, it was not a snake. With its mouth wide open, Chu Feng was unable to tell how long its body was. However, its mouth was enormous; it measured a thousand meters across. A single fang was a hundred meters long, and such fangs filled the entire mouth. From a rough estimate, there were several hundred fangs in that giant mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such a giant mouth was not only disgusting, but also extremely terrifying. This was especially true when combined with that horrifying screech. Even Wuma Shengjie’s face turned deathly pale from fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Roar~~~”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, right as that Evil Spirit approached Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie, it began to distort. Soon, it turned into boundless gaseous substances that passed by Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie. Furthermore, the gaseous substances soon disappeared too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was what Wuma Shengjie was able to witness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Could it really be because of that egg?” Wuma Shengjie looked at Chu Feng as shock filled her eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although she was unable to sense the attractive force emitted by the egg, she knew that what had just happened was definitely not a coincidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That should be the case. Merely, I don't know how long it's capable of doing this,” Chu Feng was also uncertain. Although he was uncertain, he continued to rapidly fly toward the depths of the hidden path. As they flew deeper down, more and more Evil Spirits began to appear. These Evil Spirits appeared to be each mightier than the last ones. However, none of them were able to escape being refined by the Qilin’s Egg.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, as more and more Evil Spirits were refined by the Qilin’s Egg, a transformation also occurred to it. The crack on the eggshell started to increase in size.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Is it engulfing external powers to accelerate its incubation?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Are Divine Beasts truly this terrifying?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Chu Feng was relying on the Qilin’s Egg to solve the difficulty before them, the more he witnessed its power, the more extraordinary he felt it to be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He truly didn’t know if it would be a blessing or a calamity to keep such a terrifying monster beside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it ended up listening to him, then he would have most definitely profited enormously. However, what if it refused to listen to him? Who knew what it might do to him then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most importantly, the abilities that Chu Feng currently possessed were simply incapable of restricting the Qilin’s Egg. Thus, it would truly be a gamble, with the outcome determined by luck and fate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All the Evil Spirits have disappeared. Could it be… that they sensed the terrifying power of the Qilin’s Egg, and were scared away?” Wuma Shengjie asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t know. However… it seems that the answer will soon appear,” even though the Evil Spirits had disappeared, Chu Feng’s gaze became particularly stern.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of that, Wuma Shengjie, who had just felt some relief after the Evil Spirits disappeared, also started feeling nervous again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, Chu Feng was still talking cheerfully and wittily when there were Evil Spirits around. Yet, after the Evil Spirits disappeared, Chu Feng became very serious. From his behavior, Wuma Shengjie knew that what they would confront later would be even more terrifying than the Evil Spirits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wuhahahaha!!!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a burst of ear-piercing laughter sounded from the depths of the hidden path. That laughter was extremely loud, resounding and mighty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When that laughter was heard, a strong gale rushed out from the depths of the hidden path. Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie were completely powerless to defy it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furthermore, as there was the invisible barrier behind them, the two of them were pressed into the barrier by the wind, unable to budge at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, even Chu Feng revealed a look of fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Earlier, Chu Feng was able to slay both gods and buddhas that blocked his path using the Qilin’s Egg in his hand. No matter how terrifying an Evil Spirit might look, they would be instantly destroyed upon encountering them, becoming nourishment for the Qilin’s Egg.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the thing below was able to release such tyrannical wind with mere laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most importantly of all, the Qilin’s Egg in Chu Feng’s hand did not react at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This made Chu Feng realize that the thing down in the hidden path was likely extremely difficult to deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, although that thing was very powerful, it was unlike the Evil Spirits that they’d encountered on the way, as it did not try to kill them right after discovering them. This meant that whatever that thing might be, it was something that possessed intelligence and awareness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, Chu Feng braced himself against the strong gale crashing into him and spoke with a tone filled with respect, “Senior, why are you laughing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Chu Feng spoke, that strong gale actually stopped. With that, Chu Feng and Wuma Shengjie’s hearts sank once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A pair of eyes had appeared in the pitch-black hidden path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those eyes were blood-red, and enormous in size. They resembled two bloody moons as they appeared below them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sure enough, that thing below was much more terrifying than all of the Evil Spirits Chu Feng had encountered so far.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why am I laughing? This exalted one is laughing out of bitterness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This exalted one has waited for so long. Finally, someone had managed to reach this place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, never would I have imagined that what I’ve waited so long for would be two trash.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The voice below sounded again. This time around, it was filled with mockery and anger.</span></p>
