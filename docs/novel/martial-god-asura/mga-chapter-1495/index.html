 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1495 - Overwhelming Victory</strong></p>
 <p>“Ahhhhh~~~” At this moment, Qin Wentian began to scream in pain. His voice was very ear-piercing.</p>
 <p>Being oppressed by Chu Feng’s enormous power, Qin Wentian’s body started to grow smaller and smaller. At the same time, the pain that he was feeling became more and more enormous.</p>
 <p>Qin Wentian knew very well that the situation would be extremely bad if it were to continue. He knew that the moment when his size returned to that of an ordinary human, it would be the time when he would be met with a violent death.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you piece of trash. As a disciple of the Cyanwood Mountain, instead of using martial techniques, you relied on world spirit techniques. You are truly fighting with an unfair advantage, a completely unfair advantage!” Qin Wentian knew that he did not have much time left. Thus, he began to curse out at Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, after hearing Qin Wentian’s curse, Chu Feng suddenly stopped his attack toward Qin Wentian and asked, “Do you truly think that I, Chu Feng, would not be a match for you if I didn’t use world spirit techniques?”</p>
 <p>“Bullshit! You are merely a rank six Martial King. If you didn’t use world spirit techniques, I could drown you alive with a single spit.”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you are nothing more than trash. You are trash who only knows how to use world spirit techniques. You are a failure as a martial cultivator. You are unworthy of being known as a martial cultivator, and even more unworthy of staying in the Cyanwood Mountain. You should scram back to the World Spiritist Alliance!” Qin Wentian continued on cursing.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~~”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, with a thought from Chu Feng, the Eight Armed Deity Formation was dissolved. From above the skies, Chu Feng gently floated down and landed on the plaza.</p>
 <p>“Heavens! What is Chu Feng planning to do? He couldn’t possibly be planning to fight against Qin Wentian with martial techniques, right?”</p>
 <p>When they saw this scene, many of the people present were immensely shocked. They all felt that Chu Feng had let his emotions affect his decision-making ability, and let go of the opportunity of certain victory so that he could fight against Qin Wentian with his weak point. This was not a wise decision.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, Qin Wentian’s body shifted. His enormous body turned into crimson gaseous flames. With might and speed akin to that of a lightning bolt, he arrived before Chu Feng. Like a blood python, he twined tightly around Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qin Wentian was no longer human. Instead, he was now a monster that was capable of changing into any form and any object.</p>
 <p>“Haha, Chu Feng, you are truly too arrogant. A fight between experts possesses rapid substantial change. You actually don’t even know about this logic, and have given me the chance to fight back.”</p>
 <p>“I, Qin Wentian, on the other hand, will not give you this opportunity. The more grievances you possess when you die, the more joyous I will be. That is because your death is well-deserved.” As Qin Wentian spoke, he utilized all of his strength to tighten his grasp on Chu Feng. He was planning to crush Chu Feng to death.</p>
 <p>“Heh…” However, right at the moment when Qin Wentian thought that Chu Feng was doomed to die, Chu Feng uttered a single laugh. After that, five different kinds of lightning flashed through his eyes. Then, with a loud ‘snap,’ countless lightning bolts shot forth from within Chu Feng’s body like sharp blades.</p>
 <p>Anywhere the lightning passed, all living things would be destroyed. Even the space Chu Feng was in was shattered by the lightning. The space collapsed into void, leaving nothing behind. At this moment, Chu Feng was in a space of darkness. Everything surrounding him had been destroyed. As for Qin Wentian, he had naturally also disappeared. He was completely and utterly dead.</p>
 <p>“Oh, I forgot to mention this to you. I didn’t use martial power because I didn’t want you to lose too miserably.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was still standing in the space of darkness. Even though his surroundings had all been covered with darkness, he himself had not been covered with darkness. On the contrary, he appeared to be extremely imposing with his surging Thunder Armor and fluttering Thunder Wings.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng appeared like a god of lightning. With every move, he would attract everyone’s attention. He was truly extraordinarily imposing.</p>
 <p>“Rank one Half Martial Emperor, Chu Feng’s cultivation is actually also rank one Half Martial Emperor?! Sure enough, he concealed his cultivation!” The crowd was astonished. That was because Chu Feng’s cultivation right now was that of a rank one Half Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>“No, that’s wrong. I’ve heard that Chu Feng possesses a special method that can increase his cultivation by two levels. That lightning armor and those lightning wings are the method I’m talking about. Since his current cultivation is that of a rank one Half Martial Emperor, his actual cultivation should be that of a rank eight Martial King.” There were also people that knew Chu Feng that started to explain things to the others.</p>
 <p>At this moment, before the gazes of the crowd, while the crowd was spiritedly discussing him, the dark void formed by Chu Feng’s shattering of space started to recompose itself.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings had also started to fade away.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng’s cultivation lowered to that of rank eight Martial King. Chu Feng did not try to conceal his cultivation. That was because he had already displayed his true cultivation before the crowd. Thus, there was no need for him to conceal it anymore. Rank eight Martial King was Chu Feng’s current actual cultivation.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng’s battle power was on par with actual rank four Half Martial Emperors. This was not something that only Chu Feng believed. Rather, he had managed to successfully accomplish that under the countless gazes from the crowd.</p>
 <p>Although the battle had ended, the discussions of Chu Feng from the various powers did not end.</p>
 <p>There was no need to mention the Ten Thousand Flowers Garden, the Sword Crafting Villa and the others. That was because they had already thought Chu Feng to be a rare heavenly genius. Not only were his world spirit techniques extremely powerful, even his martial power was very powerful. He was simply a rare sapling that might not even appear in ten thousand years.</p>
 <p>They were envious and even jealous of the Cyanwood Mountain. However, they also wanted to obtain a good relationship with Chu Feng. This was not because those grand characters and grand powers were shameless, rather, it was because a heavenly genius possessed that sort of charm. Even for grand characters like the headmasters of the Nine Powers, they would still want to obtain a good relationship with that sort of genius.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he just so happened to be that sort of heavenly genius.</p>
 <p>After this battle was over, it was actually the Cyanwood Mountain’s disciples who had the greatest change in their opinion of Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Regardless of whether Chu Feng had obtained six bets from the various grand characters, or the fact that Chu Feng had defeated the twenty disciples of the Cursed Soil Sect, or even the fact that he had killed Qin Lingyun...</p>
 <p>… all of those matters were extremely grand and capable of stirring up great commotion. However, when those matters happened, it was only the grand characters that had been present to witness them. Thus, not many people knew about them. Naturally, the majority of the disciples of the Cyanwood Mountain did not know how powerful Chu Feng was.</p>
 <p>However, the battle today had been displayed publicly. Not only were there grand characters present, many of the Cyanwood Mountain’s disciples had also come to watch.</p>
 <p>Those disciples had all managed to see how powerful Chu Feng was with their own eyes. They all came to know about Chu Feng’s transformation. Thus, in their hearts, Chu Feng was no longer that trash that Qin Lingyun was able to trample upon as he wished. Instead, he had become the fully-deserving number one disciple of the Cyanwood Mountain.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng actually did not care much about the opinions that others had of him. After the battle ended, Chu Feng returned to his own residence. He needed to recuperate.</p>
 <p>Even though Chu Feng had appeared to be extremely impressive in this battle and obtained absolute victory, it was actually not that simple.</p>
 <p>The battle had, in fact, been somewhat challenging for Chu Feng. At the very least, Chu Feng had displayed two of his greatest trump cards in order to obtain victory this beautifully.</p>
 <p>If the Eight Armed Deity Formation was disastrously damaging to Chu Feng’s spirit power, then Chu Feng’s five colored lightnings were an enormous burden to Chu Feng’s martial power and even his own body.</p>
 <p>That move of his was done by using the five different Divine Lightnings in Chu Feng’s blood. Actually, Chu Feng already had known of this method since long ago. He had grasped it the moment he had managed to break through into the Martial King realm. Merely, the might of the move back then had not been this enormous. Furthermore, its firing distance was extremely short.</p>
 <p>As for the attack Chu Feng had used today, it was over a hundred, a thousand or even ten thousand times stronger than it had initially been.</p>
 <p>Actually, Chu Feng had not gone all-out today. If he had gone all-out, the destructiveness of his attack would have been even greater.</p>
 <p>As for the reason why his attack’s power had increased, it was not only because Chu Feng’s cultivation had increased. More importantly, it was because Chu Feng had managed to grasp greater control over the Divine Lightnings.</p>
 <p>As for the reason why Chu Feng was able to accomplish such a feat, it was because of the flash of enlightenment from earlier. When he had broken through to rank eight Martial King, Chu Feng had seized a chance opportunity and obtained enlightenment. Thus, his control over the Divine Lightnings was now a bit more unconstrained.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng knew very well that although he had managed to grasp the power of the Divine Lightnings, he had only managed to grasp a small portion, akin to the tip of the iceberg.</p>
 <p>The Divine Lightnings in his body were extremely powerful, unimaginably powerful, incomprehensibly powerful. If Chu Feng were to be able to completely grasp them, it would be a trivial matter for him to destroy the entire Holy Land of Martialism.</p>
 <p>Although a power like this was extremely frightening, Chu Feng was not afraid. Instead, he was excited.</p>
 <p>“Sure enough, you all are very powerful, so powerful that I am simply unable to control you all.”</p>
 <p>“However, I like that you all are this powerful. The more powerful you are, the more I want to control you all.”</p>
 <p>“Right now, I have only managed to grasp the tip of the iceberg. However, one day, I will completely grasp you all and make you mine.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng opened his eyes and said those words. He was speaking to the Nine Colored Divine Lightnings in his body.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was not at all humble when he said those words. At the same time, he did not display any arrogance. The attitude that he had was completely different from before.</p>
 <p>Before, Chu Feng was uncertain about the origins of the Divine Lightnings. Thus, he felt that they were extremely frightening and ended up fearing them.</p>
 <p>Yet now, he no longer thought of them that way. That was because he had came to a realization, and understood that the Divine Lightnings were not a foreign power. Instead, they were the power of his bloodline.</p>
 <p>In other words, he was the Divine Lightnings and the Divine Lightnings were him. Regardless of how powerful the Divine Lightnings might be, they would still have to live within his body. As they were the power of his bloodline, they were one with Chu Feng.</p>
