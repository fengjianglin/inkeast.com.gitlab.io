 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 702 - Conclusion</strong></p>
 <p><span style>*hmm* Just at that moment, the entrance behind Chu Feng slightly trembled, seeming that it was about to close.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, Chu Feng couldn’t help smiling, then said, “It’s time to head out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once Chu Feng stepped out, the entrance to the Martial Marking Immortal Realm closed in an instant. The entire mountain peak returned to its former state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the current peak was not quiet. In the eyes of almost everyone who looked at Chu Feng was full of strong amazement. There were even some of the same generation who looked at Chu Feng with a few bits of admiration or idolization.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Feng had already anticipated such a scene. Back then, six thousand Martial Markings made even him very shocked, let alone them. Certainly, at that very moment, some people were guessing what sort of Taboo martial skill he got.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Junior Wuqing, you’re too awesome! All of the Martial Markings in the Temple of Reproduction were captured by you, right? How did you do that?” Chun Wu said after running over with a face full of joy. As she spoke, she even gave the Cosmos Sack in her hand to Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Chun Wu, you should keep this,” Chu Feng refused with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How can that do? This is your reward, how can I accept it? That does not comply with the rules!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Besides, Junior Wuqing, although you are very powerful, you still need to work hard on your cultivation! And this, can help you.” Chun Wu forcefully opened up Chu Feng’s palm, then stuffed the Cosmos Sack into his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that, Chu Feng examined the Cosmos Sack and his eyes involuntarily lit up instantly. He hurriedly asked, “Senior Chun Wu, what exactly are these? The Martial power inside is so gentle! They are such rare cultivation treasures!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These are the high-rank Martial Medicine, the Immortal Mushrooms of Martialism. However, they are not ordinary high-rank Martial medicine. They are unique Martial Medicine that only the Misty Peak has. Moreover, their growth cannot be sped up and only when they mature on their own could they be picked. Their price far surpasses beyond normal high-rank Martial Medicine, and are even more precious than top-rank Martial Medicine—Martial Beads.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Although the Martial power in the top-rank Martial Medicine ‘Martial Bead’ is far above the Immortal Mushroom of Martialism, after all, those under the rank of Martial Lord cannot cultivate them. This Immortal Mushroom of Martialism, however, is different. Even those in the Heaven realm can cultivate them, and there are even good effects after cultivation,” Chun Wu explained patiently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s that mystical?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Feng’s heart was even more joyed when he heard those words. No matter what, he did not expect the first-place reward for the Martial Marking Immortal Realm would be that bountiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Chu Feng’s Spirit power, he could feel how powerful the Immortal Mushroom of Martialism was. Not only did it contain powerful Martial power, it was even very gentle. And, the gentler the Martial power, it represented greater ease in refining.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Especially to those in the Heaven realm, it had great effects. Even with a single Immortal Mushroom of Martialism, it would absolutely be no problem to continuously make breakthrough past many realms. It was a true Natural Oddity, a cultivation treasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Chu Feng wanted to make breakthroughs now, the Martial power required was very enormous. Thus, the six Immortal Mushrooms of Martialism would not have much of an effect. However, if Su Rou, Su Mei, Zhang Tianyi, and Jiang Wushang refined them, the effects would be unimaginable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, that was why Chu Feng was so elated. It was because the six Immortal Mushrooms of Martialism would help greatly towards Su Rou’s, Su Mei’s, and the others’ cultivation. As the closest people to him currently in the Eastern Sea Region, Chu Feng had always wanted to help them. And now, he finally had such a chance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wuqing, it seems that your harvests in the Martial Marking Immortal Realm are quite good. I wonder… Have you gotten the Martial Marking Immortal Lotus?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just at that moment, Lady Piaomiao also walked over. When she looked at Chu Feng, her eyes actually contained a bit of amiability. It could be said to be a few times more benignant than before. After seeing Chu Feng’s strength, she did look at him with new lens.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Piaomiao, I have gotten the Martial Marking Immortal Lotus.” As Chu Feng spoke, he gave the Martial Marking Immortal Lotus Chun Wu helped him collect to Lady Piaomiao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm.” Seeing the Martial Marking Immortal Lotus, a rare expression of joy appeared on Lady Piaomiao’s face. One could see that she too really wanted to save Yan Ruyu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, in Chun Wu, Jiang Wanshi, and the other beauty’s company, under countless admirative and envious gazes, Chu Feng left the mountain peak and returned to his place of residence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But even after returning, Chu Feng could not rest well because he, who had collected six thousand Martial Markings, already showed his powerful side and exceptional talent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Almost all the youths who knew of that matter wanted to befriend Chu Feng. There were even some young females who sent messages to Chu Feng, expressing their love towards him. It reached a point where even some old experts wished to see Chu Feng and chat with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But how could Chu Feng, who had already seen people who acted like that within the Martial Marking Immortal Realm, give them the chance? So, other than Chun Wu and others who had rather closer relationships with him, Chu Feng closed his door to all and was not willing to see them. No matter who it was, he gave no face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And because the Martial Marking Immortal Realm event had concluded, the Misty Peak would not leave those people there as guests for long periods of time. So, pretty much other than Chu Feng as well as Qiushui Fuyan and Jiang Wanshi, everyone was politely sent down the Misty Peak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the people who were bothering had gone, the current Chu Feng instead became more restless. He could not even sit in peace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason for that was because he heard that Lady Piaomiao had already used the Martial Marking Immortal Lotus to officially dispel the demon in Yan Ruyu’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And after several long days of torture, Qiushui Fuyan who went to help Lady Piaomiao finally appeared within Chu Feng’s line of sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Qiushui, how was it? Yan Ruyu is fine, right?” Chu Feng anxiously asked when he saw Qiushui Fuyan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoh.” Seeing Chu Feng with a face full of disquiet, Qiushui Fuyan charmingly smiled, then said, “I didn’t think you would be so worried for her. Is the relationship between the two of you good?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh…” Chu Feng hesitated a bit, then shook his head and said, “No, my relationship with her isn’t good, but the reason why she was in that state was, after all, related to me. If she could not be healed, I cannot feel calmness in my heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry. The Martial Marking Immortal Lotus is a sealing oddity. Although that demon was powerful, it has been completely exorcised. Right now, that girl Yan Ruyu not only has no worries for her health, she has also thoroughly obtained that demon’s unique power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That power is not simple. It can even be said to be extremely powerful, possibly no weaker than a Divine Body’s power. In the future, her potential is unlimited. It may not be an impossibility for her to surpass Murong Xun one day.” As Qiushui Fuyan spoke, there was even a bit of admiration on her face. As if she was admiring Lady Piaomiao able to take in such an outstanding disciple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, Chu Feng, she seemed to have quite an opinion on you, so she does not wish to see you,” Qiushui Fuyan said with a smile. It seemed that she had hiddenly guessed of something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Feng did not mind Yan Ruyu not willing to see him. After hearing that she was not only completely fine, and even obtained power comparable to Divine Bodies, Chu Feng felt happy for her. Perhaps it was the so-called “all’s well that ends well”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Chu Feng’s relieved complexion, Qiushui Fuyan satisfiedly smiled. She had better and better thoughts about Chu Feng. Not only did he have outstanding talent, exceptional courage, he even had a very suave air. From all sides, he surpassed those of the same generation by huge margins. So, she asked again, “Chu Feng, the Martial Marking Immortal Realm has ended now, and we should be leaving soon. Do you have plans regarding your destination?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Qiushui, do you know where Senior Fu Liansheng, one of the Four Protectors of the Crippling Night Demon Sect, is?” Chu Feng asked.</span></p>
