 <p><strong> Chapter 1975 - You’re Truly Ridiculous</strong></p>
 <p>“Roar~~~”</p>
 <p>Once the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader appeared, a dragon’s roar immediately resonated through heaven and earth, and a boundless oppressive might surged from Chu Feng’s body. That oppressive might instantly turned the situation of the battle around; it had completely overturned the oppressive might that was suppressing Chu Feng, and even began to oppress Xian Yuyin’s uncle instead.</p>
 <p>“Heavens, that is?!”</p>
 <p>“Could it be…. That that is also an Imperial Armament?”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, he actually also possesses an Imperial Armament?!”</p>
 <p>At that moment, the expressions from the crowd were truly marvelous. Chu Feng’s weapon was emitting an Emperor’s might. There was no mistake; that unparalleled sensation that they were feeling was definitely that of an Imperial Armament.</p>
 <p>However, no one had expected that Chu Feng would actually possess an Imperial Armament. This was especially true of the Heavenly Law Palace’s Elder Yue Ling. At that moment, he was feeling extremely complicated.</p>
 <p>He was someone that had managed to become a rank six Martial Emperor and a management elder of the Heavenly Law Palace after training for thousands of years. Yet, he did not possess a single Imperial Armament.</p>
 <p>However, that Chu Feng, that brat who had only trained for just over a dozen years, actually already possessed an Imperial Armament. This caused Elder Yue Ling to feel extremely envious and jealous of Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, someone from the Heavenly Law Palace shouted, “Furious Coiling Dragon Behader! Milord, look, Chu Feng’s Imperial Armament seems to be the legendary Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader!”</p>
 <p>Upon closer inspection, Elder Yue Ling’s face nearly turned green. Wasn’t the appearance of that silver Imperial Armament that Chu Feng was holding in his hand exactly the same as that legendary Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader?</p>
 <p>In fact, many people heard the cry of shock from that person of the Heavenly Law Palace. They had also heard of the renowned Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader. At that moment, they too had expressions of disbelief covering their faces.</p>
 <p>The Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader was a weapon renowned for its might. It was the legendary Imperial Armament of the Beast Emperor, the Black Dragon King.</p>
 <p>Thus, how could such an Imperial Armament end up in Chu Feng’s hands? The might being revealed by the Imperial Armament Chu Feng was holding in his hand was definitely real. But, was that weapon really the legendary Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader?</p>
 <p>As such, it was inevitable that there would be people who were skeptical of whether or not the Imperial Armament in Chu Feng’s hand was really the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader. After all, the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader was too famous. It had never appeared in the Holy Land of Martialism since the death of the Beast Emperor. For it to suddenly appear now, it was inevitable that people would find it hard to believe.</p>
 <p>“Roar~~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at the moment when the crowd was shocked, the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader in Chu Feng’s hand uttered another roar.</p>
 <p>“Buzz, buzz, buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>After that roar sounded, the Imperial Armament which Xian Yuyin’s uncle was holding began to tremble, as if it were afraid.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Xian Yuyin’s uncle tried his hardest to conceal his Imperial Armament’s trembling. After all, he could not allow himself to lose to Chu Feng in terms of battle deposition before the confrontation had even begun.</p>
 <p>However, with only one hand left, how could he possibly conceal the trembling of his Imperial Armament? In fact, even the hand that he was holding his Imperial Armament with started to subsequently tremble.</p>
 <p>“Heavens, quickly, look over there! That man’s Imperial Armament is actually trembling. It is afraid! Could it be that it’s intimidated by the Imperial Armament in Chu Feng’s hand?”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng’s Imperial Armament is actually capable of intimidating other Imperial Armaments? It is most definitely no ordinary Imperial Armament! Heavens! Could it be that Chu Feng’s Imperial Armament really is that legendary Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader?!” At that moment, the crowd exclaimed in succession.</p>
 <p>“Fuck! I refuse to believe this!!!”</p>
 <p>Seeing that everyone was starting to lean toward Chu Feng and ignore him, Xian Yuyin’s uncle shouted furiously. As he spoke, he brandished the giant Imperial Armament axe in his hand.</p>
 <p>“Snap~~~”</p>
 <p>With the slash of his axe, an enormous crack appeared in the void. His frightening slash caused the expressions of everyone present to stiffen.</p>
 <p>The aura of death had never been so close to them before. At that moment, even grand characters like Elder Huang Guan felt that a great catastrophe was about to befall them.</p>
 <p>As for all this, it was caused by Xian Yuyin’s uncle. That axe of his was truly too powerful. Not only was he planning to kill Chu Feng with that slash, he would also destroy everything and everyone within a ten thousand meter radius of Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Break!!!”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, Chu Feng suddenly waved the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader in his hand. “Snap~~~,” another enormous spatial crack appeared.</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~”</p>
 <p>The two attacks collided with one another and created an enormous explosion. At that moment, this region turned completely black. And everyone’s line of sight was covered.</p>
 <p>It was the shattering of space and the void itself. The space and void in this region were shattered by the confrontation between Chu Feng and Xian Yuyin’s uncle.</p>
 <p>It was only when the shattered space returned to normal that the crowd’s line of sight managed to see clearly again. When they discovered that they had come out unscathed, the crowd was wild with joy.</p>
 <p>No one on Chu Feng’s side was injured. Chu Feng had successfully blocked Xian Yuyin’s uncle’s attack.</p>
 <p>“Cough, cough~~~”</p>
 <p>However, suddenly ear-piercing coughing noises were heard. They were emitted from the direction of Xian Yuyin’s uncle.</p>
 <p>Turning toward the direction of the coughs, the crowd were stunned once again. They had discovered that Xian Yuyin’s uncle had fallen to the ground.</p>
 <p>Not only that, his body was also badly mutilated. As he coughed, he continuously vomited out mouthfuls of blood. He was so weak that he simply looked like someone who was on the verge of death.</p>
 <p>Defeated. Xian Yuyin’s uncle had been defeated. In the confrontation of Imperial Armaments, Xian Yuyin’s uncle had been defeated by Chu Feng in a single bout.</p>
 <p>That said, even though Xian Yuyin’s uncle had a very miserable appearance right now, no one other than the people from the Heavenly Law Palace felt any sympathy for him.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because even though he was an incomparably noble Ancient Era’s Elf, he was an extremely ruthless individual. When he fought against Chu Feng earlier, he had unleashed many ruthless attacks with no concern for the surrounding people. Had it not been for Chu Feng blocking all of those attacks, countless innocent bystanders would’ve been killed by him.</p>
 <p>Someone like him, someone who would disregard the lives of others for his own purpose, would only be a scourge should he be kept alive. At that moment, many people wished for the death of that Ancient Era’s Elf.</p>
 <p>“Step, step, step…”</p>
 <p>Holding the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader, Chu Feng began to walk toward Xian Yuyin’s uncle one step at a time. After arriving before him, Chu Feng asked, “Is there anything you wish to say before your death?”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you must not kill me. I am an Ancient Era’s Elf. If you are to kill me, you will have gone against all of us Ancient Era’s Elves.”</p>
 <p>“While you were able to contend against the Four Great Imperial Clans, I’d advise you to think twice before going against us Ancient Era’s Elves. In this Holy Land of Martialism, no one dares to go against us. Even the Three Palaces do not dare to do so. If you dare to go against us, you will not only be sealing your own doom, those with you will also be killed. Even if you escape to the ends of the earth, we will still catch you and kill you,” Xian Yuyin’s uncle spoke in an extremely fierce manner.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was startled upon hearing those words. He truly did not expect that Xian Yuyin’s uncle, with how overflowing his murderous intentions were earlier, was actually also a coward that feared death. It must be said that Chu Feng was truly disappointed in him.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng’s startled look caused the crowd to think that he was scared. Indeed, they were the Ancient Era’s Elves. How could anyone possibly not be afraid of them?</p>
 <p>While others might not know, the people from the Three Palaces knew very well that Xian Yuyin’s uncle was not boasting at all when he made those threats. The capabilities of the Ancient Era’s Elves were truly that powerful. If Chu Feng were to offend the Ancient Era’s Elves, he would definitely be killed.</p>
 <p>‘Heh, are you scared now? Come, kill him. I shall see whether or not you dare to kill him. If you kill him, you’ll definitely die. If you don’t kill him, you’ll also die. This is what you get for offending the Ancient Era’s Elves,’ Seeing Chu Feng’s hesitation, many of the people from the Heavenly Law Palace started to sneer in their hearts.</p>
 <p>What Xian Yuyin’s uncle had said earlier suddenly made the Heavenly Law Palace’s crowd realize that Chu Feng had offended the Ancient Era’s Elves. No matter what, he would undoubtedly be killed. And they were very willing to see Chu Feng suffer this sort of fate.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, if you kneel to me, beg for forgiveness and apologize to my dead nephew, I will consider sparing your life,” Xian Yuyin’s uncle added. Evidently, he also thought that Chu Feng had grown afraid. Thus, when he said those words, he was no longer scared and actually filled with confidence.</p>
 <p>“Hahahaha…” At that moment, Chu Feng burst into loud laughter.</p>
 <p>“What are you laughing about?” Xian Yuyin’s uncle was completely confused by Chu Feng’s sudden laughter.</p>
 <p>Wasn’t Chu Feng afraid?</p>
 <p>Why would he be laughing like this at such a time?</p>
 <p>Exactly what was he thinking?</p>
 <p>“I am laughing at how truly ridiculous you are,” Chu Feng said.</p>
