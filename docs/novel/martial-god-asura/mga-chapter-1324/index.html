 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1324 - Why Aren’t You Scramming?</strong></p>
 <p>The beautiful Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest was composed of six bamboo forests. They were respectively the Colorful Bamboo Forest, the Golden Bamboo Forest, the Silver Bamboo Forest, the Iron Bamboo Forest, the Copper Bamboo Forest and the Discarded Bamboo Forest.</p>
 <p>As for the heads of the six bamboo forests, they were all extraordinary characters.</p>
 <p>Each and every one of them possessed enormous strength. In the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest, they were, other than the headmaster, the people with the most authority.</p>
 <p>However, there was a bamboo forest’s head that was an exception, the Discarded Bamboo Forest’s head.</p>
 <p>Not to mention that the other five bamboo forest’s heads looked down on the Discarded Bamboo Forest’s head, even the management elders, ordinary elders and disciples looked down on the Discarded Bamboo Forest’s head.</p>
 <p>To them, the Discarded Bamboo Forest was a gathering place for trash. The people there were inferior to even pigs and dogs. As for the head of the Discarded Bamboo Forest, he was the trash among trash.</p>
 <p>It was precisely because they had this sort of impression of the Discarded Bamboo Forest’s head that when the heads of the Golden, Silver, Copper and Iron Bamboo Forests found out that their elders and disciples were being detained by Hong Qiang, who had ordered their elders to have them come to redeem those individuals, they were both surprised and enraged.</p>
 <p>A trash among trash actually dared to provoke them. He was simply tired of living.</p>
 <p>This was what all four of these heads thought.</p>
 <p>Thus, the four of them did not hesitate. Once they learned of what had happened, they immediately rushed to the Discarded Bamboo Forest to obtain justice for their elders and disciples and teach Hong Qiang a lesson as to how to behave himself.</p>
 <p>As for the head of the Colorful Bamboo Forest, he was even more arrogant. He felt it to be beneath himself to teach Hong Qiang a lesson, and casually dispatched three management elders to the Discarded Bamboo Forest as his delegates.</p>
 <p>“This…”</p>
 <p>However, even though they were very arrogant and aggressive, when they arrived at the Discarded Bamboo Forest and saw what had happened there, even they, some of the most powerful existences in the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest, were stunned.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Hong Qiang and Chu Feng were standing in the sky. Beneath them was a densely packed crowd of people.</p>
 <p>There were people from the Iron Bamboo Forest, the Copper Bamboo Forest, the Silver Bamboo Forest, the Golden Bamboo Forest and even the Colorful Bamboo Forest among these people.</p>
 <p>However, at this moment, regardless of where these people were from and what sort of status they possessed, they were all kneeling on the ground with enormous fear across their faces, as if they had committed some sort of gargantuan crime.</p>
 <p>Upon closer inspection, there was actually a person lying unconscious among the group of people kneeling on the ground. It was an old man, who was lying in a pool of blood. Upon even closer inspection, the four heads were unable to help themselves from sucking in a mouthful of cold air.</p>
 <p>That was because they managed to recognize who that person was. He was one of the management elders of the Colorful Bamboo Forest, Jiang Chenshan.</p>
 <p>“Jiang Chenshan was actually really defeated? That Hong Qiang is actually that powerful?”</p>
 <p>As matters stood, the four heads from the Golden, Silver, Copper and Iron Bamboo Forests were all stupefied.</p>
 <p>They knew best what sort of character that Jiang Chenshan was. Although he was only a management elder of the Colorful Bamboo Forest, his strength surpassed the heads of the Iron Bamboo Forest and the Copper Bamboo Forest.</p>
 <p>In fact, he was even stronger than the Silver Bamboo Forest’s head, and only the Golden Bamboo Forest’s head was able to fight him equally.</p>
 <p>Yet now, Jiang Chenshan had been defeated so miserably. Thus, how could the four heads from the Golden, Silver, Copper and Iron Bamboo Forests possibly dare to challenge Hong Qiang anymore?</p>
 <p>As matters stood, they all realized that this Hong Qiang, the head of the Discarded Bamboo Forest, that had not bothered with anything in the past, was actually an unfathomable expert.</p>
 <p>“Hong Qiang, you are truly daring. For no reason or cause, you actually have the nerve to injure our Colorful Bamboo Forest’s Elder Jiang. Have you become tired of living?”</p>
 <p>However, at this time when the four heads did not dare to say anything, the three management elders from the Colorful Bamboo Forest suddenly snarled in rage at Hong Qiang.</p>
 <p>Although the three of them were only management elders, their strength was extremely powerful. They were even more powerful than the four heads of the other four bamboo forests.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, their forest, the Colorful Bamboo Forest, was the core of the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest. Thus, they were extremely arrogant, and had simply never placed the other bamboo forests in their eyes.</p>
 <p>Thus, while the other four heads had decided to keep their pent-up grievances in their hearts and not say anything, the elders from the Colorful Bamboo Forest were unwilling to do so.</p>
 <p>“Boom.” However, right at this moment, Hong Qiang’s eyes flashed, and a ferocious oppressive might swept forth from his body.</p>
 <p>Everything happened too quickly. Before anyone could react, those three Colorful Bamboo Forest’s management elders all emitted ‘puu’ sounds and vomited mouthfuls of blood. Then, like kites that had had their strings broken, they fell from the sky and crashed into the ground.</p>
 <p>“As mere management elders, you all actually dare to speak to me in such a manner?” Hong Qiang said coldly.</p>
 <p>“Huuu~~~” When they saw this scene, the four heads from the Golden, Silver, Copper and Iron Bamboo Forests once again sucked in a mouthful of cold air.</p>
 <p>If they had still held some doubts as to Hong Qiang’s strength earlier, then they now firmly believed that he was extremely powerful.</p>
 <p>They knew that they were no match for Hong Qiang. This head of the Discarded Bamboo Forest was truly a hidden expert.</p>
 <p>Thus, at this moment, none of them dared to be careless, none of them dared to provoke Hong Qiang. Most importantly, none of them dared to even be disrespectful toward Hong Qiang.</p>
 <p>With smiles across their faces and very amiable tones, they turned to Hong Qiang and asked, “Brother Hong Qiang, what has happened here, for you to call us over?”</p>
 <p>“It’s nothing major. I merely had something that I wished to inform you all of,” Hong Qiang said.</p>
 <p>“Brother Hong Qiang, we are brothers, there is no need for you to regard us as outsiders. If you wish to tell us something, please go ahead. If there’s anything that we can help with, we will definitely help,” The four heads said in unison.</p>
 <p>“Inform your elders and disciples that my Discarded Bamboo Forest is not a place where they can come and go as they please.”</p>
 <p>“In the future, if anyone other than my Discarded Bamboo Forest’s disciples dare to take half a step into my Discarded Bamboo Forest, they will not be met with a simple punishment of kneeling,” Hong Qiang spoke with a very calm tone. However, there was a great deal of killing intent hidden within his voice.</p>
 <p>“That’s only natural, of course,” Those four heads repeatedly nodded their heads with smiles on their faces. Not a single one of them dared to refuse.</p>
 <p>“Other than the people from the Colorful Bamboo Forest and my Discarded Bamboo Forest’s disciples, the rest of you, scram,” Hong Qiang waved his sleeve and coldly said those words. Those words were not only meant toward the elders and disciples, it appeared that he was also telling the four heads to scram.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, the four heads turned green in the face. However, they did not dare to say anything about it.</p>
 <p>Instead, they turned to their elders and disciples and angrily shouted, “Did you not hear what Lord Head Hong Qiang just said? Why aren’t you scramming?”</p>
 <p>In an instant, people began to soar into the sky. Regardless of whether they were elders or disciples, they all began to run away with great haste.</p>
 <p>“Brother Hong, if there’s nothing more you need from us, we’ll take our leave too.”</p>
 <p>After their elders and disciples had all left, the four heads modestly bid their farewells to Hong Qiang before leaving in a hurry.</p>
 <p>At this time, other than the people from the Discarded Bamboo Forest, only the elders and disciples from the Colorful Bamboo Forest remained.</p>
 <p>Merely, compared to the disciples from the Discarded Bamboo Forest, the people from the Colorful Bamboo Forest were all kneeling.</p>
 <p>“Since your head is unwilling to come and bring you all to leave, then you can continue to kneel here until he comes around,” Hong Qiang said to the people from the Colorful Bamboo Forest.</p>
 <p>After hearing those words, the people from the Colorful Bamboo Forest truly felt like crying. However, other than kneeling, what else could they possibly do? The only thing that they could do was silently kneel.</p>
 <p>“Wooooaaaahhhh~~~~~~~~~”</p>
 <p>“Lord Head, you are truly amazing. I never imagined that you were such an unfathomable expert. Even the heads of the Golden, Silver, Copper and Iron Bamboo Forests were afraid of you.”</p>
 <p>“Haha, this is great. I shall see who would dare to bully us again.”</p>
 <p>At this time, senior brother Shao and the other Discarded Bamboo Forest’s disciples began to cheer. They were extremely excited.</p>
 <p>Before today, they would never have thought that their Discarded Bamboo Forest’s head was this powerful.</p>
 <p>However, they now knew. From today on, the Discarded Bamboo Forest’s name would be spread through the entire Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest, and everyone would know how powerful their Discarded Bamboo Forest’s head was.</p>
 <p>From today on, no one would dare to look down on their Discarded Bamboo Forest, no one would dare to come and behave atrociously in the Discarded Bamboo Forest.</p>
 <p>It was so much so that there would be countless genius-level disciples who would scramble to join the Discarded Bamboo Forest to become the disciples of Lord Hong Qiang.</p>
 <p>The Discarded Bamboo Forest would no longer be the gathering place for trash in the Fallen Leaves Bamboo Forest. It would receive an unprecedented flourishing period. It would undoubtedly surpass the Golden, Silver, Copper and Iron Bamboo Forests. It would even be able to become an enormously strong power comparable to the Colorful Bamboo Forest.</p>
 <p>They, the trash who had been humiliated by others their entire lives, would be able to turn a new leaf and become senior brothers in the Discarded Bamboo Forest. No one would dare to disrespect them anymore.</p>
 <p>However, right at this moment, Hong Qiang looked to the group of disciples from the Discarded Bamboo Forest led by senior brother Shao. With an ice-cold expression, he said, “Why aren’t you all scramming?”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, senior brother Shao and the other Discarded Bamboo Forest’s disciples who had earlier been endlessly excited and wild with joy were all stunned.</p>
