 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1149 - Encountering A Malignant Star[1. Someone who brings about disaster/calamity.]</strong></p>
 <p>“A hundred thousand keys?” Hearing those words, Bai Ruochen was greatly shocked.</p>
 <p>Without mentioning the number of a hundred thousand, they did not even know where to find the keys in the first place. Not knowing where to find them plus a large quantity, this was truly an impossible thing to accomplish.</p>
 <p>“The Ascension Sect’s ancestor is truly vile. Isn’t this clearly to make things difficult for us, his descendants?”</p>
 <p>“If he wanted to leave something for us, couldn’t he have just done it directly? Why must he go through such a long circle to make things difficult for us?” At this moment, Bai Ruochen who had always been calm began to complain.</p>
 <p>“Calm down. While it is true that a hundred thousand keys is quite a large amount, there is another benefit to gathering these keys,” Chu Feng said with a calm expression.</p>
 <p>“Another benefit? Chu Feng, what do you mean by that?” asked Bai Ruochen.</p>
 <p>“Lil Sis Ruochen, look carefully at these key holes. Don’t they appear to be very compatible to these?” As Chu Feng said those words, he took out an Firmament Medicinal Herb. In the center of the Firmament Medicinal Herb was a single seed. As for the seed, it was a match for the holes on the gate.</p>
 <p>“So it’s actually the Firmament Medicinal Herb’s seed?” Bai Ruochen finally managed to react. However, she still sighed. “Even if this is the case, we’d need a total of a hundred thousand seeds. This is truly an extremely large quantity. Even if we were able to gather them, we would have to spend several days to do so.”</p>
 <p>“There’s nothing we can do about that. If we want to obtain the treasures left behind by your Ascension Sect’s ancestor, we can only gather the Firmament Medicinal Herbs. Either way, I want to stay here and gather them, as I am an impatient person. If there are treasures, I would rather enjoy the feeling of having them with me. Otherwise, I will always worry about them.”</p>
 <p>“What are your plans?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“What else can I do? We’ll do according to what you suggested. Keep my communication talisman on you. When you finish gathering fifty thousand Firmament Medicinal Herbs, contact me.” Bai Ruochen threw a communication talisman to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Very well.” Chu Feng put the communication talisman away, and then created a concealing spirit formation to hide the gate.</p>
 <p>After that, the two of them began to operate separately, and wholeheartedly started to gather Firmament Medicinal Herbs.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng still underestimated how difficult it was to gather Firmament Medicinal Herbs. After three entire days had passed, he had only managed to gather over three thousand Firmament Medicinal Herbs.</p>
 <p>Although this speed was extremely frightening when compared to the speed at which others were harvesting Firmament Medicinal Herbs, for Chu Feng, who needed to gather a hundred thousand Firmament Medicinal Herb seeds, it was truly too slow.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, this Firmament Medicine Garden was a very vast place. Otherwise, Chu Feng would truly worry about whether he might actually be able to gather a hundred thousand Firmament Medicinal Herb seeds.</p>
 <p>“Speak! If you still don’t speak, I’ll beat you to death.”</p>
 <p>“Senior brothers, I truly do not know where the Firmament Medicinal Herbs are located. Even if you all were to beat me to death, I would still not be able to tell you where to find them.”</p>
 <p>“Nonsense, you’re a member in charge of watching this garden, and have stayed in this garden all year round, how could you not know where the Firmament Medicinal Herbs are?”</p>
 <p>“I truly do not know, I truly do not know. Please, please let me go.”</p>
 <p>“F*ck, f*cking servant girl, we tried to let you off easily, yet you still refuse to do as we say. Let me see how you continue to refuse to talk…”</p>
 <p>“Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow…”</p>
 <p>“Ahhh~~~~”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Chu Feng was wholeheartedly gathering medicinal herbs when he suddenly heard the sound of fighting from afar. Originally, Chu Feng did not plan to bother with interfering in other people’s business. However, after he heard the conversation between them, Chu Feng was unable to sit still anymore.</p>
 <p>That was because this was not a battle between disciples. Instead, it was the core disciples of the Cyanwood Mountain bullying someone else, an Firmament Medicine Garden’s garden watcher.</p>
 <p>What were the garden watchers? They were people with extremely low statuses, not much different from servants. Logically, even if a disciple was to beat up a garden watcher, they would not be punished. However, Chu Feng was unable to watch what was going on; he was unable to watch as these people bullied the weak.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng hurriedly rushed toward the source of the sound. After he passed through a forest, sure enough, he discovered five people; four men and a woman.</p>
 <p>The four men were all core disciples. All of them possessed a quite decent cultivation. However, they were most definitely not exceptionally powerful disciples either, being only rank nine Martial Lords.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, their ages were not very old and they did not have any armband signifying their belonging to a branch power organization on their arms. From this, Chu Feng suspected that they were most likely new disciples that just joined several days ago like himself.</p>
 <p>As for that woman, she was actually a young girl. She was wearing an ordinary-looking outfit and her appearance was also very ordinary. However, her skin was smooth and glossy like jade; it was very exquisite-looking.</p>
 <p>However, at this very moment, this girl was kneeling on the ground. Furthermore, on her face that should be smooth and glossy like the rest of her skin were two purplish handprints. There was even blood on her face; it was coming out from the wounds on her face unceasingly. They were flowing down her face alongside the tears coming out of her eyes. It was a very miserable and pitiful appearance.</p>
 <p>However, even though this was the case, that man standing before this girl did not cease his attacks. Instead, with one hand, he grabbed onto the girl’s hair and continued to slap the girl’s face with his other hand.</p>
 <p>“Stop.” When he saw this scene, Chu Feng immediately shouted.</p>
 <p>When the four men heard Chu Feng’s voice, they immediately turned toward him. Originally, they had expressions of shame on their faces. After all, what they were doing was not something that one could be proud of.</p>
 <p>However, when they saw how young Chu Feng was, they displayed disdainful smiles on their faces. One man said. “And here I was wondering who it was that had come here. So it’s actually just a brat.”</p>
 <p>“Reckless brat, you actually dare to meddle in our business. Immediately kneel onto the ground and admit your mistake by kowtowing to us. With that, we shall spare your life. Otherwise, you’ll be taught a lesson.” The man that had been beating the girl began to walk toward Chu Feng with large strides. He was actually planning to teach Chu Feng a lesson.</p>
 <p>“Woosh.” Right at this moment, Chu Feng suddenly extended his palm. A frantic suction power surged forth from his palm and directly sucked that man into it. Using his palm, Chu Feng grabbed onto that man’s throat.</p>
 <p>At the same time, layers upon layers of a rank one Martial King’s oppressive might began to sweep through the surrounding like a hurricane. Not only did it caused the ground to tremble, the surrounding trees even began to sway with great force. As for the grasses, they were scattered by Chu Feng’s oppressive might.</p>
 <p>“Wuuu~~~” With his throat seized by Chu Feng, that man immediately began to display a painful expression. As for the other three men, their expressions changed greatly. They were so scared that they started to shiver.</p>
 <p>“You all, as disciples of the Cyanwood Mountain, actually bullied the weak in such a manner. In order to obtain Firmament Medicinal Herbs, you have all decided to do this sort of despicable thing like beating up a garden watcher. Tell me, if I was to inform a Punishment Elder of this matter, what sort of punishment would they give you?”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s gaze was like lightning. He looked to the man that was being held by the throat. With merely a movement of his hand, he would be able to turn these disciples into dust.</p>
 <p>“Senior brother, please spare our lives. Senior brother, please spare our lives. We were confused, it is us who are confused. Senior brother, please give us another opportunity. Please do not inform a Punishment Elder of this matter.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, the three men finally realized the severity of the matter. With a ‘putong’ sound, they knelt onto the ground and began to kowtow to Chu Feng as they admitted their mistakes.</p>
 <p>“Humph.” Seeing their actions, Chu Feng snorted coldly. Then, with a wave of his hand, he ruthlessly threw the man that he was grabbing. The power of his throw was so powerful that it directly smashed the other three men onto the ground, leaving them in a miserable state.</p>
 <p>“I can let you all go. However, you must slap yourselves until I’m satisfied.” Chu Feng said those words coldly. There was not the slightest trace of emotion within his words.</p>
 <p>Once Chu Feng said those words, the four men were stunned. After they exchanged glances with one another, a determined expression emerged in their eyes. They first knelt in an orderly row, then turned their faces toward Chu Feng and began to use their hands to ruthlessly slap themselves.</p>
 <p>“Pow, pow, pow, pow…” In an instant, sharp and clear slaps exploded like firecrackers. One heavy slap after another was landing on their faces without any interruption.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, as they slapped their faces, they were also admitting their wrongdoings to Chu Feng. From this, one could tell that they truly feared Chu Feng. After all, this was a place where one’s strength determined their status. Earlier, they experienced Chu Feng’s strength for themselves; it was a strength that was out of reach for them.</p>
 <p>Moreover, they were truly in the wrong. If Chu Feng was to really report this matter to a Punishment Elder, they would likely receive an even more tragic punishment, and might even be driven out of the Cyanwood Mountain.[1.pelicanv: wasn't there something earlier that was like "even if they killed her it wouldn't be that big of a deal?" YWL: I think it might be because they were trying to extort Firmament Medicinal Herbs, a shameless behavior unworthy of disciples of the Cyanwood Mountain.]</p>
 <p>Compared to that, slapping themselves was nothing major. Even if they were to slap their faces open with wounds, they would be willing to do that. If they want to blame someone, then they could only blame themselves for being unlucky and encountering a malignant star like Chu Feng.</p>
