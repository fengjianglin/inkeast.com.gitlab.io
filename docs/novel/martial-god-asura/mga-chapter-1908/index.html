 <p><strong> Chapter 1908 - From The Other World</strong></p>
 <p>“Why?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“That’s because from that day on, my idol had changed to Qing Xuantian,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>“This…” Chu Feng felt very surprised. He did not expect that the Ancient Era’s Elves’ King, the grand number one expert in the Holy Land of Martialism, would actually think of Qing Xuantian, a human, as his idol.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng was able to imagine how world-shakingly powerful Qing Xuantian was back then. Else, how could he have possibly subdued the current Elf King?</p>
 <p>“Qing Xuantian was an era’s Overlord. He is also the only true Overlord in my eyes.”</p>
 <p>“Not only did he save the Holy Land of Martialism, he also saved us Ancient Era’s Elves. He is everyone’s benefactor. Even the later generation should not forget about the enormous grace that he bestowed upon us.”</p>
 <p>“However, due to the fact that the Elf King back then had been defeated at Qing Xuantian’s hands, and our Ancient Era’s Elves would have to share our many Ancient Era’s Immortal Ponds with the various races as per the agreement made before the match, this caused many of our clansmen to feel deep enmity for Qing Xuantian.”</p>
 <p>“However, there was also a portion of us Ancient Era’s Elves that greatly approved of Qing Xuantian. The reason for that was because it was true that us Ancient Era’s Elves were extremely arrogant and excessive in many ways. What Qing Xuantian did was only fair.”</p>
 <p>“It was precisely because there were Ancient Era’s Elves among us that acknowledged Qing Xuantian, as well as those those that held a deep enmity against him, that led to our Ancient Era’s Elves from that time to have a friendly yet antagonistic relationship with him.”</p>
 <p>“And now, I see Qing Xuantian’s shadow on you, little friend Chu Feng. And I… do not wish to be have a relationship of being both friend and enemy with you. I wish to only be friend, and not an enemy, of little friend Chu Feng,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>“What Your Majesty said is precisely what this Chu Feng was thinking,” Chu Feng held up his wine cup to toast.</p>
 <p>The Elf King held up his own wine cup and toasted Chu Feng with a smile. The two men enjoyed a shared cup of wine. However, the Elf King was not satisfied. He said, “The cup’s too small. It’s not satisfying to drink out of it. Let’s change to a larger bowl.”</p>
 <p>In response, Chu Feng directly picked up the wine jug and said, “Let’s drink directly from this.”</p>
 <p>“Haha, what little friend Chu Feng says is correct. Good, let’s drink from the wine jugs,” The Elf King also picked up a wine jug.</p>
 <p>Even though martial cultivators were very powerful, it remained that wines were capable of intoxicating them. The reason for that was because the wines in the world of martial cultivation were special.</p>
 <p>However, the two men were both very capable of drinking. Over the course of the night, they drank several tens of jugs of wine and were still not intoxicated.</p>
 <p>There was no need to mention Chu Feng. He was immune to poisons. When even poisons were unable to cause him to pass out, how could wine possibly be able to?</p>
 <p>As for the Elf King, it didn’t seem like he possessed a special constitution. Rather, he simply possessed a superb capacity for liquor.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because he was different from Chu Feng. As Chu Feng was immune to poisons, he was not affected even after drinking all that wine. As for the Elf King, although he was not drunk, his complexion turned red, and he became more talkative. It was clear that he had been affected by the alcohol.</p>
 <p>However, to Chu Feng, this was something good. The reason for that was because it would allow the Elf King to converse with him without any restrictions.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, as for the Outer World… I will not be able to reach there. However, I know that you will definitely go there one day. If you are able to go there, can you help me find a person?” The Elf King asked.</p>
 <p>“Find a person?” Chu Feng’s expression changed. Then, he asked, “Find who?”</p>
 <p>“Miaomiao’s mother,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>“Princess Miaomiao’s mother?” Chu Feng’s eyes shone upon hearing those words. He thought to himself that there must be a story behind this.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng did not continue to ask. Instead, he looked to the Elf King; he was waiting for the Elf King to explain things to him. Since the Elf King had already mentioned it, he would definitely tell Chu Feng the entire story.</p>
 <p>“Do you know why I am certain that there are martial cultivators in the Outer World? That’s because Miaomiao’s mother is from the Outer World,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>“Princess Miaomiao and Princess Lingyue are not born of the same mother?” Chu Feng asked in a surprised manner.</p>
 <p>“That is what everyone believes. However, that is actually not the case. As for this secret, it is something that only I and Lingyue’s mother know about. And now, you know about it too,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng was unable to contain himself and asked, “Your Majesty, exactly what is going on?” He had to ask the Elf King. After all, the Outer World was the place where his future expedition would be.</p>
 <p>The Elf King did not try to conceal anything, and began to narrate to Chu Feng what had happened back then.</p>
 <p>It turned out that, back then, Princess Lingyue’s mother was pregnant with the Elf King’s child. However, after she was pregnant with that child for only a month, her pregnancy became extremely unstable. It was very possible that she would have a miscarriage.</p>
 <p>At that time, the Elf Kingdom’s Grand Elders all advised the Elf King to let nature take its course. After all… if that child were to be born with such a weak body, they would not be able to become a capable person in the future. As such, it was better to let nature take its course.</p>
 <p>However, the Elf King was stubborn. He was determined to save his child.</p>
 <p>As such, he sought for several of the most powerful World Spiritists in the Holy Land of Martialism. He wanted their assistance in helping him save his child.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, for the sake of searching for a medicinal herb, he braved the dangers and charged into the Holy Land of Martialism’s number one forbidden area, the Realm of Gods.</p>
 <p>“Realm of Gods? Your Majesty has been to the Realm of Gods?” Chu Feng was very shocked.</p>
 <p>“Mn, I have indeed been there,” The Elf King nodded.</p>
 <p>“However, didn’t they say that the Realm of Gods was a place that one could not enter, that one would undoubtedly be killed should one enter, and that even if one were to live, one would not be able to live for more than a month? Could it be that the rumors were false?” Chu Feng asked. The reason he asked that was because the Realm of Gods was a place that he had always wanted to go. Yet, he had never had the opportunity to do so.</p>
 <p>“The rumors are true. Inside the Realm of Gods is a special sort of pathogen. If one is to be affected by it, they will definitely die. Furthermore, all those who enter the Realm of Gods will be affected by that pathogen.”</p>
 <p>“For this sort of pathogen, all those below the Martial Emperor level of cultivation will definitely be killed should they be affected by it. However, for Martial Emperors and above, there is a way to treat them. Of course, only Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists are capable of treating that pathogen,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>“So that’s the case. In that case, what happened afterward?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“I was unable to find the medicinal herb. However, I ran across the most unforgettable person in my entire life,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>“Was that Princess Miaomiao’s biological mother?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Mn,” The Elf King nodded. He said, “This matter is a bit complicated. As such, I will skip the details. In short, while she became pregnant with my child, she was unwilling to stay here. Thus, she used her abilities to transfer the child in her womb to my wife’s womb. Furthermore, it was also her who named that child. As for that child, she was Miaomiao.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng seemed to realize why Xian Miaomiao possessed such overwhelming talent. It turned out that she was also a child borne of someone from the Outer World too.</p>
 <p>“How did you know that she was from the Outer World?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“She was the one who said it. Furthermore, her strength was unimaginably powerful. When she wanted to leave, I was simply unable to stop her at all,” When mentioning this matter, the Elf King revealed a helpless expression.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng was surprised. When even the grand number one individual in the Holy Land of Martialism was feeling this powerless, it would appear that Xian Miaomiao’s mother was most definitely no ordinary person.</p>
 <p>Were the experts from the Outer World truly all that powerful? At that moment, Chu Feng started to increasingly look forward to the Outer World.</p>
 <p>“In short, Miaomiao does not belong here. She belongs to the Outer World. Furthermore, if my guess is correct, you should be the same. The reason for that is because the strength that you possess is also not something that belongs to the Holy Land of Martialism,” The Elf King said while looking at Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng smiled. He was hesitating as to whether or not to reveal his origin to the Elf King.</p>
 <p>Upon thinking about how the Elf King had mentioned such a secret to him, which meant that he trusted him enormously, Chu Feng determined that he would tell the Elf King his origin too.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, I believe that your origin is your secret. Thus, there is no need for you to tell me about it. After all, I am not curious about it. All I know is that you are not someone from this pond. Sooner or later, you will be flying to the Outer World. As for my Miaomiao, she is the same as you.”</p>
 <p>“Although I have never been to the Outer World, I am able to imagine how dangerous of a place it is. Thus, I hope that you will be able to look after Miaomiao on my behalf, and help her search for her mother after entering the Outer World with her,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>“Does Princess Miaomiao also not know about this matter?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“She still doesn’t know about it yet. However, she will sooner or later know about it,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>“In that case, do you know how to enter the Outer World?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
