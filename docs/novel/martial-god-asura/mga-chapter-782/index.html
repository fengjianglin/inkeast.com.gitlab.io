 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 782 -&nbsp;Overlords of Two Generations</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone, you’re being too polite. I understand that all of you only acted like you did because you cared about what the circumstances were.” Chu Feng gave quite a bit of face. They had already yielded to him, yet once again, he took another step back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This changed their perspectives of Chu Feng completely. From extreme annoyance, or even spite, they began having favourable impressions of him. Some of them were even extremely grateful towards Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother, are we going to make our move now?” Some people cast their gazes at Old Liu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No rush. Let us first join in the liveliness—this is a good show that should not be missed,” said Old Liu with a calm smile. A hint of expectation surged on his aged face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the people on the surface were still drowned within the excited cheers, because they knew the most exciting moment was soon to arrive—the battle between the disciples of the Three Protectors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, even though Xuan Xiaochao, Fu Fengming, and You Tonghan had opened the formation, they didn’t seem to be in any rush to fight. Instead, they appeared to be awaiting something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh*</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, countless people shot out of the crowds. At the same time, the distant air started to gradually squirm, and shortly after, golden warships appeared one after the other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were over a thousand people, all Martial Lords. They were organized, akin to an unstoppable army as they pressed towards Xuan Xiaochao and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heavens! Those are the people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone became dumbfounded when they saw such a scene. At present, the people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago no longer concealed their identities, and they all wore clothing that represented their Immortal Execution Archipelago. As a result, one could recognize them immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, judging by the demeanor of the Immortal Execution Archipelago, as long as one had a bit of brains, they could tell that they didn’t come with kind intentions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at who’s the leader! Isn’t that the young master of the Immortal Execution Archipelago, Murong Xun?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My gods, it truly is him! What is the number one genius of the Eastern Sea Region here for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could it be… Could it be that Murong Xun wants to prove that </span><i><span style>he’s</span></i><span style> the number one genius of the Immortal Execution Archipelago, so he’s come to challenge the disciples of the Three Protectors?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? If it truly is like that, then there will really be a good show coming up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they noticed Murong Xun, the vast range of people started getting excited again, because they predicted that a battle beyond their expectations yet still nonetheless entertaining was soon to appear. It was the true battle of geniuses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Murong Xun, this is the territory of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. What are you doing bringing your Immortal Execution Archipelago here?” said Xuan Xiaochao with great displeasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The territory of the Crippling Night Demon Sect? Where’s the sect? Moreover, all of the present Eastern Sea Region is the land of my Immortal Execution Archipelago,” said Murong Xun extremely domineeringly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Murong Xun, you can eat whatever you want to eat, but you may not say whatever you want to say. Do you truly think in the years my Crippling Night Demon Sect has been silent your Immortal Execution Archipelago is invincible in this world?” said You Tonghan displeasedly. As he spoke, cold glints emerged in his eyes, and killing intent shot out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. In my eyes, the Immortal Execution Archipelago is not invincible in this world yet. It is just invincible within the Eastern Sea Region,” Murong Xun said with extreme confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoh, invincible, huh? Since your Immortal Execution Archipelago is so powerful, why must it be so sneaky and hide here for so long, only appearing after we opened the Spirit Formation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>*whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh* Quickly after, countless black figures shot out from the vast ocean of people. They arrived in the air, and stood behind Fu Fengming and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they all arrived above, neatly standing behind the three geniuses, everyone could see they had more people than the Immortal Execution Archipelago—over two thousand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though they all wore black robes, when they took off their hoods—revealing strong and firm faces—the backs of their robes changed as well. A black-coloured incomplete moon appeared; they were clearly from the Crippling Night Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moreover, there was suddenly a person who took out a large banner. On that fluttering banner, there was similarly the symbol of the Crippling Night Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s the people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect! They’ve also sent so many experts over?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is happening? Could they have predicted the people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago would come here to stir up trouble?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the people from the Crippling Night Demon Sect appeared, the surrounding crowd were shocked again. They could be truly dumbfounded, because in comparison to the Immortal Execution Archipelago, the people of the Crippling Night Demon Sect had disappeared for many years. They were even recognized as&nbsp;legends, so there was more excitement for their appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One was the overlord of the current Eastern Sea Region, one was the overlord of the past Eastern Sea Region. At present, these overlords of two generations were facing each other with such might. It was most definitely an unexpected but wondrous show</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, the people from the crowd knew something was up, and they all knew what would probably occur soon. So, the vast number of people were migrating away into the distance, extremely afraid they would be affected by the battle, since, in the air, there were not only Martial Lords; the representatives of the two generations of overlords were also there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they did not go too far away, because they didn’t want to miss their clash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoh, not bad. You seemed to have expected it, so you made prior preparations.” Murong Xun was very calm. Even though the number of Crippling Night Demon Sect experts surpassed their own, he was still fearless. Instead, he was chatting with smiles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Intrusions are not tolerated in the land of the Crippling Night Demon Sect. Second-rate trash like your Immortal Execution Archipelago should not think you’re worthy to even take a crap here,” said Xuan Xiaochao fiercely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? If my Immortal Execution Archipelago is second-rate trash, then what are you? Have you forgotten your pitiful appearance when you were running away from me?” said Murong Xun with laughter—ridicule filled it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Xuan Xiaochao escaped from Murong Xun? When was that? Have they fought already? Was Murong Xun the superior one?” Everyone was shocked again when they heard those words. All of them guessed what exactly happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan Xiaochao’s complexion was not too great as he listened to the surrounding discussions. So, he coldly said, “Hmph. I had matters to attend to that day, so I didn’t want to waste time with you. Do you truly think I was afraid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Xuan Xiaochao spoke, he release his boundless aura. The colour of the sky changed immediately, as if it were evidence of his true power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And also at that moment, Murong Xun gradually walked forward in the air. Only when he was a thousand meters away from Xuan Xiaochao did he stop, extend his arm, and say with a smile, “No matter if you had reserved strength or not, I just want to tell you that I need but one hand to deal with someone like you.”</span></p>
