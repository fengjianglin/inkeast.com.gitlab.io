 <p><strong> Chapter 1907 - Angered To The State Of Vomiting Blood</strong></p>
 <p>“You, you, you!!!” At that moment, Xian Yuyin’s father was unable to even speak properly. He was truly about to be driven mad with rage.</p>
 <p>He truly never expected for the Avaricious Immortal to be this shameless. It was clearly he, the Avaricious Immortal, who had come to him. Yet, he now pushed all of the blame onto him.</p>
 <p>“Puuu~~~”</p>
 <p>Under the effects of his raging anger, Xian Yuyin’s father actually vomited a mouthful of blood. He was actually angered by the Avaricious Immortal to the state of vomiting blood.</p>
 <p>“Humph, you’re still pretending? You are truly a great actor. Although you might appear to be righteous, the person who’s actually the most treacherous is you,” However, not only was the Avaricious Immortal not affected by Xian Yuyin’s father vomiting blood, he even began to mock and ridicule him.</p>
 <p>“You, you, you! Avaricious, you damned despicable bastard!”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Xian Yuyin’s father was filled with regret. He regretted how foolish he was to be overwhelmed with emotion last night and actually give that jade pendant to the Avaricious Immortal.</p>
 <p>“I’ll kill you!” In anger, Xian Yuyin’s father actually shot out an explosive palm strike at the Avaricious Immortal. Immediately, overwhelming martial power surged toward the Avaricious Immortal.</p>
 <p>Seeing that the situation was bad, the Avaricious Immortal shouted, “Your Majesty, please save me!!!” He wanted to seek asylum from the Elf King.</p>
 <p>However, the Elf King ignored him completely. In fact, no one present bothered with him. They were all watching him with cold gazes.</p>
 <p>“Bang~~~”</p>
 <p>Thus, following a muffled explosion, the Avaricious Immortal turned into blood that sprinkled down. He had been killed by Xian Yuyin’s father’s palm strike.</p>
 <p>Not a single person present felt any pity for the Avaricious Immortal’s death. Instead, they all had relieved expressions on their faces. Someone like the Avaricious Immortal truly deserved to die, or he would only remain a scourge should he continue to live.</p>
 <p>‘Rank six Martial Emperor. Sure enough, I guessed correctly,’ At that moment, Chu Feng had discovered that Xian Yuyin’s father’s cultivation was that of a rank six Martial Emperor. He had the same cultivation as Nangong Longjian.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng was no longer the same person as he was before. Even when facing rank six Martial Emperors, he would not fear them. Even if he could not defeat them, he possessed the capability to fight against them. In short… it would not be that easy for rank six Martial Emperors to kill Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>That aside, Chu Feng felt that Xian Yuyin’s father might not necessarily have the intention to do anything to him. After all, he was currently powerless to defend himself.</p>
 <p>The Elf King turned to Xian Yuyin’s father and asked, “How are you to explain this matter?”</p>
 <p>“My explanation will be useless. This matter is indeed related to me. However, it is unrelated to Yuyin,” Xian Yuyin’s father actually admitted to it calmly.</p>
 <p>Actually, this was the best option that he could take. If he were to admit to his crime, he would, at the very most, be punished. The Elf Kingdom would not kill him for the sake of an outsider like Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, if he refused to admit his crime, then not only would he be mocked, looked down upon and pointed at by others, even his son Xian Yuyin would suffer the same fate.</p>
 <p>“You have truly disappointed me. Your position of Protector shall be handed to Xian Long. As for you… go and enter closed-door training to repent for your actions. You are not allowed to exit for the next hundred years,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>“......” Hearing those words, Xian Yuyin’s father was stunned. To speak of it pleasantly, it would be a hundred years of closed-door training. To speak of it unpleasantly, it would be a hundred years of house arrest.</p>
 <p>No one thought that the Elf King would give Xian Yuyin’s father such a severe punishment.</p>
 <p>When the punishment was declared by the Elf King, even Xian Miaomiao and Xian Lingyue were stunned.</p>
 <p>“Yes,” That said, Xian Yuyin’s father had no choice but to nod his head. Then he turned around and left.</p>
 <p>The Elf King was not worried about him escaping, because he knew that Xian Yuyin’s father did not have the courage to do so. Furthermore, for the sake of his son, he would not escape. As such, he had no choice but to comply with the punishment bestowed by the Elf King.</p>
 <p>…………</p>
 <p>After this matter ended, the Elf King felt guilty for having Chu Feng suffer repeatedly at the hands of their Ancient Era’s Elves after coming to the Elf Kingdom.</p>
 <p>Thus, he personally arranged a feast to entertain Chu Feng. Merely, there were no other people besides Chu Feng and the Elf King at this feast.</p>
 <p>“Your Majesty, might you be willing to tell me about the matters of the Ancient Era?” Chu Feng asked. Chu Feng yearned for that era, the golden age of martial cultivation. It was also the era that he was the most curious about.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, you are not the first one to ask me about the Ancient Era. Merely, I really cannot answer that question.”</p>
 <p>“The Ancient Era is truly too distant. Although our Ancient Era’s Elves have existed since the Ancient Era, we do not remember the things of the Ancient Era, nor do we possess any information regarding the Ancient Era,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>“So that’s the case. It would seem that the Ancient Era is truly a mystery,” Chu Feng sighed.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, it is a mystery. However, all mysteries will one day be unraveled,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>“Your Majesty, do you think all of the experts from the Ancient Era have truly died out?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Not necessarily,” The Elf King shook his head. He then said, “The path of martial cultivation is never-ending. Although we might seem to be able to call upon the wind and summon the rain here, whenever I look to the night sky, I will feel myself viewing the vast sky from the bottom of a well.”</p>
 <p>“The reason for that is because I know that there are more martial cultivation experts above that vast sky. Merely, they are experts that completely surpass our imagination.”</p>
 <p>“If they were to be described as gods, then we would merely be mortals in comparison.”</p>
 <p>“Think about it. When we mortals are able to live for ten thousand years through various means, it should not be impossible for gods to live for several tens or even hundreds of thousands of years,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>After hearing what the Elf King said, Chu Feng had a whole new level of respect for him. He was able to tell that the Elf King was truly a great visionary.</p>
 <p>“Your Majesty, could it be that you feel that there are more martial cultivation experts in the Outer World?” Chu Feng asked in a probing manner.</p>
 <p>“I don’t only feel that way. Rather, I am certain. Furthermore, there must be a lot. If the world we live in is the vast starry sky, then our Holy Land of Martialism’s place in this vast starry sky would be...”</p>
 <p>As he spoke those words, the Elf King suddenly extended his finger and placed it before Chu Feng. Chu Feng looked carefully at his finger, and discovered that there was a single speck of dust on it.</p>
 <p>“Dust?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. If we are to compare ourselves to the vast starry sky, our Holy Land of Martialism would only be a speck of dust,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>“Your Majesty is truly a person of great notions,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, did you know that I thought of a single person when I saw you,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>“Who?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Qing Xuantian,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>“Qing Xuantian?” Chu Feng was surprised.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, Qing Xuantian. I met him before when I was a child.”</p>
 <p>“At that time, I was only ten years old. Due to the fact that I possessed decent talent, I ended up learning martial cultivation sooner than the other children.”</p>
 <p>“At that time, I possessed boundless expectations for martial cultivation. Furthermore, the person that I admired the most was the Elf King from that time.”</p>
 <p>“He was the Elf King that was said to be the strongest Elf King in the history of our Ancient Era’s Elves,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>“Strongest?” Chu Feng was shocked.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, the strongest. However, your human race’s Qing Xuantian defeated my idol.”</p>
 <p>“He defeated the strongest Elf King in the history of our Ancient Era’s Elves.”</p>
 <p>“He defeated the person who was viewed to be an omnipotent god by us Ancient Era’s Elves,” The Elf King said.</p>
 <p>“At that time, practically all of our Ancient Era’s Elves crumbled from shock. It was as if we had been cast from the altar of gods to the world of mortals.”</p>
 <p>“It was as if we had lost all conviction in an instant, and entered a state of bewilderment.”</p>
 <p>“However, I was the only one that did not. Do you know why?” The Elf King asked Chu Feng.</p>
