 <p><strong> Chapter 2440 - This Is A Treasure Mountain</strong></p>
 <p>“Big brother, look at the situation. Please stop saying these sorts of things, okay?”</p>
 <p>Actually, Zhan Lingtong wanted to tell Chu Feng to stop boasting. He wanted to remind Chu Feng about the beating he had received yesterday.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he had grown silent after he finished saying what he wanted. No matter how worried Zhan Lingtong was, there was nothing he could do.</p>
 <p>Soon, several hundred Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clansmen arrived before Kong Lingtong’s line of sight.</p>
 <p>The person leading the group was actually that rank five Half Martial Ancestor from yesterday. Standing beside him was the monstrous beast that Chu Feng had scared away earlier.</p>
 <p>“Could he be the rebellious individual you spoke of?” After that rank five Half Martial Ancestor discovered that it was Chu Feng, he looked to his clansmen beside him with a furious expression on his face. He thought that he had been lied to.</p>
 <p>“Milord, it is indeed him. I do not know what happened to that guy. However, he actually managed to beat Yao Feng unconscious with a single attack,” The monstrous beast from earlier explained.</p>
 <p>After it was pointed out to him, that rank five Half Martial Ancestor discovered that there was indeed a fellow clansman that was unconscious and seriously injured deep in the cave where Chu Feng stood. After discovering that, his expression turned serious.</p>
 <p>“Brat, exactly what is your origin?” That rank five Half Martial Ancestor asked.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng did not answer him. He continued to sit there in a cross-legged manner with his eyes closed.</p>
 <p>“I am talking with you! Do you not hear me?!” The next moment, that Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan’s rank five Half Martial Ancestor revealed a voice many times more resounding than thunder.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the rocks of the mountain started to rumble, and space itself started to tremble.</p>
 <p>However, even with this being the case, Chu Feng was still paying no attention.</p>
 <p>Although Chu Feng was confident, Zhan Lingtong was deeply frightened.</p>
 <p>That monstrous beast had already unleashed his rank five Half Martial Ancestor-level oppressive might. Before a Martial Emperor like Zhan Lingtong, that was simply an existence akin to gods.</p>
 <p>And now, that rank five Half Martial Ancestor was enraged. Zhan Lingtong was afraid that if Chu Feng continued to play dumb, that rank five Half Martial Ancestor would directly kill them.</p>
 <p>Thus, he hurriedly said to Chu Feng, “Big brother, quickly, get up and say something. Just apologize to them.”</p>
 <p>After Zhan Lingtong finished saying those words, Chu Feng finally opened his eyes. Furthermore, he revealed a smile on his face.</p>
 <p>“Brother, don’t be afraid. I am here,” After Chu Feng finished saying those words, he stood up, ran his eyes toward the sky and said, “Not enough people.”</p>
 <p>“What did you say? Not enough people?” That rank five Half Martial Ancestor asked.</p>
 <p>“The people that beat me yesterday are not all here. Gather them all here for me. Else I’ll have you suffer the consequences,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“You damned trash, was the beating yesterday not enough for you? Now that you’ve recovered a bit from yesterday’s injuries, you’re immediately starting to play dumb with us again?” The monstrous beasts that had attacked Chu Feng yesterday were furious. They started to mock Chu Feng again.</p>
 <p>“Injury?” Chu Feng smiled lightly. Then, his injuries started to rapidly recover. In merely the blink of an eye, Chu Feng’s injuries all disappeared. There was not a single scar or bruise remaining on him.</p>
 <p>“That is merely a trick that I used. Did you all really think that you’d be able to injure me?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Don’t you bluff here!!!”</p>
 <p>“Today, I will whip you to death.”</p>
 <p>The monstrous beast that was scared away by Chu Feng earlier seemed to have grown confident because the rank five Half Martial Ancestor was beside him.</p>
 <p>He actually took out an Incomplete Ancestral Armament and rushed forth to attack Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, he had unleashed an Emperor Taboo Martial Skill from the get-go. Powerful martial power gathered, forming a pillar of flame as it shot toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Zhan Lingtong’s expression turned ashen. He felt that if that attack were to land, both he and Chu Feng would definitely be killed.</p>
 <p>“Humph, ignorant fool,” A cold light flashed in Chu Feng’s eyes. Then, he raised his arm and shot forth a palm strike.</p>
 <p>“Boom!” A loud explosion was heard as the flame pillar was shattered.</p>
 <p>“Wuuah~~~”</p>
 <p>At the same time, the monstrous beast that had attacked Chu Feng let out a scream and was knocked flying far away. He landed motionlessly on the ground. It was unknown as to whether he was still alive.</p>
 <p>“What audacity!!!”</p>
 <p>At this moment, that rank five Half Martial Ancestor let out a furious shout. Then, he flipped his hands and actually revealed two Incomplete Ancestral Armaments.</p>
 <p>At this moment, he had completely unleashed his rank five Half Martial Ancestor-level oppressive might.</p>
 <p>Black clouds began to surge behind him. Thunder was rumbling in the clouds. As his aura descended from the sky, Zhan Lingtong felt a chill covering his entire body, and he started to shiver violently.</p>
 <p>It was not only the might of a rank five Half Martial Ancestor. In addition to that, that rank five Half Martial Ancestor had also unleashed overwhelming killing intent.</p>
 <p>This monstrous beast was not only going to attack Chu Feng, he planned to kill Chu Feng and Zhan Lingtong too.</p>
 <p>However, right at this moment, Chu Feng shot forth another palm strike.</p>
 <p>“Wuuahh.”</p>
 <p>Following that, a scream was heard.</p>
 <p>That rank five Half Martial Ancestor from the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan was actually knocked flying far away after uttering a scream like the monstrous beast before him. Furthermore, he too grew motionless when he fell to the ground.</p>
 <p>Unlike the one before him, his life and death was certain. He had died.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had actually managed to kill this rank five Half Martial Ancestor with only a single palm strike.</p>
 <p>“This!!!”</p>
 <p>This time around, not to mention Zhan Lingtong, even the rest of the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clansmen were stunned.</p>
 <p>That was a rank five Half Martial Ancestor!!!</p>
 <p>“I originally did not want to kill. However, with how you all treat us humans, if I do not teach you all a lesson in blood today, I fear that you will not learn your lesson,” After Chu Feng finished saying those words, killing intent suddenly emerged in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing Chu Feng’s gaze that was filled with killing intent, the monstrous beasts in the sky all started to tremble with fear.</p>
 <p>At this moment, they finally realized that the human before them was not bluffing. He really did possess overwhelming power.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, he was very frightening!!!</p>
 <p>“Run!!!”</p>
 <p>Someone let out a shout to run. It was unknown who said it, but when that voice was heard, the monstrous beasts in the sky immediately turned around and began to flee in all directions.</p>
 <p>“Today, not a single one of the monstrous beast from the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan here will be able to escape!”</p>
 <p>As Chu Feng spoke, he raised his arm and spiraled it toward the sky.</p>
 <p>“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>The next moment, martial power surged forth. It turned into a tornado that engulfed the sky.</p>
 <p>Sand began flying as rocks were moved about; the sky and the earth had darkened.</p>
 <p>The fleeing monstrous beasts were all caught by the violent tornado. None of them were able to escape.</p>
 <p>As the tornado surged on, miserable screams could be heard.</p>
 <p>After that, Chu Feng soared into the sky and waved his sleeve. Immediately, many more tornados appeared in the vast mine. They completely rolled up all of the members of the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan.</p>
 <p>However, one thing was worthy of mentioning. That is, not a single human was caught in the tornados.</p>
 <p>“What is going on?”</p>
 <p>What was suddenly occurring astonished all of the miners. One by one, they stopped mining and turned to look at the sky.</p>
 <p>“Heavens! Who is that?!” Everyone saw Chu Feng. They were all bewildered.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because the sky was filled with chaos. Enormous tornadoes were like huge dragons wreaking havoc through the mine.</p>
 <p>Not only were the people from the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan screaming in the tornadoes, one could also see them spinning round and around, colliding with one another.</p>
 <p>To the people from the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Race, the scene before them was akin to the arrival of doomsday.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he was the only person standing in the sky.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, he was not someone from the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan. Rather, he was an ordinary human.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the miners subconsciously felt that the devastation those Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clansmen were undergoing must be related to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>As such, to the humans that were tormented by the Ancient Era’s Monstrous Clan, they felt as if they were seeing a god when they saw Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Never would I have expected that there’s actually such a treasure hidden here.”</p>
 <p>“How could this possibly be a mine? This is simply a treasure mountain!”</p>
 <p>“It would appear that this journey has not been made in vain.”</p>
 <p>“Even if I was beaten before, it was worth it.”</p>
 <p>At this moment when the miners were all looking to Chu Feng as if he was a god, Chu Feng’s eyes were running through the vast mine the entire time.</p>
 <p>This vast mine contained an extremely and even unimaginably dense amount of Natural Energies.</p>
 <p>The Natural Energies contained here were many times denser than all of the Natural Energies Chu Feng had refined throughout his life!!!</p>
