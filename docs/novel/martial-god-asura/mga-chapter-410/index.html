 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 410 - The Body of the Heaven Realm</strong></p>
 <p><span style>Song Qingfeng at that very instant was simply like a human-shaped weapon. Compared to the martial skills he used before, it was several times more terrifying. Even Chu Feng felt extremely huge pressure from his simple punch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when Chu Feng, who came to this place in order to challenge himself to see how his current battle power was, faced that situation, he would naturally not shrink away. Similarly, he threw out a punch straight at Song Qingfeng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*boom* The two fists collided and instantly, a boom rang out, causing layers of ripples to sweep by.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this time, Chu Feng felt his feet slip and quickly after, he was pushed several steps back by a burst of force. At the same time, numbing feeling came from his left hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Observing in detail, tiny cracks had actually appeared on the faint green-coloured armor that covered his left hand. Although the cracks very quickly disappeared, Song Qingfeng’s punch still injured him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng, even if you have wings, today, you will die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>And just at that time, Bai Yunfei, Tang Yixiu, and Liu Xiaoyao also released the power of the manmade Elite Armaments. They did not use any martial skills, and with only their physical bodies, they attacked Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just on time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Feng coldly snorted and the Dragon Travelling Through Nine Heavens was already under his feet. With an azure flash, it disappeared, and when it reappeared, it was behind Bai Yunfei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eat my fist.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Feng threw out a punch and as Bai Yunfei was caught off guard, he was struck. However, it was exactly the same as when he punched Song Qingfeng’s body before. Chu Feng’s power was dissolved by a gentle power, and that power came from the radiant armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dammit. Attacking and defense in one. Is it possible that it’s a replica of the Armor of Thorns?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, Chu Feng lightly furrowed his brows because he had to admit that the so-called manmade Elite Armament that Tang Yixiu and the others used was indeed a bit troubling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he was taken aback, Chu Feng felt three auras nearing. Tang Yixiu and two others had already started to attack from behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Chu Feng was not too worried. He urged the azure dragon that he was stepping on forward and after dodging Tang Yixiu and the others’ attacks with strange speed, he changed his attacking style and suddenly threw out a palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*roar*</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, the roar of a fierce tiger that could shake the mountains and rivers rang out from Chu Feng’s palm. At the same time, a huge claw of a White Tiger came out and slammed towards Tang Yixiu and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crap.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique that was headed straight for them, even if they had Elite Armaments as protection, and even if their cultivations were in the Heaven realm, their faces still changed greatly because within the huge claw of the White Tiger, they felt extremely horrifying aura as if the one claw could shatter themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the three of them originally wanted to dodge but it was useless as the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique was too powerful. Not only did it have outstanding attacking might, its speed was even faster and it didn’t even give them a chance to escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*boom*</span></p>
 <p><span style>An explosion rang out, and the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique had already fiercely slammed the three of them into the ground. The savage power instantly caused a huge pit to appear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chu Feng, I will kill you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing his three brothers being struck by such a terrifying attack from Chu Feng, Bai Yunfei felt that Tang Yixiu and the two others didn’t have much luck. So, he was incomparably furious and he attacked Chu Feng once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph.” However, Chu Feng only coldly snorted. The azure dragon under him flashed, and very easily and casually, he dodged Bai Yunfei’s attack. After that, another White Tiger Slaughtering Technique directly slammed into Bai Yunfei, throwing him towards the deep pit where Liu Xiaoyao and the others were.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*boom* Another White Tiger Slaughtering Technique struck, so another layer of berserk ripple spread and the deep pit instantly increased quite a bit in size. The nearby palace buildings almost collapsed from such shocking power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even many observing people were blown dozens of meters back by the might, and some with weak strength even spat out blood from the shock and almost died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heavens! How is it possible for Chu Feng to use such terrifying might? Even four geniuses in the 1st level of the Heaven realm cannot fight against it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s too scary. The attacking might he used just now was even undoable by some Heaven realm experts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people who personally witnessed Chu Feng’s White Tiger Slaughtering Technique all had complicated emotions and they had tens of thousands of thoughts in their hearts. They were deeply stunned by Chu Feng’s strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, bursts of strange heat started to be given off from the deep pit. The hate permeated the deep pit and rose into the sky. There was no way of seeing the situation in the pit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In such circumstances, Chu Feng could only use his Spirit power to observe the state of the four people. However, when Chu Feng saw everything in the deep pit, he couldn’t help furrowing his brows and a hint of shock flashed through his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that time, four bodies suddenly shot out explosively from the deep pit. It was Tang Yixiu, Bai Yunfei, Liu Xiaoyao, and Song Qingfeng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, the four of them more or less suffered some light injuries on their bodies and faces. However, they were only light injuries. Chu Feng’s peerless attacking skill, the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique, had actually been unable to kill them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s this? Even my White Tiger Slaughtering Technique can’t harm them!” Chu Feng was very puzzled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s very normal. They are in the Heaven realm, and the degree of strength of their physical bodies are far from being comparable to the Profound realm. Although you can use the Dragon Travelling Through Nine Heavens to dodge their attacks, and use the Black Tortoise Armor Technique to block their attacks, it will be very hard for the offensive methods you grasp to kill them off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Besides, putting aside the strength of their physical bodies, the four of them even have a Elite Armament replicas right now. In this situation, no matter how much stronger your White Tiger Slaughtering Technique is, it will be very difficult to kill them. After all, you haven’t completely grasped the Secret Skill, the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique.” Just at that time, Eggy detailedly analyzed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. I do not believe that I cannot break open their imitative Elite Armaments nor be unable to destroy their Heaven realm bodies.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Chu Feng did not believe in that. He who had absolute confidence in his White Tiger Slaughtering Technique used it once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But this time, it was the same as last time. Tang Yixiu and the others did not dodge and they were struck head-on by Chu Feng’s White Tiger Slaughtering Technique. However, the result was the same as last time. The four of them only received some light injuries, and to Heaven realm cultivators, light injuries to that degree were simply not significant at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, what you just used should be the Secret Skill Vice-chief Jie talked about right? It is truly not simple.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But sadly, when this Secret Skill is in your hands, its might it should have can’t be displayed and it is simply a waste for it to be yours.” After successfully defending against Chu Feng’s attack, Song Qingfeng and the others had actually started to mock Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They already heard about Chu Feng from Jie Yan earlier and knew that Chu Feng grasped a Secret Skill heard in the legends. But at first, they only half believed and half doubted. After all, Secret Skills were truly only in legends, and in the current continent of the Nine Provinces, no one grasped it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But at that instant, they believed it because when Chu Feng used the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique, they really did feel unprecedented might.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That might didn’t come from Chu Feng. It came from the Secret Skill’s tiger’s claw. It was might that was unique to Secret Skills. That situation was something they never felt before, so they were sure that it was the legendary Secret Skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ho… The Heaven realm is truly a wonderful realm. It is indeed completely different from the Profound realm, Origin realm, and Spirit realm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Chu Feng smiled relievedly. After retrying the White Tiger Slaughtering Technique yet it was still useless, Chu Feng didn’t continue trying. He opened his right hand, and said to the four, “Since your bodies are so strong, why not try my Asura Ghost Axe?”</span></p>
