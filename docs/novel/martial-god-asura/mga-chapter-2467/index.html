 <p><strong> Chapter 2467 - The War Axe’s Command</strong></p>
 <p>“Young Hero Chu Feng is truly a genius,” Zhan Yuanmo’s eyes were filled with completely unconcealed admiration as he looked at Chu Feng, who stood beside him.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had already completely revealed how extraordinarily talented and strong he was in terms of martial cultivation. However, Zhan Yuanmo truly never expected that Chu Feng’s attainments in terms of world spirit techniques would also be so exceptional.</p>
 <p>“Grandfather, not only is my big brother Chu Feng an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, he also managed to ascend to the Martial Comprehension Ground’s third level,” Zhan Lingtong said.</p>
 <p>“The third level?!” What Zhan Lingtong said was once again enormous news that exploded in the hearts of the crowd.</p>
 <p>At that moment, none of the crowd were able to keep calm. Emotions and disbelief covered their faces.</p>
 <p>Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, and being able to ascend to the third level of the Martial Comprehension Ground. Both were things akin to legends to them.</p>
 <p>Apart from Zhan Haichuan, there had never been anyone who had ever ascended to the third level.</p>
 <p>Yet, Chu Feng had done so. Standing before them, Chu Feng was like a god.</p>
 <p>“Wuu~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment when the crowd were astonished by Chu Feng’s accomplishments, Zhan Yuanmo’s expression started to distort. Following that, he let out a painful sound.</p>
 <p>“Milord!!!” Upon seeing that, the Ancient Era’s War Clansmen hurriedly rushed toward Zhan Yuanmo.</p>
 <p>“Woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, Zhan Yuanmo suddenly raised his hand and said, “Don’t worry, I’m fine.”</p>
 <p>Then, Zhan Yuanmo raised his head and looked at the crowd with a complicated gaze. “No matter what, our Ancient Era’s War Clan was unrighteous and unjust to imprison Young Hero Chu Feng. While Young Hero Chu Feng can decide to not look into it, we cannot pretend as if nothing has happened.”</p>
 <p>“Senior, let’s just forget about this matter. After all, it is all thanks to that Martial Comprehension Ground that I managed to obtain my current level of cultivation,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Young Hero Chu Feng, please listen to me. No matter what, our Ancient Era’s War Clan owes you for this.”</p>
 <p>“Even if you truly do not plan to look further into it, our Ancient Era’s War Clan must still compensate you,” Zhan Yuanmo said.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, we must definitely compensate Young Hero Chu Feng. Lord Father, please decide,” The War Clan’s Clan Chief said.</p>
 <p>“No, I am unable to decide this matter,” Zhan Yuanmo shook his head.</p>
 <p>………...</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, the Ancient Era’s War Clansmen’s expressions all turned frozen. They were confused.</p>
 <p>Although Zhan Yuanmo was not their Clan Chief, he had always been the person with the greatest authority in their Ancient Era’s War Clan.</p>
 <p>If even he could not make the decision, who in the Ancient Era’s War Clan could possibly decide?</p>
 <p>“This matter must be personally decided by Lord War Axe,” Zhan Yuanmo said.</p>
 <p>“Lord War Axe? The Ancient Era’s War Axe?” Everyone came to a sudden realization.</p>
 <p>“Lord Father, what sort of instructions does Lord War Axe have?” The Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Clan Chief asked.</p>
 <p>“Lord War Axe is going to personally speak in regards to this matter,” Zhan Yuanmo said.</p>
 <p>“Personally speak?” The crowd were startled. As the Ancient Era’s War Axe was a secret skill, it would be capable of communicating with Zhan Yuanmo. However, it would likely be a very difficult task for it to personally speak.</p>
 <p>“Regarding this, I must have Young Hero Chu Feng help me. Once a secret skill enters one’s body, unless its user is to die, the secret skill will not be able to be removed from its user’s body. However, that’s with the exception of Immortal-cloak World Spiritists.”</p>
 <p>“Young Hero Chu Feng, since you are an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, please help me remove Lord War Axe from my body,” Zhan Yuanmo said to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Lord Father, if you truly want Lord War Axe to be removed from your body, it would be be fine to use the grand formation that our Ancestor left behind. There is simply no need for Young Hero Chu Feng to act,” The Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Clan Chief said.</p>
 <p>The reason he said that was because he was not very confident in Chu Feng. Even though Chu Feng was an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, it remained that a secret skill was no small matter. Compared to Chu Feng, he believed in the grand formation left behind by their Ancestor more.</p>
 <p>“Shut up. This matter must be done by Young Hero Chu Feng.”</p>
 <p>Zhan Yuanmo glared at his son. Then, he looked at Chu Feng and said, “Young Hero Chu Feng, you must definitely help me with it.”</p>
 <p>“I am indeed able to accomplish that. Merely… your body will be affected. You are already wounded. I’m afraid that it would not be suitable for you to undergo this now,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Young Hero Chu Feng, this is the desire of Lord War Axe. I cannot go against the desire of Lord War Axe. Please, I beg of you, help me with this,” As Zhan Yuanmo spoke, he actually knelt before Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Senior, don’t be like this,” Chu Feng hurriedly helped Zhan Yuanmo up. Then, in a very helpless manner, he said, “I will help you.”</p>
 <p>Then, Chu Feng began to set up a special formation to help Zhan Yuanmo remove the secret skill from his body.</p>
 <p>As Chu Feng was a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist now, his world spirit techniques were incomparably magnificent. As they were unleashed, they started illuminating heaven and earth.</p>
 <p>“Amazing. Is this the legendary Immortal-cloak World Spiritist? This is truly a well-deserved reputation.”</p>
 <p>The crowd were all stunned by Chu Feng’s exquisite world spirit techniques.</p>
 <p>“Look! Look at those veined patterns, they’re Snake Marks! Young Hero Chu Feng is not only an Immortal-cloak World Spiritist, he’s actually also a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist!”</p>
 <p>“Young Hero Chu Feng should only be in his early thirties, right? With how young he is, he should only have trained in martial cultivation and world spirit techniques for a very short period of time.”</p>
 <p>“This is truly too unimaginable. He is simply an otherworldly genius. This is what it means to be an otherworldly genius. Compared to him, we are truly insignificant.”</p>
 <p>There were experienced and knowledgeable individuals among the Ancient Era’s War Clan. After they recognized that Chu Feng was a Snake Mark Immortal-cloak World Spiritist and declared it, Chu Feng’s status in the hearts of the Ancient Era’s War Clansmen naturally increased by another tier.</p>
 <p>“I wonder, would Young Hero Chu Feng’s spirit formation be feasible?” At the same time they were astonished, the Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Clan Chief was also worried.</p>
 <p>After all, secret skills were different from ordinary martial skills. Secret skills possessed lives. After they recognized someone as their master, it should logically be impossible to remove them.</p>
 <p>The only alternative would be special formations or powerful abilities. However… regardless of what sort of ability, they must obtain the cooperation of the secret skill’s master.</p>
 <p>If the secret skill’s master did not want to release the secret skill, then regardless of what sort of method one might use, one would still not be able to forcibly extract the secret skill. The only exception would be… to kill the secret skill’s master.</p>
 <p>It would be just like when Chu Feng took care of the Monstrous Clan’s Clan Chief.</p>
 <p>However, by the same accord, even if the secret skill’s master was willing to cooperate, it would still be very dangerous to extract a secret skill.</p>
 <p>Originally, for the sake of making it more convenient for secret skills to be passed on, there was a grand formation left behind by their ancestor in the Ancient Era’s War Clan.</p>
 <p>That grand formation was no small matter at all. If one was willing, one would be able to extract the secret skill.</p>
 <p>The Ancient Era’s War Clan’s Clan Chief felt that while Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques were indeed extremely powerful, it would be more reliable for them to use the grand formation of their clan to extract the secret skill. After all, they had used that grand formation to extract the secret skill many times already.</p>
 <p>Thus, he was truly confused as to why his father insisted on having Chu Feng extract the secret skill.</p>
 <p>It was not that he did not trust Chu Feng. Rather, he was merely afraid that some sort of mishap might happen to his father.</p>
 <p>After all, he felt that, regardless of how powerful Chu Feng might be, he would not be as powerful as their ancestor, who founded the War Clan’s Ancient Domain.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, Chu Feng’s spirit formation began to shine much brighter.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Zhan Yuanmo appeared to have fused with that spirit formation.</p>
 <p>Soon, a special symbol appeared on Zhan Yuanmo’s forehead. That symbol blossomed with a special light.</p>
 <p>At the beginning, the light was only glimmering faintly. However, it soon became a dazzling light.</p>
 <p>The next moment, that golden light shone from Zhan Yuanmo’s forehead. Then, it turned into an enormous golden axe measuring hundreds of meters in length. That enormous axe was floating in the sky.</p>
 <p>That enormous axe appeared to be very ordinary-looking, and did not possess too many veined patterns. However, it emitted an overwhelming desire for battle and a threatening aura.</p>
 <p>“This is the Ancient Era’s War Axe?” At that moment, even Chu Feng’s gaze changed.</p>
 <p>Before them was the original form of the Ancient Era’s War Axe with its original power. It was extremely powerful.</p>
 <p>Although it was truly unable to compare to the Ancient Era’s War Sword that Chu Feng had encountered that day, it was many times more powerful than the Enemy Restraining Slash.</p>
 <p>While Chu Feng was able to easily subdue the Enemy Restraining Slash, he knew that he was still pathetically tiny before the Ancient Era’s War Axe.</p>
 <p>“Lord Father, are you alright?” At that moment, the War Clan’s Clan Chief immediately arrived before Zhan Yuanmo.</p>
 <p>As Zhan Yuanmo was, after all, his biological father, he was more concerned about his father’s well-being than anything else.</p>
 <p>“Rest assured, I am fine,” Zhan Yuanmo said with a smile. Furthermore, as he spoke, he took a glance at Chu Feng and said, “Young Hero Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques are even more exquisite than I imagined them to be.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, the War Clan’s Clan Chief looked to Chu Feng again. Admiration filled his eyes.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because he was astonished to discover that while his father was indeed suffering from the effect of the extraction of a secret skill, the effect was extremely weak, and seemed to be not much different from their ancestor’s grand formation.</p>
 <p>It was at that moment that he truly realized that Chu Feng’s world spirit techniques were truly grand.</p>
 <p>“Are you all going to listen to my order?”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, a voice filled with imposing might resonated through heaven and earth.</p>
 <p>It was the Ancient Era’s War Axe!!!</p>
