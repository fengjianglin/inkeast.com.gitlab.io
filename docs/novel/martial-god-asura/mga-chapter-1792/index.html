 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1792 - Heaven Taboo Martial Skill</strong></p>
 <p>As Baili Xinghe was also a Divine Body, he knew very well how powerful Divine Powers were. Divine Powers were stationed within one’s body. One could attempt to grasp them and control them. However, it was extremely difficult to grasp and control them.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because Divine Powers were boundless, and very difficult to measure. Regardless of how much of one’s Divine Power one was capable of grasping, as long as one possessed Divine Power within one’s body, its power would also be one’s own. Even if one failed to grasp the Divine Power, one’s body would still have to endure it.</p>
 <p>It was already the limit for a single person to be able to have a single Divine Power within their body. How could there possibly be two Divine Powers in a single body? How could one possibly endure them, master them?</p>
 <p>“Leng Yue, are you a monster? How can you be this powerful?” Baili Xinghe was filled with astonishment. The way he saw it, what Leng Yue had accomplished was not something that humans were capable of accomplishing.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng is done for. He’s most definitely done for. Regardless of how outstandingly talented he might be, he will still definitely be no match for that devil woman.”</p>
 <p>“His opponent is already no longer human. She’s a demon, an actual demon!!!” Baili Xinghe exclaimed in his heart.</p>
 <p>Even though Baili Xinghe had wanted Chu Feng to be killed the entire time, he was feeling sorry for Chu Feng at this moment. He had already seen Chu Feng’s talent for himself. He firmly believed that if Chu Feng were to continue to mature, he would very likely become the strongest among the younger generation.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, before Chu Feng had matured, he had encountered Leng Yue, a fellow demon-level character.</p>
 <p>Judging from the situation now, Leng Yue was even more demon-like than Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>In fact, it was true that Chu Feng was being suppressed by Leng Yue right now.</p>
 <p>Leng Yue’s cultivation and battle power were on par with Chu Feng. Their Incomplete Imperial Armaments were also of extremely high quality, and were also on par with one another.</p>
 <p>However, Leng Yue possessed two Divine Powers. Those two Divine Powers were also in perfect harmony with one another, increasing their overall strength by many times.</p>
 <p>In this sort of situation, even if Chu Feng were to summon his Water Immortal Profound Technique and Fire Immortal Profound Technique, he would not be able to contend against Leng Yue.</p>
 <p>“Leng Yue, since you’ve revealed your trump card, I’ll also let you experience my abilities.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng did not retreat. Instead, he proceeded onward. Then, four rays of lights shot forth explosively from his body.</p>
 <p>“Roar~~~~”</p>
 <p>In an instant, roars began to resonate throughout heaven and earth!!!</p>
 <p>Azure Dragon Dashing Technique.</p>
 <p>White Tiger Slaughtering Technique.</p>
 <p>Vermillion Bird Revival Technique.</p>
 <p>Black Tortoise Armor Technique.</p>
 <p>Like four Divine Beasts, in a vivid and lifelike manner, the Four Great Supreme Secret Techniques appeared around Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>With the appearance of the Four Great Supreme Secret Skills, Chu Feng’s might was no longer inferior to Leng Yue’s. Furthermore, he currently appeared even more imposing than Leng Yue.</p>
 <p>“This feeling, they’re supreme secret skills. Chu Feng… you actually possess four more supreme secret skills?!” At this moment, Leng Yue was extremely shocked. How precious were secret skills? Even though she possessed two Divine Powers, she did not possess a single secret skill.</p>
 <p>Yet not only did Chu Feng possess the Water Immortal Profound Technique and the Fire Immortal Profound Technique, he possessed four more secret skills in addition to them. Furthermore, judging from their appearances, those four secret skills were even stronger than the Water Immortal Profound Technique and the Fire Immortal Profound Technique.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng possessed a total of six secret skills. Yet she, Leng Yue, possessed none. How could she not be startled by this?</p>
 <p>Actually, Leng Yue’s startled reaction was already quite composed. When Chu Feng revealed his Four Great Supreme Secret Skills, Baili Xinghe, who was watching the battle, was completely stunned.</p>
 <p>No matter what, Baili Xinghe was the Weaponry Refinement Immortal’s personal disciple. He could be said to be someone who had experienced the wider world, the greater aspects of society. For him to be in such a stunned state, it was truly unbefitting of his status.</p>
 <p>However, this also signified how astonishing it was for Chu Feng to possess six secret skills.</p>
 <p>At this moment, by relying on the divine might of his Four Great Supreme Secret Skills, Chu Feng was able to block Leng Yue’s attacks. Once again, the two fighters reached a balance of power.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, interesting, truly interesting.”</p>
 <p>“They say that when the master of secret skills is alive, that secret skill will not die. That when the master of a secret skill is killed, the secret skill will still not die. However, should the master die, the secret skill will find a new master.”</p>
 <p>“Today, you actually dared to disgrace me like this. I’ll definitely kill you. Not only will I kill you, I’ll also dig out your eyes, plunder your weapons, seize your treasures and subdue your secret skills.”</p>
 <p>“All that you possess, all that you’ve acquired through meticulous effort, shall be mine! All of your previous efforts shall be devoted to me, Leng Yue!”</p>
 <p>Seeing Chu Feng’s Four Great Supreme Secret Skills, greed flashed through Leng Yue’s eyes. Following that, Leng Yue, who rarely smiled, actually started to smile. Merely, her current smile was extremely wicked.</p>
 <p>“Woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>Then, her hands began to rapidly change. Many complicated hand seals were being formed unceasingly. With speed akin to light, they flashed past.</p>
 <p>At the same time, a very powerful aura began to spread from Leng Yue’s body.</p>
 <p>“This aura,” Upon sensing Leng Yue’s aura, Chu Feng started to frown. The reason for that was because Leng Yue’s aura was simply too unusual.</p>
 <p>“That Leng Yue, what is she planning to do?”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng felt that the situation was bad. He immediately raised the Heavenly Immortal Sword and unleashed the Earthen Taboo: Firmament Slash.</p>
 <p>“Woosh, woosh, woosh, woosh~~~”</p>
 <p>In a moment of desperation, Chu Feng sent forth nine slashes in succession. He was no longer holding back.</p>
 <p>The nine slashes overlaid one another. Heaven and earth turned pitch black. Only the dazzling crimson slashes could be seen.</p>
 <p>At the moment when the nine slashes broke through the many walls formed by wind and lightning and approached leng Yue, Leng Yue suddenly revealed a cold smile on her face. “Heh, surprise attack? Unfortunately, you’re too late.”</p>
 <p>“Boom~~~”</p>
 <p>Right after she finished saying those words, Leng Yue abruptly raised her hand. Then, a golden ray of light suddenly appeared.</p>
 <p>That golden ray of light was extremely bright. It actually managed to forcibly intercept all nine of Chu Feng’s slashes.</p>
 <p>“That is?”</p>
 <p>That golden ray of light was truly too dazzling. Even Leng Yue’s body was covered by it. In this sort of situation, Chu Feng could only use his Heaven’s Eyes.</p>
 <p>Before his Heaven’s Eyes, everything was clear. Chu Feng was able to clearly see that there was a golden imprint seal floating above Leng Yue’s palm. That seal was square shaped and half the size of her palm. As for that overbearing golden ray of light, it was being emitted by that golden seal.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the space surrounding that golden seal was trembling nonstop. That sort of trembling did not resemble the trembling caused by oppressive might. Instead, it appeared more like the trembling from fear.</p>
 <p>That golden seal had actually managed to make space itself fear it!!!</p>
 <p>There was already no need to mention how powerful that golden seal was. However, most importantly, Chu Feng discovered that the golden seal was not a treasure, nor was it an Incomplete Imperial Armament. Rather, it was pure martial power.</p>
 <p>“Could it be?!” Upon seeing that golden seal, Chu Feng’s eyes shone, and his heart tightened.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, your martial skill is extremely powerful. It could be said to be the most powerful Earthen Taboo Martial Skill I’ve seen. However, unfortunately, regardless of how powerful your Earthen Taboo Martial Skill might be, it will not be able to injure me in the slightest. The reason for that is because what I have unleashed is a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill.”</p>
 <p>Leng Yue loudly spoke five words, “Heaven Taboo: Dao Light Seal!!!”</p>
 <p>“Heaven Taboo, sure enough, it’s a Heaven Taboo Martial Skill. The Heavenly Law Palace is truly worthy of being one of the Three Palaces. It actually possesses a Heaven Taboo for its disciples to cultivate,” Upon seeing that powerful golden seal in Leng Yue’s hand, a rare trace of admiration and envy shone through Chu Feng’s eyes.</p>
 <p>Heaven Taboo Martial Skills were martial skills akin to legends. Chu Feng had never been able to encounter one yet. Today, he had finally seen one. However, it was being used by his opponent. To Chu Feng, this was not a good news at all.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you should give up. If you are to kneel and beg for forgiveness now, I am willing to not dig out your eyes and leave you an intact corpse,” Leng Yue said.</p>
 <p>“What if I don’t?” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Humph, if you refuse, then I’ll make it so that you will not even know how you were killed,” Leng Yue said fiercely. At this moment, she spoke with absolute confidence. That said, she did possess the qualifications to act this confidently.</p>
 <p>It was true that Leng Yue was the strongest fellow member of the younger generation that Chu Feng had ever encountered.</p>
 <p>In fact, it could even be said that, facing such a Leng Yue, Chu Feng was currently at an absolute disadvantage.</p>
 <p>However, even with this being the case, Chu Feng was not panicking. Instead, he smiled lightly and said, “Give it a try then.”</p>
