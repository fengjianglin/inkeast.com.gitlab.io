 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1189 - Proving Oneself</strong></p>
 <p>“Heavens, is this Chu Feng unable to understand what others are saying? Even the elders have said that this Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond is different from before, that the current energy of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond is extraordinary ferocious. How could Chu Feng possibly dare to enter?”</p>
 <p>“No, it’s obvious that Chu Feng has already prepared something. Look at his confident expression. Clearly, he had already made preparations to use his own strength to prove everything since the beginning.”</p>
 <p>“This Chu Feng, he’s truly too amazing. Not to mention whether he might actually be able to trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle here, merely his courage is enough to show that he is destined to be someone great.”</p>
 <p>Once Chu Feng said those words, he immediately gave rise to an enormous ruckus. The crowd all began to argue among themselves, each with their own respective thoughts. Some felt that Chu Feng was too impulsive, while others felt that he possessed a great deal of courage.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, don’t enter it. Our Cyanwood Mountain’s Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond is different from the one that’s controlled by the Ancient Era’s Elves. The energy within this Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond is truly extremely ferocious. It is even said that the Ancient Era’s Immortal Ponds controlled by us humans are generally more berserk than ordinary Ancient Era’s Immortal Ponds.”</p>
 <p>“It is something that the Ancient Era’s Elves had done deliberately. They feared that the humans would be able to obtain too many benefits from the Ancient Era’s Immortal Ponds, and thus deliberately gave the ones with more ferocious energies to the humans to control.”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you must definitely not play around with your own life.” Compared to the others, Elder Xie and the others from the Ascension Sect began to secretly send voice transmissions to urge Chu Feng against it.</p>
 <p>As elders of this place, Elder Xie and the others knew about the situation here better than most. Not to mention now, even during the time when the Ancient Era’s Immortal Ponds were opened, the time when the energy of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond was weakest, the energy within this Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond would still be more ferocious and frightening than the one controlled by the Ancient Era’s Elves. The Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle in this Ancient Era’s Pond was truly not that easy to trigger.</p>
 <p>“Elders, thank you all for your concerns. However, as matter stands, I, Chu Feng, can no longer turn back.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, I, Chu Feng am a true gold that fears no fire. As I’ve been able to trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle once, I would be able to trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle twice.” With confidence, Chu Feng replied to those Ascension Sect elders that were urging him against his chosen voice of action.</p>
 <p>Then, Chu Feng turned to the Orion Monastery’s elders and said, “Elders, didn’t you all say that the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle here cannot be triggered? In that case, if I, Chu Feng, am to trigger it, would you all have anything else to say?”</p>
 <p>“This…” Hearing those words, the Orion Monastery’s elders did not know how to reply. They truly never imagined that Chu Feng would possess such courage, and that he would truly want to challenge the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.</p>
 <p>However, right at this moment, before the elders from the Orion Monastery could respond, Bai Ruochen suddenly shouted with a loud voice. “True gold fears no fire.[1.if you think about it, when refining metals in extreme temperatures, gold and other metals will collect into beads. Well, this is a chinese phrase that doesn’t really work ‘that’ well when you think about it chemically…] If it does, then it would definitely not be real gold. Chu Feng possesses the courage to challenge the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond, whereas Yuan Qing does not. Which among them is true and which is fake, who is right and who is wrong, is there even a need to ask?”</p>
 <p>“Everyone, what do you all think? Between this Chu Feng and Yuan Qing, who was the one that actually triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle?”</p>
 <p>“That’s right, true gold fears no fire. Chu Feng dares to challenge our Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond, whereas Yuan Qing doesn’t. This is sufficient for the truth to already be revealed. I firmly believe that Chu Feng is the one that triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle.”</p>
 <p>Once Bai Ruochen said those words, Wang Wei and the others also started to shout loudly. They wanted to obtain justice for Chu Feng. They truly wished that Chu Feng did not have to go through such danger in order to prove himself. At the same time, they also wished for the old men of the Orion Monastery to get killed.</p>
 <p>“The respective strengths of Chu Feng and Yuan Qing have already been displayed. Is there even a need to ask who between them is real and who is fake? As long as one has a brain, they should be able to guess it already.”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Chu Feng is the one that actually triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle and obtained the Commander Flag. The Orion Monastery’s Yuan Qing is nothing more than a despicable, shameless and vile individual.”</p>
 <p>It was not only Bai Ruochen and the others who were associated with Chu Feng that started to shout for his injustice. Many people who were unrelated to Chu Feng were unable to continue watching such injustice, adding to the endless pestering that the Orion Monastery’s elders felt. More and more people began to cry out for Chu Feng, and even started to shame Yuan Qing and the Orion Monastery.</p>
 <p>In this sort of situation, the pressure that the Orion Monastery’s elders felt became greater and greater. If it was before, they might’ve truly given up when faced with such enormous pressure.</p>
 <p>However, it was different now. They had already sworn oaths. If they were to acknowledge that it was Chu Feng that triggered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle, they would have to kill themselves on the spot.</p>
 <p>However, when faced with such enormous pressure, they had no choice but to compromise. Otherwise, even if they were to be able to force Chu Feng to kill himself, their disgrace would likely spread far and wide.</p>
 <p>Finally, the leader among the Orion Monastery’s elders spoke. “Chu Feng, if you’re truly able to trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle of the Cyanwood Mountain, then we will admit that what you’ve said is the truth. Without raising another objection, we will kill ourselves then and there.”</p>
 <p>“However, as what you’ve spoken are empty words that cannot be counted as the truth, you must trigger this place’s Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle in order for us to recognize you.”</p>
 <p>“Very well. You must honor those words.” Hearing those words, Chu Feng laughed in a complacent manner. At the same time, he turned and gave Bai Ruochen a gaze filled with gratitude.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng had already experienced how shameless these elders of the Orion Monastery were. If it weren’t for Bai Ruochen’s words that managed to get the crowd to speak for him, it was likely that even if Chu Feng proposed the triggering of this Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle to prove himself, the Orion Monastery’s elders would likely still disapprove of it.</p>
 <p>However, now there were no longer any misgivings. What Chu Feng needed to do was only a single thing…display his strength before the crowd. He had to prove himself with his own strength, and force the elders of the Orion Monastery to death with his strength.</p>
 <p>“Woosh.” Suddenly, Chu Feng’s body moved. He directly flew toward the entrance of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.</p>
 <p>There were elders from the Cyanwood Mountain guarding that location. If one wished to enter, they had to pay a certain amount of achievement points. Otherwise, the disciples were not allowed to enter the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond to train.</p>
 <p>Even though Chu Feng had only entered the Cyanwood Mountain not too long ago, he possessed quite a few achievement points due to gathering that many Firmament Medicinal Herbs during his mission. While the amount of achievement points that were required to enter the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond to train was rather numerous, it was not an issue at all to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>After paying the achievement points, Chu Feng finally entered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond’s boundary. At the same time, the elders present all began to enter the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond too. That was because the elders possessed a special privilege of being allowed to train in the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond, as well as the ability to enjoy many other of the Cyanwood Mountain’s cultivation resources without having to pay any achievement points.</p>
 <p>In fact, many disciples who were capable of paying the fee required to enter the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond also began to come pouring to the entrance. They all wished to see, for themselves and up close, whether or not Chu Feng was truly capable of triggering the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle.</p>
 <p>In an instant, practically everyone was pouring into the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. Only those disciples incapable of paying the achievement points stayed at the distance and repeatedly shook their heads as they watched the entrance of the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond became an unprecedented attraction. As for all this, it was all because of Chu Feng, this disciple whose fame had already spread throughout the entire Cyanwood Mountain not long after entering.</p>
 <p>In this sort of situation, the elders in charge of guarding the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond became extremely busy. All of the elders in charge of guarding the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond started to take on the mission of accepting the achievement points.</p>
 <p>“You are…”</p>
 <p>Right when they were busily receiving the achievement points, an elder’s expression suddenly changed greatly. That was because, at this moment, there were two people wearing conical bamboo hats in front of him. Those two people did not hand him any achievement points. Instead, the two of them respectively handed him a title plate apiece. As for those title plates, they were both management elder’s identity plates.</p>
 <p>As for these two individuals, they were naturally the management elders from the Weaponry Refinement Department and the Medicine Concocting Department. They did not wish to miss the show of Chu Feng triggering the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle. Yet, they could not just pass through the spirit formation guarding the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond without providing an explanation. Thus, they could only sneak in among the people entering through the entrance.</p>
 <p>“Hush~~” Seeing the shocked expression of this guarding elder, and how he was about to display a courteous gesture of kneeling to them, Elder Wei, who did not wish to have his identity revealed, immediately stopped him. Then, like a ghost, he entered the Ancient Era’s Immortal Pond. As for the Weaponry Refinement Department’s management elder, he also followed closely behind Elder Wei.</p>
 <p>As he saw the departing backs of those two management elders, that guard elder understood their intentions. However, once he recalled how noble their status was, he was unable to stop himself from gasping in surprise.</p>
 <p>“Even these two lords have moved, this boy by the name of Chu Feng is truly extraordinary.”</p>
 <p>“Could it be that he will truly be able to trigger the Ancient Era’s Immortal Needle here?”</p>
