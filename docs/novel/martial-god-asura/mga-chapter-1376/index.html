 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1376 - Could it be him?</strong></p>
 <p>“Senior Ma, it is not that I do not trust you.”</p>
 <p>“However, if you are unable to find that person, or you discover that the Sealing Glacier is no longer in his or her hands after finding that person, what do we do then?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>He was very worried. It was not unnecessary worry. As that person had been capable of stealing the Sealing Ancient Village’s Sealing Glacier without them noticing, it meant that that person possessed extraordinary strength. Even someone like Old Village Chief Ma might not necessarily be a match for that person.</p>
 <p>In short, since the Sealing Glacier had been lost, it would not be easy to recover.</p>
 <p>“The time limit shall be a year. If I am unable to return little friend Chu Feng’s innocence in a year, if I am unable to present you the Sealing Glacier within a year, then I, Ma, will offer my death as an apology to you. Before my death, I will publicly announce this matter,” Old Village Chief Ma vowed.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng’s heart trembled. No matter how he saw it, he did not think that Old Village Chief Ma was joking around. Old Village Chief Ma was serious in his death vow.</p>
 <p>“Senior Ma, are you certain that the trace of aura that you’ve gathered is the person that has stolen the Sealing Glacier?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“This formation is flawless. I have conducted my inspection through the use of this formation and gathered the trace of aura from that. Thus, I am certain that this aura is most definitely the aura of the person who stole the Sealing Glacier,” Old Village Chief Ma said with certainty.</p>
 <p>“In that case, how much of the aura do you require to gather in order to activate the tracking formation?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“To be honest, I have only gathered five percent of the aura required. I will still need to gather the other ninety-five percent in order to activate the tracking formation,” Old Village Chief Ma said helplessly.</p>
 <p>“Such an enormous amount is actually lacking?” After hearing those words, Chu Feng’s already frowning brows started to frown even more.</p>
 <p>Based on this, even if Old Village Chief Ma were to be able to find the person who had stolen the Sealing Glacier, it would require quite a bit of time. The one year time limit that he had given himself might not even be enough.</p>
 <p>After pondering for a moment, Chu Feng said, “Senior Ma, is it possible for you to allow me to examine the aura that you’ve gathered? Although it is unlikely, I might be able to help you a bit.”</p>
 <p>“Of course I can do it,” Old Village Chief Ma agreed to Chu Feng’s suggestion right away. As he spoke, he took out a jade bottle from his bosom. After he opened the bottle, a faint aura floated out from it. Like a little snake, it began to revolve around that jade bottle.</p>
 <p>At this time, Chu Feng closed his eyes. He released his spirit energy and began to sense that aura with his heart.</p>
 <p>He was planning to remember this aura in case he encountered it in the future. If he were to encounter it, he would be able to notify Old Village Chief Ma.</p>
 <p>It was as Chu Feng said, this sort of hope was extremely slim, unlikely to be of any help. However, apart from this, there was nothing else that Chu Feng could do.</p>
 <p>“This aura…” Suddenly, Chu Feng opened his closed eyes. At the same time, an expression of both shock and delight appeared on his face. He said, “Could it be him?”</p>
 <p>Seeing Chu Feng’s reaction, Old Village Chief Ma was shocked. Immediately afterward, as if he had grabbed onto hope, he hurriedly asked, “Little friend Chu Feng, can it be that you recognize the owner of this aura?”</p>
 <p>“I am indeed somewhat familiar with this aura. It resembles a person that I know. However, this aura is too weak. Therefore, I am unable to be completely certain as to whether or not it might be that person,” Chu Feng nodded. However, he did not give a clear answer.</p>
 <p>“So that’s the case,” Old Village Chief Ma was no fool. He was able to tell that Chu Feng had most likely thought of someone, and that person might be the culprit, the person who had stolen the Sealing Glacier. Merely, Chu Feng did not wish to tell him who that person was.</p>
 <p>Even though Old Village Chief Ma was eager to know who exactly the person was that Chu Feng was suspecting in his heart, he did not continue to ask Chu Feng about it.</p>
 <p>In fact, Chu Feng was indeed suspecting someone in his heart.</p>
 <p>As for this person, it was the culprit that had killed Sima Ying’s grandfather in the Cyanwood Domain, the greatest enemy to Sima Ying, the traitor of the World Spiritist Alliance, Han Helai.</p>
 <p>Even though Chu Feng had only been able to observe the grand battle between Han Helai, Sima Huolie and Elder Hong Mo, Chu Feng managed to clearly remember Han Helai’s aura in his heart, and was unable and unwilling to forget it.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the aura that Old Village Chief Ma allowed Chu Feng to examine was very similar to Han Helai’s aura.</p>
 <p>Merely, the amount of aura Old Village Chief Ma gathered was truly too little. Even Chu Feng did not dare to be completely certain that this aura was Han Helai’s.</p>
 <p>Thus, after considering the matter, Chu Feng did not inform Old Village Chief Ma of his suspicion.</p>
 <p>After all, Han Helai possessed a relatively special status. Furthermore, this man was extremely dangerous. If he were to inform Old Village Chief Ma who he suspected without being absolutely certain that it was him, it might instead create trouble.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Old Village Chief Ma asked, “Little friend Chu Feng, is the person that you’re suspecting right now a friend of yours?” He was very restless.</p>
 <p>However, this could not be blamed on him. After all, to him, this matter was extremely important. Ultimately, the item that had been lost was their Sealing Ancient Village’s treasure.</p>
 <p>“No, not a friend. Instead, he’s an enemy. However, this matter is no small matter at all. Therefore, unless I am absolutely certain, I cannot tell senior Ma who I suspect,” Chu Feng answered honestly.</p>
 <p>“As long as it’s not little friend Chu Feng’s friend, then this old man is relieved.”</p>
 <p>Old Village Chief Ma felt a bit more relaxed. He knew very well that he was currently on the same battlefront as Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>If that person was truly Chu Feng’s enemy, then even if Chu Feng were to not tell him who that person was right now, he would, sooner or later, tell him who that person was.</p>
 <p>However, if that person was instead Chu Feng’s friend, things might become a lot more troublesome.</p>
 <p>Thus, when he was certain that it was Chu Feng’s enemy and not a friend, he became a lot more relieved.</p>
 <p>“Senior Ma, if I am able to obtain the aura of that person that I suspect, might you be able to ascertain whether that person was the one who stole the Sealing Glacier?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Naturally. Our Sealing Ancient Village’s tracking formation is precisely there in order to prevent others from stealing our Sealing Glacier. As long as little friend Chu Feng is capable of gathering enough aura, I will be able to use the formation that my ancestor left to determine whether that person is the culprit who stole our Sealing Glacier,” Old Village Chief Ma said with confidence.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, could it be that you are able to obtain the aura of that person that you suspect?” Old Village Chief Ma asked in a probing manner. To him, this matter was extremely important.</p>
 <p>“I do not dare to guarantee. However, I can give it a try,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“In that case, what percentage of certainty do you have?” Old Village Chief Ma asked.</p>
 <p>“Fifty percent,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“If that’s the case, it would truly be great,” Hearing what Chu Feng said, Old Village Chief Ma was overjoyed. Even though his smile was not very distinct, it was the first time that Chu Feng had seen Old Village Chief Ma smiling this happily.</p>
 <p>However, this could not be blamed on Old Village Chief Ma. After all, it would be impossible for him to not be at least a little happy.</p>
 <p>Originally, he had only had a single method of finding the person who had stolen their Sealing Glacier. As for that method, it was to enter closed-door training and use all of his strength to activate the formation to gather the aura bit by bit. After that, he would have to use the tracking formation to search for the location of the thief.</p>
 <p>This sort of method was very taxing on one’s spirit power. Furthermore, it was very time-consuming. Even Old Village Chief Ma knew that this was not the best method. However, it was the only method that he had available to him.</p>
 <p>Yet, at this time, Chu Feng had given him hope. As such, how could he not be happy? Secretly delighted? Even if he wanted to not be happy, it would be extremely difficult.</p>
