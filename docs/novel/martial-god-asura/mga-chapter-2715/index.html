 <p><strong>Chapter 2715 - Battle Of World Spiritists</strong></p>
 <p>On the final day of the hunt, Chu Xianshuo finally entered the hunting ground.</p>
 <p>At that moment, an enormous spirit formation filled the entire sky outside of the hunting grounds’ entrance. It was circulating slowly.</p>
 <p>That spirit formation emitted a faint glimmer. The inside of the spirit formation was like a lake’s surface as it displayed a scene.</p>
 <p>The scene shown on that spirit formation was that of Chu Xianshuo. Not only was the spirit formation capable of capturing Chu Xianshuo, but it was also capable of observing the circumstances inside the hunting ground as per Chu Xianshuo’s movements.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the conversations of all the people that appeared in the spirit formation would be transmitted and heard by everyone present.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Right after Chu Xianshuo entered the hunting ground aggressively, he stopped.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were all gathered at the entrance of the hunting ground.</p>
 <p>“This… why would the Chu Heavenly Clan’s young masters and young ladies all be gathered there?”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, what are those things on their bodies?”</p>
 <p>Through the image displayed by the spirit formation, the people present were all able to see the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations. One by one, they revealed confused expressions.</p>
 <p>“Why are you all here?” Inside the hunting ground, Chu Xianshuo was even more confused.</p>
 <p>“Big brother Chu Xianshuo, you’ve finally come. We were waiting for you.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations all revealed a look of grievance. This was especially true for the women, who were even shedding silent tears.</p>
 <p>“It’s Chu Feng?” Chu Xianshuo had managed to guess that the reason the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were acting like this it was most definitely related to Chu Feng .</p>
 <p>“Yes, it’s that Chu Feng. That Chu Feng not only snatched away all of our World Spirit Bones, but he also restricted our world spirit techniques. Right now, we are akin to cripples, and unable to hunt in the hunting ground.”</p>
 <p>“Big brother Chu Xianshuo, you must uphold justice for us.”</p>
 <p>The Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations were all complaining to Chu Xianshuo at the same time.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Xianshuo was so furious that his face had turned deathly white. Even though he knew that his Chu Heavenly Clan’s brothers and sisters were bullied and humiliated by Chu Feng, he had never expected Chu Feng to be so excessive.</p>
 <p>At the moment when Chu Xianshuo was furious, the crowd outside the hunting ground burst into an uproar.</p>
 <p>“Heavens! He actually dared to do that sort of thing to the young masters and young ladies of the Chu Heavenly Clan. Exactly who is that person?”</p>
 <p>“He’s called Chu Feng. However, it’s clear that he’s not someone from the Chu Heavenly Clan. Exactly who is he?”</p>
 <p>The crowd were making all kinds of guesses in regards to Chu Feng’s background.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a roar sounded from the hunting ground. It was a roar of anger.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, just you wait! I, Chu Xianshuo, will definitely make you pay!”</p>
 <p>It was Chu Xianshuo who let out that roar. He was truly enraged by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>At that moment, killing intent was continuously being emitted from Chu Xianshuo. He was not only planning to take care of Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>He was planning to kill Chu Feng. He was planning to publicly execute him.</p>
 <p>“I have been waiting for you the entire time.”</p>
 <p>However, right after Chu Xianshuo’s declaration was made, Chu Feng’s voice was suddenly heard.</p>
 <p>At the moment when Chu Feng’s voice was heard, Chu Feng also appeared from nearby. Soon, he appeared in the spirit formation.</p>
 <p>“He is Chu Feng? He’s actually so young?”</p>
 <p>When Chu Feng appeared, the people outside the hunting ground were all astonished.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because Chu Feng possessed a truly youthful appearance. He was like a young man in his early twenties.</p>
 <p>This might be because Chu Feng had taken the Ginseng King of Evil, but his appearance was even younger than before. He had simply seemed to regain his youth.</p>
 <p>Based on Chu Feng’s appearance, the crowd guessed that even if he wasn’t in his twenties, he would not be older than fifty years old.</p>
 <p>An age like that could be said to be extremely young in the world of martial cultivators. It was no different from infancy for ordinary people.</p>
 <p>“Lord Villa Master, he is that Chu Feng?” The fiery red-haired old man seemed to not dare to believe what he was seeing. Thus, he turned to ask the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master for confirmation.</p>
 <p>“Mn, he is that Chu Feng,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master answered.</p>
 <p>“That child is truly daring. He actually dared to offend the Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations in such a manner.”</p>
 <p>“Merely, I wonder if he will be able to defeat Chu Xianshuo?” The fiery red-haired old man asked.</p>
 <p>The reason why he asked that question was because he also disliked Chu Xianshuo and the other Chu Heavenly Clan’s younger generations.</p>
 <p>Thus, he actually also wished for Chu Feng to win.</p>
 <p>However, it was precisely because he wanted Chu Feng to win that he did not have confidence. Even though he knew that Chu Feng had defeated that World Spirit Beast, he was still not confident.</p>
 <p>As he did not possess confidence, he had no choice but to turn to the Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master. After all, their Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master had observed Chu Feng already.</p>
 <p>“I did not see how that Chu Feng defeated that World Spirit Beast. It might even be possible that he was lucky to strike its weakness.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, I also do not know exactly what sort of abilities he might possess,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master said.</p>
 <p>“Then, why were you so certain that Chu Xianshuo would not be a match for Chu Feng?” The fiery red-haired old man felt somewhat helpless.</p>
 <p>“Haha,” The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master laughed. He said, “Chu Xianshuo is extremely egotistical and arrogant. However, he has taken first place in the hunt for the previous nine years.”</p>
 <p>“It is a rare opportunity that someone capable of going head to head with him has appeared. Thus, how could this old man not take this chance to deride him?”</p>
 <p>The Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master spoke those words secretly through voice transmission. Only the fiery red-haired old man was capable of hearing them.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, the fiery red-haired old man felt even more helpless.</p>
 <p>Even though their grand Immortal Armament Villa’s Villa Master was already so old, he still had the temperament of a child. This caused him to feel very helpless.</p>
 <p>Feeling helpless, he turned his attention to the spirit formation again.</p>
 <p>Although he had no idea whether Chu Feng or Chu Xianshuo would be stronger, he knew that the following battle would be wonderous to watch.</p>
 <p>It would a battle without any martial power or martial skills. It would be a battle between world spiritists.</p>
 <p>Inside the hunting ground. Chu Feng was still moving closer. He was growing closer and closer to Chu Xianshuo and the others.</p>
 <p>Chu Xianshuo was staring at Chu Feng. His gaze was so sharp that it was like blades. An ominous glint was being radiated from his eyes. It was like that of a fierce animal.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng was not afraid in the slightest after seeing the expression on Chu Xianshuos’ face. Instead, he wore a faint smile.</p>
 <p>“Why are you looking at me like that?” Chu Feng asked with a smile on his face.</p>
 <p>“Nothing. I merely wanted to tell you that if you are to kneel and beg for forgiveness now, I can consider leaving you an intact corpse,” Chu Xianshuo spoke with fuming range between gritted teeth.</p>
 <p>“I wish to know who gave you the confidence to say those sorts of words in a place like this?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Merely by the fact that I was able to use my oppressive might to oppress you to the ground like a dog and make you wag your tail and beg for mercy,” Chu Xianshuo said.</p>
 <p>“I admit that I had been defeated by you. I also admit that your cultivation was stronger than mine. However… I don’t think that I’m inferior to you.”</p>
 <p>“After all, your age is so much older than my own. If your cultivation was weaker than mine, then you might as well just kill yourself, right?” Chu Feng asked with a smile on his face. That smile of his was so very provocative.</p>
 <p>“Insolent bastard, you’re truly trying to die today!”</p>
 <p>“Today, I, Chu Xianshuo, will have you know that even without using my martial power, I will still oppress you to the ground like a dying dog!”</p>
 <p>“Using my world spirit techniques, I am equally capable of making you lie before me!”</p>
 <p>As Chu Xianshuo spoke those words, he suddenly opened his palm. Then, a layer of golden-bright and dazzling light flew out of his hand. Its speed was so fast that it arrived before Chu Feng in an instant.</p>
 <p>That was… a world spirit formation!!!</p>
