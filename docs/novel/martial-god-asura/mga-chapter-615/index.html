 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 615 - Familiar Person?</strong></p>
 <p><span style>In a deep place like that, it was simply like a purgatory in the human realm. To normal people, personally seeing cultivators cruelly refined by the monster one after another was truly a type of torture by itself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a situation like that, perhaps </span><i><span style>death </span></i><span style>was a release so they wouldn’t have to see such cruel refining and would have to hear the agonizing screeches. Hence, to them, the passing of time was really too slow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, to people such as Chu Feng who still had a smidgen of hope that escape was possible, they felt like time passed too quickly because only an hour had passed, yet most people were already refined by the monster out of the several thousands of people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though they already moved locations furtively, to the safest area, if that continue, they would soon catch the eyes of the monster, and at that time, they would not avoid their fate of being refined.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cries of pain rose up and down, continuing endlessly. But, at present, Chu Feng and the others no longer had time to think of the lives of others because after the conclusion of another scream, after a set of bones was thrown onto the ground, the monster finally locked its gaze onto their position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crap, it has discovered us! Quickly use your treasure or else we will die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, they panicked. They subconsciously crawled back, deeply afraid they would become the monster’s next target of refining.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bastard, shut up!” But just at that time, a powerful leg ferociously kicked the buttocks of the person who shouted out, casting him to the front of the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The one who kicked was a person from the Immortal Execution Archipelago, the rank three Martial Lord old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You, you, you...” Seeing himself betrayed, the person who was kicked gnashed his teeth in anger, but before he could say anything more, the monster made him float in the air, and started its inhumane refining.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But that was only the start. After he was kicked out, the three from the Immortal Execution Archipelago actually, with their superior Martial Lord bodies, started to forcibly kick away the World Spiritists, one following the other, who channeled Spirit power for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing? They helped you just now, yet you treat them like this? Are you even human?!” Chu Feng could not endure such behavior and rebuked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, listen up. At a time like this, it is a must to perform some necessary sacrifices.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of the people here, other than me, only your Spirit power is the strongest. So, that’s why I kept you behind. You better obediently continue channeling your Spirit power or else the next one to be kicked out will be you,” said the old man from the Immortal Execution Archipelago fiercely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Spirit power? The two trash next to you don’t have any Spirit power. Why don’t you kick </span><i><span style>them</span></i><span style> out? And make them sacrifices?” Chu Feng cast his gaze towards the wild big man and the fair-faced man. Although their cultivations were not bad, they were indeed not World Spiritists and had no Spirit power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up! If you want to die, I can grant you that wish right now!” The old man was enraged. He pointed at Chu Feng and loudly howled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Screw that! You want me to be your stepping stone? You can dream less! If you don’t want us to live, you better not think of living either. If you want us to die, we all die together!” Chu Feng was also enraged. He suddenly stood up and howled at the old man furiously as he pointed at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right! We won’t be your stepping stones! If you want us to die, we all die together!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn Immortal Execution Archipelago! Righteous and benevolent on the surface, but it turns out that they are actually this despicable! Even if I die, I will drag you down with me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, everyone saw through their plans and started to loudly rebuke. They wanted to let the monster hear that the three people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago were scheming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“God damn, you are all truly looking to die!” Seeing the unfolding events, the wild big man and the fair-faced man from the Immortal Execution Archipelago were enraged too. They actually, with their physical power, rent the water grasses that tied their hands and feet, then with several large strides, went up to Chu Feng and the others, grabbed them, and threw them next to the monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lord Monster, Lord Monster, those three animals from the Immortal Execution Archipelago are hiddenly plotting, aiming to harm you! Quickly stop th—Ahh~~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Arriving next to the monster, seeing that their end was nigh, those who helped the three from Immortal Execution Archipelago gather Spirit power started to report their actions to the monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was useless as the monster seemed to simply be unable to understand human speech. It actually ignored their words and started to refine those people first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn it.” At that instant, Chu Feng tightly furrowed his brows. Although he could stand up, he didn’t have a Martial Lord’s physical power, so he was unable to forcefully tear open the water grasses. So, at that instant, he had already become the meal of the monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Especially when he turned his gaze back and saw their expressions of schadenfreude, that made him extremely displeased. But, who told the monster to be unable to understand human speech? In that situation, he could do nothing as well. His fate was left to the heavens.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh~~~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, another painful scream, another person refined. Within the vast space at the bottom of the ocean, only the monster, Chu Feng, and the three others from the Immortal Execution Archipelago were left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come at me idiotic thing! Let me see if you can take my bones and flesh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feeling his body floating up and involuntarily nearing the monster, Chu Feng did not have a single trace of fear. Instead, he furiously howled at the monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*hmm*</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when the monster saw Chu Feng’s face, its blood-red eyes actually lightly flickered. At that instant, Chu Feng could feel its body faintly quivering once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking more carefully, Chu Feng even discovered fear surging within the monster’s blood-red eyes. Moreover, he also felt a near intangible familiar feeling from the monster’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?” That situation made a thought spring up in Chu Feng’s mind—the terrifying monster in front of his eyes was very possibly someone he knew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>*bam* But what Chu Feng didn’t expect was that despite not replying to his question, the monster threw Chu Feng, who was already floating, onto the ground. Then, it turned its gaze and walked towards the three people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“God damn, what is happening? Why is it walking towards us? Why didn’t it refine that brat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that scene, the wild big man and the fair-faced man were stupefied from fear because they could simply not understand why the monster didn’t kill Chu Feng, and instead, locked its eyes on them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Back.” Just at that moment, the rank three Martial Lord old man explosively yelled, then he walked in front of the wild big man and the fair-faced man. Concurrently, he opened his palms, the awl coming into view.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at that very instant, the symbols on the awl were lit up and swirling. It had an extraordinary atmosphere, and emanated extremely horrifying aura. He actually never planned to use that treasure and escape that place. He wanted to use that treasure to undergo the final battle against the monster.</span></p>
