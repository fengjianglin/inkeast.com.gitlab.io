 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What happened to her?” asked Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I believe you’ve also heard about the things regarding Yue’er before. During the days when I wasn’t present, she hadn’t been treated well in the clan. That’s how a large clan is. I believe you’ve also experienced your fair share of that in the Chu Heavenly Clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Later on, for the sake of making it up to her, our clansmen decided to present her an opportunity to enter our clan’s grand training formation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That grand training formation only opens once every thirty years. Every time it opens, only a single person of the younger generation is allowed to enter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you know why Li Anzhi refrained from entering the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm for so long? It’s because he was waiting for the grand training formation to open.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The benefit that grand formation could bring to a person of the younger generation far surpasses that of the Ancestral Martial Cultivation Realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Merely, Yue’er entered that grand formation to train some time ago. Logically, she should’ve returned from the grand formation by now. Yet, she is still in there. I'm worried that she has encountered a mishap,” Li Ruochu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Am I able to help her?” Chu Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“To be exact, you’re the only one that can help her,” Li Ruochu said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That spirit formation is currently closed. Others will simply not be able to enter it at all. The only possible exception would be a person of the younger generation within a hundred years of age that possesses Saint-level spirit power.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Perhaps this is the will of the heavens. I never expected that you’d become a Saint-cloak World Spiritist when we met again. Although you’re only an Insect Mark Saint-cloak World Spiritist, you should be able to enter that spirit formation. If even you are unable to enter it, then it will be up to Yue’er herself as to whether or not she will be able to return safely,” said Li Ruochu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then, wouldn’t it mean that the longer we wait, the more dangerous the situation would be for her?” Chu Feng asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right,” Li Ruochu nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ssss~~~” Chu Feng sucked in a mouthful of cold air upon hearing those words, and revealed a difficult expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He naturally wanted to go save Li Yue’er. As Chu Feng had been to many spirit formations before, he knew very well what one would be confronted with should one fail to exit the spirit formation in time -- fatal danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But, Bai Liluo was currently captured by the so-called Black-feathered Specter. Although it was said that she would be saved should Chu Feng gain first place in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars, it was unknown what her current situation was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Chu Feng were to directly proceed to save Li Yue’er and ignore Bai Liluo, he would become very worried.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the longer he waited, the more dangerous the situation would be for Li Yue’er. He was truly rushed for time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of this, he was placed in a very difficult situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young friend Chu Feng, may I come in?” Right at that moment, the voice of the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief sounded from outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng did not directly answer him. Instead, he looked to Li Ruochu. It was only after Li Ruochu nodded that Chu Feng gave a response.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief and Wuming Xingyun entered Chu Feng’s room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment the door was opened, Chu Feng saw that there were a lot of experts from the Tantai Heavenly Clan standing outside. Merely from looking at them, Chu Feng was able to tell that they were people with extraordinary status in the Tantai Heavenly Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For there to be sol many experts gathered outside his door in a manner seemingly waiting for an order, Chu Feng realized that something must’ve happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief walked in, Li Ruochu immediately stepped forward to greet him. However, the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief directly opened his mouth and said, “Miss Ruochu, may I be given some time to chat with young friend Chu Feng alone?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course,” after giving that reply, Li Ruochu walked out of the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although he had asked to be given time to speak with Chu Feng alone, Wuming Xingyun did not leave this time around, and the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief seemed to have no intention of asking him to leave either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young friend Chu Feng, please have a look,” as Wuming Xingyun spoke, he took out a letter and handed it to Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng opened the letter and discovered that the letter was written to him by Bai Liluo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The contents of the letter stated that the Black-feathered Specter was merely some mischief created by her. It stated that the Black-feathered Specter had not reappeared, that it was all created by her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for the reason why she did that, it was because she wanted to motivate Chu Feng to obtain the best performance in the selection for the Ancestral Martial Decastars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, she had wanted to confess everything to Chu Feng after he won the first ranked place of the Ancestral Martial Decastars. However, due to the fact that something had come up, she had to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, she had decided to leave the letter. Furthermore, she ended the letter by reminding Chu Feng that he must not worry about her, as she would come find him once she was finished with her business.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing the letter, Chu Feng’s suspended heart was finally lifted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He smiled and shook his head, “Big sister Liluo is truly mischievous.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng did not doubt the authenticity of the letter at all. The reason for that was because Bai Liluo’s aura was present on the letter. As a Saint-cloak World Spiritist, Chu Feng was able to conclude that the letter was written by Bai Liluo personally, and was not something that others had forged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So it was actually all some mischief caused by that girl. However, she was doing it for your sake. Thus, it could be considered to be good-willed mischief,” Wuming Xingyun had managed to see the contents of the letter. He was unable to help himself from smiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a very relaxed smile, as if he had been relieved of a burden. The reason for that was because he'd been feeling guilty before, because he felt that Bai Liluo had disappeared because he had failed to properly take care of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was the reason why he had been accompanying Chu Feng. He had wanted to return to the Tantai Heavenly Clan with Chu Feng to figure out exactly what was going on, and give Chu Feng an explanation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, after learning that Bai Liluo was fine, the guilty feeling that he’d been feeling was finally lifted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Although that young lady had made some mischief, that Black-feathered Specter has truly reappeared.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Furthermore, I suspect that that young lady might not have really left because she had something she needed to do. Instead, her departure is very likely related to the Black-feathered Specter,” the Tantai Heavenly Clan’s Clan Chief said all of a sudden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah?” Hearing those words, the smile on Chu Feng and Wuming Xingyun’s faces instantly disappeared.</span></p>
