 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 672 - Dragon Marking Sword Technique</strong></p>
 <p><span style>After returning to his residence, the first thing Chu Feng did was to use his Heaven’s Eyes to carefully examine the Incomplete Royal Armament he obtained from Temple Head Wuya.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, something Chu Feng did not expect was when he used the Heaven’s Eyes to study how the Incomplete Royal Armament was created, he accidentally discovered that the markings on the Dragon Marking Sword were faintly changing under the gaze of his Heaven’s Eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?! This is actually a technique!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, Chu Feng found out that there was a technique concealed within the markings. Moreover, that technique had a name: the Dragon Marking Sword Technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Dragon Marking Sword Technique was very special. Rather than calling it a technique alone, it would be better to call it a sword technique. However, something undeniable was its powerful strength. One could even say it surpassed ordinary rank nine martial skills, and comparable to even Mortal Taboo martial skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the Dragon Marking Sword Technique could only be used if one had the Dragon Marking Sword. It could be said to be a custom-made sword technique specifically for the Dragon Marking Sword. If Chu Feng were to learn that sword technique, he would be unstoppable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This Dragon Marking Sword has had a long history, it’s likely it wasn’t made by modern people. I wonder if that Temple Head Wuya discovered the Dragon Marking Sword Technique hidden in this Dragon Marking Sword.” Chu Feng was even more elated upon an inadvertent harvest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He definitely hasn’t discovered it yet. Although that Temple Head Wuya seems to grasp a special Spirit Formation technique, how can it be compared to the Heaven’s Eyes?” Eggy said very certainly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, that’s true. Regardless, right now, this Dragon Marking Sword is mine, so of course this Dragon Marking Sword Technique is mine too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, after Chu Feng, who hadn’t learnt any new methods in a long while, discovered the sword technique within the Dragon Marking Sword, he started to train in it without sleeping. With superior cultivation talent and powerful comprehension abilities, Chu Feng grasped the Dragon Marking Sword Technique in a short two days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After two full sleepless and restless days of sword training, even Chu Feng was left a bit fatigued. However, just as he entered slumber, he was awakened by urgent knocks on his door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is it? It’s so early in the morning, why aren’t you letting me sleep?!” When he woke up, he discovered that the night was no more and it was already bright outside. However, the sky </span><i><span style>just</span></i><span style> lit up. He, who had just sleep for a short while, was very furious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when Chu Feng prepared to open the door and send out a barrage of insults, he was taken aback. Immediately after seeing the people behind the entryway, he forcefully stuffed back in all the insults he prepared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that very instant, outside his palace stood four lithe beauties. They were none other than Chun Wu, Xia Yu, Qiu Zhu, and Dong Xue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The four of them all wore the same patterned yet different coloured skirts. Not only were they beautiful, they were also a feast for the eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were like four flowers that had just blossomed after a morning shower. It made people involuntarily wish to near them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, even Chu Feng lit up his eyes at that moment. The drowsiness lingering around his brain also instantly disappeared like a whisper of smoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re still sleeping, what time is it? You are truly a pig-like man!” Chun Wu was the first to speak. With a smile, she cast a glimpse at Chu Feng, as if she were venting her displeasure because of Chu Feng’s earlier howls and roars in the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Junior Wuqing, today is the day that the Martial Marking Immortal Realm opens! Although the specific time it opens isn’t certain, it’s always better to head there earlier. Or else, if you miss it, that would be quite a shame,” Xia Yu said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Today’s the day that the Martial Marking Immortal Realm opens?” A revelation came to Chu Feng when he heard those words. In the past two days, he had been training hard with the Dragon Marking Sword Technique, and almost forgot about that important event.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oi oi oi, you idiot! You haven’t forgotten that today’s the Martial Marking Immortal Realm’s opening day that occurs </span><i><span style>only</span></i><span style> once every six years, right?” Chun Wu asked pouting when she saw Chu Feng’s reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh… I...” Chu Feng didn’t know how to respond because indeed, he had forgotten.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoh, I’ve heard that Junior Wuqing’s been in closed-door cultivation in these past two days. It’s quite normal to have forgotten the time and date.” Xia Yu very smoothly helped Chu Feng out of that situation. As for Qu Zhu and Dong Xue, the two beauties, they stood unmoving and in silent, giggling while looking at the good show.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, okay. Let’s go now! Today, everyone who has received the Misty Badge and passed the screening will appear. I’m a bit impatient to see what abilities those arrogant people from the Immortal Execution Archipelago have,” Chun Wu said with a face of expectation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Immortal Execution Archipelago, huh? I wonder if the one titled as the number one genius in the Eastern Sea Region, Murong Xun, will come or not,” Chu Feng said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s unlikely. The Martial Marking Immortal Realm only opens once every six years, and every time only a hundred people can enter. Moreover, those over and including the age of thirty cannot enter, and Murong Xun is exactly thirty years old. So, my master didn’t send him a Misty Badge to invite him to come.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“On the other hand, his younger sister, Murong Wan, and his fiancée, Ya Fei, as well as many geniuses from the Immortal Execution Archipelago have received the Misty Badge. As for whether he will accompany his fiancée here, I do not know. But even if he did, it would be useless as his age prevents him from entering the Martial Marking Immortal Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But to him, there’s probably not much bitterness he’d feel whether he enters or not. After all, the one who possess the current best record is him—120 Immortal Markings. That is indeed very impressive,” Xia Yu patiently explained, but when Murong Xun’s record he left behind was mentioned, admiration unwittingly emerged onto her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“With 120 Immortal Markings one can exchange them for a Mortal Taboo martial skill, huh? I wonder, are there Earthen Taboo martial skills?” Chu Feng asked curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To be more precise, a hundred Immortal Markings is sufficient for a Mortal Taboo martial skill, but as for Earthen Taboo martial skills… To be honest, even I don’t know if there are or not. Many things in the Misty Peak are operated automatically. They are not something that we can control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not to mention thoroughly governing the Misty Immortal Formation, if we can open this Martial Marking Immortal Realm whenever we wish to, then the Misty Peak will have a great increase in strength,” Xia Yu explained with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Junior Wuqing, you wouldn’t be wanting to exchanging markings for an Earthen Taboo martial skill, right? Not trying to lower your confidence, but the Martial Markings in the Martial Marking Immortal Realm aren’t that easily obtained. Every time the realm is opened, there are a hundred people that enter. However, for most of them, getting several is already quite good. Some people can’t even get one and returned with empty hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So, people like Murong Xun are already very outstanding. A hundred twenty Immortal Markings… Even thinking about it I feel it to be unbelievable. The appellation of the number one genius in the Eastern Sea Region is quite genuine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Dong Xue spoke. From her words, not only could one tell that the Martial Markings in the Martial Marking Immortal Realm were very difficult to obtain, she personally also seemed to like Murong Xun quite a bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what if he’s more powerful? At the end, didn’t he fall before my Senior Qiu Zhu?” Chun Wu suddenly spoke at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And hearing those words, Xia Yu’s and Dong Xue’s face instantly changed, and then asked simultaneously, “Little Wu, what do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little Wu, you… Don’t speak of random things.” At the same time, Qiu Zhu’s beautiful face lost colour as she secretly tugged Chun Wu’s skirt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eiya, Senior Qiu Zhu, what is there to not talk about? Isn’t it just you rejecting Murong Xun’s confession?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph. After being turned down, he even told you to not tell others about this matter. From what I see, this sort of person who dares to do but not bear the consequences is no more than a hypocrite,” Chun Wu said with her lips curled.</span></p>
