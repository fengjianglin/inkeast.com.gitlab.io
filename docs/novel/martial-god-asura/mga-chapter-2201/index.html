 <p><strong> Chapter 2201 - Absolute Trust</strong></p>
 <p>“Since you don’t want my help, then forget about it,” Chu Feng stood up and prepared to leave the lake.</p>
 <p>“Hey, hey, hey! Who said that you could leave? I’m telling you to help me treat my illness. But… you must not think about doing anything ulterior to me,” The woman said loudly.</p>
 <p>“Do I look like that sort of person?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“You do,” The woman nodded without the slightest hesitation.</p>
 <p>“You truly have a pig brain,” Chu Feng sighed helplessly. Then, with a wave of his sleeve, his world spirit power began to appear.</p>
 <p>Then, Chu Feng’s hands began to change rapidly. His world spirit power also started to transform nonstop. In merely the blink of an eye, he created a golden-bright and dazzling spirit formation that surrounded the woman’s body.</p>
 <p>“This guy!!!” After seeing the spirit formation Chu Feng had created, the woman revealed an astonished and admiring gaze.</p>
 <p>As a fellow world spiritist, she had never expected Chu Feng to not only be a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist, his world spirit techniques were also this skillful.</p>
 <p>After seeing Chu Feng’s abilities, the woman began to cooperate with Chu Feng. Thus, it became much easier for Chu Feng to treat her illness.</p>
 <p>With Chu Feng’s meticulous effort, he finally managed to stabilize the woman’s illness. At the very least, her illness would not relapse for the time being.</p>
 <p>However, even though this woman’s illness had been stabilized rather quickly, her illness was actually even more serious than Elder Liu Chengkun’s illness. Likely, even Immortal-cloak World Spiritists would find it very difficult to cure her illness.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng truly did not know how this woman had contracted such a powerful illness. Most importantly, her illness seemed to be something she had been born with. In other words, it had been destined that she would contract this illness since she was born.</p>
 <p>“Never would I have expected that you actually do have some real skills. Hey, what’s your name?”</p>
 <p>“Which power are you from? How come I’ve never heard of a character like you? You’re so young, yet you already possess the cultivation of a rank two Half Martial Ancestor, and also a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivation. You are simply capable of comparing with that bunch of bastards from the Heavenly Clans. However, I feel that you are even stronger than them.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, most importantly, you are a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritist. Furthermore, your world spirit techniques surpass all of the other Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists I’ve met before. Tell me, exactly who are you?”</p>
 <p>“Someone like you cannot be a nameless nobody.”</p>
 <p>After the woman’s illness was stabilized, she began to ask Chu Feng questions in succession. She had completely forgotten the matter of Chu Feng seeing her naked.</p>
 <p>“Could it be that you don’t know that you should tell others your name first when asking for their name?” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“I am called Xu Yiyi. I am a disciple of the Sunset Cloud Valley,” The woman said.</p>
 <p>“I am called Chu Feng,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“What? You are that Chu Feng?” Hearing those words, that Xu Yiyi woman once again revealed an astonished expression. Merely, her astonishment this time around was even greater than all her previous astonishments combined. She was so shocked that her mouth even hung open.</p>
 <p>“You know me?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“I don’t. However, I’ve heard of you. You didn’t go save your friend?”</p>
 <p>“That’s reasonable too. With your cultivation, if you had gone to save your friend, your life would definitely be lost,” Xu Yiyi said.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng realized what was going on. For the sake of capturing Chu Feng, Hong Xi had spread the news of Tang Ying’s capture everywhere. Likely, this Xu Yiyi had received that news.</p>
 <p>“I have only managed to stabilize your illness, and not bring it under permanent control. I urge you to quickly continue with your journey. Else, your illness might act up again. After all, not everyone is as kind-hearted as me, not everyone will not take advantage of others, and even lend a helping hand,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Hey hey hey! Judging from your tone, it seems that you’re not happy? Is it because of the fact that I said that you didn’t go save your friend, that I indirectly said that you are not loyal to your friends, that caused you to be angry?” Xu Yiyi said with a ‘teehee’ laughter.</p>
 <p>“The two of us are already even. Farewell,” As Chu Feng spoke, he entered the void.</p>
 <p>After all, he had only come out to inspect the situation outside. Huang Luo might be very worried right now. Thus, Chu Feng felt that he should return quickly and explain what was going on to Huang Luo.</p>
 <p>In response, Xu Yiyi shouted, “Hey hey hey, wait! I have a gift for you,”</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng had only helped her to make it up to her for accidentally seeing her naked. Now that he had compensated her for his action, he no longer owed her anything. As such, he would naturally not accept anything from her.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng heard her calls but did not wish to accept her gift.</p>
 <p>“What a petty man. I can’t even crack a joke with you.”</p>
 <p>“I didn’t even do anything to you after you saw me naked. Why did you run away right after I cracked a joke?”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Chu Feng had left, Xu Yiyi pouted her lips in a displeased manner. She opened her hand and looked to the title plate on her palm and shook her head, “It’s you who was too narrow-minded. It’s not me that didn’t want to help you.”</p>
 <p>After saying those words, Xu Yiyi’s petite body moved. Like a cyan light, she soared into the clouds and began to fly toward the distance. As for that direction, it was the direction of Luyang’s Pavilion.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, he naturally did not notice the direction that Xu Yiyi had left in. At that moment, he had returned to the underground palace.</p>
 <p>“Senior Liu, you’ve awakened?!!!” After returning, Chu Feng immediately revealed an overjoyed expression. The reason for that was because Liu Chengkun had awakened.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, I have heard from Huang Luo what happened. I truly do not know how to thank you for stabilizing my illness,” Liu Chengkun said.</p>
 <p>“Senior, that is merely something that this junior should do. How are you feeling now?” Chu Feng asked in a deeply concerned manner.</p>
 <p>“I am not exaggerating at all. Compared to all the other times when I wake up from my illness, this time around is the most comfortable.”</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, your world spirit techniques are truly exceptional. Although you are a Dragon Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists, your world spirit techniques have already surpassed those of our Society President. Little friend Chu Feng, you are truly worthy of being an Asura World Spiritist,” Liu Chengkun praised.</p>
 <p>“Senior, if you continue to flatter me like this, I will grow conceited,” Chu Feng scratched his head awkwardly.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, it seems that the motion earlier was unrelated to Luyang’s Pavilion?” Huang Luo asked.</p>
 <p>After seeing that Chu Feng was not worried at all after returning, he had managed to guess the result of Chu Feng’s inspection. However, he wanted to ascertain his guess.</p>
 <p>“It was merely a passerby, and not someone from Luyang’s Pavilion. Furthermore, her cultivation was only that of a rank one Half Martial Ancestor. She poses no threat to us,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“That’s great,” Huang Luo nodded in relief.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, this old man has a presumptuous request. I don’t know if you might come to our…” Liu Chengkun said.</p>
 <p>However, before Liu Chengkun finished his words, Chu Feng interrupted and said, “If Senior Liu wants to invite me to be a guest to the Red Butterfly Society, you don’t have to mention it anymore.”</p>
 <p>“Eh…” Hearing those words, Liu Chengkun was placed in an awkward situation and unable to continue his words.</p>
 <p>Huang Luo was also placed in an awkward situation. They had both thought that Chu Feng would refuse. However, they had not expected that Chu Feng would refuse so bluntly.</p>
 <p>“The reason for that is because even if Senior Liu doesn’t invite me, I would’ve asked Senior Liu to bring me to the Red Butterfly Society to have a look,” Chu Feng said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Liu Chengkun and Huang Luo both revealed overjoyed expressions. They truly never expect that Chu Feng would… take such a long pause between his sentences.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, they had not expected that Chu Feng would actually agree to be a guest of the Red Butterfly Society.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha, this is great. It is our Red Butterfly Society’s blessing to have an honored guest like little friend Chu Feng.”</p>
 <p>“Our Society President will definitely be extremely fond of you after seeing you,” Liu Chengkun was very happy. He was simply wild with joy.</p>
 <p>“Senior, please stop flattering me. Those words should be things that I should say,” Chu Feng was telling the truth. As matters stood, he possessed a certain amount of understanding of the Red Butterfly Society.</p>
 <p>The Red Butterfly Society’s range of activity was only in the territory controlled by Luyang’s Pavilion. It was a power that dared to meet Luyang’s Pavilion head-on.</p>
 <p>The Red Butterfly Society was also what Luyang’s Pavilion wanted to eliminate. Thus, the various branches and headquarters of the Red Butterfly Society were all constructed in places that no one knew about. Furthermore, their movements were also very secretive. Only the people from the Red Butterfly Society knew of their locations.</p>
 <p>This was especially true for the Red Butterfly Society’s headquarters. Their headquarters was their greatest secret. In fact, the location of the Red Butterfly Society’s headquarters would always change after a certain period of time. Furthermore, members of the Red Butterfly Society without sufficient qualifications would not know of the location of their headquarters. This was even moreso the case for an outsider like Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>However, right now, Elder Liu Chengkun had actually invited Chu Feng to their headquarters as a guest. This was simply absolute trust in Chu Feng.</p>
