 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 1507 - The Price For Boasting</strong></p>
 <p>“Wow! Royal-cloak world spiritist?”</p>
 <p>“Tian Liang, you’re going to become a royal-cloak world spiritist?”</p>
 <p>Sure enough, after hearing what Tian Liang said, Yan Ru’s little face was immediately covered with excitement. Furthermore, her pair of beautiful eyes were even shining brightly.</p>
 <p>“I will definitely become a royal-cloak world spiritist within ten years’ time,” Seeing Yan Ru’s reaction, Tian Liang became especially haughty. He stuck his chest out and displayed a boastful smile of confidence.</p>
 <p>“Amazing! In that case, wouldn’t you be as powerful as senior Li?” Yan Ru asked.</p>
 <p>“No, I naturally cannot compare with my master,” Upon mentioning his master, Tian Liang finally became modest.</p>
 <p>“Why not? Aren’t you both going to be royal-cloak world spiritists?” Yan Ru asked in confusion.</p>
 <p>“They’re different. Royal-cloak world spiritists are separated into three different levels. The first is the Insect Mark, the second is the Snake Mark, and the last is the Dragon Mark.”</p>
 <p>“These three different levels can be said to be three different realms. The difference between them is enormous. However, all world spiritists that can become Insect Mark Royal-cloak World Spiritists are heavenly geniuses in the cultivation of world spirit techniques.”</p>
 <p>“Not only must they possess exceptionally strong perception, spirit power and comprehension, they must also put forth effort no ordinary people could compare with. They must train with their all and read through countless ancient books in order to learn nonstop.”</p>
 <p>“For people like them, it would be extremely rare if one were to appear, even in tens of millions of people.”</p>
 <p>“As for the Snake Marked Royal-cloak World Spiritists, they are even rarer. Each and every one of them are existences who can contend against Martial Emperors.”</p>
 <p>“As for Dragon Marked Royal-cloak World Spiritists, I’m afraid that there are no such world spiritists in the entire Holy Land of Martialism.” As Tian Liang explained the difference between royal-cloak world spiritists to Yan Ru, he also began to exaggerate how extraordinary royal-cloak world spiritists were. In actuality, he was praising himself.</p>
 <p>As for Yan Ru, she did not doubt what Tian Liang said in the slightest. Instead, the more she heard, the more excited she became. From this, it could be seen that she truly adored world spiritists.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was unable to continue listening to Tian Liang’s boasting anymore. He could not sit and watch as Tian Liang continued to trick Yan Ru with his false, misguiding knowledge. Thus, he spoke out against Tian Liang. “Although there are very few Dragon Marked Royal-cloak World Spiritists, there are still Dragon Marked Royal-cloak World Spiritists in the Holy Land of Martialism. As far as I know, there are some Dragon Marked Royal-cloak World Spiritists in the World Spiritist Alliance’s World Spiritists Sacred Assembly,”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, is that for real?” Yan Ru asked in a joyous manner.</p>
 <p>“How could that be real?” However, before Chu Feng could answer, Tian Liang interrupted him. Furthermore, he turned to Chu Feng and said, “Brother Chu Feng, you must definitely not spread false rumors. All that you’ve said are only rumors that people spread around. A wise man should know not to trust in rumors, oh a wise man should know not to trust in rumors.”</p>
 <p>“My master is a true Royal-cloak World Spiritist. Back then, even the World Spiritist Alliance wanted to invite my master to join them, only to be refused by him. Do you know the reason why?”</p>
 <p>“That’s because my master felt that the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master’s world spirit techniques were inferior to his own. As such, why should he vow loyalty and devotion to someone who is inferior?”</p>
 <p>“That’s why you must not think that the World Spiritist Alliance is extraordinary. They’re merely running on false reputation. In the Holy Land of Martialism, there are countless world spiritists more amazing than the ones in the World Spiritist Alliance.”</p>
 <p>“Generally, it is only hidden world spiritists like my master who are the truly powerful world spiritists,” Tian Liang began to belittle the World Spiritist Alliance.</p>
 <p>“There’s actually such a thing?” Although Chu Feng’s expression remained unchanged, he was actually feeling displeased in his heart. While Tian Liang could brag about himself and his master, he could not allow Tian Liang to belittle others, and especially not the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master, a senior that Chu Feng respected greatly.</p>
 <p>“Absolutely. My master is currently in the Yan Clan. If you do not trust me, you can go and ask my master.”</p>
 <p>“However, my master’s temperament is not very good, and he is not fond of speaking with others, especially those who do not know about world spirit techniques,” Tian Liang spoke with a threatening expression. It was evident that he was displeased by Chu Feng speaking out against him.</p>
 <p>“Indeed, senior Li is a person like that. However, Chu Feng is also a world spiritist,” Yan Ru interrupted.</p>
 <p>“Oh, I nearly forgot that Brother Chu Feng is a world spiritist. Although your world spirit techniques might be a bit lacking, you are barely qualified to meet my master. However, I will not be certain as to whether my master will pay attention to you.”</p>
 <p>“If he is to be enraged, he might attack you. My master will not care that Brother Chu Feng is a disciple of the Cyanwood Mountain. In my master’s eyes, he only cares about true experts, and will never be afraid of those with only false reputations.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, Brother Chu Feng, you should carefully consider whether you should meet my master or not. If something bad were to happen, I will not take responsibility for that,” Tian Liang said.</p>
 <p>“Oh, in that case I will not have to meet with your master. However, the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master is currently in the Yan Clan as a guest. How about we have him meet your master?”</p>
 <p>“Didn’t your master say that the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master was inferior to him? A decision made by himself would not be suitable. I think it’s better that they compare notes with one another to see whether or not your master’s world spirit techniques are truly as powerful as he declares them to be, truly stronger than that of the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“What? The World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master is in the Yan Clan?” Hearing those words, that Tian Liang’s complexion instantly changed. From his earlier rosy complexion, his complexion instantly turned deathly pale. He was evidently deeply scared.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, not only is the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master here, that renowned Elder Miao, Miao Renlong, has also come. Furthermore, my Uncle Dugu is also present,” Yan Ru added.</p>
 <p>“This…” At this moment, Tian Liang’s complexion turned green from fear. All of them were existences that he could not afford to provoke. In fact, not to mention him, even his master could not afford to provoke them. If he knew that Dugu Xingfeng was here, how could he dare to provoke Chu Feng? Weren’t his actions earlier now simply courting death?</p>
 <p>“Brother Tian, we should have your master have a match against the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master. What do you think?”</p>
 <p>“It will be very beneficial to both you and your master. After all, after their spar, your master will be able to prove himself.”</p>
 <p>“Else, without fighting one another, your master has been going around declaring that the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master is inferior to him. Wouldn’t that be akin to be speaking without thinking, and slandering another’s reputation? It will not be good if others were to think that he’s been boasting the entire time. Furthermore, it would be even worse if the World Spiritist Alliance ended up having a misunderstanding with him because of that,” Chu Feng said with a beaming smile.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, that’s right. I also wish to see whether senior Li or the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master’s world spirit techniques are actually stronger.” Yan Ru said with an expression of anticipation.</p>
 <p>“I…” Tian Liang was sweating all over. Even his calves started to shiver with cold.</p>
 <p>Earlier, he had been boasting. He naturally knew that his master was inferior to the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master. If his master were to find out that he had provoked the World Spiritist Alliance’s Alliance Master for him, his master would definitely skin him alive.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Tian Liang was filled with regret. He was regretting that he should have said those words before Chu Feng. That was because he suddenly discovered that Chu Feng was not as simple as he thought him to be.</p>
 <p>Else, it would be impossible for Chu Feng to force him to such a state with merely a few words. If this were to continue according to Chu Feng’s plan, he would definitely be met with a great calamity.</p>
 <p>The more Tian Liang thought about it, the more scared he became. He was so scared that he was already sweating like a pig.</p>
 <p>At this moment, he realized that this Chu Feng was truly treacherous.</p>
