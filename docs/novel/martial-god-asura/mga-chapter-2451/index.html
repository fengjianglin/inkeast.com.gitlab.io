 <p><strong> Chapter 2451 - I Will Shoulder The Responsibility</strong></p>
 <p>“Mn?”</p>
 <p>Once Chu Feng spoke, the Ancient Era’s War Sword immediately let out an annoyed snort.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Chu Feng felt that there seemed to be an invisible gaze being cast onto him.</p>
 <p>Although the gaze was invisible, it was incomparably cold. Chu Feng felt as if he had been thrown into a bitter cold region as the hair on his body instantly stood erect.</p>
 <p>However, even with that being the case, Chu Feng still managed to raise his head toward the Ancient Era’s War Sword in a manner that was neither servile nor overbearing.</p>
 <p>In a very calm manner, Chu Feng said, “Senior, since this matter was caused by me, please allow me to take responsibility for it. There is simply no need for you to kill the seniors of the Ancient Era’s War Clan. If you really want to kill someone, you should be killing me.”</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, have you gone insane? This matter does not concern you, why must you throw your life away for this?”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Chu Feng was actually planning to throw his life away for the people of the Ancient Era’s War Clan, Her Lady Queen who was originally sitting cross-legged in Chu Feng’s world spirit space spoke.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing those words, the expressions of the Ancient Era’s War Clansmen also changed. Although they were unable to raise their heads, and could not see the expression Chu Feng had right now, they were able to hear him.</p>
 <p>They had truly heard that Chu Feng was planning to die for them.</p>
 <p>“You wish to die on their behalf?” The Ancient Era’s War Sword said.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, immediately take back what you said earlier. You’re completely unrelated to them, how could you throw away your life for them?”</p>
 <p>Before Chu Feng could answer, Her Lady Queen spoke out against it again.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng completely ignored Her Lady Queen.</p>
 <p>Instead, he looked to the Ancient Era’s War Sword and said, “This matter was caused by me. It is unrelated to them. As such, I am willing to die on their behalf.”</p>
 <p>“Merely, I have a world spirit in my body. This matter is also unrelated to her. Senior, with how overwhelmingly powerful you are, you most likely possess the means to kill me without killing her. Thus, I hope that senior will kill only me and spare her.”</p>
 <p>“Of course. I can sever your relationship with her. I’ll kill only you and have her return to her world,” The Ancient Era’s War Sword said.</p>
 <p>“Since that’s the case, senior, please go ahead,” Chu Feng said calmly.</p>
 <p>“You really do not fear death?” The Ancient Era’s War Sword asked. At that moment, there was an evident change in the tone with which the Ancient Era’s War Sword spoke to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>It was no longer high and aloof like before. This time around, it was filled with curiosity toward Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“I am afraid of death. Who in this world would not be afraid of death? However, even if I am afraid of death, I cannot have these people die because of me.”</p>
 <p>“As a man, there are some responsibilities that one should shoulder. Else… one will not be qualified to be a man,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Very well. I admire your courage. Compared to this trash, you are much stronger.”</p>
 <p>“Thus, I will give you another opportunity. Consider it properly,” The Ancient Era’s War Sword said.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was about to reply when a voice filled with concern, anger and various other complicated emotions exploded in Chu Feng’s ears.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, shut up immediately! You don’t have to die, why do you want to die for them?!”</p>
 <p>“Think about your father, think about your mother, do you not feel it to be pitiful if you are to die here like this?”</p>
 <p>“Are you not letting down your father who is trapped in the Lower Realm?”</p>
 <p>“Are you not letting down your mother who intruded into the Asura Spirit World without hesitation to seal me in your body?”</p>
 <p>It was Her Lady Queen. At that moment, Her Lady Queen was shouting and roaring. Anger filled her beautiful face.</p>
 <p>Very rarely did she ever act this way. However, she did so then. The reason for that was all because she did not want Chu Feng to die in vain like that.</p>
 <p>To her, this was simply too unworthy.</p>
 <p>“No, I would’ve let them down. If I am to die here today, I will naturally be letting my parents down.”</p>
 <p>“But… it’s impossible for me to allow these people to die because of me.”</p>
 <p>“Furthermore, there’s also a very important aspect. Milady Queen, I feel that this might be a show,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Show? What show?” Her Lady Queen asked.</p>
 <p>“It is a show that the Ancient Era’s War Sword has deliberately put on for me,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“You’re saying that the Ancient Era’s War Sword is not really planning to kill the people of the Ancient Era’s War Clan, and is instead trying to see if you will bravely step forward for them?” Her Lady Queen was very smart. She immediately realized what Chu Feng meant.</p>
 <p>“That’s right,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Now that you mention it, there is indeed such a possibility,” Her Lady Queen had only been concerned with enjoying the show earlier, and had not bothered to think much about it.</p>
 <p>When she had heard what Chu Feng said, she discovered, upon thinking about it, that what Chu Feng said was very reasonable. There were indeed a lot of flaws in the Ancient Era’s War Sword’s actions.</p>
 <p>Perhaps it might really be a show.</p>
 <p>If it were to be a show, it would be a good thing.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because that show might very well be a test for Chu Feng. In short, if it was a show, then it would mean that the Ancient Era’s War Sword had taken a fancy to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Merely, it was planning to test Chu Feng’s moral character.</p>
 <p>“If this really is a show, what will happen if you do not step forward bravely?” Her Lady Queen asked.</p>
 <p>“If I do not step forward bravely, it is likely that no one from the Ancient Era’s War Clan will die. Instead, the person who would die in the end would be me,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“That’s true. But, if this is not a show, wouldn’t it mean that you would’ve thrown your life away in vain?” Her Lady Queen was still worried.</p>
 <p>“I feel that if it truly plans to kill the people from the Ancient Era’s War Clan, I will definitely be killed alongside them,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Why’s that?” Her Lady Queen asked.</p>
 <p>“If it truly plans to kill all of the Ancient Era’s War Clansmen here, it would mean that it will have done so because it possesses deep sentiments toward the Ancient Era’s War Clan.”</p>
 <p>“After it kills the people of the Ancient Era’s War Clan, if I am to survive, it would mean that everything here would be mine to keep.”</p>
 <p>“Say, do you think that it will allow me, an outsider, to inherit everything from the Ancient Era’s War Clan?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Now that you mention it, why didn’t I think of it earlier?” Her Lady Queen came to a sudden realization. She realized that what Chu Feng said was very reasonable.</p>
 <p>“My Eggy was only concerned about my safety. Naturally you would’ve neglected these things. Else, with how smart you are, you would definitely have been able to think of it.”</p>
 <p>“As they say, love will make one stupid. Right now, I have truly managed to experience it,” Chu Feng said in an embarrassed manner.</p>
 <p>“Mn, that is indeed the case. I had neglected it… wait a moment… you said love is what?”</p>
 <p>“Damn you! Chu Feng, you actually dared to seize this opportunity to take advantage of this Queen? Do you believe that this Queen will bite you to death?” Her Lady Queen pouted her little mouth angrily and began to shake her fist in the world spirit space. It was truly adorable.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, have you finished thinking it over?” Right at that moment, that Ancient Era’s War Sword’s urging voice was heard.</p>
 <p>“I’ve already decided. Allow me to shoulder this responsibility,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Very well, since you’ve decided, I will satisfy you,” Right after the Ancient Era’s War Sword said those words, the oppressive might and killing intent that enveloped the Ancient Era’s War Clansmen disappeared instantly.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the people from the Ancient Era’s War Clan finally regained their freedom. They stood back up and raised their heads.</p>
 <p>“Young Hero Chu Feng, you!!!”</p>
 <p>After they regained their freedom, they all revealed worried expressions on their faces.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because they were shocked to discover that the oppressive might and killing intent covering their bodies previously had all gathered on Chu Feng now.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng was actually faced with all of the power that had enveloped all of them earlier.</p>
 <p>Such power was incomparably berserk. It caused Chu Feng’s hair and clothes to flutter violently.</p>
 <p>However, even with that being the case, Chu Feng’s expression remained unchanged. Furthermore, he was not lying on his stomach in a sorry manner like the Ancient Era’s War Clansmen did earlier.</p>
 <p>Although the Ancient Era’s War Sword was planning to kill Chu Feng, it had given Chu Feng this final honor.</p>
