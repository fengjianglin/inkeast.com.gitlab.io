 <p><strong> Chapter 1996 - Killing With One Strike</strong></p>
 <p>“That’s right. Facts speak louder than words. We have all seen for ourselves what happened in the Moonlight Maze.”</p>
 <p>“It is your Heavenly Law Palace that is in the wrong with regards to everything. Yet, not only are you all not planning to apologize to little friend Chu Feng, you actually want to invert right and wrong to frame little friend Chu Feng. Heavenly Law Palace, you all are truly shameless, truly unqualified to proclaim yourself to be a righteous sect that upholds the heavenly law!!!!”</p>
 <p>“The Heavenly Law Palace is despicable and shameless, unworthy of being upright. Get the hell out of our Holy Land of Martialism!!!”</p>
 <p>…………</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, countless people stood forth. Not only were they speaking out for Chu Feng, they also began to insult the Heavenly Law Palace.</p>
 <p>This scene completely stunned all those who did not know what happened in the Moonlight Maze. None of them expected Chu Feng to have such enormous crowd-rallying power.</p>
 <p>One must know that all those people who spoke for Chu Feng were people that were unrelated to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Yet now, they actually dared to go against the Heavenly Law Palace for Chu Feng. In fact, they were even insulting the Heavenly Law Palace. This was clearly an attitude of becoming enemies with the Heavenly Law Palace.</p>
 <p>“You all!!!”</p>
 <p>“You all!!!” Elder Kuang Kui was so enraged that his face turned red. He was gnashing his teeth and his body was shivering.</p>
 <p>It was one thing for the Weaponry Refinement Immortal to go against their Heavenly Law Palace. Yet, this trash actually also dared to go against their Heavenly Law Palace. This was extremely humiliating for them.</p>
 <p>“All of you, you’re truly courting death here!!!” Sure enough, Elder Kuang Kui was unable to endure the humiliation. After a shout of anger, he suddenly lifted his right hand and spread open his palm. Immediately, a violent gale began to form.</p>
 <p>His majestic oppressive might turned into an enormous vortex. As that vortex surged, it covered this region of space. Then, killing intent began to engulf the people who were cursing at their Heavenly Law Palace.</p>
 <p>He was not only planning to threaten the crowd. Rather, he was planning to massacre them. He was planning to publicly kill those who dared to go against their Heavenly Law Palace so as to establish their might.</p>
 <p>“Zzzzzzz~~~~”</p>
 <p>However, right at that moment, a figure suddenly flashed through the sky. Like a phantom, that figure arrived beside Elder Kuang Kui.</p>
 <p>It was Chu Feng. Not only did Chu Feng arrive before Elder Kuang Kui, he also possessed a murderous-looking gaze. Without saying a word, he suddenly waved the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader in his hand. “Snap!” Blood bubbled out. Elder Kuang Kui had been hacked in two.</p>
 <p>Silence... everything became deathly quiet. Even the Weaponry Refinement Immortal stood there in a stunned manner.</p>
 <p>Astonished. They were all incomparably astonished. Those who did not know how powerful Chu Feng was simply did not dare to believe what had just happened.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng, a member of the younger generation, had actually killed a management elder of the Heavenly Law Palace, a renowned rank six Martial Emperor, with only a single strike.</p>
 <p>When ignoring one’s cultivation, the crowd also did not expect that Chu Feng would dare to kill a Heavenly Law Palace’s management elder before all these people.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you are truly bold! You actually dared to kill our Heavenly Law Palace’s management elder, you…” Suddenly, a Heavenly Law Palace’s elder managed to react to what had just happened. He pointed at Chu Feng and started to curse at Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>If he was facing Chu Feng alone, he would absolutely not dare to say those sorts of words to Chu Feng. However, at that moment, they were in front of this many people, and their Heavenly Law Palace was a place that possessed impressive fame and power. Furthermore, it was also Chu Feng who was in the wrong for killing Kuang Kui. As such, he became confident and lashed out at Chu Feng without any fear.</p>
 <p>“Puu~~~”</p>
 <p>However, before he could finish his speech, the Furious Coiling Dragon Beheader in Chu Feng’s hand was waved once again. As a silvery light streaked across the sky, the void itself started to shiver. Like Elder Kuang Kui, that elder was also hacked in two. He was dead, killed by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Those who wish to die can continue to speak,” At this moment, Chu Feng’s voice was incomparably cold. It was as if there was not the slightest trace of emotion in his voice. Instead, contained within his voice was only killing intent.</p>
 <p>Sensing Chu Feng’s dense killing intent, and seeing how Chu Feng had killed two of their Heavenly Law’s Elders before their eyes, the people from the Heavenly Law Palace hurriedly shut their mouths. One by one, they possessed flustered appearances. They were all clearly deeply afraid. In fact, no one dared to even look at Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>The people from the Heavenly Law Palace that had tried to create trouble for Chu Feng earlier all lowered their heads, afraid to even speak.</p>
 <p>It was not only the people from the Heavenly Law Palace. The bystanders were also terrified. Even though they had heard about how renowned and powerful Chu Feng was, they had not expected the rumored Chu Feng to be this ruthless and fierce.</p>
 <p>While anything could be fake, the strength which Chu Feng had revealed was definitely not fake; the killing intent that the crowd was feeling was definitely not fake.</p>
 <p>“All of you, listen carefully. Regardless of whether you are the Heavenly Law Palace or the Dark Hall, if you want to make me, Chu Feng, an enemy, then feel free to come and find me. I, Chu Feng, am absolutely not one that is afraid. If you send one, I will kill one. If you send two, I will kill two. However many people come for me, I will kill that many people.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s voice was like thunder as it resonated through heaven and earth. His voice caused space and the void itself to tremble intensely. It was as if the firmament itself was scared of Chu Feng’s declaration.</p>
 <p>When even the firmament was acting in such a way, there was no need to mention what the crowd was feeling. Not to mention those that had not been present in the Moonlight Maze, even the people that were defending Chu Feng were terrified by Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>As for Chu Feng, after he finished saying those words, he walked off without a second thought. He was truly in no mood to bother speaking with the crowd anymore.</p>
 <p>“Heavenly Law Palace, I urge you all to act tactfully. Although Chu Feng is only a member of the younger generation, he is not someone that you all can bully.”</p>
 <p>“I urge you all to not make Chu Feng your enemy. Else, you all will end up regretting it,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal warned in a serious manner.</p>
 <p>He was telling the truth. The current Chu Feng dared to make the Dark Hall his enemy and possessed the Ancient Era’s Elves as his ally.</p>
 <p>While the Heavenly Law Palace was indeed one of the human race’s three strongest powers, they were much inferior when compared to the Ancient Era’s Elves.</p>
 <p>If the Heavenly Law Palace insisted on making Chu Feng an enemy, they would only be courting disaster.</p>
 <p>However, the Heavenly Law Palace remained a power that had continued for countless years, one of the Holy Land of Martialism’s oldest powers. As someone from the Holy Land of Martialism, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal also did not wish for the destruction of the Heavenly Law Palace.</p>
 <p>However, if the Heavenly Law Palace ignored his advice and insisted on making Chu Feng their enemy, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal would also not spare the Heavenly Law Palace.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, have you managed to calm yourself?” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal asked after catching up to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“I am fine. I am merely afraid that something will happen to Lil Rou and Lil Mei,” Chu Feng had calmed down a lot. However, his worry for Su Rou and Su Mei had not decreased in the slightest. Likewise, his self-blame had not decreased in the slightest. Instead, it had increased. Furthermore, he had a very serious expression on his face.</p>
 <p>Seeing Chu Feng acting in such a manner, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal heaved a long sigh. He knew that it was useless for him to say anything to Chu Feng at such a time, because Chu Feng was a wise person that knew what to do. Thus, he did not try to console Chu Feng. Instead, he asked, “What’s your plan now?”</p>
 <p>“Return to the Cyanwood Mountain,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Return to the Cyanwood Mountain?” Hearing those words, the Weaponry Refinement Immortal’s expression changed. He said, “Chu Feng, the Cyanwood Mountain is the place that you should not go to the most right now.”</p>
 <p>“Right now, we have made the Dark Hall our absolute enemy, and the World Devastator Immortal has escaped. Likely, after the Dark Hall’s Hall Master comes to find out that it was I who ruined his plan, he absolutely will not spare me.”</p>
 <p>“If they wish to find me, they will definitely come to the Cyanwood Mountain,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Since you know all that, then why do you want to return to the Cyanwood Mountain?” The Weaponry Refinement asked.</p>
 <p>“What else should I do then? Am I to go to the Elf Kingdom and have the Elf Kingdom protect me while exposing all my friends in the Cyanwood Mountain to the Dark Hall so that they can slaughter them willingly?” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, that is not what I meant. Merely, one must consider the greater good. The greater one’s capability, the greater one’s responsibility. And you…” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal continued to advise Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Senior Weaponry Refinement Immortal, if your kinsmen were in trouble, would you ignore them?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“I…” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal started to hesitate.</p>
 <p>“I know that senior would not. I, Chu Feng, am the same. I will also not ignore them,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Very well then,” The Weaponry Refinement Immortal sighed, but had nothing more to say. He knew that Chu Feng was very stubborn. In the most crucial moment, Chu Feng was someone who would value his friends with loyalty and righteousness.</p>
 <p>When asking himself honestly, it was also because of Chu Feng’s loyalty and righteousness that the Weaponry Refinement Immortal admired and appreciated Chu Feng. Thus, he said, “Since you insist on returning, I will accompany you to the Cyanwood Mountain.”</p>
