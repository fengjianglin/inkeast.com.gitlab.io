 <p><strong> MGA: Chapter 1861 - Rank Nine Half Martial Emperor</strong></p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, I have a method that can increase your cultivation by a level for a short period of time. From rank eight Half Martial Emperor, you will become a rank nine Half Martial Emperor.”</p>
 <p>“This method relies on an Ancient Era’s medicinal pellet. Although it is only effective for Half Martial Emperors, it just so happens to be suited for you to use,” Duan Jidao said to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, before Chu Feng could say anything, Hong Qiang asked worriedly, “Medicinal pellet? Are there any side effects?”</p>
 <p>After all, Hong Qiang was also a world spiritist. He knew that medicinal pellets capable of increasing one’s cultivation would generally have enormous side effects accompanying them. This was especially true for someone of Chu Feng’s cultivation. If there was a medicinal pellet capable of increasing his cultivation by one level, then the pain from the backlash would definitely be extremely frightening.</p>
 <p>“Before taking that medicinal pellet, one must first set up a spirit formation. When that spirit formation is used alongside the medicinal pellet, there will not be any side effects,” Duan Jidao explained.</p>
 <p>“Senior Duan, Chu Feng is willing to give it a try,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng was currently a rank eight Half Martial Emperor. By relying on the power of his divine lightnings, he was able to increase his cultivation by two levels to become a rank one Martial Emperor. Furthermore, he possessed a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation. As such, he was capable of fighting against rank two Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>However, if he was able to increase his cultivation to rank nine Half Martial Emperor from rank eight Half Martial Emperor by using the medicinal pellet that Duan Jidao had spoken of, even if it was only temporary, he would be able to contend against rank three Martial Emperors by himself.</p>
 <p>Although rank three Martial Emperors were extremely powerful existences in the Holy Land of Martialism… they were definitely not the strongest. However… they were definitely not weak either. After all, the Clan Chiefs of the Four Great Imperial Clans and the King Monstrous Dragon Race’s Clan Chief Yaojiao Guang were all only rank three Martial Emperors.</p>
 <p>“Very well, time doesn’t wait. Let’s set off for the Ximen Imperial Clan immediately. I’ll teach you how to use the medicinal pellet on the way there,” Duan Jidao said.</p>
 <p>“Okay, we shall do as senior Duan suggested,” Chu Feng nodded.</p>
 <p>“Soldiers and warriors of the King Monstrous Dragon Race, listen up! Proceed for the Ximen Imperial Clan!” Yaojiao Guang shouted.</p>
 <p>Then, the eight enormous dragons began to open a path toward the Ximen Imperial Clan. Chu Feng and the experts from the World’s Hidden Valley were all sitting atop the eight enormous dragons. They were rapidly traveling to the Ximen Imperial Clan.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, this is that Ancient Era’s medicinal pellet,” On the way there, Duan Jidao took out a medicinal pellet and handed it to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing the medicinal pellet in Duan Jidao’s hand, Chu Feng’s eyes shone. Although the medicinal pellet was black all around, and did not resemble anything special, and was unnoticable and even resembled a ball of clay, Chu Feng’s heart was extremely excited the moment he saw that medicinal pellet. The Natural Energies contained within this medicinal pellet had reached an unfathomable level.</p>
 <p>“Senior, where did you obtain this medicinal pellet?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“This medicinal pellet is something left behind by Lord Emperor Huang. All I know is that it is from the Ancient Era. I do not know its origin,” Duan Jidao said.</p>
 <p>“Are there any more of these sorts of medicinal pellets?” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“When I obtained them, there were only two. I used one as a experiment, and helped one of my clansmen. Currently, this medicinal pellet is the only one remaining,” Duan Jidao said.</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Chu Feng felt pity in his heart.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, rest assured. That clansman of mine possessed a talent greatly inferior to yours. At that time, he just so happened to be a rank eight Half Martial Emperor too. After he used the medicinal pellet, his cultivation persisted for an entire month and half. Furthermore, he received absolutely no side effects or any backlash. Thus, you can use this medicinal pellet without any worries,” Duan Jidao continued.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, senior,” Chu Feng received the medicinal pellet. He directly opened his mouth, tossed the medicinal pellet into his mouth and then swallowed it.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, quickly, vomit it out,” Duan Jidao was greatly shocked by this scene. Although that Ancient Era’s medicinal pellet possessed no side effects, it must be used alongside the special spirit formation. To directly swallow it like he did was equivalent to courting death.</p>
 <p>Thus, at that moment, it was not only Duan Jidao that was shocked, Hong Qiang, Yin Gongfu, Yaojiao Guang, Jiang Wushang and the others were all deeply frightened by Chu Feng’s actions. They hurriedly arrived before Chu Feng to see if they were able to help him with anything.</p>
 <p>“Buzz~~~”</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, Chu Feng’s body actually started to glimmer faintly. Soon, Chu Feng’s aura started to surge. From rank eight Half Martial Emperor, his aura was now that of a rank nine Half Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng, you!!!”</p>
 <p>Seeing such a change happening to Chu Feng, even Duan Jidao’s expression took a huge change. Disbelief filled his gaze. Even his breathing became hurried.</p>
 <p>“Succeeded? He actually succeeded this quickly?” Seeing that Chu Feng was not only fine, but had also successfully increased his cultivation, the crowd finally heaved a sigh of relief. At the same time, smiles of joy appeared on their faces.</p>
 <p>“No, the situation with little friend Chu Feng is amiss,” However, the expression of shock on Duan Jidao did not decrease, and instead increased.</p>
 <p>“Amiss? Lord Duan, what is amiss?” Hearing Duan Jidao saying those words, Yin Gongfu and the others started to panic again. Merely, none of them knew exactly what was wrong with Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Little friend Chu Feng has not borrowed the power of the medicinal pellet to temporarily increase his cultivation. Rather, he has refined the medicinal pellet and permanently increased his cultivation.”</p>
 <p>“What?!!!” Hearing those words, the crowd all opened their mouths wide in shock. They turned their gazes to Chu Feng and began to have a look at him again.</p>
 <p>When they saw him again, they became even more shocked. The reason for that was because Chu Feng’s aura was extremely stable, and simply did not resemble the aura of someone who had obtained temporary power after using a medicinal pellet. Instead, it appeared more like his own power.</p>
 <p>“Senior Duan, thank you for that medicinal pellet,” At that moment, Chu Feng opened his eyes. With a beaming smile on his face, he clasped his fist and bowed to Duan Jidao. He was extremely grateful to Duan Jidao, for it was precisely because of Duan Jidao’s medicinal pellet that he had managed to increase his cultivation to rank nine Half Martial Emperor.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Chu Feng felt pity. If both of the Ancient Era’s medicinal pellets were still present, then even if he could not break through to Martial Emperor, it would also build a great foundation for his future breakthrough.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, you really managed to reach a breakthrough by using that medicinal pellet?” Yaojiao Guang and the others all looked to Chu Feng with expressions of shock on their faces.</p>
 <p>“Seniors, I actually possess a special bloodline. Although even I do not know what sort of bloodline I possess.”</p>
 <p>“However, one thing is certain. That is, my bloodline greatly resembles Imperial Bloodlines. As long as I possess a sufficient amount of cultivation resources, I will be able to rapidly increase my cultivation.”</p>
 <p>“The medicinal pellet that senior Duan gave me earlier contained an extremely dense amount of Natural Energies. With that, I was able to increase my cultivation by a level,” Chu Feng did not try to conceal anything, and spoke the truth to the crowd.</p>
 <p>“But… even for Imperial Bloodlines, they will only be able to refine a certain amount of cultivation resources. They are not able to refine all cultivation resources given to them. That medicinal pellet is definitely not something within the criterion of cultivation resources which Imperial Bloodlines can refine,” Jiang Wushang said.</p>
 <p>Jiang Wushang was the possessor of an Imperial Bloodline. Thus, he knew of the characteristics of Imperial Bloodlines . While it was as Chu Feng had said, and those who possessed Imperial Bloodlines were capable of refining cultivation resources to increase their cultivation, there were a lot of restrictions. Chu Feng’s bloodline was simply much more frightening than Imperial Bloodlines.</p>
 <p>It could be said that the two of them were simply incomparable.</p>
