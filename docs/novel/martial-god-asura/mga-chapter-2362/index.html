 <p><strong> Chapter 2362 - Zhao Hong Revealing Her Might</strong></p>
 <p>“What arrogance. I will have you die here.”</p>
 <p>Zhao Hong’s insult toward Heavenly Bloodlines once again angered that Kong Cheng.</p>
 <p>With a furious shout from Kong Cheng, surging lightning began to emit from his body. The nine colored lightnings began to interweave with one another, forming a dazzling armor of lightning on his body. At the same time, the lightning began to sprout a pair of wings on his back.</p>
 <p>The Thunder Armor and Thunder Wings were the symbol of Heavenly Bloodline possessors. Once the two of them were unleashed, one’s cultivation would instantly increase by two levels.</p>
 <p>At that moment, that Kong Cheng’s aura was no longer that of a rank one Martial Ancestor. Instead, it was that of a rank three Martial Ancestor. Adding on his heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting four levels of cultivation, and his strength was now on par with ordinary rank seven Martial Ancestors.</p>
 <p>“Ignorant bastard. You dare look down on us Heavenly Bloodline possessors? Do you not know how powerful our Heavenly Bloodline is now?”</p>
 <p>“Did you really think that just because your cultivation was the same as our big brother Kong Cheng’s that you would be able to contend against our big brother Kong Cheng?”</p>
 <p>“Ignorant fool! Our Heavenly Bloodline is the greatest bloodline in the world. Even if you possess the same level of cultivation, you are still a powerless ant when before a Heavenly Bloodline possessor. You will not be able to withstand a single blow.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, before Kong Cheng could say anything, that rank six Half Martial Ancestor-level young man from the Kong Heavenly Clan shouted complacently.</p>
 <p>At that moment, all those that were knocked flying by Zhao Hong earlier revealed delighted smiles on their faces.</p>
 <p>Although Zhao Hong had beaten them up like a fierce tiger oppressing a bunch of white hares, they knew that Zhao Hong would undoubtedly be defeated by Kong Cheng. The reason for that was because the disparity between the two of them was simply too enormous.</p>
 <p>“Against someone of your level, there is simply no need for your mother, I, to personally take care of you.”</p>
 <p>However, right at that moment when the group was feeling immensely proud and thinking that victory was at hand, a world spirit gate suddenly appeared before Zhao Hong. Following that, two huge monsters walked out of the world spirit gate.</p>
 <p>Those were two Fairy Spirit World, world spirits. Both of them were surging with immortal airs. Like two celestial bodyguards, they stood aggressively before Zhao Hong, protecting her.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing those two world spirits, not to mention the others, even Chu Feng’s expression changed.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was because Chu Feng had fought against Zhao Hong before. At that time, the world spirit that Zhao Hong had summoned was a rank three Martial Ancestor world spirit.</p>
 <p>However, this time around, the two world spirits that Zhao Hong summoned were different from the one she had summoned that time around.</p>
 <p>Those two world spirits were of different genders. They appeared like lovers, and were well-matched with one another.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, those two world spirits were rank four Martial Ancestors.</p>
 <p>In addition to their rank four Martial Ancestor-level cultivation, the two world spirits emitted a heaven-defying battle power capable of surmounting three levels of cultivations. In other words, these two world spirits both possessed the ability to contend against ordinary rank seven Martial Ancestors.</p>
 <p>“This woman, s-she actually possesses such powerful world spirits?”</p>
 <p>“Exactly who is she?”</p>
 <p>At that moment, those previously complacent people from the younger generation started to panic. The reason for that was because the auras of those two world spirits were simply too powerful. Neither of them seemed to be inferior to Kong Cheng.</p>
 <p>“Properly teach that ignorant fellow for me. Have him experience your strength,” Zhao Hong ordered.</p>
 <p>“Yes,” The two Fairy Spirit Worlds’ world spirits answered obediently. Then, both of them took out long whips and began to rush to attack Kong Cheng.</p>
 <p>“Don’t you underestimate me,” Kong Cheng was not to be outdone. With a flip of his wrist, he took out an Incomplete Ancestral Armament. Then, he rushed to confront the two world spirits.</p>
 <p>“Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom~~~”</p>
 <p>Rumbles began to sound all over. Oppressive might was surging all over as the three powerful Martial Ancestors collided with one another.</p>
 <p>The two world spirits were extremely well-coordinated. They worked perfectly with one another as they fought two against one.</p>
 <p>As for Kong Cheng, he relied on the strength of his Incomplete Ancestral Armament and began to unleash martial skills in succession to confront the two world spirits.</p>
 <p>Although Kong Cheng was already a Martial Ancestor, his Incomplete Ancestral Armament was still capable of increasing his battle power. The reason why he took out his Incomplete Ancestral Armament right away was precisely because he wanted to rely on the power of his Incomplete Ancestral Armament to suppress the two world spirits.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, those two world spirits were simply too powerful. Furthermore, they had grasped powerful offensive abilities. Thus, even though Kong Cheng had already increased his strength with his Incomplete Ancestral Armament, he was still unable to subdue the two world spirits, and could only fight them to a stalemate.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, go ahead and ask what you want to ask. Leave this Kong Cheng to me,” Zhao Hong said to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Chu Feng turned his gaze to that man by the name of Zhao Yu again.</p>
 <p>“Big brother, please don’t kill me, spare me, please spare my life!!!” That Zhao Yu was extremely frightened after seeing how powerful Chu Feng and Zhao Hong were. He hurriedly knelt on the ground and began to kowtow to Chu Feng while begging him to spare him.</p>
 <p>“Stand up. I only want you to answer my questions. As long as you answer them honestly, I will absolutely not bring harm to you,” Chu Feng said.</p>
 <p>“Big brother, as long as you don’t harm me, I will tell you anything you want to know,” Zhao Yu stood up and said to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“When and where did you encounter the two women that you described earlier? Tell me honestly,” Chu Feng asked.</p>
 <p>The reason why Chu Feng was so concerned with the two women was because he was overjoyed upon hearing the descriptions given by Zhao Yu. The reason for that was because the women in Zhao Yu’s description truly resembled the descriptions of Su Rou and Su Mei.</p>
 <p>Back in the Holy Land of Martialism, Su Rou and Su Mei had been possessed by the Moon Immortal and had their bodies forcibly occupied by her.</p>
 <p>Later on, the two of them had disappeared. However, it was said that they had proceeded toward the Outer World. However, it seemed that the Moon Immortal had used a different sort of method to proceed to the Outer World. Thus, Chu Feng was unable to be certain as to whether or not the Moon Immortal had arrived in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p>
 <p>Thus, at the beginning, Chu Feng felt that it was very unlikely that he would find Su Rou and Su Mei in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm.</p>
 <p>However, after hearing the description provided by that man, Chu Feng saw a trace of hope. Although he was unable to be certain, it remained a possibility.</p>
 <p>That is, the Moon Immortal was in the Hundred Refinements Ordinary Realm. Furthermore, it was very possible that she was at the Drought Demon’s Damned Pond.</p>
 <p>“Big brother, so you were actually interested in those two women? Hehe, you should’ve said that sooner. You scared me to death.”</p>
 <p>“Actually, as we’re both men, I can understand you. After all, those two girls are truly too good-looking,” That Zhao Yu said with a mischievous laugh.</p>
 <p>“Get to the point. If you dare spout superfluous words again, I will cut off your tongue,” Chu Feng narrowed his brows and spoke in a relatively angry manner.</p>
 <p>“Don’t, don’t, don’t. I’ll speak right away,” Seeing that Chu Feng was angry, that Zhao Yu was so scared that his complexion changed. He did not dare to say anymore impudent words, and began to narrate his whole encounter with the two women to Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>It turned out that this Zhao Yu’s master was not someone to be trifled with. He was a Martial Ancestor-level expert.</p>
 <p>It was precisely because of his master’s special status that Zhao Yu came to know Kong Cheng and the others, these people of the younger generation with extraordinary statuses.</p>
 <p>A while ago, this Zhao Yu’s master had needed an item. As for that item, someone had once obtained it at the Drought Demon’s Damned Pond.</p>
 <p>However, his master needed to enter closed-door training, and could not personally go there. As such, he had ordered Zhao Yu to go and search for that item.</p>
 <p>Although Zhao Yu had failed to discover the item, Zhao Yu had found two women at the Drought Demon’s Damned Pond.</p>
 <p>Those two women had not possessed powerful cultivations; they had only been rank two Half Martial Ancestors. However, had been were training when Zhao Yu had encountered them. Furthermore, the two of them had emitted extraordinary power while training.</p>
 <p>Although Zhao Yu was not very strong, he had followed his master all over the place. Thus, he had gained some knowledge.</p>
 <p>At that time, he was able ascertain that the power he felt was from some sort of treasure. Most likely, those two women were training in some sort of technique by relying on that treasure.</p>
 <p>Zhao Yu was also a rank two Half Martial Ancestor like the two women. However, as those two women possessed some sort of treasure, Zhao Yu did not dare to act blindly without thinking.</p>
 <p>Thus, he had hurriedly rushed back to find his master. Unfortunately, Zhao Yu’s master was still in closed-door training, and Zhao Yu had no idea when his master would come out of his closed-door training.</p>
 <p>As Zhao Yu was afraid that those two women would leave should he take too long, he ended up requesting help from Kong Cheng and the others.</p>
 <p>That was why he had led Kong Cheng and the others over. Actually, their actual purpose in coming was to snatch away the cultivation treasure from those two women.</p>
 <p>“Where did you encounter those two women?” Chu Feng asked coldly.</p>
 <p>“This… it’s been so long, I can’t remember the location clearly. Furthermore, it’s uncertain that those two women will be at that same location. As such, I truly don’t know where they are anymore,” Zhao Yu shook his head.</p>
 <p>However, who was Chu Feng? From Zhao Yu’s flickering gaze, Chu Feng was already able to tell that Zhao Yu was lying to him.</p>
 <p>Thus, Chu Feng unleashed his oppressive might and suppressed Zhao Yu, pushing him into the ground and nearly suffocating him in the process.</p>
 <p>Then, with a cold voice, he said, “Speak honestly. Else, I’ll take your life.”</p>
 <p>“Please spare me, I’ll speak, I’ll speak,” Zhao Yu sensed Chu Feng’s killing intent and did not dare to conceal the truth from Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“Zhao Yu, if you dare speak, I will definitely not spare you!” However, right at that moment, that Kong Cheng’s voice sounded.</p>
