 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 3553 - Terrifying Goal</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a series of inquiries, Chu Feng learned that the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s peak experts were practically all killed in the battle back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bunch of Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen that they’d encountered could not be considered to belong to the actual Blood-devouring Demon Clan. At most, they could only be considered a very small branch clan. That was also the reason why they were able to survive without being discovered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That said, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan still possessed very abundant resources. By relying on the cultivation methods left behind by their forefathers and secretly recuperating their strength for thousands of years, the Blood-devouring Demon Clan now numbered over a hundred thousand clansmen. Furthermore, they had managed to nurture many experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The current Blood-devouring Demon Clan was most definitely not an existence the powers of the Great Chiliocosm Upper Realm could contend against. They were so powerful that they could play a role in the entire Ancestral Martial Starfield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The number of Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen that had arrived at the Void Sacred Tree was not a lot, only three thousand. However, those three thousand were all the elites of the current Blood-devouring Demon Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had travelled there following their clan chief. As for their purpose, it was precisely to revitalize their Blood-devouring Demon Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Void Sacred Tree had an inseparable connection with their Blood-devouring Demon Clan. That said, as to what exactly that inseparable connection was, clansmen of their level had no idea at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That said, this Blood-devouring Demon Clansman also revealed why they were trying to capture people from the Starfall Holy Land and Ghost Sect Hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, they were not only targeting people from the Starfall Holy Land and Ghost Sect Hall. Instead, they wanted to capture all of the people that entered the Void Sacred Tree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They intended to refine the souls of the people that they’d captured. Using the living souls, they planned to open a gate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They did not know what was inside that gate. However, it was likely related to the revitalization of their Blood-devouring Demon Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng forced several other Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen to answer his questions. However, their responses were all the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">According to Chu Feng’s observations, they were likely not lying. That was likely all that they knew.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After obtaining the information, Chu Feng no longer continued with the torture of the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen. He also did not kill them. Instead, he imprisoned all of them using his world spirit techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, he put away the spirit formation cage that he imprisoned them in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young friend Chu Feng, it is truly thanks to you this time around.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, it should be young master Chu Feng. I have misspoken, I have misspoken.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ghost Sect Hall’s Hall Master, who had watched everything unfold, finally walked over to talk to Chu Feng after seeing that he had finished settling things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Hall Master, you can address me whichever way you prefer. There is no need to be so restrained. Besides, I am a junior, whereas you are my senior,” Chu Feng said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Master. My name is Nangong Lingwen. I pay my respects to young master Chu Feng.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Master brought the elders of the Starfall Holy Land with him and walked over to Chu Feng. He lowered his back and bent his knees to pay enormous respect to Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Holy Master, you must not do this. You are my senior, this is unsuitable for one of your seniority. This junior cannot accept it,” Chu Feng said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If it’s in accordance with seniority, then it is true that I should not have paid such respect to a person of the younger generation, even if it’s a younger generation from the Chu Heavenly Clan.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, it is different for young master Chu Feng. Earlier, the Blood-devouring Demon Clansmen themselves admitted it. They were planning to capture us so that they could refine our souls.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Had it not been for young master Chu Feng saving us, we would all be unable to escape from this calamity. Thus, paying respects to young master Chu Feng would still not be enough to express how grateful I am,” said the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a short exchange of pleasantries, Chu Feng and the others chatted for a bit. After all, the crowd were all very interested in knowing how Chu Feng had grown to become so powerful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that their own paramount Lord Holy Master was actually chatting with Chu Feng with such a respectful look on his face, Song Yunfei felt extremely displeased, whereas Xia Yun’er and the other people of the younger generation were all extremely astonished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, back then, Chu Feng was merely a nameless nobody to them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They had all deeply looked down on him in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, even their Lord Holy Master was acting so respectfully toward him. As for them… they could only look on from the sidelines, and were unqualified to even interrupt their conversation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Such an enormous disparity made them feel very uncomfortable and unfamiliar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Chu Feng, he did not continue to chat with the seniors for too long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had learned about the terrifying goal of the Blood-devouring Demon Clan, and was very worried about his clansmen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, after a short conversation, Chu Feng spoke his intentions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng told the people from the Starfall Holy Land and the Ghost Sect Hall to return to the Starfall Holy Stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He said that he would set up a spirit formation that would conceal the Starfall Holy Stone so that they could remain safe inside it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it was when they had just entered the Void Sacred Tree, the Starfall Holy Land would definitely not agree to hide like that. After all, they would miss out on a rare opportunity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, after experiencing what had just happened and learning about the Blood-devouring Demon Clan’s terrifying goal, they learned that the Void Sacred Tree was extremely dangerous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, they gladly accepted Chu Feng’s proposal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that he was about to leave, Xia Yun’er’s heart was burning with anxiety. She had finally managed to see Chu Feng again, and deeply wished to speak with him. Yet, she did not know how to start a conversation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was instead Chu Feng who noticed her behavior, and looked to her. “Girl, are you free?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah?” Xia Yun’er was caught somewhat off-guard by Chu Feng suddenly speaking to her. However, once she reacted to what he had said, she immediately nodded repeatedly, “Free, I’m free.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Daughter, who had always acted very natural and unrestrained, had actually lost her composure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This came as a surprise to all the people that knew her well. However, upon recalling that the person she was answering was a person of the younger generation that was stronger than even their Holy Master, they seemed to be able to understand why she would react like that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To a greater or lesser degree, they were all able to tell what she thought of Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides, the Chu Feng before them was so outstanding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Senior Holy Master, if you don't mind, this junior wishes to bring your Holy Daughter with me for a bit. That said, it will not be too long. Furthermore, I guarantee that she will return safely,” Chu Feng said to the Holy Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not at all, I don’t mind at all,” the Starfall Holy Land’s Holy Master not only did not mind in the slightest, but he was even smiling brilliantly. His expression seemed to be stating ‘You’d best bring our Holy Daughter away with you and take her as your wife.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, Chu Feng brought Xia Yun’er to a place that was far from the crowd, yet rather safe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chu Feng looked at the beauty beside him, the beauty who women would feel envious toward and men would be completely infatuated with, and sighed emotionally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xia Yun’er was truly very beautiful. She possessed both looks, charm and temperament.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the reason why Chu Feng sighed emotionally was not due to her beauty. Instead, it was because he was recalling all that had happened between them back then.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Never would I have expected that you’d be this attentive,” said Xia Yun’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh? What do you mean by that?” Chu Feng pretended to be stupid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You should’ve detected that it was I who wanted to say something to you. However, I found it embarrassing to open my mouth, so that’s why you deliberately brought me here, isn’t it?” said Xia Yun’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No, that’s not it. It is I who wants to say something to you,” said Chu Feng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is that so? What do you want to say?” A slight look of anticipation appeared in Xia Yun’er’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you for taking care of me back then,” Chu Feng said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Pfff…” Xia Yun’er mouth widened, and she nearly laughed out loud. Then, she looked at Chu Feng, “Are you certain that I was taking care of you back then and not bullying you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I feel that what you did back then was pretty good. After all, they’ve become my beautiful memories,” Chu Feng smiled as if he was truly reminiscing about the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Chu Feng like that, Xia Yun’er felt very relieved and joyous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Actually, Xia Yun’er had thought about what Chu Feng would be like when she met him again a lot of times. She had thought about how he would react to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was not afraid that he would become weak, and even less afraid that he would become strong. What she feared was that Chu Feng would become cold and detached toward her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was the reason why she felt so relieved and joyous. What she was most worried about did not occur. Chu Feng was still as affable toward her as before. In fact, he was even more friendly to her than before. It was like they were old friends.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are truly different from the others,” Xia Yun’er blurted out.</span></p>
