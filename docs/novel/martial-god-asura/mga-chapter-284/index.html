 <p><strong>MGA: Chapter 284 - A Tooth for a Tooth</strong></p>
 <p>After hearing the words from the head of the Jade Maiden&nbsp;School, Dugu Aoyun’s face instantly changed. The fists within his robe tightly clenched and a cold glare emerged into his eyes as he swept his gaze over Chu Feng who still on the tall stage.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Chu Feng also tightly stared at Dugu Aoyun with an equally cold gaze, and within his gaze, strands of killing intent were surging as well.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, it’s your turn now. According to the rules, you have the chance to challenge Fenghao. Will you challenge him, or will you give this chance up?” At the same time, the head of the Lingyun School, Yan Yangtian, smiled as he looked towards Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>At that instant, everyone cast their gazes towards Chu Feng. Li Zhangqing’s defeat was already a lesson given in blood. Everyone could see that the Lingyun School was intentionally singling out Li Zhangqing and Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>At this time, the best choice for Chu Feng was to give up. Or else, everyone did believe that Fenghao who had superior strength over Chu Feng was certainly going to act similarly to how Dugu Aoyun acted towards Li Zhangqing in order to make Chu Feng pay a painful price.</p>
 <p>However, Chu Feng only sneered as he faced Yan Yangtian’s question and said, “I will let you know what my choice is.”</p>
 <p>*whoosh*</p>
 <p>After speaking, Chu Feng leaped and he dashed onto the fighting stage that Fenghao was on. He even said to Fenghao, “It seems that your body has recovered quite well huh? I even thought that you became a cripple and I never would have expected that you could still participate in this Hundred School Gathering.”</p>
 <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
 <p>After hearing those words, the colour of Fenghao’s face changed greatly because he understood what Chu Feng meant by his words. Around half a year ago, within the Valley of Hundred Bends, during a fight over Profound medicines, Fenghao was crippled and he almost died because of a person who called himself as Asura.</p>
 <p>Although his current body was already recovered due to the vast resources from the Lingyun School, the thing that happened that day was pain that would remain forever in his heart. It was a taint that could not be wiped away and the male called Asura left a shadow in his heart.</p>
 <p>Chu Feng did not reply to Fenghao’s question. He only coldly smiled and said, “It’s not much. I just want to tell you that you better prepare yourself for getting crippled.”</p>
 <p>“Nonsense. With your cultivation of the 9th level of the Origin realm, you want to cripple me? I can squish you to death with one hand.” Fenghao was completely enraged by Chu Feng. He extended his big hand out, and he palmed towards Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>That palm was not a martial skill, but it was an attack from the condensation of his cultivation of the 6th level of the Profound realm as well as the combination of his Mysterious Technique. Its power was extremely frightening.</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, be a bit careful. Fenghao can’t be compared to Gong Luyun. He is a truly genius so do not be careless since you are only using your own cultivation to fight against him.” At that instant, Eggy reminded solemnly.</p>
 <p>“Hmph. At first when I borrowed you power, I could beat him like a dog. Right now, I can still do it as well.”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng coldly snored. He did not dodge Fenghao’s palm. Rather, he turned his hand and threw out a punch, and with Origin power fighting against Profound power, he counterattacked Fenghao.</p>
 <p>“Is Chu Feng insane? He is actually going to fight against Fenghao who is in the 6th level of the Profound realm with the cultivation of the Origin realm?” That scene frightened everyone because Chu Feng was simply looking for a path of death.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Baixi and the others from the Jade Maiden&nbsp;School, the head of the Swordless School, as well as the number one disciple of the Swordless School, Nangong Xiao, stared at Chu Feng with complex gazes.</p>
 <p>They who had seen Chu Feng’s super strong battle power really wanted to know what stage Chu Feng’s strength reached, and whether he was able to fight against the number two disciple of the Lingyun School.</p>
 <p>Under the gazes of countless people, Chu Feng’s Origin power displayed extremely strong battle power. Not only was it not destroyed, rather, as the crowd was staring, it dispelled Fenghao’s might from his fist.</p>
 <p>*whoosh* After dispelling Fenghao’s attack, Chu Feng took the lead to attack. It flashed under his feet, and like an arrow leaving a bow, his entire body shot towards Fenghao.</p>
 <p>“You are really looking to die.”</p>
 <p>Seeing that, Fenghao did not restrain himself anymore. The Profound power from his body violently surged out and became innumerable huge Profound power hands. The huge hands extended, and started to claw and slam onto Chu Feng.</p>
 <p>“You think you are able to stop me with this tiny little method?” Chu Feng’s fury rose to the skies and he did not even have the slightest intention to retreat. He continued charging forward as usual, and as he operated the high-level Mysterious Technique, his body’s battle power increased again and he already infinitely neared the 1st level of the Profound realm.</p>
 <p>Following that, one of his hands clenched into a fist, and a golden-coloured big blade was condensed into his hand. He chopped towards the incoming huge hand, and as the golden light flickered, the huge hands that unceasingly came towards him were all cut.</p>
 <p>“Heavens. This Chu Feng can really fight around Fenghao who is in the 6th level of the Profound realm with the cultivation of the 9th level of the Origin realm.”</p>
 <p>“This isn’t right. Not only that, but Chu Feng is clearly only using a rank 5 martial skill, but Fenghao is using the famous rank 6 martial skill from the Lingyun School, the Ten Thousand Spider Hands.”</p>
 <p>“The difference in power between the two martial skills should be extremely huge. But Chu Feng, at this instant, is pressuring Fenghao’s rank 6 martial skill with his rank 5 martial skill. How can Chu Feng have such terrifying battle power?”</p>
 <p>The strength that Chu Feng showed stunned everyone. Not to mention the people from the various schools, even the Twelve Protectors of the Lingyun School, including the number one disciple Dugu Aoyun as well as the school head Yan Yangtian lit up their eyes and they were dumbfounded by Chu Feng’s battle power.</p>
 <p>However, compared to the observers, Fenghao who was facing Chu Feng who was approaching started to panic a bit because at that instant, he felt a familiar pressuring feeling from Chu Feng’s body.</p>
 <p>He had felt that pressure roughly half a year ago. It was from the mysterious person who almost killed him in the Valley of Hundred Bends, Asura.</p>
 <p>“You...You are?!!” At that instant, Fenghao finally reacted to it. He looked at Chu Feng while being astounded and his gaze was filled with fear.</p>
 <p>“You have guessed correctly!” But Chu Feng who had already dashed in front of Fenghao did not give him the chance to finish speaking. The big blade in his hand became two golden blurs again, and after he brushed past Fenghao, two rows of blood splattered and both of Fenghao’s arms were cut off as they fell to the ground.</p>
 <p>“Ahh~~~” With a short delay, Fenghao looked at his chopped off arms and he rolled around on the ground with deathly sorrow and he painfully howled.</p>
 <p>“This...this Chu Feng has actually... actually cut off both of Fenghao’s arms!”</p>
 <p>“This means that the rumours before were true, and Chu Feng really has battle power that can surpass multiple levels. With the cultivation of the 9th level of the Origin realm, he defeated Fenghao who is in the 6th level of the Profound realm, and he even defeated him so easily!”</p>
 <p>Chu Feng’s methods were seen completely clearly by everyone and they were all dumbstruck by the battle power he displayed because that terrifying battle power was unseen before by them. It caused them to feel disbelief at that very instant, and they even doubted whether everything was true or not.</p>
 <p>But compared to the pure astonishment of the crowd, the people from the Lingyun School had anger that rose to the heavens and they pointed at Chu Feng and angrily rebuked,</p>
 <p>“Chu Feng, this is outrageous! It is only a small fight, yet you do such poisonous attacks! You will pay the price for your actions.” As they spoke, the disciples and elders from the Lingyun School surged up together and surrounded the fighting stage that Chu Feng and Fenghao was on.</p>
 <p>Seeing that the people from the Lingyun School were angered, the people who weren’t from the Lingyun School were frightened, and they couldn’t avoid adding some pity into the gazes that they looked at Chu Feng with.</p>
 <p>Because within the Azure Province, other than the Qilin Prince’s Mansion, the Lingyun School was the boss. When Chu Feng treated Fenghao in such a way, not only did he harm Fenghao, he also hit the face of the Lingyun School. Naturally, they wouldn’t so easily let him go so everyone felt that Chu Feng had a disaster coming his way.</p>
 <p>But compared to the worries of the observers, Chu Feng who was surrounded was not afraid in the slightest. He disdainfully said, “It is but a tooth for a tooth!”</p>
