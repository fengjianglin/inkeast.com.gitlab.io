 <p>[Through a series of events, you have obtained a written oath from the leading organizations of Paradise.]</p>
 <p>[You have also identified and removed some of the traitors in Paradise.]</p>
 <p>[In addition, you helped the royal family gain the authority to manage the settings of Earthlings.]</p>
 <p>[I acknowledge that you have used the above three methods to forcefully change the Earthlings to some extent.]</p>
 <p>Gula’s voice paused for a moment.</p>
 <p>[…However.]</p>
 <p>The voice continued with a sigh.</p>
 <p>[Those who have changed are only a fraction of the total.]</p>
 <p>[Humanity still bears a grave problem.]</p>
 <p>[Because it has a problem, it isn’t perfect. Because it isn’t perfect, the change isn’t complete.]</p>
 <p>[Therefore, you have yet to pass the trial to become my apostle.]</p>
 <p>Her words were like a death sentence to him.</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu shut his eyes.</p>
 <p>He had hoped his premonition would prove false.</p>
 <p>But Gula’s declaration just now only proved him right.</p>
 <p>What drove him even more crazy was that he had no idea what went wrong.</p>
 <p>‘So… What more do I need to do?’</p>
 <p>[…]</p>
 <p>‘How close am I to the problem?’</p>
 <p>[…]</p>
 <p>There was no response from Gula. But Seol Jihu didn’t mind, because he had never expected one from the start.</p>
 <p>Because of the principle of causality, the Seven Sins were unable to interfere freely in this world where the Parasite Queen had become the Chief Deity.</p>
 <p>If Gula suggested a way to solve the existing problem, the Parasites would gain something in return for it.</p>
 <p>Just like how the Parasites’ invasion of Paradise caused Earthlings to be summoned and the Fallen Angels to emerge.</p>
 <p>‘Such an annoying law,’ Seol Jihu thought to himself.</p>
 <p>[You were close in terms of physical distance.]</p>
 <p>This was the best she could tell him.</p>
 <p>Physical distance.</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu let out a chuckle.</p>
 <p>So it could have been one of the thousands of people he had passed on the street.</p>
 <p>[I’m sorry.]</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu shook his head.</p>
 <p>He knew Gula wasn’t doing this on purpose.</p>
 <p>He could only blame the former Chief Deity for getting devoured by the invaders.</p>
 <p>‘…I understand.’</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu bowed and then left with Little Chick.<br><br></p>
 <p>*</p>
 <p><br>“Hey, Bouncy.”</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu spoke to Little Chick as he walked out of Gula’s Temple.</p>
 <p>“When do you think you’ll be able to unlock the Spear of Purity to its fourth stage?”</p>
 <p>Little Chick, who was standing on Seol Jihu’s shoulder picking at his down, glanced sideways.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know….”</p>
 <p>It crossed its wings and tilted its head.</p>
 <p>“First tell me why you suddenly brought this up. I thought you haven’t been paying much attention to it lately.”</p>
 <p>“I think I might need it soon.”</p>
 <p>“Need it….”</p>
 <p>Little Chick tilted its head and smacked its beak.</p>
 <p>“I’m not sure.”</p>
 <p>“?”</p>
 <p>“As you know, I’m a Spirit born under the protection of Castitas, one of the Seven Virtues. As a pursuer of everything good and orderly… Judging from your recent moves, I can’t help but hesitate.”</p>
 <p>“…”</p>
 <p>“In regards to the current situation, do you consider yourself good and lawful?”</p>
 <p>“No. Not at all.”</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu immediately shook his head.</p>
 <p>Him, good and lawful? That was enough to make a cat laugh.</p>
 <p>“I’m glad if that’s what you really think. Anyway, in my opinion, you’re hardly neutral. If I had to be completely honest, I’d say you lean towards chaotic evil.”</p>
 <p>Little Chick continued.</p>
 <p>“To control evil by evil. Considering the situation in Paradise, which is dominated by the Seven Sins, I guess that could be a valid method. So I’m going to wait before I make up my mind.”</p>
 <p>“Until when?”</p>
 <p>“Until I see for myself the consequences of your actions and the changes they bring.”</p>
 <p>It was rare for him to present such accurate standards.</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu was surprised.</p>
 <p>In the past, whenever Seol Jihu brought up this topic, Little Chick used to get angry, saying he was expecting more than he deserved. So why the sudden change?</p>
 <p>“I see your standards have become quite generous. Wasn’t ability also an important factor in the evaluation?”</p>
 <p>“Well, that’s….”</p>
 <p>One of Little Chick’s eyes slowly widened.</p>
 <p>“In terms of ability, you could probably breeze through two stages right now.”</p>
 <p>“Really?”</p>
 <p>“You’ve suffered enough on the Path of the Soul and cultivated yourself with a discipline that befits the fourth and fifth stage. So I’m not worried about your skills.”</p>
 <p>Little Chick snorted.</p>
 <p>“The truth is, when I saw you for the first time after you passed the trial, I debated with myself over whether or not to unlock the fourth stage. I’m sure you won’t let the Spear of Purity shake you now.”</p>
 <p>In short, his ability was sufficient, but his character left much to be debated.</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu nodded. Somehow he felt better knowing that.</p>
 <p>That’s right. He couldn’t just sit idly by and watch everything he’d built up so far go to waste.</p>
 <p>The goal was clear. All he had to do now was try his best to achieve that goal.</p>
 <p>He swore to himself to break all the traps the enemy had laid out, as he had done so far.</p>
 <p><em>Slap!</em></p>
 <p>Seol Jihu slapped himself to snap out of it.</p>
 <p>“Alright. Let’s go.”</p>
 <p>Full of determination, he began to descend the stairs.<br><br></p>
 <p>*</p>
 <p><br>After the meeting with Sinyoung, everything happened in a flash.</p>
 <p>When the best organization finally succumbed, others rushed to cooperate with Valhalla.</p>
 <p>Odor and Haramark were the first cities to accept Valhalla’s terms and open their borders to the Federation.</p>
 <p>Their quick response prompted representative organizations in other cities to take action as well.</p>
 <p>Caligo’s PAX and Grazia’s Wu Lei, the Star of Wrath, visited Eva to talk to Valhalla, although the latter wasn’t directly related to the attack incident.</p>
 <p>The royal families of each city had no reason to resist the change.</p>
 <p>One of the conditions requested by the Federation was the authority to supervise the settings of Earthlings, which, if accepted, would give the royal families enormous power.</p>
 <p>So all the royal families, except Scheherazade’s, used the Royal Oath and began preparing to welcome the immigrants.</p>
 <p>Everything was going smoothly.</p>
 <p>Except for one thing.</p>
 <p>Sinyoung had been faithfully implementing the terms of the contract, delivering signed oaths and withdrawing its branches from other cities, but made a small mistake regarding Jung Minjong’s extradition.</p>
 <p>Sinyoung first removed Jung Minjong from his post and then summoned him to Paradise, but he refused to comply.</p>
 <p>So they tried to transfer him by force when the police suddenly rushed in and took him away.</p>
 <p>It turned out that he had asked one of his acquaintances to report him missing.</p>
 <p>Usually, it took time for the investigation to begin after the initial report, but the way the police intervened almost immediately made Seol Jihu think it was a premeditated scheme on part of Jung Minjong.</p>
 <p>Yun Seohui informed Seol Jihu that Sinyoung was contacting the police and asked for his understanding.</p>
 <p>Other than that, everything was under easy sail.</p>
 <p>‘It’s lively.’</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu stood on the rooftop of Valhalla’s building and looked down at the city.</p>
 <p>He saw a few Earthlings provide beer and towels to the Dwarves busy repairing the castle wall. In the middle of the main road, there was a Cave Fairy’s shop bustling with Earthling customers looking at displayed items or bargaining prices with the shop owner.</p>
 <p>Wherever his gaze landed, the Federation and humanity had mingled together.</p>
 <p>Eva was flourishing more than ever.</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu smiled as he watched the little fuzzballs out on the street wagging their tails at passersby awarding them with treats.<br><br></p>
 <p>*</p>
 <p><br>The next day, Seol Jihu opened his eyes at the crack of dawn.</p>
 <p>Today was the day he had decided he would return to Earth.</p>
 <p>He hadn’t been home for a long time because of everything that was going on in Paradise.</p>
 <p>His mother and brother must be worried sick.</p>
 <p>His plan was to contact them and meet with them as soon as he returned, then stay on Earth for a day or two to for a change of pace.</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu walked down the stairs to the first floor and stopped.</p>
 <p>Kim Hannah stood by the entrance, looking at him.</p>
 <p>She seemed to have been waiting for him.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on? It’s still early.”</p>
 <p>“You said you were going to Earth today.”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, that’s what I said a few days ago.”</p>
 <p>“There’s something I want to warn you about before you leave. Also, I have a question for you….”</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu blinked in mild confusion.</p>
 <p>The Kim Hannah he knew wouldn’t try to ambush him with a sudden question. She would have just asked him straight up.</p>
 <p>So it seemed that she had stayed up all night wondering whether to ask him this question or not.</p>
 <p>“What is it?”</p>
 <p>“What’s your relationship with Yun Seohui?”</p>
 <p>That came out of nowhere.</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu frowned.</p>
 <p>“Relationship? What do you mean?”</p>
 <p>“Have you ever met or contacted her without my knowledge since you met at the cafe?”</p>
 <p>This confused him even more.</p>
 <p>“No, not even once. I only met with Miss Yun Seora.”</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu shook his head.</p>
 <p>He felt slightly offended because her question seemed to accuse him of secretly dating Yun Seohui.</p>
 <p>“Why do you ask?”</p>
 <p>“You see, I just don’t understand why she acted as she did….”</p>
 <p>“You mean the attack?”</p>
 <p>“No, the meeting.”</p>
 <p>Kim Hannah began with a sigh.</p>
 <p>“Do you remember what Yun Seohui said at the meeting? Her address, I mean.”</p>
 <p>“Address?”</p>
 <p>“You’re the Representative of Valhalla and Yun Seohui is the Representative of Sinyoung. And that meeting wasn’t a personal meeting, it was an official meeting between the two representatives, attended by the members of each organization.”</p>
 <p>She was right.</p>
 <p>“But Yun Seohui, she…. How should I say this? It’s like she spoke to <em>you</em>, not to all of Valhalla, as herself and not as Sinyoung’s Representative.”</p>
 <p>“But she apologized to everyone at the end….”</p>
 <p>“That was after everything was over. Think about it carefully.”</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu searched through his memories.</p>
 <p>[We—<em>I</em> don’t hate Valhalla.]</p>
 <p>[If <em>I</em> really thought badly of <em>you</em>….]</p>
 <p>[<em>I</em> admired you, <em>Representative of Valhalla</em>, for all the incredible achievements you made for the sake of Paradise. <em>I</em> wanted to become your friend and help <em>you</em> in any way I could.]</p>
 <p>[I apologize for the distress and the hurt the recent series of incidents have caused you, <em>Representative of Valhalla</em>.]</p>
 <p>[And <em>I</em> promise in the name of God Invidia to faithfully fulfill the conditions set by Valhalla until <em>your</em> misunderstanding is resolved.]</p>
 <p>It did sound a little strange now that he thought about it.</p>
 <p>She had emphasized herself when she should have spoken for Sinyoung, and Seol Jihu when she should have mentioned Valhalla as a whole.</p>
 <p>It might be nothing, but he couldn’t help but suspect it was on purpose because Yun Seohui was the one who made these remarks.</p>
 <p>“There’s no way she could have made such a mistake. I just think it’s weird….”</p>
 <p>Kim Hannah clicked her tongue and then nodded her head.</p>
 <p>“Anyway, thanks for answering my question. Be careful on Earth. We’ve done everything we can, but who knows?”</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu nodded quietly.</p>
 <p>“…See you later.”</p>
 <p>With that, he left the building.</p>
 <p>Once he arrived at the temple, Seol Jihu stood in front of the warp gate.</p>
 <p>He hesitated for a moment before taking out the tiny piece of paper he had received from a priest.</p>
 <p>He clenched the paper in his fist so that he could tear it right away when needed.</p>
 <p>After a moment of silence, Seol Jihu took a deep breath and buried himself slowly into the portal.<br><br></p>
 <p>*</p>
 <p><br><em>FLASH!</em> Light exploded.</p>
 <p>As soon as the scenery changed, Seol Jihu ducked his head in a hurry.</p>
 <p>Tightening the grip of his hand holding the paper, he rolled across the floor and looked around busily.</p>
 <p>But nothing happened, and no one was nearby.</p>
 <p>“…”</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu got up from the floor with a cough.</p>
 <p>‘That was new.’</p>
 <p>He felt a little humiliated, but he only had one life.</p>
 <p>Only after he kicked open the closet door and peeped into the bathroom with his back against the wall was he finally able to relax.</p>
 <p>“Let’s see…. What the…? Why do I have so many unread texts?”</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu was shocked when he turned on his cell phone.</p>
 <p>There were at least a dozen missed calls and text messages.</p>
 <p>The most recent calls were from his mother and brother.</p>
 <p>In total, there were 12 records left.</p>
 <p>‘Uk. I guess I’ve been gone for too long.’</p>
 <p>He wouldn’t be surprised if they reported him missing.</p>
 <p>Nervously, Seol Jihu clicked on the call button.</p>
 <p>He heard the dial tone, but his mother didn’t pick up.</p>
 <p>The same thing happened with his brother.</p>
 <p>He tried calling them again, but the calls went straight to the automated message announcing that they were unavailable.</p>
 <p>‘They’re probably working right now….’</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu decided to wait a little longer and looked around the room.</p>
 <p>He didn't know what to do, so he turned on the TV and browsed the texts.</p>
 <p>—There was a shooting in downtown Seoul last night. A police officer and a civilian were injured in the process of arresting the suspect. This is reporter Park Johyun.</p>
 <p>‘A shooting? In Korea?’</p>
 <p>Curious, Seol Jihu was about to raise his head but stopped.</p>
 <p>As he had expected, most of the text messages came from Yun Seora.</p>
 <p>[Oppa~ This is Seora. How are you?]</p>
 <p>[You said we should meet up. When can we meet?]</p>
 <p>[Can you give me a call if you get this message?]</p>
 <p>[I heard the news. Unni is resigning…. Thank you. I’ll do my best to help you from now on.]</p>
 <p>[By the way, what are you going to do to Seohui Unni?]</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu gave a light chuckle as he read the text messages one by one.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know~ What should I do?”</p>
 <p>He muttered to himself and tapped on the arrow icon.</p>
 <p>They had promised to hang out a long time ago, but their meeting had yet to take place.</p>
 <p>‘Should I reply?’</p>
 <p>He thought for a moment but decided to read the rest of the messages first. There could be one from his mother or his brother, after all.</p>
 <p>As Seol Jihu slowly browsed through the text messages, his thumb suddenly stopped.</p>
 <p>There were quite a lot of texts from a number he had never seen before in his life, almost as many as Yun Seora’s texts.</p>
 <p>‘Who is this?’</p>
 <p>Led by curiosity, he tapped on one of them.</p>
 <p>[Jihu Oppa. This is Seora.]</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu’s face immediately stiffened.</p>
 <p>[Ignore all the calls and texts from my old number. Even if that number pretends to be me, you shouldn’t trust it.]</p>
 <p>[This number belongs to someone I know and trust. From now on, I’ll only contact you with this number.]</p>
 <p>[Oppa. If you get this text, return to that place immediately. Don’t call this number or my old number, just to be safe.]</p>
 <p>[I know it’s confusing, but please do as I say. I was going to explain it beforehand, but I couldn’t get in touch with you. I’ll tell you everything later.]</p>
 <p>[Don’t worry about Earth. I’ll think of something. Hurry up and leave, Oppa….]</p>
 <p>After Seol Jihu read the last message, he immediately scrolled up through the texts.</p>
 <p>He reread the texts from Yun Seora’s original number.</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu’s face began to tremble as he compared the messages from the two numbers.</p>
 <p>‘What the hell…?’</p>
 <p>He suddenly felt goosebumps all over his body.</p>
 <p>Who was he supposed to trust?</p>
 <p>It was then.</p>
 <p><em>Buzz! Buzz!</em></p>
 <p>His cell phone began to vibrate violently.</p>
