 <p>Yun Seohui signed the contract and passed the pile of papers to the left.</p>
 <p>The middle-aged man, neatly dressed in a suit, bit his lower lip.</p>
 <p>But he couldn’t possibly resist as his boss had already signed before him.</p>
 <p>Finally, the man took the pen out of his pocket and signed the contract papers.</p>
 <p>The same thing repeated. The next recipient signed the documents and handed them over to the person next to him.</p>
 <p>As the pile of contracts moved from left to right, Seol Jihu and Kim Hannah stared at Yun Seohui.</p>
 <p>They pretended to be calm, but the truth was that they were confused.</p>
 <p>They had spent days without any sleep preparing for this meeting, so it felt strange that Yun Seohui accepted their terms without a single objection.</p>
 <p>‘Could it be that….’</p>
 <p>With a light frown, Kim Hannah carefully went over Yun Seohui’s words in her head.</p>
 <p>[Sinyoung made a tentative conclusion concerning this case a few days ago.]</p>
 <p>This meant that Sinyoung had already reached a decision, even before this meeting.</p>
 <p>This was proven by the fact that Sinyoung’s executives were signing the contracts without any resistance, although their faces did look grim.</p>
 <p>‘But why?’</p>
 <p>But this logical conclusion confused her even more.</p>
 <p><em>The</em> Yun Seohui is surrendering without putting up even a token resistance? Really?</p>
 <p>As new questions arose, the pile of contracts reached the far right, and when the last person finished signing, it was delivered back to Yun Seohui.</p>
 <p>Yun Seohui checked the documents one by one and handed the pile over to her assistant.</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu looked down at the pile of contracts that Yun Seohui’s assistant had carefully placed before him.</p>
 <p><em>Flip, flip!</em> He quickly flipped through the papers, his eyes scanning the signatures, before raising his head again to look at Yun Seohui.</p>
 <p>“There’s something I want to tell you if you don’t mind.”</p>
 <p>Their eyes met and Yun Seohui gave a weak smile.</p>
 <p>“It might be a little, no, a lot childish, but… Can I?”</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu tossed her a little nod.</p>
 <p>“We—<em>I</em> don’t hate Valhalla.”</p>
 <p>She doesn’t hate Valhalla?</p>
 <p>One of Seol Jihu’s eyebrows slowly lifted.</p>
 <p>She was right. It did sound childish.</p>
 <p>“I’ve never felt envy or hatred towards Valhalla, nor have I ever considered you my rival. Because the achievements Valhalla has made in recent years are not something that Sinyoung can match.”</p>
 <p>Yun Seohui spoke in a low but articulate voice.</p>
 <p>“Of course, I understand this is sudden and that it may be hard for you to believe me. I have no excuse for that. However….”</p>
 <p>She let out a sigh and cleared her throat.</p>
 <p>“If I really thought badly of you… I would have done something about it a long time ago. Not only in Paradise but also….”</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu’s eyes sharpened.</p>
 <p>Yun Seohui didn’t finish her sentence, but he heard the words she didn't say loud and clear.</p>
 <p>‘But also on Earth.’</p>
 <p>“People who have earned grudges in Paradise often face threats on Earth. It’s a very common occurrence.”</p>
 <p>The atmosphere grew stifling, but Yun Seohui continued without a flinch.</p>
 <p>“You wouldn’t know what happened or how many attempts have been made since the last banquet was held a few years ago, and since you started making a name for yourself in Paradise….”</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu didn’t visit Earth often, but when he did, he never received any threat from anyone.</p>
 <p>Yun Seohui was saying that Sinyoung had been protecting him all along.</p>
 <p>“I’m not saying this to impress you or to convince you to go easy on me. I’m merely stating the fact that I had many chances to betray you, but I chose not to.”</p>
 <p>A faint smile spread across Yun Seohui’s face.</p>
 <p>“Because the thought has never once crossed my mind. I admired you, Representative of Valhalla, for all the incredible achievements you made for the sake of Paradise. I wanted to become your friend and help you in any way I could.”</p>
 <p>She slowly lowered her gaze and continued.</p>
 <p>“Of course, my opinion is mine alone…. There were a few people in Sinyoung who disagreed with me. I saw these people every day, but failed to notice what was going on inside their heads.”</p>
 <p>Yun Seohui closed her eyes.</p>
 <p>“In regards to that… I have no excuse to offer.”</p>
 <p>“So I made my decision before this meeting to let you know my feelings and set the record straight.”</p>
 <p>“Even if it means I have to accept every term that Valhalla offers.”</p>
 <p>With that Yun Seohui slowly rose from her chair.</p>
 <p>And she spoke.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
 <p>She straightened her shoulders…</p>
 <p>“I apologize for the distress and the hurt caused by the recent series of incidents.”</p>
 <p>Clasped her hands in front of her waist…</p>
 <p>“From now on, Sinyoung will do its best to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.”</p>
 <p>And starting at her head…</p>
 <p>“And I promise in the name of God Invidia to faithfully fulfill the conditions set by Valhalla until your misunderstanding is resolved.”</p>
 <p>She bowed 90 degrees, in a polite and humble manner.<br><br></p>
 <p>*</p>
 <p><br>Their meeting ended much earlier than they had expected.</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu tried his best to stay alert until the end, but Yun Seohui’s subsequent remarks made him feel like he was overreacting.</p>
 <p>Yun Seohui promised to get signatures from each of Sinyoung’s employees, and with several executives, she took the time to apologize to each member of Valhalla.</p>
 <p>In the end, she shook hands with Seol Jihu, and, with a shy smile, asked if they could finally be friends.</p>
 <p>Before leaving, Seol Jihu observed Yun Seohui with his Innate Ability.</p>
 <p>She was still shining in five colors, like the last time he saw her.</p>
 <p>But more importantly….</p>
 <p>[5. Level of Cognition]<br>—Enterprising (Takes the initiative in achieving one’s goal)<br>—Given up<br>—Chaotic (Many things are jumbled up and is impossible to unravel)</p>
 <p>The second slot of her Level of Cognition, which represented the emotion she was currently experiencing, stated ‘given up’.</p>
 <p>What exactly had Yun Seohui given up during this meeting?</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu couldn’t find the answer to that question even after the meeting was over.</p>
 <p>On their way back, the members of Valhalla were all in high spirits.</p>
 <p><em>The</em> Sinyoung had given in to their demands. How could they not be glad that it was over?</p>
 <p>“Hey, did you see that? Did you? Sinyoung’s executive director just bowed to us!”</p>
 <p>“Bastards. That’ll teach them not to mess with us.”</p>
 <p>Chohong and Hugo cackled merrily.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know. Something did feel a little off…. When I was in White Rose, I never imagined something like this could happen.”</p>
 <p>Phi Sora seemed skeptical and a little worried.</p>
 <p>Hugo tilted his head in question.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong? She apologized. And she’s super pretty.”</p>
 <p>“Look, if a pretty face could automatically earn forgiveness, I’d be making a living as a notorious criminal by now.”</p>
 <p>“But she signed the agreement. Which means she can’t mess with us now, right? Because of the consequences.”</p>
 <p>“Well, yes….”</p>
 <p>Even Phi Sora couldn’t find any fault with that.</p>
 <p>“I mean, she did swear on her god as a priest…. And our representative basically backed her into a corner…. Makes me think she’s smart, though I’m still not sure if her apology was sincere.”</p>
 <p>She shrugged, concluding that it wouldn’t be a bad idea to keep an eye on Yun Seohui for a while.</p>
 <p>“…”</p>
 <p>Oh Rahee stood staring at the Scheherazade Palace with cold eyes.</p>
 <p>One of her eyebrows raised slightly to reveal her annoyance.</p>
 <p>She stared and stared until their carriages arrived, then felt Seol Jihu’s gaze and turned towards him.</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>“What are you thinking about?”</p>
 <p>“…Nothing.”</p>
 <p>Oh Rahee ran a hand through her hair with a sigh.</p>
 <p>“I just remembered someone from my past.”</p>
 <p>“Your past?”</p>
 <p>“A high school friend. We were part of the same group of friends that did everything together.”</p>
 <p>The topic was unexpected and her tone wasn’t a happy one.</p>
 <p>“Yun Seohui reminds me of that bitch…. The way they talk and the way they act, it’s basically the same.”</p>
 <p>She frowned angrily at the thought of her friend.</p>
 <p>“How are they alike?”</p>
 <p>“How should I describe it? They both have a mask. It’s like… they’re fake, or artificial….”</p>
 <p>Kim Hannah, who was standing next to Seol Jihu, threw a quick glance at Oh Rahee.</p>
 <p>“I can’t pinpoint exactly what’s wrong. Something about them annoys me, but I can’t say what for sure.”</p>
 <p>Oh Rahee shook her head, saying that some of her friends still think of that particular friend as a bright and outgoing person.</p>
 <p>“Anyway, I don’t want to be anywhere near her. It’s the first time I’ve felt this way about someone since Baek Haeju.”</p>
 <p>Oh Rahee, who spat in the direction of the palace, turned towards the carriage.</p>
 <p>“Are you still friends with her?”</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu blurted out.</p>
 <p>Oh Rahee stopped.</p>
 <p>“…Nope.”</p>
 <p>She turned towards him with a little smirk.</p>
 <p>“I cut ties with her a long time ago. It was <em>the</em> best decision of my life, without a doubt.”</p>
 <p>With a smile on her lips, Oh Rahee climbed onto the carriage.</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu followed after her, feeling somewhat restless.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t relax even after settling down in the carriage.</p>
 <p>The result wasn’t bad at all.</p>
 <p>Sinyoung readily accepted Valhalla’s terms, and the signed contract was in his hands.</p>
 <p>She could no longer conspire against Valhalla, at least in Paradise.</p>
 <p>Still, he just couldn’t put his mind at rest.</p>
 <p>After pondering for a while, Seol Jihu concluded that the reason he was anxious was because of his preconceptions about Yun Seohui.</p>
 <p>Come to think of it, Kim Hannah wasn’t the only one who warned him about her.</p>
 <p>[Be careful of Yun Seohui.]</p>
 <p>Black Seol Jihu had said the same thing.</p>
 <p>There must have been a good reason for such a strong-minded and cautious man to say such a thing.</p>
 <p>He also recalled the time he looked at Yun Seohui with Future-Gauging Nine Eyes during the opening ceremony.</p>
 <p>[What’s your reason?]</p>
 <p>[Why does our mighty Spear Demon—why does he hate me so much?]</p>
 <p>[I know you have a grudge against Sinyoung. But don’t you know how hard I tried to ease your heart?]</p>
 <p>[How could you do this to me?]</p>
 <p>[Kill me. Just kill me instead!]</p>
 <p>The words Yun Seohui screamed at Black Seol Jihu….</p>
 <p>[You didn't do anything for me. It was for Sinyoung.]</p>
 <p>[You used my strength to protect your company, and I used you to achieve my goals.]</p>
 <p>[That’s why you threw away everything and desperately clung to me.]</p>
 <p>[Sung Shihyun told me you were a crazy bitch right before he died at my hands. He was right.]</p>
 <p>The words Black Seol Jihu said to Yun Seohui….</p>
 <p>[You got discarded, didn’t you?]</p>
 <p>[I guess you couldn’t enter his fence~]</p>
 <p>[What did I tell you? He’s an uncontrollable lunatic.]</p>
 <p>[You want to, what, break it if you can’t have it? Is that it?]</p>
 <p>And the words Kim Hannah spat at Yun Seohui. He remembered them one by one.</p>
 <p>In Seol Jihu’s opinion, Yun Seohui was definitely not normal.</p>
 <p>She was unpredictable and totally uncontrollable, as evidenced by the fact that she once switched sides to join the Parasites.</p>
 <p>But that was in the past.</p>
 <p>Knowing her present self, Seol Jihu was reluctant to draw conclusions.</p>
 <p>Because….</p>
 <p>‘Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet.’</p>
 <p>Yun Seohui was a woman of five colors.</p>
 <p>He had seen her become an enemy. But he had also seen the exact opposite of that.</p>
 <p>The future in which Yun Seohui, standing beside him as the Executor of Invidia, the Star of Envy, waving her hand at the crowd as they cheered her name.</p>
 <p>‘Maybe.’</p>
 <p>Maybe it was already too late.</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu had forced Yun Seohui to sign the contract and Yun Seohui accepted it.</p>
 <p>The contract basically specified that he chose Yun Seora over Yun Seohui.</p>
 <p>‘…I don’t know.’</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong with you? Are you okay?”</p>
 <p>As Seol Jihu rubbed his forehead, Phi Sora leaned closer and asked.</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu shook his head without a word.</p>
 <p>“Now this is a rare sight. You must really be tired. Do you have a headache? I think the carriage will leave soon. Maybe you should get some sleep, or…. Do you want to lean on me?”</p>
 <p>Phi Sora tapped her shoulder lightly and Seo Yuhui, who was sitting across from them, got up in a hurry.</p>
 <p>It was then.</p>
 <p>“We’re leaving!”</p>
 <p>Just as the wagoner lifted the whip, a hurried knock was heard and the carriage door swung open.</p>
 <p>Not only Seol Jihu but also Phi Sora, and Seo Yuhui, who was forcibly pulling up Phi Sora from her seat, widened their eyes.</p>
 <p>There, a stranger stood, dressed in an oversized cloak with a hood, fidgeting nervously.</p>
 <p>The stranger looked at Seol Jihu and spoke in a hurry.</p>
 <p>“Excuse me, but could you….”</p>
 <p>A thin but low voice escaped the stranger’s lips.</p>
 <p>A moment later, the carriage set off.<br><br></p>
 <p>*</p>
 <p><br>The carriage pulled by four Horuses passed through the eastern gate.</p>
 <p>Half an hour later, the wagoner suddenly changed the direction of the carriage.</p>
 <p>The carriage spun around to the left and headed back towards the city where it had just left.</p>
 <p>This time it moved towards the western gate, instead of the southern gate.</p>
 <p>Soon the carriage stopped at a secluded spot near the gate, and two people in hooded cloaks got off the carriage and began walking towards the city.</p>
 <p>“…Hold on.”</p>
 <p>As Scheherazade neared, Seol Jihu stopped the hooded figure in front of him.</p>
 <p>“Pardon?”</p>
 <p>“Sorry. I just think this will be better.”</p>
 <p>“What do you m…. W-Wait!”</p>
 <p>Seol Jihu literally swept the stranger off her feet, and the stranger wriggled in response.</p>
 <p>“Hold tight.”</p>
 <p>He wrapped his arms around her and raised his mana.</p>
 <p><em>Tong!</em></p>
 <p>With the sound of air exploding, Seol Jihu’s body scattered like the wind.</p>
 <p><em>Tong, tong, tong, tong!</em></p>
 <p>The wind climbed the castle wall and blew into the city, towards the back gate of the Scheherazade Palace.</p>
