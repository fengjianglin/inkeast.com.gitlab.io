 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When people are posed with the question, “Did you live life to the fullest?”, how many people can say “Yes!” with confidence? Only a person that had spurned the hand of negligence and indolence could answer in such a fashion. These were the people running towards the goal of happiness. They were on the right path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this was a difficult question for many people. It was common for a person to yell, ‘I want to live my life to the fullest!’, yet it was rare for one to stick with it to the end. This was why many called such motto a short-lived resolve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With that in context, Sungyoon wouldn’t hesitate to answer ‘Yes!’ when asked ‘Have you lived your life to the fullest?’ This was the reason why he thought he had been leading a happy life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had a not so small fortune, and he had held a high position in society. He had a beautiful wife and a cute daughter. He had a loyal friend. In terms of societal and familial life, everyone would be jealous of the life he led. He believed he could be happy for the rest of his if he continued to work diligently without showing too much greed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the road of life wasn’t that easy. Even if one was walking down a straight path right now, there was a chance that the road could be in a completely different state on the other side of the hill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a clear day. There were a couple of clouds in the sky, but the clouds only enhanced the feeling of refreshment brought on by the sky. The sunlight came down unimpeded as it shone on the ground. It was a weather that made one drop everything to head outdoors. It was a weather that could invigorate one’s spirit. Even someone that normally doesn’t care about others would show generosity to others. It was such a weather.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite the world enjoying this nice weather, it was business as usual for the people. In some ways that was good and in other ways it was bad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kuhk!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A dull sound could be heard, and a short scream rang out. Then the sounds of someone moaning in pain followed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was Gangam. The skyscrapers looked as if they were holding up the sky. It was a majestic sight. In contrast, there was a man fallen atop the bumpy sidewalk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man looked to be in his mid to late 30s, and he looked quite handsome. Still, his age was quite evident. There were small wrinkles starting to appear on his face. The wear and tear of time was starting to show. However, this made him look mature. He looked like a dignified and attractive middle-aged man. The only blemish was the little bit of belly fat on his lower abdomen. Most middle-aged Korean men had a beer belly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, his handsome face couldn’t mask his current state. He was truly a mess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His hair was greasy as if he hadn’t showered in many days. His hair was long, and it made one wonder when he had gotten his last haircut. His beard was also unkempt. His appearance was a visual representation of his current mental state. At least, he was wearing a sharp suit, but even that was dirty and wrinkled. He looked like a homeless person. If someone saw him, one would distance oneself from him. He was beyond looking bad. He looked dirty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ooooh!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He raised his upper body. He had been thrown to the floor, and the impact made his back burn as if it was on fire. He was having a hard time breathing due to it. At that moment, he wanted to go lie down somewhere, but he couldn’t do that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He clumsily stood back on his feet. He looked like a hero that had arrived at the Demon King’s castle despite all the hardships and sacrifices that he had to suffer. He looked forward with hate in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was in front of a high rise building. The clear sky was in the background, and the sunlight was reflected by the many glass windows of the immaculate building. The building looked the same, but the eyes of the person watching the building had changed completely. In the past, he had looked at the building as a close and trustworthy friend. Now he looked at it with hateful eyes as if it was his enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He once again took a step forward. He didn’t hide the rage in his heart as he quickly moved towards the building. His feelings were reflected in his footsteps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he still couldn’t enter the building.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sssk!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two bots were in his way. He looked up at the men that blocked his path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He’d never been called short before. He was pretty tall at 182 cm. More often than not, he had to look down on people. The men barring his path were much bigger than him. They were at least 190 cm tall. They looked slim on the outside, but their bodies were full of hard muscles. They were wearing decent suits, and they were built like a brick house. They looked to be from the mob, but they weren’t hired for such an illegal profession. In fact, they were hired to stop illegal and violent groups. They were the security guards of this building.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Get out of my way!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was obstinate as he tried to push his way past the security guards. Of course, they would never let him pass. They looked a bit annoyed as they pushed him back. He was slowly pushed backwards. Fortunately, he wasn’t thrown to the ground like before. However, he didn’t look thankful at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fuck! Get out of my way!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As if he was making a heavy assault, he heedlessly charged forward. However, his effort was in vain. The two security guards were hired to protect this expensive building. Of course, they were skilled at their job, and they were well trained. When he made his desperate charge, one of the security guards used a foot sweep. A slight push to his shoulder broke his balance. He rolled across the ground as he was sent back to his original spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ughh!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the second time he had been sent flying to the sidewalk. He was becoming fast friends with the ground. He screamed once again when he felt the pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, his humiliation and pain at being sent to the ground couldn’t stop him. He got up again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The security guards let out a sigh. They were beyond annoyed and tired by his act. One could see anger rise in their eyes. As security guards, they’ve been through all sorts of experiences, and they’ve met countless people like the man in front of them. This didn’t mean they got used to dealing with such people. In reality, they became annoyed when faced with such a situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They thought about calling the police, but the owners of the building had forbidden it. The owners said the image of their company would be tarnished if people saw police cars in front of the building. In their opinion, the company’s image would inevitably be tarnished by having a man like this hanging around the building. However, they had to do whatever their superiors wanted them to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It happened when the security guards wanted to let out their frustration and irritation. They had been ready to cause a bit more damage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That is enough, Mr Woo Sungyoon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A person came out from the building.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The security guards looked to be at their wit’s end. They were lowly employees, and they hadn’t been able to wrap up their work. It had caused one of their superiors to appear. They weren’t able to get rid of a crazy man. When the team leader came out of the building, the security guards glared at Sungyoon as if they wanted to kill him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Sungyoon didn’t care about their feelings. In fact, he rejoiced at the fact that someone finally had come out to listen to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Team leader Che!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon quickly approached the man called team leader Che. The security guards moved to block Sungyoon, but team leader Che waved them away. The security guards looked disappointed as they retreated. It was quite evident from their reaction that the security guards had been about to escalate the force used on him. However, Sungyoon couldn’t afford to think about such things. He clung to team leader Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please let me in! I have to meet Jaeho!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon spoke desperately as if team leader Che was his last hope. However, team leader Che dashed his hope by slapping away Sungyoon’s hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The president is busy. If you want to meet the president, you shouldn’t do this. You should make an appointment. You should agree upon a time and location to meet.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Time is of the utmost importance! Also, he isn’t returning my calls! I tried to make an appointment with his secretary, but he just put me on hold!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then you should wait.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I told you I don’t have the time to do that!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unlike Sungyoon’s burning insides, team leader Che’s attitude was cold. It was reminiscent of the winter fields of Siberia. At a glance, it was evident that he wasn’t going to help Sungyoon. Sungyoon had realized that. It hadn’t been too long ago that team leader Che had bowed towards him with respect. The change in attitude only reaffirmed his new position in life. Of course, he felt humiliated and miserable. He wanted to spit and cuss out the man in front of him before he left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he couldn’t do that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Move! I have to see him no matter what! How can he do this to a friend!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon started to push his way forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why are you acting like this! Didn’t they teach you any manners!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Team leader Che yelled as he got in the way of Sungyoon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let me go! Let me go!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon struggled. However, he couldn’t escape team leader Che’s iron grip. When he was young, Sungyoon had been an athlete. However, he was already in his late 30s, and he had partaken plenty of alcohol and cigarettes. His social life required it. It had made his body soft. On the other hand, team leader Che’s body had been molded through exercise. Sungyoon couldn’t escape his grasp. He was sent flying like a piece of paper by the hands of team leader Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Koohk!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the third time he rolled across the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are a president in charge of a company… Ah! I guess you are no longer a president.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Team leader Che ridiculed him as he laughed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Still, you were once a president of a company. You should show more manners and situational awareness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Y...you guys don’t have the right to talk about manners and situational awareness!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon breathed roughly as he turned his death glare towards team leader Che.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you really think this will be the end?! I’ll sue all of you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As if he was making a last-ditch effort, Sungyoon screamed out his words. However, his threat held no weight. He was dirty and in a sorry state. Who would be afraid of a threat from an older man with no backings? Moreover, they were security guards for a building owned by a premier conglomerate that was acknowledged even on the world stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do as you like..”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Team leader Che crossed his arms as he spoke arrogantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For a brief moment, Sungyoon turned his death glare towards team leader Che, the other security guards and the high rise building. However, that was all he did. It wasn’t as if the team leader Che and his security guards would be afraid of his glare. He couldn’t smash the building just with his looks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, there wasn’t much to be gained here. He was barely able to accept this fact. Sungyoon turned around in a huff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He stood under the clear sky that was supposed to refresh the hearts of people. Sungyoon turned his back on the imposing building. The building looked down on him as if it was a despot looking down on its subject. He retreated without making a whimper. He looked like a miserable loser.</span></p>
