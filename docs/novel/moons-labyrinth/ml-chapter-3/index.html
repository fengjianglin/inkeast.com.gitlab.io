 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did he leave?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the top most floor of the highrise building where Sungyoon had made a commotion. This was a room that normal people could only see in dramas or movies. The furnishing made it quite obvious that this was the president’s office. The room was large, and there was a luxurious sofa and a coffee table that could be used to greet customers. Then there was an executive desk and chair placed in front of the large window. An expensive name plate was placed on top of the desk. It had the president’s name and position engraved on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A man was sitting behind the desk. At a glance, he looked to be in his mid 20s or early 30s. In reality, he was in his late 30s like Sungyoon. However, he took care of himself. Therefore, he still maintained an athletic body and firm skin that belied his age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was handsomely tall and he had a well defined face. On a scale of one to ten, he would register as an eight or nine. He possessed an appearance that people would compliment. The only thing that marred his face was his slightly upturned eyes. It made him look cruel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was the president and owner of this building. His name was Lee Jaeho, and Sungyoon had been trying to desperately get a hold of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jaeho’s secretary, who had been standing in front of him, gave a reply in a polite manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jaeho clicked his tongue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He should be thinking about how to revive his company. Why the hell is he making a scene by coming here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon named Jaeho as a friend. However, Jaeho didn’t treat Sungyoon as a friend. One wouldn’t ignore and show contempt towards a friend.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you sure this is fine? If he starts to respond through the legal system, it’ll cause quite a headache for us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey, secretary Kim. You can’t run a business if you are afraid of the law.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jaeho dismissed secretary Kim’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Moreover, it might have been possible if he had done it earlier. Now, he has nothing. He is millions in debt. Also, do you think our team of lawyers will twiddle their thumbs in the meantime?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are right. However, I’m afraid the chairman won’t look fondly at the mess being created.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jaeho agreed with that sentiment. He had used all kinds of dirty tactics. He had even stabbed a man, who was known to be his friend, in the back. Why did he do all that? It was to inherit the empire built by his father and grandfather. He had to achieve better results than his other siblings. However, a commotion might sour his father’s mood. It wouldn’t matter if he had improved his record. His secretary was correct.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s true. It is best to wrap this up quietly. Don’t worry. I have a powerful ally in this matter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You have an ally?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. She is an ally that is capable of taking complete advantage of his weakness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jaeho thought about ‘her’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That is why you don’t have to worry about it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Secretary Kim bowed his head instead of answering him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After dismissing secretary Kim, Jaeho propped his chin on his palm as he tapped his desk. His thoughts returned to his college days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">『Hey! Lee Jaeho! Did you do all your homework?』</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">『Ah. Shit. The hangover is killing me. It feels as if someone is rattling steel balls inside my head.』</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">『Bastard! You went to a group blind date yesterday! That’s really cheap!』</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The familiar voice ran through his thoughts. Jaeho placed no importance on that voice. Soon, a face of a man appeared alongside the voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He wore a graduation cap. He was laughing merrily as he held a bouquet of flowers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">『Ah ha ha ha ha! Let’s continue to be close friends!』</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Hmmph! He doesn’t know his place.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jaeho snorted. Friend was a word that can be used amongst equals. He was from a rich family, and he was going to inherit a large empire. Sungyoon was beneath his notice. He freely admitted that Sungyoon was capable. He had built and run a successful company. However, his company was like a child’s toy that could be stolen by Jaeho.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jaeho laughed at Sungyoon, who had deluded himself into believing Jaeho was his friend.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Still, I should clean up after myself.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had to avoid any commotions. He picked up the phone to quietly resolve this situation. Above all else, Sungyoon had a critical weakness that could be exploited. Jaeho called to contact his ally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘This will be a harsh life lesson for you. Well, you don’t have to thank me. You don’t even have to pay me a fee for this lesson. After all, we are friends, right?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jaeho’s narrow eyes curved to make a crescent shape. He let out a cruel laughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">* * *</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon was sitting in a cafe. His appearance differed greatly from how he looked in front of the building owned by Jaeho. It had only been a couple days, yet he no longer looked like an invalid. He had cleaned himself up, shaved his beard, had worn clean clothes. His messy hair and his wrinkled suit was nowhere to be seen. However, he couldn’t hide his troubled heart. His cheeks looked a bit gaunt. But this made him look a bit like his younger self, so the women around him were glancing towards him from time to time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ring!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bell rang as the door to the cafe opened. Sungyoon looked towards the entrance, and his face brightened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A woman had entered the store. She looked to have put on a bit of makeup, and she wore a fluttering black one piece dress. She wore many jewelries. She wore earrings, necklaces and rings embedded with many precious gems. She looked like a big spender. Still, she looked beautiful. At a glance, she looked to be in her late 20s. However, there were crows feet at the corner of her eyes. It was a sign that she was older than she looked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon raised his hand to make himself known to her. The woman had her chin up high as she surveyed her surroundings. She looked almost arrogant and snooty. She noticed Sungyoon’s presence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tap!　Tap!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">High heels rhythmically tapped the floor. She walked like a model, and most of the male customers kept glancing at her. Some couples bickered with each other when their significant other was caught stealing glances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she and Sungyoon didn't pay attention to their surroundings. They were used to such reactions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Welcome.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if he looked emaciated, Sungyoon looked happy as he greeted her. When she sat down, she placed her handbag on the next seat. The handbag had the logo of a famous brand on it, and it was even was shining.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you want to eat?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon looked at the menu placed atop the counter. However, she shook her head from side to side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s fine. I’ll buy my own. You are short on money.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I still have the means to buy my wife a cup of coffee.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon raised his voice slightly as if his pride had been hurt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her name was Lee Miyun. She was Sungyoon’s wife.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They met each other during college, and they had been a famous couple on campus. Sungyoon was handsomely tall, and he had the classic good looks. Lee Miyun was the beauty queen of the campus. They were a handsome couple. They had started dating in college, and it led to them marrying each other after school finished. They were a couple that everyone envied. They even had a beautiful daughter named Shinhae. When Sungyoon’s business started to take off, the envy around them got stronger. At that point in life, Sungyoon boasted to others that he regretted nothing in life. He had a beautiful wife and a cute daughter. He had succeeded in business. The only shortcoming was the fact that Miyun was loose in how she spent their money. However, he hadn’t cared because he was making a lot of money. As a man, he thought it was his duty to support her luxurious spending to a certain degree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s fine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t know what was wrong, but Miyun was unusually cold to him today. She glanced at the empty spot on the desk in front of him. She got up. It was as if she was criticizing his current state, so his cheeks reddened a little bit. He immediately shook his head to shed his embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Yes. She’s speaking that way for my sake.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he was being honest, he didn’t have any money. It was the truth. His wife had to go to her parent’s house with their daughter. Repossession tickets were placed all over his house. The money she was using right now was probably allowance given to her by his father in law and mother in law. Her parents were quite rich. Jewelries and the designer handbag had all been provided to her by her parents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He decided she was acting this way, because she was worried about him. He berated himself. He was probably letting his hurt pride put her actions in a negative light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After his business failed, he was stabbed in the back by his friend. He had been traumatized, and this was why he had relied a lot on Miyun. Still, it was clear that something was amiss. Her husband was on the run from debtors, yet she was wearing expensive pieces of jewellery and designer handbag. He made an effort to overlook it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It didn’t take long for Miyun to come back with two cups of coffee. She pushed one towards Sungyoon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon wordlessly grasped the coffee cup. It was a cold ice coffee, so there was a lot of condensation around the cup. His hands were getting wet, but he didn’t pay attention to it as he fiddled around with the cup. He said he had enough to buy his wife a cup of coffee, yet when it came down to it, he hadn’t even bought coffee for himself. He didn’t want to waste his money.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He placed the straw between his lips, and he sucked in the liquid. The coffee was cold and bitter. Miyun also used a straw to drink her coffee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So why did you want to see me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon let go of the straw as he asked the question. He was constantly on the move trying to salvage his fallen business. He was also busy trying to get his revenge on Jaeho, who had stabbed Sungyoon in the back. This was why he hadn’t been very happy when he received a call from her. Still, he had caused a lot of trouble for Miyun when he got in debt as his business failed. He owed it to her to make some time for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Miyun put down her coffee cup. The cream atop the brown coffee jostled a little bit at the impact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want a divorce.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She spoke coldly as if she was cutting the thread of their relationship with a knife.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“····what?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon looked dumbfounded as he repeated her words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“D...divorce?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. A divorce.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unlike the flustered Sungyoon, Miyun didn’t show any emotions as she spoke. Her words put Sungyoon in a corner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“W...why are you suddenly saying this?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon abruptly stood up. He had been pushed to the edge by the betrayal of his friend and the failure of his business. Miyun’s request was like the final nail in his coffin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please sit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Miyun looked at her surroundings as she spoke. Sungyoon’s shout had drawn the attention of the other customers. Half of the cafe was surprised, and the other half was curious as they focused their gazes on the two.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Sungyoon wasn’t in a state where he cared about the gazes of others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Sungyoon showed no signs of sitting down, Miyun let out a sigh. She picked up her handbag as she got up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s talk outside.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She didn’t even look back as she walked towards the entrance of the cafe. Sungyoon looked at her back with a blank expression on his face. It was as if he had just woken up from a dream. He quickly followed after her as they left the cafe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two half-empty coffee cups remained in front of their empty seats.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">* * *</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them arrived at a quiet park. The sun was high up in the sky, so there weren’t many people visiting the park. At most, there were a couple of old people taking advantage of the slow hours to do a brisk walk around the park. Sungyoon and Miyun moved far away from the seniors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Miyun faced Sungyoon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her husband looked betrayed, but his face still held a glimmer of hope as he looked at her. There were traces of his old self left, but he looked completely like a middle-aged man. He had a potbelly, and there were light wrinkles all over his face. She had no regrets. Miyun shifted her weight to one leg as she looked at her husband.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“‘I'll say this once again. Let’s divorce.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected, he hadn’t heard wrong. Sungyoon’s expression became desperate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This request for a divorce is so sudden! Is it because of my business?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon shut his mouth. Miyun didn’t beat around the bush as she told the truth, and her words stabbed deep into his heart. He wanted to make some kind of an excuse. However, no words came to his mind. He knew what kind of situation he was in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He owed millions of dollars. In society, it was said that human life was more important than money. However, no one honestly thought that. It was a material world. Millions of dollars could determine if a person would die or not.</span></p>
