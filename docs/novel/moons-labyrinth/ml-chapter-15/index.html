 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moon was in the sky. A dark curtain had come down over the night sky, and the moon silently looked down at the surface. It was the day when the moon could fully show off its shape. It was the day of the full moon. Even though the light pollution from the city made it hard for the stars to make their presence known, the moon was still able to cast its bright light. No obstacles could erase its presence, and the moon expressed itself with confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon was sitting on a park bench, and he blankly looked up at the sky. To be precise, he was looking up at the moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘If I accept his offer, I have to go there.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He never thought a day would come when he would need to go to the moon. It troubled his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moonstones were gathered within the Moon’s Labyrinth, and they were a source of energy. It provided 30% of the world’s current energy. He was qualified to gather the moonstones now. He could regain his wealth and live as a family with his daughter. It was a powerful opportunity for him, but the risks associated with the job worried him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There you are.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon’s thoughts were in turmoil as he watched the moon. He was disturbed when someone spoke to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry. I made you wait too long. Some unexpected problems cropped up one after another.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was Insoo. He wiped his forehead with his handkerchief then he profusely apologized to Sungyoon. By the expression on his face, he looked really apologetic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is fine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had no work to do here in the first place. Sungyoon gave a curt reply as he stood up from the bench.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Insoo fished out his cell phone from his pocket. The screen lit up, and several notifications popped up. However, Insoo only needed it to tell the time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is probably a good time for this. Are you a drinker?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not really, but I can hold my weight.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The drinking culture in Korean society was showing signs of slowly coming under control, but drinking in business was still non-negotiable. This had especially been true when Sungyoon was a president of his own company. Basically,<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;if needed,</span> Sungyoon could drink like a fish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s good. Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Insoo started walking with Sungyoon in tow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon thought Insoo would take him to a nearby restaurant or a bar. However, Insoo didn't go to the main street. He headed towards a high rise building with most of their lights off. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“…this place?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon hadn’t shown any signs of discontent until now. However, he couldn’t help letting out that question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ha ha. Most people are surprised when they come here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Insoo pressed the elevator button.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can take you to any of the good bars nearby, but most Connectors prefer this place. If you want, I’ll take you to a good pub later.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them entered the elevator, and Insoo pressed the button to the top most floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is this a government building too?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No. This is a civilian owned building. I asked for permission from its owner, so I can use it sometimes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Insoo got off the elevator then he took the emergency staircase to climb one more floor. Sungyoon saw a firmly shut steel door. It was the door to the rooftop, and it had been placed there as a security measure. Insoo took out a key, and he opened the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The view of the rooftop unfolded in front of Sungyoon’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The slightly strong wind was tickling the nape of his neck. He didn’t know when someone had prepared all of this, but there was a large table and two chairs placed on the rooftop. There were various food and alcoholic drinks prepared on top of the table. There was a low light illuminating the background. It looked like something out of a dream . It gave him goosebumps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Insoo walked towards the railing of the roof. He pointed down towards the city below.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Isn’t it a beautiful sight? When my thoughts are in a mess, I sometimes come here. This is the tallest building in this city. You can see the entire city from up here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon stood next to Insoo, and he looked down at the city. The city was lit up by bright lights. When he was down there, he thought the city was full of useless lights that masked the light of the stars in the night sky. Now he was watching the lights from a little ways off, and the light of the city was spread across the surface like the Milky Way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did you bring me here to show me this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No. This is an awesome sight, but I have another reason for bringing you here, Mr Sungyoon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Insoo pointed towards the brightly lit moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is the tallest building in this city. It means we are closest to the moon here. Fortunately, we have a clear sky today, so we can see the full moon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon looked up at the sky and saw the moon showing its splendor. It didn’t matter if one was on the surface or the building. When one considered the Lunar distance, the difference between the surface and the top of a high rise building seemed miniscule. &nbsp;It wasn’t an exaggeration to say the difference was negligent. However, it might just be a feeling, but the moon looked a little bigger here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please sit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon sat in the chair at Insoo’s insistence. The weather was still a bit chilly, so the cold permeated into his jacket.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Insoo took up a bottle of alcohol. The soju cup had already been set up. Sungyoon raised his cup, and the clear soju filled the small cup.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s have a shot before we talk.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two men lightly clicked their glasses then they downed the alcohol. The unique alcohol flavor of distilled soju filled their palate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please don’t hold back. This was all prepared in order to welcome you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon didn’t hold back. It had been awhile since he had eaten a feast like this. The hospital food was enough to fulfill his stomach, but if he was being honest, it didn’t taste that great. The table was filled with simple delivery food, but it was food that Sungyoon hadn’t been able to eat for a while. He didn’t have the money to purchase them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two took turns pouring the alcohol. They didn’t stop drinking and eating. It seemed Insoo was famished too as he kept stuffing food into his stomach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It didn’t take them too long to empty most of the dishes. Three bottles of soju had also been emptied, and a fourth bottle was half empty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Insoo was quite drunk right now. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Compared to before,&nbsp;</span>his voice was oddly higher in pitch , and he became more animated. Sungyooon was a little bit drunk too. However, he wasn’t that drunk compared to what he had imbibed. In the past, his head would already be fuzzy by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘This must be thanks to the heart of the moon.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His body had gone through a change, and he assumed this was one of his new abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Connectors have a hard time getting drunk, and they metabolize the alcohol quickly. They don’t have a hangover. However, <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">if they drink a lot of alcohol,&nbsp;</span>they are capable of getting drunk .”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Insoo had accurately assessed Sunngyoon’s current state. He quickly poured soju into Sungyoon’s cup, and Sungyoon drained the shot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You said you are on the fence about going to the moon, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Insoo filled his own cup as he asked the question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘He is finally going to talk about it now.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon was a bit miffed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This topic was very important to Sungyoon. He didn’t think it was right to give such an explanation while drinking alcohol.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Insoo was a pro. He wasn’t having this important discussion here without a reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are probably asking why I am explaining such an important topic while we are drinking. I have a reason for doing this. Usually, newly awakened Connectors had a hard time feeling it. That is why I’m letting you drink alcohol. It dampens the conscious mind a little bit. Some other managers use other methods, but I use this method. Alternatively, we can just wait until you are able to sense it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“…what am I supposed to feel?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Insoo had accurately assessed Sungyoon’s disgruntled state. Sungyoon sounded a bit sheepish as he asked the question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you know what percentage of the Connectors go to the moon?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not sure.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is over 99%.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon was very surprised. Even if one could make significant amounts of money gathering moonstones, it was still dangerous work. They were paid so much only because the risk was significant. Despite this fact, Insoo was saying that most Connectors went to the Moon’s Labyrinth. After drinking another shot, Insoo continued to speak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m saying 99%, because I do not know all the Connectors in the world. That is why I deducted 1% from the figure. But as for the connectors I do know, hundred percent of them travel to the Moon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There must be some factor...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The awakening of 1st Gen Connectors was completely random. Of course, there must be some that were rich prior to becoming a Connector. He didn’t even need to bring up the 1st Gen Connectors as an example. The 2nd and 3rd Gen Connectors either had one or both parents who were Connectors. They weren’t short on money.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There must be a reason why they were all drawn to the moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, there is. In truth, one could make a lot of money gathering moonstones. However, it is troublesome work. You have to constantly risk your life, and it is nearly impossible to meet friends or acquaintances when on the moon. It doesn’t end there. If you are clueless on how the market works in the Lunar city, you might cause significant disruption to the market. It might even affect the Connectors that earn well. It causes the Connectors to eat and play after earning their hard earned money. There is no merit to continue going back to that place at a certain point. However, Connectors continue to head back to the moon. It looks foolish from the outside, yet they go back, even after amassing hundreds of millions of dollars.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was hard, dangerous, and dirty work. Still, they headed back towards the moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where do you want to go right now, Mr Sungyoon?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It really was a question that came out of nowhere. Sungyoon thought hard on it, but it didn’t take him long to come up with an answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to go where my daughter is right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he was admitted and released from the hospital, he had wanted to go see Shinhae. However, he didn’t do it. He had made a promise to himself. If he went to see Shinhae every time he wanted to see her, Sungyoon would probably visit her every day. It was in his nature. That was why he couldn't go. He had to work to pay down his debt. He had to work for his life and the future of Shinhae. That was why he only visited Shinhae on scheduled days. It was why he had focused on his health and work after he was let out from the hospital.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, he missed his daughter. He almost had a near death experience, so his desire to see his daughter had become bigger than ever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I see.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Insoo didn’t sound satisfied by the answer. It seemed that wasn’t the answer he was looking for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As expected, it must be very weak. You are drunk, and you are at a location that is closest to the moon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you want to hear from me? I really just want to go be with my daughter.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon unconsciously furrowed his brow. It sounded as if Insoo was trivializing his love for his daughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Insoo refilled his own cup, he took a shot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m not trying to downplay your feelings for your daughter. However, you are a Connector. You should be filled with desire to travel to your roots.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Insoo brought down his shot glass hard enough to make the table ring a little bit. He looked at Sungyoon with fierce eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t care about your emotions or logic. I want you to let go of your memories and your desires. I want you to feel where your non-beating heart is pointing towards. Where is it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Insoo spoke in a forceful manner. Sungyoon stared at Insoo, then he mirrored Insoo’s gesture. He placed his hand over his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon unconsciously raised his head up high. His black eyes took in the light of the round moon in the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked as if he was mesmerized by a ghost. Sungyoon spoke one word with a heavy voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“…moon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His heart still refused to beat.</span></p>
