 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After ordering the food, the three of them carried on a conversation until the food came out. No, it was wrong to say that the three of them spoke. To be precise, Chelsea spoke continuously with Jimin, and Jimin would <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">occasionally&nbsp;</span>answer her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In many ways, Sungyoon had turned into a third wheel, but he preferred this. Also, Chelsea was quite entertaining. She spoke about her research on the moon, mostly spoke about the inconveniences of living on the moon. It was useful information for him since he was going to be living on the moon and would be raiding the labyrinth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Still, it wasn’t as if Sungyoon was completely shut out from the conversation. Jimin and Chelsea occasionally asked him a question.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could feel everyone staring at them. He was sitting with two beauties, both on a different level. Everyone kept stealing glances towards them, yet the two women remained cool under their gazes. Jimin and Chelsea was used to it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">People looked at Sungyoon too. However, it wasn’t the amorous glances sent towards Jimin and Chelsea. Most of them were glaring at him with jealousy in their eyes. Unlike what those men thought, Sungyoon wasn't feeling welcome being in this situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a certain amount of time had passed, their food started to come out. A good looking waiter and waitress started to bring out their food.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wow. It smells so good.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chelsea sounded as if she was in ecstasy as she looked at the steak in front of her. She lowered her nose towards the steak and inhaled. She looked like she was about to drool from her open mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please mind your manners.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ahahaha! Manners? If I was going to mind my manners, I wouldn’t have come here wearing this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chelsea was undaunted by Jimin’s criticism. She shook her dirty lab coat as she let out a hearty laughter. Then, taking up her fork and knife, she started to dissect the steak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon also cut up his steak and placed a piece in his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Wow!’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The juice from the meat flooded his mouth. Was the price of the steak influencing how it tasted? It would be unfortunate if the food in the range of 10 million won wasn’t delicious. The reason didn’t matter. In the end, it was delicious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Kooo! As expected of this restaurant, they have the best chefs in Armstrong!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chelsea pounded the table with her fork. Jimin once again told her to quiet down. However, the smile never left Chelsea’s face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘A top-notch chef made this.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fortunately, his brain hadn’t tricked his taste buds. He once again put more food in his mouth. Even during his more successful days, it was extremely rare for him to eat food this good.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How’s the food? Is it good?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, it is delicious.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he answered Jimin’s question, he once again used his fork and knife on the meat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I never expected us to eat such a gourmet meal on the moon. I wouldn’t have minded if we went to a cheaper restaurant.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A single piece of steak was like shoving a couple hundred dollars into his stomach. The thought made him flinch inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There are no cheap restaurants here. Most of the stores in Armstrong are at this level.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Something unbelievable was said by Chelsea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“…they are all on this level?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. The eye popping price comes from the cost of transporting the ingredients, and the cost of the chef living on the moon. The original cost of the ingredients are a very small percentage of the sales margin and the operating expense. Of course, it is a lot of money, but the cost of living and transportation is too high here. That is why the profit margin doesn’t change much even if they use high quality ingredients and the best chefs. Would it matter if it was 1,001 million, 1,050 million or 1,000 million won? The difference is small in the grand scheme of things. What would happen if such foods were tasteless?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chelsea waved her fork as she gave an explanation. Jimin was glaring at her once again, so she discreetly put down her fork.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“…I see. Everything is expensive, so great service is required.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In addition, each country chose the people that get to come up here. It means only those with proven skills get to come up here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jimin gave an additional explanation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Well, politics also plays a big part too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Politics?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chelsea had put a piece of steak in her mouth. She chewed as she spoke. Sungyoon responded to her statement.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. Politics. You do know that it isn’t good for an economy if money is gathered in one place? In the case of Connectors, they make a massive amount of money. This is especially true for the high ranked Connectors. A massive amount of money is tied up in their bank accounts. The amount of income brought in by the 1st Gen Connectors… Whew. It is ridiculous.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She fluttered her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Every government would want to extract those money in any way possible. The governments could tax them, but there is a limit. They can’t be unreasonable by taxing them 70-80% of their income. There would be an incredible amount of backlash. That is why the governments try to make the Connectors spend their money. Places of entertainment are set up anywhere the Connectors reside for an extended amount of time. The Connectors put their lives on the line to raid the labyrinths. This is why most of them are compulsive spenders. They don’t know when they will die, so many of them are loose with their money. Of course, the entertainment industry is a booming success here. Moreover, they price the services high, so the stores are able to have high profit margins. It would be called rip-off on earth, but no one would complain here. There is THE place to make a profit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon looked down at his place. He could still see steam rising up from his half eaten steak. In his eyes, the steam looked like money evaporating into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed he would have to change his mindset if he wanted to live in the Lunar city of Armstrong. He made a resolve to do so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">* * *</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah! The food was great!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Chelsea exited the restaurant, she stretched her two arms as she let out a shout.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I had given up on eating good food until the next time I would've gone back to earth. This is why it is good to have a well-off friend!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chelsea hugged Jimin. Chelsea was much taller, so Jimin was engulfed in her hug. Jimin said she couldn’t breathe, so she tried to push Chelsea away. But Chelsea was like a tick. She wouldn’t let go of Jimin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon let the two friends have their moment of skinship. He looked up at the dome’s ceiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The intensity of the light within the city was getting weaker. It seemed this was how they differentiated day and night. They didn’t completely turn off the light, but if one closed the curtain, it was dark enough to sleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surrounding streets had become busy. It was like any other city. Bars and shops turned their lights on, and they greeted the customers. People were already drunk on the street. Their faces were red as they laughed madly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“People should be returning from the labyrinths.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chelsea let go of Jimin as she spoke. Jimin’s hair was all disheveled, so she rearranged it. Her eyes narrowed as she pinched Chelsea’s arm. Chelsea let out a scream, exaggerating her pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s time for me to go. If I stay any longer, I’m afraid I’ll be murdered by my friend.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She covered the location where she had been pinched. She acted as if she had been knifed or shot by a gun. She staggered on her feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. Leave. I won’t buy you anything next time, you wench.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ooh hue hue. Please show me a good time next time we meet!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chelsea once again hugged Jimin. The hug was part of the goodbye, so Jimin didn’t resist this time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s do well in our future endeavors, Mr Sungyoon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After she moved away from Jimin, she pushed her hand out toward Sungyoon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please look after me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon grabbed her hand lightly, and he shook it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chelsea let out a bright smile as she looked at Sungyoon. However, Sungyoon had a vague idea that there was a coldness hiding behind her smiling face. Her cold eyes were dissecting him. She hid it behind her bright and energetic personality. However, she was a scientist, and she was dispassionately dissecting and assessing him. He was a stranger. She wasn’t ready to put her guard down in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘That’s great.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was good news for Sungyoon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chelsea waved with both hands as she walked away. Jimin gave a small wave. When Chelsea disappeared from their sight, Jimin put down her hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She’s a whirlwind, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jimin let out a bitter laughter. She looked like a big sister watching her immature younger sister play at the pool. However, there was true affection within her voice. They were true friends.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She is a bit of a whirlwind. I can also tell that she really likes you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She is a really affectionate person. I was lucky to have met her. If something happens later, you can consult Chelsea. She is a researcher, so she’s been here for a while. She knows a lot about this city.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shall we get moving? I want to show you something before we return to our lodging.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them started walking the streets of the city once again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people around them acted the same as the people on earth. They had safely finished their work today, so they were excited. They wanted to let some steam off, so the people around them wanted to enjoy their night. In fact, the people were more excited here compared to earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He remembered what Chelsea had said earlier. The Connectors risked their lives to raid the labyrinths, and many of them pursued pleasure afterwards. Since they didn’t lose their lives today, they were happy and excited. Sungyoon guessed they wanted to celebrate that fact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It sounded as if there was an argument in the front. Sungyoon could hear shouts and cursing. Sungyoon saw a man with two women in his arms. The women were showing a lot of skin on the side. The man laughed out loud as he walked by Sungyoon. He talked about how much he had gained and lost in the casino.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Basically, this place was a vortex of basic human desires.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it became quiet once again after Sungyoon and Jimin left downtown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not all Connectors live their lives like that. The ones that can’t bring in an absurd amount of income live normally. No, I guess it is a bit of a sad life. Most of the normal Connectors have to live in small lodgings. They eat the minimal amount of food by supplementing their diet with vitamin packs. Of course, all the facilities within Armstrong are above average compared to earth. The normal Connectors may be able live the high life on earth, but they have to live like normal people in Armstrong. This city revolves solely around money. This place has the most disparity between the haves and have nots.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he heard more about the city, he realized Armstrong was a terrifying city. He shook his head. He wondered if he’ll be fine living here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">* * *</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The last place Jimin wanted to visit was the outer wall of the dome. He could see many vehicles and people move in and out through a massive tunnel that went through the wall. Sungyoon recognized it in a single glance. This was the entrance that connected the city of Armstrong and the outside. If they went through this tunnel, they would be able to walk on the surface of the moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you ready?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It didn’t take long for Jimin to put on another space suit. Sungyoon nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two of them moved towards the entrance. The large wall started to open, and Sungyoon gulped. As soon as the wall was opened, Sungyoon and Jimin moved with the cars and a crowd of people. When the wall was closed once again, the two of them started climbing the wall from the outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hoo-oong!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wind started to blow in their surrounding. Wind shrieked as air exited out into the dark space. Soon, his ears couldn’t pick up any sound. He slowly started seeing the outside as the gap in the wall widened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The gray desolate field of the moon was revealed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people and the vehicles started to move as one. Sungyoon and Jimin slowly exited towards the outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first thing he noticed was the moon’s gravity. It was ⅙ the gravity of earth. It was as if steel weights were lifted from his body and his body felt light. Then he stepped onto the surface of the moon. The moon had been bombarded by meteor through the long years, so the ground was covered with dust. Due to the lack of winds, there were deep footprints everywhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon looked at his surroundings. The vast and desolate field of the moon stretched out in front of him. At his back, the enormous city of Armstrong obstructed his view. On top of the horizon, he could see the lights of stars.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tap! Tap!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jimin tapped on his shoulder. When he looked at her, he saw her pointing towards the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the last thing Jimin wanted to show Sungyoon. He realized what it was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Earth was floating above them in the sky.</span></p>
