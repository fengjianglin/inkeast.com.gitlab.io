 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite her surprise, Jimin continued her explanation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll explain the function of the Gems using their shapes. &nbsp;<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A Gem’s shape is dependent on its type.</span></strong>&nbsp; A different shape indicates a different weapon. The cross shaped gem is a shield. The X shaped gem is an armor. The hexagonal gem gives a special ability.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time Sungyoon placed the cross shaped gem into its slot. A small round shield appeared in his left hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Gems are the only weapons that work against the monsters within the labyrinths. It is possible to kill a monster using a Connector’s body, but it is too dangerous. The only certainty is the fact that normal weapons of humanity do not work on these monsters.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was why Connectors fought against monsters using weapons from ancient and medieval times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This time Sungyoon inserted the x shaped Gem. A moderately thick leather armor appeared around his upper body. It was shaped like a vest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had one Gem left. However, Sungyoon was having a hard time mounting this Gem. He turned it over as if he was appraising the Gem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Gem was different from the other Gems. It had a hexagonal shape, but it wasn’t purple. It was letting out a lustrous gold light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Isn’t this a Jewel ranked Gem?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Seven types of Gems had the color of a rainbow, so it was called the Rainbow rank. Above the Rainbow rank, there were transitional Gems, and these were called Black and White rank Gems. Then there were the higher ranked Gems, and these were referred to by the name of jewels. This color was the start of the Jewel rank. The gold colored Gem in his hand was a Jewel ranked Gem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of the requirements for entering the Great Labyrinth was a Jewel ranked Gem. The Gold Gem was a Jewel ranked Gem, and it was a very valuable and expensive item.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon had a baffled expression as he looked at Jimin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This Device can only slot purple Gems. And even if I had a Device capable of being able to slot a gold Gem, I can’t use it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When a Connector had just awakened, they could only use purple Gems. As time passes, the amount of energy emitted by the heart increases, and it allows the Connector to use more Gems. Of course, how fast one could use the higher ranked Gems was dependent on the Connector. It varied amongst Connectors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, one thing was for sure. Sungyoon had just awakened, so he couldn’t use this Gold rank Gem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Also, it is unknown as to whether I’ll be able to use a Gold Gem in the future.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The rank of Connectors depended on the ranks of the Gems they could use. The 1st Gen ranked much lower than the 2nd and 3rd Gen Connectors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Basically, it was like casting pearls before swine when Jimin gave the Gold rank Gem to Sungyoon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It isn't as if you can’t use it at all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“…are you being serious with me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if the Device’s quality was low, it was possible to use a high rank Gem with it. However, one had to forcefully activate the Gem, and it would cause a rebound, resulting in the device being destroyed. If the Connector’s rank was well below the rank of the Gem, it would destroy the Gem too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In other words, the Gem would be a single-use Gem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite this fact, Jimin was adamant in her position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“At the very least, it’ll be able to save your life once.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon looked straight into her eyes. He wanted to discern the truth behind the statement, but Jimin’s eyes never faltered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“…thank you for your kindness, president.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon placed the gold Gem into the Device. It was like placing a dish from a high end restaurant amongst junk food. The gold Gem was the only gem in <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">the dull silver bracelet</span> that let out a brilliant light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon looked at the lustrous gold Gem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘It is a Gem with a special ability.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t know what kind of ability this Gem possessed. The direction on how to use this Gem would only appear in his head when he would activate it. He would be able to use this Gem only once, so it would be idiotic to activate it right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was going to put his life on the line to enter this labyrinth. Even if he didn’t know how to use it, the Gold rank gem was something that reassured him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did you memorize the general information regarding the monsters?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes, I stuffed as much information in my head.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s enough.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, it wasn’t enough. But he possessed the minimum requirement to be able to enter into the labyrinth. The only thing left was to gain experience, and that was the only thing he could do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want you to get a feel for the labyrinth. You should see what kind of place it is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At some point, he'll have to overcome danger. He’ll have to put his life on the line. Sungyoon was a 1st Gen Connector, and he was aiming for the Great Labyrinth. He would have to take much more risks than the other Connectors. He would be pushed into a place where death would be his closest companion. Jimin couldn’t tell him to take it easy, and she couldn’t ask him to go slowly either. Still, this would be his first time entering a labyrinth, so she wished him a safe passage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll be back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">tightly&nbsp;</span>gripped his spear as he turned around. He started walking towards the labyrinth. He looked like a warrior mentioned in myths. He looked like a hero heading into a cave to hunt down an evil monster who had been harassing the people. At the same time, he also looked like an unfortunate living sacrifice who had been chosen to quell the anger of the monster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“…Please take care.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jimin watched the shadow of the labyrinth slowly swallow up Sungyoon. She quietly mumbled the words that she couldn’t utter in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">* * *</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon walked into the labyrinth among a crowd. Jimin said there weren’t a lot of people entering the labyrinth, but there was a couple dozen people there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As he approached the entrance, his body became tense. His heart didn’t beat faster thanks to the characteristic particular to the Connectors. However, this didn’t mean he wasn’t nervous. He would have to put his life on the line.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hoo-ooh!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He took a deep breath. It was unnecessary since he didn’t need to breathe as a Connector. However, it was good enough to lessen his nerves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It might have been just in his mind, but he felt a little bit less tense. He was able to take a step back and look at his surroundings. Sungyoon looked at his ‘allies’ as they entered into the labyrinth like him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed it wasn’t a lie that this was the Beginner’s Labyrinth. Everyone was similarly equipped as Sungyoon, and only a few looked better equipped than him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This comforted him a little bit. At the very least, he wasn’t under equipped. He was able to confirm this fact.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He walked with a little bit more confidence as he entered the entrance of the labyrinth which was completely dark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ssssk!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon flinched. It felt as if something had brushed past his skin. He was surprised, because the sensation came out of nowhere. It didn’t feel unpleasant. If he had to make a comparison, it felt like the warm mountain winds. It also felt cool like the water from a creek. Still, there was a difference. It was an amazing and new sensation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Magical energy.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He realized it by instinct. A refined, fresh, and powerful energy was being supplied by his heart. Sungyoon was like a little child seeing the ocean for the first time. He moved his hand through the air as if he was dragging his hand through the ocean water. The current of magical energy swirled around the tip of his fingers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While he was doing this, he reached the part of the Dungeon where all light was absent. The light from the Armstrong city, which had been coming in through the entrance, couldn’t reach this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the darkness didn’t hinder Sungyoon at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could see.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There wasn’t a single source of light that would allow his eyes to register any shapes around him. Despite this fact, Sungyoon’s eyes were able to pick up everything around him. It was as if his eyes were picking up objects through a different medium than light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a strange sensation. He couldn’t see, yet he could see. No, it was beyond seeing. Sungyoon’s eyes could distinguish the color and outline of objects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘This is all thanks to the magical energy.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To be precise, this was the leading hypothesis explaining this phenomenon. Sungyoon thought the hypothesis was sound in logic. The labyrinth was filled with magical energy, and the magical energy was delivering information directly to his senses. He had never experienced this on earth. It wasn’t just sight. His other senses were heightened. If there were bugs nearby, he thought he would be able to hear them crawl across the floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon continued to move along inside the labyrinth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The labyrinth was large. This wasn’t like a cave or a mine shaft. Several large buildings could fit where he was standing, and the labyrinth was getting larger as he went further in. He would have no problem swinging his spear in here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He discreetly walked up towards the wall of the labyrinth and placed his hand on it. It was hard and cold, and its surface was bumpy. It was as if someone or something had forcefully cut, tore, scratched, and sliced the walls to make this place. It wasn’t man-made, and he didn’t think this place was formed naturally.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He slowly walked forward with his hand on the wall. Soon, he came to a fork. It reminded him why this place was called a labyrinth. However, he didn’t hesitate. He took the left path. As expected of a labyrinth for beginners, there were signs placed with directions. There was no way he would get lost in here, so there was no hesitation in his footsteps.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he went past a couple more forks, there were no longer many people around him. Most of the people who had entered the labyrinth with Sungyoon, had taken different routes. At times, he also met people coming towards him. They were Connectors trying to exit the labyrinth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he had yet to see a single monster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It happened when tension was about to leave his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hoo-aht!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He heard a large shout. The sound was reflected and amplified by the nearby walls and ceiling. Sungyoon’s eyes widened, and he looked towards the source of the sound. A man was bringing down his axe further down the path.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Crunch!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He heard something breaking. Something white fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon just stared at the sight that had unfolded in front of him. The body of a small-sized animal lay in front of the man. The beast was plump, and it had a creepy looking tail. Overall, it looked similar to a rat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Big Rat.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The name was right on the nose. The monster was shaped like a big rat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘It is one of the monsters that is easy to catch for beginner Connectors.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It didn’t drop much loot, but it was relatively safe to kill it. This was why this monster was popular amongst the beginner Connectors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He meticulously searched the data bank inside his head when he caught sight of a light emanating from the Big Rat’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hwahk!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the beginning, the light had been small. The light continued to grow, and it surrounded the entire body of the Big Rat. However, the light didn’t last too long.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hoo-oohk!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the light dispersed, it was as if the corpse was swallowed up by the light. In the place of the corpse, a smooth luminescent stone remained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Moonstone!’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the item every country coveted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man placed the moonstone into a pouch hanging on his belt. He didn’t look happy at the fact that Sungyoon was looking at him. He glared at Sungyoon then he went on his way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon started walking when the man was out of sight. He gained some benefit from watching someone else battle a monster. However, he wouldn’t gain any moonstones even if he viewed such battles several hundred times. His debt wouldn’t lessen. He wasn’t here to look at other Connectors fighting monsters. He was here to find monsters he could fight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He walked past several more Connectors in the middle of their hunt. He moved deeper into the labyrinth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon stopped walking. At some point, he could no longer sense other people around him. However, it would be wrong for him to say that he was alone. There weren’t any people nearby, but something was in front of Sungyoon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Red eyes were looking at him. If Sungyoon couldn't to see through the darkness, he would have seen two burning red marbles floating in the darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sssk!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon lowered himself into his fighting stance. He placed his feet firmly on the ground as he pushed his spear outwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He heard a growl. Sungyoon gulped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immediately, he could tell this monster wasn’t friendly. The monster revealed its fangs as it glared at Sungyoon.</span></p>
