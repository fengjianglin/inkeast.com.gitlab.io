 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A small light formed in and out of existence within the complete darkness of the labyrinth. It was the light that emanated when a dead monster left behind its moonstone. Sungyoon was used to it, so he silently picked up the moonstone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘I killed 11 now.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was his second day on the hunt, so he didn’t know if he was doing well. However, Sungyoon was ready to call it a day. He hadn’t received any injuries, but he was stressed from being so tense all day. Moreover, he had come here with the goal of killing 10 monsters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked at his watch. The influence of the magical energy meant that all electronic devices didn’t work in the labyrinths. This was why he had on a mechanical wristwatch. It was four o’clock in the afternoon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon turned back. He felt a bit relieved now that the battle for the day was over. Moreover, a feeling of repulsion was starting to arise as he ended the lives of the monsters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Still, his desire to fight didn’t diminish. He would willingly go through such tribulation to have a future with his daughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While he was he was retracing his route back out of the labyrinth, Sungyoon saw two people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One of them held a 1 meter long double-edged sword, and he was fighting a Mad Dog. It seemed he didn’t have much experience, so he floundered every time the Mad Dog attacked him. However, the Mad Dog was unable to inflict any significant damage on him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He held a large angular shield in his left hand, so he was able to protect himself even with his poor movement. Unlike Sungyoon’s wooden shield, this person's shield had been reinforced with steel, and its defensive capability was on a level higher than Sungyoon’s shield.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t just that. Sungyoon was wearing a leather vest that barely covered his upper body. This man wore armor that protected his upper and lower body. His arms were protected by the arm guards, and he wore shin guards too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As this man battled, the other person was overseeing the battle. This observer had his arms crossed. Sungyoon groaned when he saw this person. It was in appreciation of this man’s gear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This man looked frightening at first glance. He had a broad sword equipped over his shoulder and a helmet that covered his nose and cheeks. The sturdy metallic helmet even had neck protection. The helmet could probably block any attack towards the head. He wore a long chain-mail that came down to his knees which even covered his arms and legs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was obvious to Sungyoon that the observer had much better gear than the one fighting the monster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you doing! Don’t become flustered!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">angrily&nbsp;</span>yelled out in English. His accent was thick, so Sungyoon had a hard time understanding his words. Still, it confirmed Sungyoon’s suspicion as to what they were doing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘They are training.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon used his exceptional hearing that came with being a Connector. It seemed the person, who was battling, had come into this labyrinth for the first time. He was on the same level as Sungyoon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, their circumstances differed completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon only had three purple Gems, and one Gold Gem that could be used to save his life. Besides, he didn't have the ability to use the Gold Gem properly. Moreover, he had to wander around the labyrinth by himself. The only preparation he had was an accelerated training course he took on earth. In comparison to him, this beginner Connector had much better equipment than him, and he was being trained how to fight by his sunbae.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘He is probably contracted to a good company.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was probably a 2nd or 3rd Gen Connector.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon turned his gaze away from them, and once again, he started walking towards the labyrinth’s entrance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he came to a crossroad, a group of people walked out from the turn-off. It was a total of four people. They were quite loud as they spoke to each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Party.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A normal company usually paired Connectors of similar level. It was a method that allowed Connectors to clear labyrinths in a much safer manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, neither a sunbae nor other Connectors of his level was contracted to his company. Such a method of raiding a labyrinth had nothing to do with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It would be a lie if he said he wasn’t jealous of them. Connectors who were trained to fight, and the Connectors who worked in a party, could clear the labyrinth several times faster than Sungyoon, and they could do it in a safer manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he shook such thoughts away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘I should be thankful for my current situation.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If it wasn’t for Jimin’s good will, he would not have been able to start his labyrinth exploration in such a stable manner. He had been in the dark, and the moon had given him a faint moonlight to navigate the road. He should be thankful to the moon instead of being jealous of the sunlight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He corrected his mindset as he quickly exited the labyrinth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">* * *</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After Sungyoon exited the labyrinth, he visited the Korea’s Connector Support Center. He didn’t have the money to maintain earth’s standard of living on Armstrong, so the support center was the only place he could rely on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The support center was located in the second district. It was where most of the world’s support centers were located. He arrived at a building flying the South Korean flag.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He entered the main lobby where the reception desk and the receptionist were located.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What brings you here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The receptionist asked in fluent Korean. Sungyoon gave the receptionist all the moonstones he collected in two days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please keep this in safekeeping for me. I also would like to receive items given to Connectors raiding the Beginner’s labyrinth.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Afterwards, he gave the receptionist his Connector ID. After the receptionist confirmed his ID, he started typing into the computer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mr Woo Sungyoon. You are a 1st Gen Connector?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon nodded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The receptionist was adept at putting away the Moonstones given to him by Sungyoon. Then, he gave Sungyoon several pills and two bottles of water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is your daily limit. Even if you ask for more, I do not have the authority to give you more. Please keep that in mind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed there were a lot of people that asked for more, so the receptionist sounded a bit annoyed when he spoke these words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You will receive the nutritional supplements and water once a day. ”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The receptionist called for a man standing nearby. It seemed this person would be his guide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He exited with Sungyoon in tow and led Sungyoon to the building next door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a gray seven-story building. It looked like a big box, and there was nothing imaginative about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a dormitory. It was a resting place provided to Connectors that were going through the Beginner’s labyrinth. This was in contrast to the 2nd and 3rd Gen Connectors, who received massive amounts of support from their companies. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unlike most 1st Gen Connectors,&nbsp;</span>they were provided a place to stay by their companies, as these Connectors had a high probability of returning profit to the companies. Everyone who lived in the dormitory was contracted to small companies. Basically, they had no backing, and they weren’t talented enough. At the very least, this was true on the moon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I hate to tell you this, but Connectors call this place the Chicken Coop.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The guide smiled so broadly that all his teeth became visible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The inside of the building was clean. However, that was the only positive. The amount of space assigned to each Connector was very small. On earth, this type of establishment was called capsule hotels. Basically, a person was given enough space to lie down. That was it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These are the exclusive capsules for the Connectors. You can stay here until your contract ends or until you return to earth. When you are assigned a Private labyrinth, you can use this place for two weeks before you have to move out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man opened a door to a capsule. Fortunately, the security to the capsule was quite good, and only the person registered to it could open its door.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man let Sungyoon scan his fingerprint into the lock, and then he said his goodbye. Sungyoon was left standing by himself next to the open door of the capsule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">First, Sungyoon tossed in the nutritional supplements and water he received earlier. Then he threw his meager possessions into the capsule. When he stuffed his body into the capsule, he closed the door. The lock let out a whirr as it automatically locked the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon looked over the interior of the capsule. There was an LED light letting out a bright light. Nothing else had been provided, not even a blanket.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was barely able to turn his body in this space. It was basically a place where one only went to sleep. The ceiling was so low that he couldn’t even sit comfortably in this space. Sungyoon felt as if he had been placed inside a coffin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Are they purposefully giving us little support?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As a country, one needed Connectors assigned to Personal labyrinths. There wasn’t much profit to be made in the Beginner’s labyrinth. This was why Connectors who continued to go to the Beginner’s labyrinth weren’t considered to be valuable. If they gave too much support to them, some might refuse to move on even if they were talented enough to enter the Private labyrinths. This miserable condition was meant to nip that problem in the bud. Of course, it would also save them money.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was about to lie down, but the blood on his clothes and skin bothered him. Sungyoon poured a small amount of water onto a towel, and he did an adequate job of wiping his body. After changing into his extra clothes, he went back to lying down on the floor. The floor was hard, and it was cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon took out his wallet, and he took out Shinhae’s picture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes softened as all the stress he received today melted away. His eyelids started to get heavy, and he couldn’t overcome his sleepiness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked at the picture for a while before he fell asleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">* * *</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several more days passed like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When morning arrived, Sungyoon pushed his aching body to wake up. He popped the vitamins into his mouth, and he washed it down with water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was his breakfast.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon changed into his bloody clothes as he headed towards the labyrinth. Sungyoon already looked shabby like the time when he was contracted to work hard labor. It was to be expected. He was wearing clothes crusted with dried blood, and there was a foul stench coming off him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it didn’t bother Sungyoon. His actions weren’t dictated by how other people judged him. He didn’t care about their gazes. Moreover, there were many Connectors in similar state as him within the Beginner’s Labyrinth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He looked a bit accustomed to doing this now. He summoned his equipment then he entered the labyrinth. He kept taking different routes when he came to a crossroad in order to find monsters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, he was able to encounter a couple monsters. He mainly encountered the Big Rats and Mad Dogs. He also ran into a Six-Legged Lizard. Sungyoon was methodical as he defeated them. As he gained more experience, his hunting speed increased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he learned the basic strategy of taking down the three monsters, he became bolder with his actions. In the past, he would repeatedly knock down the Mad Dog before he used his spear. Currently, he used his spear to stab the Mad Dog to death from the beginning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most of the Connectors killed the Mad Dogs in such a fashion. If one took in Sungyoon’s vision, reflexes and power, the Mad Dogs were easy prey for him to take down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had wandered the labyrinth for an indeterminate amount of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon stopped walking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a large black hole in front of him. He carefully looked down the hole.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The surface was uneven as it continued to slope downwards. It looked crude compared to the structures created by humans, but this clearly was a staircase.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon looked conflicted as he looked below.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The monsters became stronger as one went lower into the labyrinth. On the other hand, the size of the moonstones also increased. The probability of getting a Device or a Gem increased too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Let’s be calm.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the first time he had seen the entrance to the second floor, so he talked to himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Shall I go in?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The monsters became stronger on the 2nd floor, but they were still monsters found in the Beginner’s labyrinth. Still, even if the monsters were weak, the ones on the second floor would be stronger compared to the first floor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He glanced at his watch. He still had plenty of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘I wonder how my skills will stack up against them?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had wandered around the 1st floor for several days, and he never encountered any difficulty. In fact, his battles became easier as time passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he had that thought, a firm resolve appeared in Sungyoon’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘If I want to raid the Great Labyrinth someday, I have to go down.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sungyoon gripped his spear harder. Then his left foot left the ground, and he slowly lowered his foot into the black maw. In short order, Sungyoon completely disappeared into the hole.</span></p>
