 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Five glasses, then. I’ll help,” Su Xiaosu intruded tepidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Driver sat with the busy women plastered against his chest, arms encircling his neck. “Who’s this skanky bitch,” she complained, looking Xiaosu up and down. “Skulking around, who the hell do you think you are? Get the hell out of here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiaosu answered the woman’s hostility with a small smile. “You want to know who I am?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman disentangled herself from the Driver and rose to her feet. “I don’t give a shit who you think y-“ Before she finished her sentence, Xiaosu remove her mask and pulled back her hood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bar’s interior was dark, at first she couldn’t see clearly. Soon, though, Xiaosu’s face was revealed by the neon lights. The pirate woman visibly shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She tried to scream, but before a sound could come out, a giant hand clamped down on her throat. The five Long Island iced teas arrived, soundlessly placed on the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Driver took a drag of his cigar before brazenly blowing the smoke into the pirate woman’s face. He nodded at Lan Jue. “Drink.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiaosu didn’t wait for her boss. She snatched one up, and guzzled it down without a second thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Driver, seeing this, chuckled and looked at her with respect. “She’s quick! Little Lan, are you gunna let a girl outpace you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jue, helpless to convince them otherwise, took one of the glasses himself. </span></p>
 <p><span style><span>The effect of the iced tea had already brightened Xiaosu’s eyes. “A-Mei… that’s your name, isn’t it? Redbeard’s woman. Back in the day you were quite the seductress. Hard to count how often you made poor Redbeard a cuckold. <a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> Then you turn right around, and sick him on your poor unsuspecting lover. It’s a fascinating hobby! I hear you like to castrate them too, before they die. Or am I wrong… you’re that A-Mei, aren’t you?”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>The Driver jerked. With a cigar in one hand and A-Mei’s throat in the other, he listened with increasing horror as Xiaosu revealed her identity. A chill ran up his spine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Goddamnit, your Majesty, don’t scare me like that!” His voice was a little too loud. Several nearby patrons were still watching out of the corner of their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiaosu grinned. “Lying? Everything I’ve said is true.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>She flicked her wrist, and suddenly the whole bar was illuminated by a column of golden light. The pirates within were accustomed to the dim interior and were blinded when it suddenly changed. What followed was a chorus of grunts and muffled screams.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Over the course of a few seconds, the light dimmed and the bar darkened once again. Now, however, it was eerily silent. The only people left standing were Division soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Driver unceremoniously chuckled A-Mei to the side. “That big chest hides one poisonous bitch. I don’t kill woman. Empress, it’s up to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mei shook uncontrollably. At first she’d thought she was wrong. She hoped it was a trick of the light. But when that golden column appeared there could be no mistaking it. This was the Moonfiend Empress.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Xiaosu commanded the Moonfiend Pirates, A-Mei and Redbeard were some of her eldest enemies. Their clans battled often until the Moonfiend Pirates clawed themselves up from an inferior position. Little by little she wrestled control from Redbeard and his murderous lover, nearly killing him in one encounter. They were Xiaosu’s mortal enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Empress..! Y-your Majesty!” A-Mei wailed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiaosu regarded her with a cold, heartless expression. “Is Redbeard in the palace?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Mei quickly nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And other than him, who else is there?” She pressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Mei’s face twitched, but she didn’t answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiaosu laughed and crouched so she was level with the pirate’s face. Her small pink tongue traced a line across her lips. “I could make you very happy. Or, I can give ten days and ten nights where you’ll wish for death. It’s your choice, but you don’t seem like the kind of woman who’d commit suicide. Especially when there’s a way out... Think about it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Xiaosu stood back up, after her ultimatum had been delivered. She snatched another Long Island iced tea, and swallowed it down without taking time to taste it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Driver shot Lan Jue a glance. “I’m just now seeing how dominating our Empress can be.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This made her smirk. “What do you mean, Empress? Just a pirate boss. And when you’re a pirate boss, you have to be without scruples.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Driver was seeing her with new eyes. Up to this point she had stood meekly at Lan Jue’s side, like a kitten. She’d proven herself to be a brilliant tactician, but seemed to rely on Lan Jue like a servant. At last she was bearing her teeth, and his esteem for her and Lan Jue grew. For his commander to have a woman like her under his command, it meant he had some skill!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… I’ll tell you.” A-Mei pulled herself up on shaky legs. With a weak laugh, she added, “Your Majesty, beck to reclaim your crown. Good! That’s very good. Kill them. Every. Last. One. Hah..haha! Haha hahaha haha!” She broke into a hysterical fit of laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiaosu rapped her knuckles against a table to get her attention. She didn’t want to waste any time. After a moment the cackling subsided and A-Mei spoke again, somewhat dazed. “Empress, may I ask for one thing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak,” Xiaosu replied curtly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When I’m dead, take my ashes away from this place,” she said. “Out of the Shattered Starfields. Anywhere will do, just scatter me and leave. I don’t want to spend an afterlife in this dirty, diseased place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Xiaosu seemed struck by the comment. After a moment of silence, she nodded. “Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mei went on. “You’re here to kill Redbeard. Then you better be careful. There’ve been a number of strong people around him lately. I think I remember hearing they were from the Pontiff’s Citadel. Redbeard’s Discipline is his beard. He recently broke through to ninth level fifth rank. He’s much stronger than he was when you fought him. More cunning, too. Redbeard doesn’t get his hands dirty unless he absolutely has to, so only a few people know how strong he really is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to A-Mei’s unusual cooperation, the team was told everything about Redbeard’s organization and the state of the Moonfiend Pirates today. She gave them everything with razor-sharp clarity. The dullness in her expression before was gone, and her eyes were bright as diamonds. Halfway through she even grabbed one of the Long Island iced teas, drank it, then continued.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“ … There are two people of note around Redbeard. The obvious one is Knives. The one you don’t see is called Shadow. Both are ninth level Talents, though Shadow is stronger. You’ll need to be careful. Redbeard’s also made some additions to your Palace. There’s a hatch below his throne. At the push of a button it’ll open up below him, and he can escape through a tunnel. I don’t know where it leads.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jue and the Driver exchanged looks. They figured Xiaosu would get some information out of her, but this was a wealth of inside data. If all of what she said was true, it was going to make the scouts’ jobs much easier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s all I know, do what you gotta do. Don’t forget your promise, take my bones away from here. I can’t stand the thought of staying in this piss hole.” She heaved a bitter laugh as two glittering tears rolled down her cheeks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What were you before you came here?” Xiaosu asked softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A-Mei reluctantly opened her eyes. “What does it matter?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If what you’ve told us is true, then I’ll think about bringing your ashes back to your hometown,” Xiaosu affirmed. “You know that the Moonfiend Empress’ word is her bond.”</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“My hometown?” <a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> A-Mei’s eyes sparkled, but quickly sadness overtook her and she shook her head. “No, no need. I don’t want to tarnish my family name.”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiaosu scowled at her. “If you know what you do is shameful, why do you still do it? At last count a hundred men have died painful by your hand. Every one of them tortured, mutilated. Your name is bloodier than anyone’s, even Redbeard’s.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>“Hahahaha! HAHAhahahaha!”</span></i><span style> A-Mei doubled over as she howled with laughter. This time tears flowed freely and splattered against the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re right, my reputation is well known. Over a hundred men were my victims, even I’ve lost count how many exactly. But do you know how they treated me when I was first taken? They took turn ravaging me, disgracing me, until there wasn’t a clean inch of my body left. They wouldn’t let me go. If I was any weaker, I would have died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wanted to die. I keep living just so I can take revenge on these filthy animals. An eye for an eye. One by one I stalked them and took them down. What power did I have? I had to rely on my charms. The pigs couldn’t control themselves when they saw my body. Then I told Redbeard, hoping it would eat him up inside. But to my surprise he didn’t want to kill me. On the contrary, he loved it. That crazy bastard… he didn’t kill me, and instead I helped him kill many more. The manner didn’t both me – I was happy just killing pirates.”</span></p>
