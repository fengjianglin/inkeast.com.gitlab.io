 <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 17: Let Me Be Your Antidote</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <p>The mecha towered twenty three meters, shimmering a brilliant sapphire blue. From shoulder to shoulder it stretched eight meters, with a tall and slender figure. It’s shoulder plates were three affixed layers; the topmost was the largest with spikes which rose skyward, the middle layer was smooth and slightly smaller than the first, and the third layer retracted into the joint.</p>
 <p>It’s texture was markedly different from average mechas. It was as though it was carved from a single piece of true sapphire, a work of art. As the armor tapered towards it’s edges the color became a metallic purple. As lightning flashed in the sky above, the light from the blasts reflected magnificently off of the armor. In the instant it’s chest plate closed, it emitted a burst of intense violet light. It grew until it was as a ball of violet lightning rising in to the sky, vanishing in to the forest of arcing bolts above.</p>
 <p>“That... that was...”</p>
 <p>The golden mecha had already steadied itself where it had been left in the air. The blond-haired, green-eyed woman in the cockpit filled with a shock that was difficult to describe.</p>
 <p>“Thor. That was Thor. I actually <em>met</em> Thor. Thor… Zeus? Was that Zeus? I actually… actually told Zeus that the stronger his discipline, the more he’d bow to my mecha? The Zeus who, by virtue of his Discipline alone, bested thirteen top-grade customized mechas!”</p>
 <p>The stars shimmered in her eyes, as though she’d already forgotten all about the abduction.</p>
 <p>She hovered stupefied for a long while, then again began to mutter to herself. “Why didn’t he take <em>me</em> away?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">ζ</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Thor had risen with stunning speed, the upper atmosphere rolling past it like water off a duck’s back. In minutes it was floating in the vast, quiet expanse of space.</p>
 <p>No radar in operation was capable of locating Thor. The special composition of it’s armor was legendary in the world of Mecha-Pilots.</p>
 <p>The cabin within Thor was somewhat larger than average, but was a little cramped accommodating two people.</p>
 <p>Zeus withdrew the mask, revealing his long and handsome face. Only in this moment, he found it impossible to retain his traditional calm.</p>
 <p>In this moment he wasn’t Zeus. He was Lan Jue.</p>
 <p>He hugged his arms tightly around the woman in his embrace, as though afraid she would vanish.</p>
 <p>“Jin Yu, we’re finally together again. Why… why didn’t you come looking for me? You’re my Hera!”</p>
 <p>“I’m so hot.” Locked in his tight embrace, abducted, this was the first thing Zhou Qianlin thought to say.</p>
 <p>“Huh?” Lan Jue paused, lifting a hand to press against her forehead.</p>
 <p>Zhou Qianlin’s forehead was burning up, and her eyes had shut. Her brows were furrowed, and her body trembled slightly.</p>
 <p>She had a fever?</p>
 <p>Lan Jue’s face grew somber, noticing the red flesh of her neck. She was sick, and those people wanted her to suffer through a marriage?</p>
 <p>Lifting his head, Lan Jue muttered, “Thor, take us home.”</p>
 <p>“Affirmative, returning home.” The gentle, dignified voice reverberated through the cockpit. Thor began to transform, to wings extending from it’s back. Then, like a bolt of lightning, it shot in to the darkness of the universe.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">ζ</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Zeus’ Jewelry Store.</p>
 <p>Ke'er was bored to tears, listlessly laying atop the bar.</p>
 <p>Xiuxiu sat to the side, idly sipping the cup of warm water in her hands.</p>
 <p>The jewelry shop rarely had visitors, a common reality on Skyfire Avenue. But even if there were only one or two customers, it was usually sufficient to keep the shop running.</p>
 <p>“Hey Xiuxiu, where’d the boss go? Didn’t see him yesterday, still not here today.” Ke'er cantered her head towards Xiuxiu and whined.</p>
 <p>Xiuxiu laughed. “The boss is a very important man. You think he’d just vanish? Don’t be such a nosy little thing!”</p>
 <p>Ke'er giggled. “Me? Don’t tell me you aren’t curious what he’s doing. You came so early this morning, without waiting for me to come help. You even cleaned his house!”</p>
 <p>Xiuxiu’s face grew red, as though she’d smeared it with rouge, adding even more charm to her classical beauty.</p>
 <p>Just then, the earth shook beneath Zeus’ Jewelry Store.</p>
 <p>The girls exchanged glances. “Speak of the devil,” Ke'er exclaimed. “The boss must be back, I’ll go check.”</p>
 <p>As she said this, she skipped towards the VIP lounge.</p>
 <p>As she pushed to open the door, however, she was surprised to find it wouldn’t budge.</p>
 <p>“Xiuxiu, Ke'er, I’m a little tired. I’m going to rest for a while,” Lan Jue’s voice crackled through the speaker by the door.</p>
 <p>“Eh?” Ke'er stood confused by the door, while Xiuxiu also drew near.</p>
 <p>Ke'er turned to look at Xiuxiu. “The boss doesn’t sound quite right. Maybe he snuck a woman in, and is afraid we’d find out…”</p>
 <p>Xiuxiu lifted her hand and rapped against Ke'er’s head in agitation. “What are you saying. In three years, have you even <em>once</em>…” She trailed off, a dismal look in her eyes. “I-If he really did bring a woman back, then I’m happy for him.”</p>
 <p>Ke'er closed her mouth, and said nothing more.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">ζ</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Lan Jue carefully laid Zhou Qianlin atop his bed. Even in her state, she was still breathtakingly beautiful.</p>
 <p>His brows furrowed in thought. Not half an hour since he discovered her illness and her temperature had already risen sharply. He’d used Thor’s onboard diagnostics to run a scan, but discovered no sickness or poison. It was a drug, one that could trigger desire in the victim.</p>
 <p>Why? Why today, as a bride, would she need this sort of drug? Judging by the progress of her reaction, it was meant to last until the wedding had concluded.</p>
 <p><em>Those wretches! Was this wedding forced by the Austins? They DARE to force this drug on my Hera. </em></p>
 <p>A thin hand softly rested atop his own, it’s heat and soft touch drawing him from his rage.</p>
 <p>Zhou Qianlin’s body had grown red, and her body began to writhe.</p>
 <p>It was a fierce, powerful drug.</p>
 <p>Leaning down, he gently took her up in his arms. He felt the heat radiating from her, could smell the familiar scent of her body.</p>
 <p>Softly he whispered in her ear. “My Hera. In this life, you are destined to be my bride, and mine alone. Let me be your antidote.”</p>
