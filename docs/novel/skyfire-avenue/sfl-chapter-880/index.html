She used to tell us that love isn’t something you can manage. She always loved you. You would protect her if she were bullied, and help keep her head high – no matter the cost. She remembered that. And the times she would dress up as your bride when you played as children. She said she was yours all the way back then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xiuxiu was in so much pain when you were together with Hera. Her mood was always off. When Hera was gone and we came to you, to help you recover, we all thought the two of you would come together in time. Instead you fell apart. Xiuxiu saw what it did to you and cried every night. But she never cried in front of you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“When you snapped out of your stupor no one was happier than Xiuxiu. Then another girl that looked exactly like Hera showed up in your life. When she found out Xiuxiu went out to get drunk. We stayed with her. We all drank. Boss, she really loved you. She loved you more than her own life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Lin Guoguo’s words washed over him tears streamed down Lan Jue’s face.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Jue hung his head and his eyes swung to her storage device. The last thing she wanted him to have… but what was it?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He rose to his feet, and addressed the three of them firmly. “I need some silence.”</span></p>

Not this time. He needed to be alone.</span></p>

After joining with Ultus his ghostly appearance was almost indistinguishable from reality. He would never have a physical form of his own again, but this was a close facsimile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He discovered that as Lan Qing’s power grew he became more substantial. Maybe one day he could hold his daughter for the first time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Qing nodded. “Ultus asks for far more than I thought. We need to improve our cultivation. I worry if we’d succeed even if we all reach Nirvana.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Ke grinned. “Honestly, I don’t know either. All I see what I find in Ultus’ memories, and I’ve found nothing about what the Strategy will really do. After all, it’s been an uncountable number of years since Ultus has appeared in human hands.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If there a way for us to quickly improve our cultivation?” Lan Qing asked. “Surely the crystals we took today can help.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Li Ke nodded. “Helpful, yes. Enough in fact to empower you to the Infinite, I’d think. But that’s not the way to do it. Your bodies wouldn’t be able to withstand the massive amount of pressure placed on them. Little Yue told me Lan Jue and Qianlin have broken through a series of grades very quickly. Pressing that process any further would be dangerous. But once they do break through to the Infinite, I don’t think they would be in any danger of a power backlash from the swords. Absorbing and assimilating protogenia takes time, and you’re already moving quickly. Going too fast will have consequences, not least of which the universe itself. You won’t know what it is to suffer the pressure of universal protogenia until you become one with the Infinite. Under those conditions the power you could command wouldn’t be at the Infinite level. You’d be lucky to command the power of Nirvana. First, before we do anything, you all need to reach Nirvana. Once you do we can attempt the Strategy. Then we’ll see if anything else needs to be done.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Qing nodded. He agreed that it was the best path forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">ξ</span></p>

No one knew what he was doing. Once he shut the door no one had gone in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Humanity’s armada and its three bastions slowly made their way back to Angel. They encountered no more aliens on the way. It wasn’t very long before they were back on solid ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Qing and the Pharmacist locked themselves away as well. They were trying to achieve Nirvana as soon as possible.&nbsp;</span></p>

Chu Cheng took the remains of the Terminator and the vital crystal left behind to Tyrannosaurus.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were returning after a series of victories, but they were hollow. The looming threat of destruction remained.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they got back to Angel they were met with good news. Another bastion had appeared in Angel’s orbit. It was Heron, the only bastion left that had experience fighting the alien horde.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Northern Alliance had suffered a terrible defeat in the Shattered Starfields, and again shortly after. To try and offset this they threw all their resources into repairing their fastest ship. It packed a punch as well. As for other reinforcements it would be some time before they showed up. Luckily Angel’s food stores were well stocked, and there were no fear of the citizens revolting. They’d started building neighborhoods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course they made announcements of their victories during the campaign. This boosted moral and gladdened the hearts of the people. Video of the clashes were spread far and wide, filling the humans with hope. Especially when believers saw their Queen of Heaven appear on screen. Seeing her fighting nimbly by Lan Jue’s side only boosted her reputation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course the inevitable question afterward was, who was this man who dared fight shoulder to shoulder with her?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lan Jue soon became the focus of scrutiny. He was known as the champion of the Conclave’s Great Adept Tournament, and a hero who showed up to turn the tide on many tragedies. When they saw his pedigree they grudgingly accepted his relationship to Qianlin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All over occupied space human eyes were trained on Angel, waiting for the verdict. Things had thankfully settled down, however, after word of the armada’s deeds spread. Their string of victories and saving their fellow man had given them hope and pride.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But this relative silence had its drawbacks. Some were already voicing skepticism, saying that there were too few soldiers to prevail. Why weren’t all of the North’s eight bastions out there fighting for mankind?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Why weren’t there reinforcements for these soldiers who’ve been battling on the front lines so long already? Were politicians more concerned with their own interests than those of their species? The North and East both suffered chastisement, though the North got it worse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All along the North had been known as humanity’s mightiest Alliance, with an invincible fighting worse. Yet in this decisive time it wasn’t the North was in charge. The Eastern Alliance and Poseidon Group were guiding the way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Poseidon-class bastion’s praise was especially high when the word got out, after scenes from its remarkable fight appeared on civilian screens. It was especially shocking for everyone to see it fighting in mecha form. Needless to say it made an impression and suddenly the Poseidon Group’s reputation exploded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Northern military news sources reported that in addition to Heron they were also sending two more bastions to the front line. They had to under pressure of public opinion. However the keen of eye knew that the war was coming to its end soon one way or another. Sending reinforcements now would make little difference in either case.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heron’s sudden arrival boosted the Northern’s military capabilities significantly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since Lan Qing was working on his cultivation, Kang Hui had taken temporary control of the armada. He immediately recommended they prepare for another assault on the home worlds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kang Hui had no choice but to adhere to Lan Qing’s plan for the Banishing Blades, but he was still the commander of the Northern forces. There was still a lot of suspicion surrounding whether four swords could destroy three planets.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact they doubted that the alien home worlds were trying to create their own utopia. But they did know these monsters were changing, and whatever they changed into would be the stuff of nightmares.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kang Hui proposed moving in now. The evolution had to be stopped, and both the monsters’ soldiers and generals were bloodied. With the addition of Heron they were sufficiently reinforced, according to him. The nimble bastion was ready for action.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t completely dismiss the possibility of the Banishing Blades being effective. What he proposed was a two-prong attack. If they could succeed with a purely military victory than that would be great, and the Banishing Swords could be kept as a backup. If they fail at least they’ll have succeeded in weakening the enemy further. Perhaps that’d improve the Easterners’ chances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;His proposal passed unanimously. Even the commander representing the Eastern army in Lan Qing’s absence agreed. Poseidon Group didn’t share an opinion. Its bastion, and Middle Heaven as well, would not fight as well in future battles as they had been.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the plan was ratified Kang Hui announced three days of rest and repairs.

They had an advantage technologically, but maintaining a force of notable Adepts was going to be difficult.</span></p>

Once that energy was filtered by the tears it could be used safely.</span></p>

In around five hours this crystal will be spent and they should be strong enough to make a breakthrough. From my analyses I suspect that once they join you in Nirvana they’ll need time to stabilize their cultivation. Qianlin’s Queen of Heaven Discipline should help them significantly there. Afterwards all four of you should undergo this process. We won’t push you into the Infinite, but we have to bolster your abilities as much as we can. The stronger you are, the more likely it will be that you can survive using the Banishing Strategy.”</span></p>

Qianlin let her Domain reach out and embrace them.

The two were almost immediately more relaxed, and were able to take in more of the vital energy.</span></p>

It wasn’t a power move, but one of practicality. Tyrannosaurus had the most resources left after their last campaign.

With Tyrannosaurus in the middle it gave the other bastions more leeway.</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: center"><strong>Chapter 883: General Offensive</strong></p>
 <p>The ten fleets coasted forward, and spread out to either side of the bastions like wings. Their guns were primed, waiting for the order to fire. The four bastions also lit up as their weapon arrays were prepared.</p>
 <p>Just then, the remains of the alien horde were revealed. They came swarming around either side of Europa and right for the armada. They lacked the vigor and numbers from before.</p>
 <p>“Open fire!” At Kang Hui’s order the bastions and their support fleets let loose. Spears of light crashed into the encroaching enemy force.</p>
 <p>The horde’s formation was diffuse, and they used their speed to evade the human long-ranged attacks as much as they could. However the hail of cannon fire was tightly packed and avoiding it completely was impossible. The aliens began suffering casualties right away. Compared to the last encounter the humans seemed much more confident.</p>
 <p>Behind his control panel Kang Hui summoned his Discipline. Through his empowered eyes he read and analyzed the information that flooded his screens. Despite the punishment his enemy was facing in the opening moments of their conflict he did not relax. In fact his face grew darker as the moments stretched on.</p>
 <p>The aliens came at them with no direction. He read that to mean the home worlds were almost finished with their evolution. If that were the case their elite would be sticking close to their masters. They didn’t need to command the troops, they were just cannon fodder.</p>
 <p>Should they throw caution to the wind and attack Europa at full force?</p>
 <p>His opponent still had a numbers advantage, although they were in disarray. Rushing ahead would expose his troops to a brutal counter offensive, and many would be lost. Besides, it could be a trap.</p>
 <p>Kang Hui’s fighting style was always calm, and it’d served him well so far. Caution is what saved him from dying at the aliens’ hands long ago in the Shattered Starfields.</p>
 <p>Instead of calling for the charge he ordered the ships to continue to pummel the aliens’ front lines. However, he commanded the bastions to hold back on firing their main weapons. He wanted to save their strongest attacks for the planets themselves.</p>
 <p>Eventually the aliens gathered into some semblance of formation. More defensive aliens took the fore and their speedier brethren stuck close behind. The plan was to push ahead, and once they got within range the faster aliens would burst out and wreak havoc among the human ships.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mankind’s armada was much weaker than it was when they first arrived in the system. After the last encounter the difference was especially marked, and especially now without Lan Qing’s tactical genius. However, Kang Hui was also a lauded commander and he had no problem leading the human forces. His strategic plans were simple, but nonetheless took advantage of their ranged superiority to great effect.</p>
 <p>Kang Hui orders artillery fire focused on the stronger aliens. He wanted them to be pummeled as hard as possible as they pressed forward. Once the enemy was close enough for their fast attackers to emerge they would be met by the Paragon-led Star Division, the Bloodiron Khan’s, and Chu Cheng’s convert army.</p>
 <p>Against mankind’s greatest Adept warriors and drones from their bastions, the aliens who dared attack were cut to ribbons. They were unable to cause any damage to the main fleet.</p>
 <p>With their considerable advantage Kang Hui’s leadership was flawless. The alien forces met the humans and were cut down like they were flung into a meat grinder. Monsters were cut down by the dozens and their vital crystals captured.</p>
 <p>Kang Hui was keenly aware of the Violet Prince’s absence, however. The three-headed, six-armed abomination was also nowhere to be found. They appeared to have disappeared after their failed sneak attack.</p>
 <p>Already the armada was extending an advantage that seemed irrevocable. Already the horde was begin pushed back. The armada began moving toward Europa was slow but indomitable progress.</p>
 <p>Soldiers who didn’t know any better began to cheer, their cries reverberating off the hulls of their ships. After all these hardships and losses, they were beating the enemy! How could they not be overcome with joy? And as participants of this life or death struggle, they were heroes! In their mind’s eye they could see the scene of their triumphant return, with tickertape parades and flower petals descending from the sky. Humanity’s allied forces, a ray of hope in a dark time.</p>
 <p>Cannons continued to bombard the enemy, never letting up. The enemy was steadily losing ground. Nothing indicated the home worlds were getting involved, either. Europa was still hidden beneath the cloud of caustic purple fog that made it look like a fantastical land from the story books. By contrast the three planets looked like hideous tumors affixed to the planet’s surface. Aside from the roiling tides of the clouds, nothing moved. They seemed completely devoid of life.</p>
 <p>Kang Hui pressed a button on his control panel. In his deep voice he hailed the person on the other end. “Heron, prepare your main gun.”</p>
 <p>“Heron receiving. Main gun is charging.” The response came swiftly.</p>
 <p>Kang Hui refused to be lulled into a false sense of security by the scene before him. On the contrary, he was all the more vigilant. From the very beginning the aliens had enjoyed the advantage. Right up until this point humanity had been against the ropes, only to suddenly see a reverse in fortune. It was important to remember that it wasn’t Lan Qing’s brilliance alone that got them to this point, however. An important factor was the fact that the home worlds were not involved in the fighting.</p>
 <p>If they had been even Lan Qing couldn’t have spun gold out of straw. Against the home worlds and its horde the humans would never have stood a chance.</p>
 <p>But not being present on the battlefield didn’t mean their threat did not exist. Quite the opposite, the planets were laden with the life force of eight planets and all the vitality they stole from the Northern Alliance. They hadn’t used any of that energy in battle against the humans and instead funneled it into their evolutionary process. Kang Hui shuddered to think what sort of power this new creation would wield once its evolution was complete.</p>
 <p>It went without saying that Kang Hui didn’t find their chances appealing if the home worlds chose to fight. His loss at their hands was still acutely carved into his memory, an angry scar to remind him of his defeat. Their variable offense and impenetrable protection made them virtually impossible to shake off. They were as strong as they were cunning, and used whatever advantage available to win victory over their prey. As such humans had consistently been beaten back.</p>
 <p>And so Kang Hui called off his focus to bear. Heron was their weakest bastion, but also charged its main weapons system fastest. As the fastest ship in the fleet it made for a natural choice to use as an opening gambit.</p>
 <p>Lan Qing had told him that the home worlds had mostly fused with Europa by this point. The former Western capitol was the basis of their evolution and had been chosen as the site for these beasts’ new immortal realm. With no hope of survivors left on Europa, it and the three home worlds attached to its surface were the main target.</p>
 <p>“Heron reporting. Main guns are charged and ready!” The alert was fast in coming across Kang Hui’s speakers. The armada was getting closer to Europa with each passing moment.</p>
 <p>Kang Hui answered with a string of commands. The bombardment became even more intense as capital ships, up to now their cannons dark, joined the fight. The punishing offensive carved a path through the horde.</p>
 <p>Heron’s main engines flared to life and in a flash the bastion shot ahead. It punched through the flimsy alien line and was at top speed in moments. Its three main guns were extended and aimed at Europa.</p>
 <p>The planet was a big target. Heron’s gunners weren’t afraid of missing.</p>
 <p>While Heron made its attack run Kang Hui continued to call out orders. Tyrannosaurus, Poseidon and Middle Heaven all began to charge their primary weapons. Heron’s attack was a feeler, to see how the planets would react. Once they got a read they could follow up with shots from the others bastions. He was confident that one round of attacks, if it didn’t destroy Europa outright, would at least severely affect the home worlds’ evolution. That would be enough, and they could focus on a more comprehensive attack. The greatest result would be to damage the planet enough so that the evolution process was stopped entirely. Then, under concentrated fire, they could destroy the enemy outright.</p>
 <p>At least for the moment his plan seemed to be working.</p>
 <p>Heron shook as three beams of cyan light fired from its cannons. It erupted with such intensity that space rippled around the guns’ barrels. While the weapon wasn’t as strong as Tyrannosaurus’, say, it was still a bastion’s weapon. The damage it caused was more than considerable, and against any ordinary planet the results would be catastrophic.</p>
 <p>Nothing was in the way of the three beams of light. In a blink they pierced the fog covering Europa and a mushroom cloud surged in its wake. All three shots disappeared in the haze.</p>
 <hr>
 <p style="text-align: center"><strong>Chapter 884: Aliens, Defeated?</strong></p>
 <p>With its payload delivered, Heron pulled to the side and arced away from Europa. With its speed and attack power it didn’t worry about fighting its way back through the horde. After all, the armada was not far behind. The aliens were under so much pressure they didn’t have an opportunity to give chase.</p>
 <p>As Heron tore off to the flank its crew waited with baited breath. They stared at the screens and out of the windows, anxious to see the result of their flyby. If they could do Europa any harm it would open the gates for the other bastions to do the same.</p>
 <p>Kang Hui was a good man, honest and sincere. Heron was chosen to attack the planet for more than just military reasons. Europa was the capitol of the former Western Alliance! Although the people knew it was no longer fit for human habitation, in their hearts – especially those of the Westerners – they still held the planet in high esteem. It would be better for the North to land the first strike, instead of an Eastern vessel, or Poseidon.</p>
 <p>The order was Kang Hui’s. He would bear the consequences.</p>
 <p>“Eh?” He snapped out of his ruminations.</p>
 <p>Heron wasn’t the only one waiting for signs of reaction! He’d watched the blasts enter the cloud cover, but then… nothing.</p>
 <p>The disturbance in the fog gradually disappeared and the surface looked like nothing had happened. There were no lights or indications of the shots passing behind the planet either. That should mean Heron’s attack landed.</p>
 <p>But, why was there no sign of impact? Where did the shots go? The uncertainty immediately set everyone on edge.</p>
 <p>Those were three shots from a bastion’s main cannons! Nothing came of them, not even the sounds of an explosion. It was like they just vanished into nothing, like Europa was a black hole.</p>
 <p>“All forces focus your attacks on the enemy soldiers. Fire main cannons at will.” Kang Hui directed.</p>
 <p>Europa’s situation was too inscrutable. Instead they would focus on weakening the horde, and once they got some breathing room they could find a more effective way to deal with the former human planet.</p>
 <p>Almost before the orders left his lips Middle Heaven was in the thick of it. Where before it’d silently waited behind its defenders, it was now a piercing orb of light that fired rays of amber light in all directions. Together with Poseidon’s Soft Water bombs, swaths of alien fighters were destroyed.</p>
 <p>The monsters were like a snake without its head, flailing every which way. They didn’t stand a chance against humanity’s disciplines forces.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Heron flew back around and rejoined the battle. After thirty minutes the enemy forces were under threat of collapse. Though the morale of these cruel beasts could not be broken, their lines could. More and more of them fell until the battle had become a one-sided extermination.</p>
 <p>Mankind’s warriors could not let up, not when victory was so close at hand and so many vital crystals were up for grabs! These crystals were treasures that were priceless no matter how many of them were passed around. The exuvium process was complete and ready for use to extend human life. The foundation of that process was these vital crystals.</p>
 <p>Humans had killed countless numbers of these monsters already, but there were also planets worth of humans. Everyone wanted a chance to live longer, and the only way to do that was if they got their hands on one of these crystals.</p>
 <p>In addition Skyfire Avenue wasn’t the only one who encouraged their soldiers with the promise of a spot on the list to use the exuvium process. The North, and Poseidon Group also had similar plans.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Now more than ever was the time to gather these crystals. In the eyes of these soldiers it might be their last chance. Mechas, warship crews, drone pilots – everyone wanted to take advantage of this situation. Everyone was fighting their hardest.</p>
 <p>This was, of course, within reason. The soldiers of the allied forces had struggled together for a long time, and none of them were willing to risk the lives of their brothers and sisters in greedy pursuits. There were enough vital crystals for everyone.</p>
 <p>According to Northern and Eastern reports, one average vital crystal was enough to facilitate the exuvium process for ten people. The creatures they were killing now were more than your average fiend, and some were even of the enemy’s upper echelons.</p>
 <p>The better the crystal the more often it could be used for the process. The results were also better by orders of magnitude.</p>
 <p>But while the soldiers were celebrating, the officers knew the war wasn’t over yet. Heron’s attack hadn’t done much of anything, so how were they supposed to deal with the planet?</p>
 <p>The horde’s numbers thinned but never broke. Although they were cut down in droves there was no indication they would be routed or retreat. The beasts fought back as hard as ever.</p>
 <p>Eventually the wriggling purple bodies disappeared from space. A glittering field of crystals was left behind, quickly gobbled up by the human ships.</p>
 <p>At last the army of monsters that had harassed the human species had been exterminated. Cries of elation rang from the smallest patrol boat to the largest bastion. And it wasn’t just the soldiers, either. All throughout the worlds of man people cheered their heroes. They’d watched with baited breath as the fight was broadcast into every home. Win or lose, the people had a right to know. The government could of course shut off the feed whenever they chose, but when it was clear humanity was winning they kept it going, clear as a bell.</p>
 <p>Northern cries were especially loud. Two out of the four bastions were dispatched from their Alliance and the leader of the expedition was one of their own. They proudly congratulated themselves on these facts and through this the people were calmed. In fact the government enjoyed a sharp spike in public approval. Heron proved their leaders were committed to reinforcing the heroes of the front lines. In this they were better than the East. Suddenly the calls for consequences were silenced and the citizens were at peace. Instead there were words of praise and support offered up from all corners of the Alliance.</p>
 <p>Only a handful of people had the inside scoop, and knew that the fight wasn’t over. The three home worlds still remained. It was the worst disaster in hundreds of years, but it wasn’t over until those hellish planets were destroyed.</p>
 <p>Kang Hui was inundated with commendations. He didn’t try to silence the jubilation immediately. The soldiers had fought for so long, witnessed the death of their fellow shoulders and countrymen. They’ve needed this for a long, long time.</p>
 <p>After a few moments he delivered more commands to the various ship captains. The fight wasn’t over yet, he assured them, they had one final enemy to overcome. Now wasn’t the time for celebration.</p>
 <p>Soon the vital crystals left behind by their defeated enemies were gathered together. It went without saying that the North won the largest number of crystals, for their two bastions were integral in the fight. Especially Heron and its three thousand drones. They were fierce and flexible, resulting in an impressive haul.</p>
 <p>“Form up, surround Europa.” Soldiers were trained to follow orders like the word of god. Still beaming from their victory the soldiers rushed to follow instructions once they were given. The fleets spread out, and the bastions gathered in single file.</p>
 <p>A fire burned behind Kang Hui’s eyes. <em>Do you still think yourselves so strong, monsters? With all our ships, bastions and soldiers do you think yourselves invincible?</em></p>
 <p>All four bastions began recharging their main weapons. Among them was Middle Heaven, smoldering as it prepared the terrible power that was Terminal Ray. Poseidon, though still unable to change shape, still had Soft Water bombs to employ.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kang Hui quickly puzzled out the best plan of attack. All bastions would concentrate their fire on a single point, together with the fleet as a whole. If all of their firepower was directed as Europa’s core they could destroy the planet outright.</p>
 <p>From what he could tell from outside, none of the alien worlds plastered to Europa’s surface were reacting to the horde’s destruction. Their life force and consciousness must be completely funneled into the single planet. Thus if Europa was destroyed, the home worlds would die with it.</p>
 <p>This was not the time for mercy and kindheartedness. Kang Hui knew he’d have to face many difficult questions once the campaign was finished, but he didn’t hesitate to give the order. Nothing was more important than the survival of the species.</p>
 <p>The allied forces took advantage of the calm before the final storm. Energy stores were replenished and stabilized, guns were charged. Secondary weapons systems were tuned down, for they were no longer helpful for what was to come. Only their strongest weapons could harm Europa, especially at a distance.</p>
 <p>Battleship-class vessels and smaller were ordered not to engage. They were told to observe the situation and await further orders. Everyone else had their weapons primed and aimed, waiting for the order to fire from Tyrannosaurus.</p>
 <p>The feeling of it all was thick in the air, everyone could feel it. Their battle was coming to a close, and though their final objective was in view they were not relaxed. They were tense, anxious, excited.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The four bastions shimmered with light as they pulled into firing range. Tempestuous flows of energy surrounded each of them.</p>
 <hr>
 <p style="text-align: center"><strong>Chapter 885: Success?</strong></p>
 <p>“Poseidon, prepare your main weapon.” Kang Hui ordered. He was taking personal command of how this final attack was executed.</p>
 <p>“Soft Water bombs are ready to be deployed!” Hua Li’s voice returned. Poseidon’s patriarch was also taking full responsibility of his family’s bastion.</p>
 <p>“Fire!” Kang Hui said.</p>
 <p>“Fire!” Hua Li echoed.</p>
 <p>Six glittering orbs were belched from Poseidon. Marvelous tails of blue light hung in the darkness of space where they passed on their way toward Europa.</p>
 <p>The destructive capabilities of the Soft Water bombs were put on display more than once in earlier battles. Against living targets it was frighteningly effective, and the most difficult to evade.</p>
 <p>The six bombs quickly reached their destination. They were ingeniously released in a line and slipped into the cloudy surface of Europa one after the other.</p>
 <p>Nothing changed as the first bomb entered, then the second, then the third…</p>
 <p>Once all six bombs disappeared into the fog a reaction became visible. The rolling tide of mist became tumultuous. Barely visible were flashes of blue light as the bombs detonated. They were arranged in a line to detonate at different depths, from the highest reaches of Europa’s atmosphere to where the ground presumably hid below.</p>
 <p>Kang Hui had determined it was the best use of Poseidon’s weapons. His aim wasn’t to harm the planet so much as clear the fog so they could get a glimpse of what lay beneath.</p>
 <p>The aliens had a reason for everything. When Heron’s attack disappeared into the fog Kang Hui knew the mists must have some defensive purpose. Perhaps they drained and devoured energy that passed through. If that were true the first step to a successful blow would have to be clearing a path through the fog. Without its protection they could damage the planet.</p>
 <p>His tactics were sound. The cloud cover melted away like snow before the summer sun. Europa’s surface was revealed.</p>
 <p>Spectators looked on in surprise. Europa’s surface had been painted in a pale purple hue, in contrast to the rich purple of the home worlds that had taken it over. The remains of human structures could be faintly discerned by their long-ranged telescopes, partially obscured by wisps of the fog that remained.</p>
 <p>Kang Hui did not appreciate the beautiful scenery, for he knew the cost of its creation. He continued to deliver his commands.</p>
 <p>“Tyrannosaurus, fire the main gun!”</p>
 <p>Tyrannosaurus’ weapons were already aimed and fully charged. Once the order was given its primary cannon released a blazing beam of light right into the channel left by the Soft Water bombs. It sizzled through the darkness of space, a spear ready to skewer the planet like a kebab.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Heron, all remaining ships, fire at will!” With Tyrannosaurus’ blast on its way Kang Hui ordered the fury of the human armada released on their enemy.</p>
 <p>Without hesitation thousands upon thousands of cannon blasts followed in the wake of Tyrannosaurus’ shot. They were all carefully aimed to slip through the same channel, like threading a needle. Poseidon’s secondary weapons systems, which packed as much punch as a fleet of capital ships, also spat out a salvo.</p>
 <p>This was their chance to accomplish their goal in one final, decisive stroke. No one held back.</p>
 <p>The resulting explosion was so intense it shook the distant ships. Burst after concussive burst rang in everyone’s ears – a sound they would remember for all the rest of their days. Without the protection of the fog the ire of the human armada was heard, though it was difficult to tell how much it was felt. Still, Kang Hui was confident in the capability of their unified assault.</p>
 <p>“Middle Heaven, prepare Terminal Ray!” Kang Hui did not let up.</p>
 <p>Against any normal planet the last hail of cannon fire would have been enough to split it in twain. However, Kang Hui did not want to underestimate their enemy, not in the slightest. Everything they had at their disposal, every weapon and tactic, he wanted thrown at their foes. They wouldn’t stop until Europa was a cloud of space dust.</p>
 <p>Flickers of angry amber light appeared around Middle Heaven as several beams were fired at once from different locations. They coalesced in front of the war planet into a single point of light so pregnant with energy space warped around it – Terminal Ray. The last time it was used in combat mankind walked away with several elite vital crystals. Now its aim was to obliterate Europa before it was converted into an alien paradise. To Kang Hui this was the&nbsp;pièce de résistance. The surface of the planet should already been a cratered hellscape, and once Terminal Ray made landfall Europa would be no more. It just needed to drill past the crust and into its core.</p>
 <p>Kang Hui didn’t put much stock in the stories of ancient immortal realms. To him the alien evolution was a process of energy consolidation. No matter how strong they got, once their planet was destroyed their evolution was finished.</p>
 <p>At last, humanity’s long, dark night was coming to an end!</p>
 <p>The light of expectation glimmered in Kang Hui’s eyes. One tortuous event after another had plagued them as they waited for this day! He and his species would survive. Kang Hui imagined seeing his family, heard the cheers of the people as they came back from this bloody campaign. Peace would reign again.</p>
 <p>Suddenly a bone-deep fatigue washed over him. If he could go back he likely wouldn’t join the army. He envied the life of the normal man, quiet and peaceful. At the very least he would want a nice, long vacation once this was all finished. Let the military function without him for a time, he could avoid the interviews and galas and feasts.</p>
 <p>The thoughts flitted through his mind, but did not impeded his command.</p>
 <p>“Terminal Ray – fire!” Kang Hui coolly gave the order just as the blasts from Tyrannosaurus and the other ships were dying down.</p>
 <p>Never let up! Let the attacks compound and make each other stronger. Kang Hui had considered everything that required consideration, and took all steps necessary to see this corrupted human planet destroyed.</p>
 <p>Terminal Ray’s flash lasted only a moment. In what couldn’t have been longer than a fraction of a second, the piercing ray of light buried itself in Europa’s surface. The afterimage of its passage was burned in the eyes of spectators.</p>
 <p>Would it be enough? Kang Hui’s fists had unconsciously clenched, and he wasn’t alone. Every commander of every ship watched in dread anticipation.</p>
 <p>Kang Hui ordered everyone to fall back. Europa was among the largest planets to have been inhabited by humans. Once it exploded the scale of its detonation would cover a vast area. It would be very easy for their whole armada to be wiped out in the aftermath.</p>
 <p>Gradually the lights all faded. The fog surrounding Europa continued to buck and writhe, except for the funnel created by the Soft Water bombs. Why was there no sound of explosion? Did the attack land?</p>
 <p>Uncertainty wormed its way into Kang Hui’s mind. He could see clearly through the cavity in the clouds, peered through their telescopes and magnified on his screen. Europa’s surface was a world of golden purple, unscathed but for the crater where their attacks had landed. In the place where they’d aimed their barrage was a vortex of purple energy that fiercely swirled.</p>
 <p>In the center of the vortex was a haze of golden orange light. That had to be the residual energy from Terminal Ray’s passage. The light began to grow, and as it did the whole of Europa started to shake ever so slightly.</p>
 <p>Success?</p>
 <p>Kang Hui’s heart fluttered. He saw the shudders as a sign of impending collapse and ordered everyone to fall back as quickly as they could.</p>
 <p>However it was then he noticed a change in the three planets affixed to Europa. They stretched and became oblate before eventually dissolving onto the surface of Europa. The purple orbs that were once Monarch, Queen and Consort shimmered gold and disappeared into the fog.</p>
 <p><em>This…</em></p>
 <p>Was Europa going to explode? When Kang Hui witnessed this scene he was painfully skeptical. If their target planet was going to die, why would the aliens merged with it?</p>
 <p>A voice entered his mind, as cold as it was terrifying.</p>
 <p>“Thank you for your bounty, humans!” The thought was clear and mocking.</p>
 <p>Disquiet filled Kang Hui’s heart. He wasn’t the only one to hear the voice either – every single soul aboard every vessel heard the voice in their mind.</p>
 <p>“Attack, attack with everything you’ve got!” Kang Hui shouted.</p>
 <p>The home worlds weren’t destroyed, and Europa wasn’t going to explode. Kang Hui came to a dark and bitter understanding.</p>
 <p>The effect of this intrusive thought had a dramatic effect on the soldiers. Their attacks were let loose on Europa, but wild and haphazard.</p>
 <p>All four bastions had used their main weapons and needed time to recharge them, especially Middle Heaven. Terminal Ray was especially draining and it would be a while before the East’s bastion could use it again.</p>
 <p>The crater that they’d created with their attack was gone. The fog that surrounded Europa was dimmer now and threads of gold were spreading through it. At the same time it settled deeper into the atmosphere and thinned out, giving the beleaguered planet a misty, fantastical air.</p>
