 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright. What about A-Jue?” Hua LI’s voice sounded concerned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s been cultivating,” Lan Qing replied. “He hopes to break through before this fight starts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Li’s anxiety was clear. “You need to persuade him not to be too hasty. There are real risks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Qing was calm as ever. “He’s fine, his foundation is solid. He could have broken through a long time ago if he’d wanted to. This is the most opportune moment he’s encountered so far. He wont rush, don’t worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Li replied. “That’s good. Who’d have thought we’d really come to a day when we’d be fighting shoulder to shoulder, eh? A-Cheng should be coming with Tyrannosaurus. You think they’ll write stories about us? ‘The Battle of the Four Divine Monarchs’?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Qing’s voice betrayed his no-nonsense demeanor. “If you have nothing of substance to say, hang up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh! Guy, you really need to grow a personality. Alright, that’s that then. We’ll talk again in person.” Hua Li hung up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Qing shook his head. In reality he wasn’t thrilled with the fact Hua Li was commanding his bastion. Simply put the entertainer was too gentle. In the heat of battle you needed blood of iron, it was too easy for emotional problems to rise to the fore. Calm needed to be maintained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, he was pleased with the help from Poseidon Group’s warriors. They were the richest army in all the alliances, and was well established. Their strength was undisputed, and their people boasted a host of talents. He just hoped their Poseidon-class bastion packed more surprises for them to exploit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three bastions, three planets. On paper they were decent odds. The alien home worlds were strong, but Lan Qing had faith in Middle Heaven. Even if their mission failed…</span></p>
 <p><span style>His face became stern. If the North had the strength, so did the East!</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">ζ</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The air was thick and gloomy aboard the large blue ship. Sylva Austin sat within the cockpit, ghastly pale. He’d maintained this position for several hours already. When news that the West’s bastions had fallen, the Austin family’s ships raced to Europa. It didn’t take them long to load up most of their riches and leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although they were the West’s ultimate political family, they didn’t have anywhere near the riches Poseidon Group boasted. All they needed was a transport ship disguised as a merchant vessel. Their escape was tacitly agreed to by the Western government, since the Austins had held the reigns of power for so long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Richard Austin stood at his father’s side. He looked just as bad, distraught over having to flee his home and flying toward an uncertain future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father. Us leaving like this… the West…” He struggled to find the words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The West is finished!” Sylva harshly replied to his son. Yes, the West was finished. Without its bastions it was like a naked woman waiting to be ravaged. There was no other outcome.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But we can ask for support from the North. The Aliens wouldn’t be able to ambush and destroy so many bastions at once.” Richard was clearly loathe to abandon his home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sylva shut his eyes, pain written on his face. “Impossible. I know what is happening in the North. You are not a politician, you don’t understand the problems politicians face. They can’t do something simply because they want to. Their people are rioting, their last offensive served only to condemn many of their young men to death. Four planets were destroyed. Their failure scarred them deeply, and all they can do now is defend their homes. Of course, the destruction of the West just means their own death has been postponed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sylva opened his eyes. They were hard and bitter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Richard was shocked. “So… you mean we aren’t going to the North?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His father replied. “Of course not. Why would we do? Become their vassals? We have been preparing, spending a lot of our hard-earned wealth to gather everything we need to resettle somewhere else. We have the technology to terraform a place to our needs, build a new ecosystem. We’re leaving the territories traditional held by mankind – the farther the better. Our family and servants, three thousand people, will constitute the foundation of a new Western Alliance. Even if they defeat the aliens, the West as we know it know has passed into history. How will they treat us? The Austins survival must be assured by becoming leaders, as is their right!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Richard opened his mouth, but said nothing. A bitter expression crossed his face. Europa… he’d grown up there, it was his home for as long as he’d been alive. He didn’t want to leave the planet to its fate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the aliens came the people of his abandoned world would live a short life of pain and fear. The Austin family must become rulers? But what sort of ruler didn’t protect their own people?</span></p>
 <p><span style>In an instant he felt like he’d grown up. A beautiful face appeared behind his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Qianlin… are you well?</span></i> <i><span style>It’s been so long since I’ve seen your face. Are you still with that man? I regret that I am so weak, or he wouldn’t have stolen you away from me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style> A formless pain filled his chest when he thought of her. It had been so long, and so much had happened. Now the pain was just a shadow of the stabbing obsession he’d felt before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Love’s ache didn’t hurt so badly when one’s life was in danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His thoughts were interrupted when a man in a captain’s uniform approached. “Mr. Austin, we have a problem. An unidentified military force has blocked our path.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Sylva was shocked by the news. He shot to his feet. “Do you know who they are?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldier hesitated. “We believe they’re from the East.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Eastern Alliance?” Sylva’s brows knit tight as he thought. After the fight against the aliens the Eastern army should have returned home to defend their own territory. Why would they be here all of a sudden?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me see.” He said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The captain brought Sylva to a screen. There he saw a host of warships spread out before them. They were arranged in a formation that prevented further passage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The captain went on. “Their call-signs and indications mark them as Eastern vessels. They’ve hailed us, requesting to speak with someone. Look here…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sylva scowled. “Open a connection.” It seemed strange to encounter Eastern soldiers out here without rhyme or reason. Perhaps they didn’t know the aliens where in the vicinity?</span></p>
 <p><span style>An officer appeared on the screen. “I am Senior Colonel Liu Feng. Please reply with your designation.” Liu Feng spoke curtly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The officer by Sylva’s shoulder answered. “We are a vessel under the auspices of the West. By what authority are you entering into Western space without authorization? And you dare to ask our designation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Feng was not cowed. “We’ve come to defend the West from alien invasion. Your vessel and status are unclear, it is protocol to hail all unknown vessels in proximity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Save them from the aliens? Even Sylva Austin couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Could this be true? The North was busy with their own affairs, but the East came instead?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sylva Austin blurted out. “How many reinforcements did you bring?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Senior Colonel replied. “Report your designation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a moment of hesitation, the Western politician answered. “This is the West’s Ninth Fleet. I am their commander, Chief Sylva.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Feng looked his over for a moment. “You’re an army Chief? Why aren’t you in uniform? As far as I know the West doesn’t </span><i><span style>have</span></i><span style> a ninth fleet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Newly authorized,” Sylva replied. “I request to speak with your commanding officer. Tell them President Sylva Austin wishes to speak with him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Feng went silent as he tried to confirm the information. His computer verified that this man was indeed the Western President, and patriarch of the Austin family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Feng was an intelligent man. The Present’s presence on these unmarked military vessels was telling. However, Sylva was an important person in the West and in the military.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please hold on while I get the Admiral.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before long the Senior Colonel’s face was replaced by another, a young-ish man with gallant features. His uniform was jet black, and four gold stars glinted on his shoulders. He regarded Sylva and his officer with a cold, hard expression. Richard Austin was immediately struck by his image, even on a screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This man’s aura was almost palpable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sylva Austin knew him the moment he saw him. He was a famous figure in the East – perhaps all across human space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The An Lun super soldier, a star of his military generation. He was a Paragon in service to the Eastern military, but was also known as Prometheus of the Divine Monarchs. Lan Qing!</span></p>
