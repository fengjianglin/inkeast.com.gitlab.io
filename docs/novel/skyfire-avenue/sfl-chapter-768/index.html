 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Kang Hui nodded. “How about this, I remain here. Your Majesty, you could bring the information back and disseminate it among my people. Once Commander Lan Jue returns and we finalize our plans, I’ll return.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Terminator nodded. “That’s fine. Then I’ll return to Tyrannosaurus. Admiral Lan, I may not be proficient in military matters, but I must say I admire your skill. You are worthy of the titles people have given you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Qing bowed his head. “You’re too kind, your Majesty. We won’t know how effective our plan is until the fight is over. It’s a little early to be praising my abilities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Li turned to Mo Xiao. “You return to the ship, I’m going to wait for Lan Jue to return as well. When we know everything I’ll go back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Xiao shook her head. “You should go back. I should stay, I’m more –“</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Li impatiently cut her off. “You’re trying to say you have more ability in this than I do? Don’t forget, I’ve been learning all of this since I was a child. You can go back to Poseidon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Xiao struggled with herself, eventually fighting back the urge to argue. She took up the pile of papers and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Qing watched her go. “Is she going to be a problem?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Hua Li shook his head. “It’s fine, that’s just how she is. The interests to the family are her only concern. Don’t be upset with her, brother.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Qing shook his head. “Of course not, she didn’t do anything wrong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How long before A-Jue and the others return?” Hua Li asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Qing leaned back in his chair. “A day or so. We’ve moved in pretty close to the outer ring planets already.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Li smiled. “We might walk away from this heroes to our whole species, eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“None of that is important,” Lan Qing chastised. “What’s important is that our people aren’t wiped out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The others left to rest and make their plans. Lan Qing took Hua Li to Middle Heaven’s command center.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A-Li, I sensed something between you and Mo Xiao. If it isn’t dealt with a problem could affect our plans. You should return to Poseidon and assume personal command.” Lan Qing mused openly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Li tried to assure him. “It’s a personal thing she has with me, and Mo Xiao is good about keeping her personal life separate from her duty. There won’t be a problem. Once A-Jue comes back and we hear what he’s learned I’ll go back. You should worry about yourself, I was amazed by how comprehensive your plan was but have you included yourself in all that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Eastern Admiral was dismissive. “This battle is important, and we have little in the way of luck on our side. We can’t know what will happen, so I can only prepare by doing everything I can.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This earned a sigh from his friend. “You have a tiring life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m used to it,” he answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother,” Hua Li began, “what do you plan to do if we survive this? Continue with the army? It seems like all your life you’ve never lived for yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me?” Lan Qing thought for a moment. “I’m not sure. Perhaps I’ll find a place to life out a quiet life. Years of being busy should be rewarded with silence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Li looked at him wonderment, like he couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “Wait, am I talking to the right person? You aren’t Lan Jue, are you? I’d expect something like that out of his mouth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Qing’s response was tepid. “He and I are brothers after all, fundamentally the same. We’ve just chosen different paths.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Li laughed. “I prefer this candid part of you – it makes you feel more like a real person and not some legendary soldier. You’re always so aloof, no one ever has a chance to get close to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Qing shot him a look. “I don’t need anyone to ‘get close to me.’ Everyone has different goals in life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Li paused for a moment, struck by his words. A frown touched his lips. “Yeah. Different goals.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Qing watched him for a second. “Why are you acting so strange again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fine,” Hua Li answered. “Again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Qing explained. “You’ve been very different since breaking through to Paragon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Li shook his head. “It’s nothing – I’m me, same Hua Li as always. Ever since the aliens have showed up I’ve had no interest in the rock star lifestyle. Like you I just want to live a quiet life – we should look together, what do you think? A mid-sized planet somewhere.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve always liked Skyfire Avenue, but I don’t need anything that fancy. We can find some ordinary street, set up a couple shops, start families. We can have A-Cheng come over, too, and all our shops can border each other’s. A-Jue’s got his own store, no need to push him for anything, so he could just open a small place and sell low-cost trinkets. A-Cheng can open a booze and cigar place, he likes that stuff. What sort of stuff would you sell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Qing was quiet for a time. “I don’t know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, what do you like?” Hua Li pressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Lan Qing shook his head. He couldn’t think of any hobbies or interests.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Helplessly Hua Li continued. “You’re so rigid. You should sell traditional business suits. You’re goods can be like you; stiff and austere.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Qing couldn’t stop himself from snorting a laugh. “So I’d be a tailor?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You would do incredible at whatever job you chose to do,” Hua Li said. “If you wanted to be a tailor you’d be the best damn tailor there was.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Qing turned it on him. “What about you, then? What sort of store would you open, a music shop?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Li looked like he’d been struck. “Ah, fine, I see. You think that’s all I’m good for. Nah, not music. I’d open a bridal shop. I’d make ‘em myself, you and I could work together. When you get married I’d make one special for you, whaddaya say?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Qing was understandably surprised. “I didn’t realize you had such a hobby.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Li spoke wistfully. “I’ve always loved wedding dresses, even when I was small. Elegant, pure white, lacy… All kinds. I’ve always believed they were the most beautiful clothing we’ve ever created. They may not outline the curves like your Eastern qipaos, but the bearing it brings is impeccable. I want to be a wedding dress stylist. What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Qing was supportive. “Why not, if the day ever came? But can your family go without Poseidon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Li shook his head. “I told A-Jue the same thing, Mo Xiao and I have already arranged for a genetically designed child. Soon the family will have their next successor, and that will me my responsibilities are finished. My father was about my age when he cast aside everything. The family runs on autopilot, practically. Once there’s a successor my work is done, and I can give up my role. Mo Xiao can handle the business end of things better than I can. I’ve always had an independent heart, I don’t want to be tied down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Qing frowned. “If you were one of my people I’d have you court martialed. You know how bad you are for morale?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Li chuckled. “You wouldn’t be Prometheus otherwise. Ah, but now you’re the Peerless Light emperor of Middle Heaven. Please, brother, enlighten me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Qing’s tone grew strangely threatening. “I’ll make sure to come and find you once this is all over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh… I’ve gotta piss. I’ll see you later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Qing’s face softened as he watched Hua Li race away. He gently shook his head, but his mind lingered on the picture his friend had painted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A small city, somewhere simple with a small shop on a quiet street. Would a tailor shop really suit him? He’d never even worn a suit. Skyfire Avenue had a tailor, perhaps he could give it a look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He shook his head again and looked at the screens arrayed throughout the control room. The gentleness was gone from them almost immediately, replaced with a pensive wisdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he wanted a peaceful life, there first had to be peace!</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center">ζ</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Seventeen hours later Zeus-1 quietly returned to Middle Heaven’s hangar bay. Lan Jue had recovered without incident, so his first order of business was to deliver the information they’d recovered. He went immediately to the control center to find his brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Qing said nothing, only took the data that was presented. He put it in his computer and waited for the it to show up. Lan Jue didn’t need to explain anything, Lan Qing’s dour face said he understood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Wine Master has already gone to find the Keeper with a copy of the data and the infected humans. He’s going to ask the Keeper to see what he can discover about their condition. From the little we could gather we suspect up to half of the population is still alive, and based on what I know of the aliens these humans are more ‘valuable’ to them. Living specimens have more complete DNA. All things considered the likelihood that the aliens have begun their evolution is high. Otherwise I suspect they’d have done to these planets what they did to the ones in the North. They’d simply have killed everyone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Jue continued. “I then traveled to the far side of the planet and discovered that artery stretching off into the distance. I can’t imagine where they would be going except for the alien home worlds. It offers even more evidence to support the idea that they’ve begun. Or that they’re already finished.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lan Qing scowled and scoured the information on screen. After a long time he finally spoke. “You’ve brought us both good news and bad news. The good news is we can confirm that the enemy’s preoccupied with their evolution. The bad news is conditions on the human planets.”</span></p>
