 <p><span style>This shout of mine echoed for a long time, actually. My face was burning the entire duration. I turned and snuck a glance at Chu Kong. He was also staring at me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah...sorry, I didn’t know that you two are in such a relationship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman’s voice was directed at us. A touch of blush quietly spread from Chu Kong’s neck all the way to his ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I swallowed, shook my head, and regained my sanity quickly enough to shoot her a ferocious glare. “What nonsense are you spouting?! He and I don’t have any type of relationship!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although...the bodies that Chu Kong and I were using did...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman continued to naïvely speak. “Then why are you </span><i><span style>eating vinegar</span></i><span style>?”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <ul>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><em>Eating vinegar: getting jealous</em></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ul>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>This....this was a really good question. My face burned. I massaged my temples and said, “Who was eating vinegar? I... I just wanted to remind you that you’re already married to Zihui. You shouldn’t have a second heart. A woman should not serve two husbands.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She punched herself in the head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, just now I forgot that I was married to Zihui.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason she was abandoned must’ve been because she was so stupid! I wouldn’t believe any other answer at that point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blame it on time...so much time has passed...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman craned her head upwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve waited for so long that my memory isn’t good anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her speech was really slow. I couldn’t bear to tell her that she had indeed waited for too long. So long that even the last strands of her soul’s power was beginning to fade away. If she continued to wait, then someday, she’d completely disappear from this world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why do you want to wait for Zihui here? Why don’t you go look for him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soul turned my way. If she hadn’t already waited in this place for a thousand years, then I thought she must’ve been waiting for at least a century. Either way, it seemed too long to be alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl shook her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t remember. But I remember I can’t leave here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked at me full of hope.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So can you help me bring him here? I’ll repay his debt. I’ll find another way to repay you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I turned and glanced at Chu Kong. Chu Kong shook his head stubbornly. “I don’t want to help. That stone demon isn’t a good thing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, you’re wrong,” the girl anxiously retorted after hearing Chu Kong. “Zihui is really good. He’s really good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, if your Zihui is so good, why did he leave you in this place? Your soul is so damaged; you must’ve stayed here for hundreds of years now. Why didn’t he miss you? Why didn’t he come personally to retrieve you? He is your husband, but he doesn’t care deeply about you at all and is still thinking of finding new love.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong paused. I felt that his words had a deeper meaning, so I turned to look at him. He gave me a cold stare, and then he continued: “Such a coldhearted stone demon. You tell me, what’s good about him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman was silent for a long time. Even though she was translucent, she still sat down on the stone chair like she could touch it. Then she covered her face and shivered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry, I was not good enough...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong still had things to say, but I couldn’t stand it anymore. I stretched my hand and covered his mouth. Then I said, “Lady, don’t cry. In this short-lived life, it’s impossible to clearly say who’s good and who’s bad. I’m different from this man who argues with you. I’ll help you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong pushed my hand away and gloomily said, “Do you want to be beaten?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I ignored him. I felt like he wouldn’t use his hands against me right now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girl heard my promise. She stayed at the table for a while. Then, she floated excitedly over to me, repeating her thanks all the way along. But before she could reach my side, she stopped three steps away and said, “Your...your body has a bad smell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was surprised, raised my hand, and sniffed. Chu Kong used this body to train together with the soldiers. It was tainted with men’s blood and sweat. But when we fell into the river, most of it had been washed away. At this point, there was really no smell on this body. I stared at the woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no smell, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is...” the girl said. “You have to be careful...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She seemed to have remembered something and was about to speak, but no sound came out of her mouth. Instead, she clutched her head and squatted on the ground. It seemed very painful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was scared seeing her like that and was about to go to her, but Chu Kong pulled me behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think you’re still an immortal? If a soul enters that body of yours, you could easily die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was silent, though I earnestly listened and remained behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That woman squatted for a while and then slowly stood up. With a weak voice, she said, “Excuse me...what was I about to say? I forgot again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I didn’t dare to let her remember anymore and said, “It’s alright if you can’t remember.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman looked at me apologetically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you for being willing to help me. I’m really sorry for frightening you before. Now I’ll send you out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her body floated to the right side of the stone room, but she didn’t stop at the wall. Instead, half of her went right through it. She turned and beckoned to us. “Come.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My mouth twitched. “Lady, we’re mortals. We don’t have the ability to walk through walls.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laughing, she said, “This is not a wall. Come and try it if you don’t believe me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong went first while I was still stupidly standing there. Then he turned around, looked at me, and raised an eyebrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you still want to stay here for a while? Seeing his things, thinking about that person?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inwardly, I really wondered why this guy was getting so angry...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong was impatient and grabbed my hand. He dragged me to the wall the woman disappeared into. Chu Kong also went through, pulling me along. We crossed it easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>We ended up in another cave. The woman was waiting for us by a cliff, and when she saw us arrive, she murmured, “Follow this cave and you will reach the exit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her figure flashed and then disappeared into thin air. Only her lingering voice could be heard: “If you see Zihui, you must tell him that a Luo is still waiting for him. I...just remember this. Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound drifted away. I turned and touched the wall that was blocking us just now. I put my hand through.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Surprised, I asked, “Illusion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A damaged soul that could create an illusion! This knowledge surprised me a lot. If this woman hadn’t been a god, then she must’ve been a demon who created great messes in the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong glanced at me and coldly sneered. “Casually agreeing to the request of strangers, really? In this world, nothing is as simple as you think.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I pouted. “What does it matter? Anyway, she didn’t do us any harm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She intended to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Chu Kong said his piece, he turned and walked away. My steps were small. He walked too fast. The pain in my belly gave another jolt. I tugged at his sleeves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I didn’t know when it started happening, but whenever I was alone with Chu Kong, I’d get more daring. My face would also be more thick-skinned than usual. Perhaps it was because that, in front of this man, I’d already been in the ugliest situations...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pouting, I asked him the question that the woman had asked me: “Chu Kong, why are you eating vinegar?”</span></p>
