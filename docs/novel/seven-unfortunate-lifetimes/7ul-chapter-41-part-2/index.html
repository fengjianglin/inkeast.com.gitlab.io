 <p><span style>“Are you waiting for that Celestial Star to come out?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blond man laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If that’s so, you don’t need to wait anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I wanted to say something, but when I opened my mouth, I could only vomit blood. The only thing I could do was watch the blond man as he smiled wickedly. He licked his lips and cruelly said, “Because he’s already been eaten by me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong was eaten?</span></p>
 <p><span style>That defiant and arrogant guy was actually…eaten?</span></p>
 <p><span style>I couldn’t believe my ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But his soul ran away too fast. I didn’t manage to catch it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My eyes lit up. If his soul wasn’t destroyed, Chu Kong would be able to go down the Netherworld. It would then just be another reincarnation circle. He was alright.</span></p>
 <p><span style>My heart eased up. Then I heard the man say, “But even if he went to the Netherworld, you won’t be able to see him again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I clutched my chest. The cold feeling didn’t go away. A hand suddenly grabbed my neck and lifted me up. I could feel his sharp nails piercing into my neck. Warm blood flowed out. I wanted to struggle, but the enemy’s strength was too great. The evil energy settled on me like heavy shackles, imprisoning all my actions. Gradually, my ears began to buzz. Only the man’s voice wrapped around my heart. “Because you’ll never be able to reincarnate again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From my neck came a “ka” sound. There was unbearable pain. To think, I’d actually be crushed to death like this….</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fuck, on this sunny day I actually met a pervert,” I cursed loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>My soul fled that wound-ridden body. I turned and ran to the road of the Netherworld. I vaguely saw that there was someone waiting for me, but I didn’t get to see that person clearly. A great strength reached out and captured me. I turned around in horror and saw that the blond man was smiling at me with squinted eyes. His fingertips hooked gently on my soul. He said to himself, “Let the perverted me see where the Cloud Fairy went. Oh, above my head, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I struggled with all my strength, but he was squeezing me like squeezing a worm. His fingertips barely touched my head when I suddenly felt my forehead turn hot. I panicked and shouted, “This little fairy’s power really isn’t much. I wasn’t sincere while cultivating. My head is full of filthy thoughts. I’m really not tasty, ah! You should let me go! Sound good?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not good,” the man said while smiling. “Well, you’re a Cloud Fairy. They’re really rare, you know. Really rare.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he wanted to talk about rare, I was transported through dog poop before Yue Lao transformed me from a cloud to a fairy! How about that?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t give me time to shout again. My forehead cooled as he dragged my soul out. He narrowed his eyes and looked at my soul for a while. It felt like he was studying a piece of food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, this Cloud Fairy is quite damaged. Besides, she’s still an immature little thing. You must have been transformed into a fairy by another immortal. Hey…does your soul still possess my evil energy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he said that, I was shocked. My soul had his evil energy?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be…in the lifetime that I was a tiger…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t wait for me to think about it. The blond hair man shook his head and let out a helpless sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The root of immortality is not correct. The soul is damaged. Defective product. Cheche, tasteless, tasteless, really tasteless. It’s a real pity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was…was he dissatisfied with me?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man played with my soul in his hand. He seemed in deep thought about whether he should or shouldn’t eat me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly a white shadow flashed. My soul disappeared from the man’s hand and I could feel my soul loosen. The finger that the man had used to grab me had been destroyed. I felt something tightly grip my arm. Chu Kong’s voice sounded in my ear. “Run!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I didn’t say anything and concentrated on running to the road of the Netherworld. Behind me came the sounds of blows. After passing through the boundary between the Netherworld and the human realm, I turned and looked back. Chu Kong, with the body of a soul, pushed the man about two feet backwards. Then he ran and stood beside me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that I was still startled, he kicked my ass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can’t do anything well, can you? Rather, you do everything wrong!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I rolled into the Netherworld instead of walking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I looked back for the last time. The blond-haired man didn’t seem to intend to go after us. He was looking thoughtfully at Chu Kong’s back instead. I saw him smile mysteriously.</span></p>
