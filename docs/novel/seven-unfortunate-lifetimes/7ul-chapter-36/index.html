 <p><span style>Darkness. I felt Chu Kong’s face above mine. His lips were tightly pressed against my forehead. I took deep breaths against his neck. His hands were on my back. His chest was pressed against my chest, making me feel a strange pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re openly…taking advantage of me, ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I pushed his chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Motherfucker, breath, breathless!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why the fuck are you hurrying!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong was also angry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think I want to be pressed against you?! Just let me lean here for a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>(</span><i><span style>Oh, it was involuntary? But what about your lips on her forehead, Chu Kong?</span></i><span style>)</span></p>
 <p><span style>I continued to breathe. The temperature of our bodies melted the snow. The water dripped onto my clothes. I shivered from cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just then, Chu Kong pressed me more tightly against him. Then, I heard a burst. Finally we escaped the small space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>We emerged from the ground…or better said, emerged from the snow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Standing on the white snow, Chu Kong and I kept gasping for air. I had several layers of clothing soaked in water. Then, a cold wind brushed past, and I instantly froze me like a popsicle. This situation was as bad as it could get. As for why our situation is so bad…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong fisted his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If this is Heaven’s Will, it must be big-bearded Li’s revenge!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I deeply accepted Chu Kong’s view.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because nothing went according to how he had written it, that Heaven’s dog blood Li must be angry. And now that he wasn’t going to have the chance to write our lives out anymore, he tampered with how we’d come to this world after our reincarnation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This despicable and petty Heavenly Emperor Li let us be caught in an avalanche right after reincarnating that was supposed to bury us alive in it! This was clearly taking revenge while he still could! Shameless! Really shameless!</span></p>
 <p><span style>While I was trembling, I said: “Let’s…let’s go get some thick clothes… We haven’t even found the stones yet. At this rate, we’ll be back to see Yanwang before soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong got it together. He narrowed his eyes while looking at me. “You don’t know how to use the immortal’s power against cold?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was startled. I racked through my brain. After being a mortal for so many years, I actually had forgotten that I had the power of an immortal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I murmured a spell to disperse all the cold from my body. Then I turned to Chu Kong and said, “Although you reminded me about my immortal power, you still took advantage of the opportunity to rub against me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I sighed while shaking my head. “You deserve to be single.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was obviously a means of flirting with women. Chu Kong was obviously not as good as me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong stared at me for a while and then expressionlessly said, “What do you have for me to take advantage of?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My mouth twitched. I felt that this guy must really not be interested in me. His mouth looked like it had been wiped in dirt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I narrowed my eyes and dissatisfied, said, “You deserve to be single!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying that, I turned and walked away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After taking a few steps, I didn’t hear Chu Kong’s footsteps in the snow. My heart felt it was strange. I turned to look at him. I saw him standing absentminded. A hand was touching his lips, another hand was clutching his chest. His vision was from the snow pit, where we escaped from. His cheeks were inexplicable red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That, that saying one thing, meaning another thing...what did he mean, nothing to take advantage of’… He obviously took advantage of me!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong stood there for a long time. He frowned as he thought for a moment. Then he suddenly said, “Do you feel that the snow on this mountain is strange?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I looked at him seriously. “No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Frustrated, Chu Kong said, “Forget it, I was being stupid. I actually asked you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>We were silent again. I looked around. The strange thing that I found was that the snow was mixed with some wood. I thought for a while. Suddenly, I crashed into Chu Kong’s back. Chu Kong ignored me and solemnly said, “The wrong thing with this snow mountain is that someone put a spell here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was confused. “But I didn’t see a spell, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course you wouldn’t see it,” Chu Kong said with dissatisfaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You see the snow on the roadside? It’s neat, like someone just cleaned it. You don’t need to walk far and there’ll be a stone on the roadside. If you look carefully, the distance between the stones is always the same.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I followed Chu Kong speech and looked at the environment. My heart was startled. My face paled. “These things have always been there when we walked down the mountain. Someone actually used one spell on the whole mountain? What does he want to do? Why put a spell on this mountain?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it’s only this mountain then it’d be fine…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong paused. We tried to figure this out. Suddenly one of the stones on the roadside flashed a bright red light. The flashes spelled something that I didn’t understand. Chu Kong’s eyes turned serious. “It’s a bloodthirsty spell. It’ll suck all the blood of the living creatures inside the spell!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately, I pulled Chu Kong’s sleeve and hid behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Living creatures, including us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I carefully thought for a moment. “I really don’t know if it includes us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong went silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I stuck tightly against his back. Chu Kong waved. A crimson whip appeared in his hand. He looked back at me. “Are you incapable? Are you just good for nothing? You’ve already been restored your immortal body and you’re still afraid of this kind of spell? Just find the opening and break it. It’s as simple as that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Chu Kong’s words, I was startled. If I’d fallen into this spell alone, I wouldn’t necessarily behave like this. But seeing Chu Kong’s straight back standing there, I didn’t worry and just automatically hid behind him. This seemed to have become a behavior I couldn’t stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, I wouldn’t tell Chu Kong such a thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think I want to hide behind you? If you hadn’t broken my round fan that time, leaving me with nothing to protect my body, would I still stand behind you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong was silent for a while and then harrumphed coldly. “It’s just a broken fan. You, a poor ghost, actually remembered it for so long. When we go back, I’ll compensate you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My eyes lit up. I grabbed Chu Kong’s hand. “This is something you said, ah! We agreed! I want the Weaver Girl’s fan. The best one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong pouted, dissatisfied. “Really no knowledge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you have the knowledge, you go find a better one, ah. I’ll never refuse…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My words hardly left my mouth when Chu Kong grabbed my shoulder, pulled me to the side, and jumped into the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I hadn’t understood the situation yet when a strange sound came from below. I looked down and saw there were several tentacles at the place where we were just standing, all in a flurry and moving. Everything they seized would be torn to pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I asked, “What are these?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The spell has started.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong turned serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look for the spell’s opening.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I looked around and noticed that, at the peak of the mountain, a flash passed. I poked Chu Kong’s hand. “There, there, Chu Kong. Above!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You wait here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong didn’t say anything more and let go of my hand. He swiftly went to the spell’s opening. I stood there and waved at his back. “Do your best, ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only when he was at the peak of the mountain that I came to realize how I just naturally wished him the best, and he didn’t feel anything wrong with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The earth shook. Something made a dull sound. It was the movement of the spell’s opening. I looked up at the peak of the mountain where Chu Kong was. We were separated, too far away. I couldn’t see his expression, but I could just imagine how beautiful the light in his eyes would be.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong did have some skills, and his skills were out of my range. He clearly didn’t seem like someone who’d work under another immortal. Now that I was thinking about it...whether it was Yanwang or Great Golden Star Taibai, they all called him “Celestial Star Chu Kong”. And this title “Celestial Star” was above his position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong was not as simple as he looked…</span></p>
 <p><span style>The earth shook again. It didn’t come from the direction of the spell’s opening. Not far from me, an animal suddenly drilled out from beneath the snow. His whole body was covered in white fur. Even the fur on his forehead was white and covered his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who broke my bloodthirsty spell?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His roar had a deep voice. I raised an eyebrow. Using one spell on a whole mountain, and it’s from a demon, too. This matter was really not simple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I glanced in the direction where Chu Kong was. This was a critical time to break the spell. It couldn’t be interrupted. The demon on the ground shook his head. He rushed to the peak. My body moved on its own and fell right in front of the demon. My hands twisted and a big net appeared. I waved, and it fell straight on the head of the demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Although I’m not powerful, you can’t afford to not look at me, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I walked to the demon covered in the net and whispered, “My man is at work, how can I let him have worries?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, I was such a gentle and considerate person, ah!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demon’s throat made a “gululu” sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The earth shook again. The sky above seemed to be breaking apart. The demon lying on the ground suddenly began to struggle as if he needed to fight even if he died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While he was struggling, a hole formed in the net. One hole, two holes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I didn’t expect that this demon would have such abilities. My heart was startled. I searched my whole body to see if I could find something to protect myself, but I quickly realized that I had nothing…</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was a poor immortal. There was nothing of worth on my body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You stay away from her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong’s voice could be heard above our heads.</span></p>
 <p><span style>My body stiffened. A red light flashed at the corner of my eyes. The demon’s eyes were covered in a glowing red light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, I heard a terrible roar. The net was completely shattered. He turned to me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was soaked in sweat. “In fact, it’s alright if you don’t look at me. It doesn’t matter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He shouted, “Whoever’s breaking the spell needs to die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His claws came in my direction. I rolled on the ground and escaped this attack, but couldn’t recover in time as the second claw came after me. The speed was so fast, I couldn’t react in time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of the spell breaking accelerated. Presumably, Chu Kong increased his speed to destroy the spell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I came to a decision. I needed to stall for time till Chu Kong could get over here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demon seemed angry. His claws came at me. I was furious. “The one who’s destroying the spell is obviously there. Why are you hitting me?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My words had hardly left my mouth when he got free from the net entirely. The demon’s claw came at my head…</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a split second, a hand grabbed my waist. I was surprised. When I came to, the demon was miles away from me. I looked up and saw that Chu Kong was still fighting to break the spell. I turned and looked, catching a glimpse of a purple robe drifting in the wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A Xiang lady?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His voice had a hint of surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I looked at this person’s face for a long time and finally said, “Ah, you are that sinister stone demon, Zihui?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Having not seen you for so many years, a Xiang lady is still so straightforward.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He smiled, mouth curving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But it’s really an honor that lady still remembers me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I looked at him for a moment, and then looked at Chu Kong. Suddenly, I had an impulse of mischief to roar to Chu Kong: “Your rival has come!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I really wanted to know what expression he’d make when he heard that…</span></p>
