 <p><span style>Chu Kong halted. His body stiffened and he was silent for a long time. Suddenly he turned and looked ferociously at me: “Which one of your eyes saw me eating vinegar?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Both of them were eyewitnesses.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong walked away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re thinking too much. Xiaoye doesn’t have the free time to eat vinegar.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I quickened my steps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re eating it now,” I said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gritted his teeth. “I didn’t.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I shook my head and sighed. “You’ve already done so many things that show you like me, most right in front of my face. So why do you still refuse to be honest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong stopped. I couldn’t stop in time and bumped into his back. Suddenly, Chu Kong grabbed me and spun me around. My back ached; Chu Kong was pressing me against the stone wall. The smell of man on his body stained all my feelings. Obviously...not long ago, it was my own smell, but now that it belonged to someone else, now that it belonged to Chu Kong, my heart couldn’t control itself and ran rampant inside my chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong seemed set on this. It was a complete reversal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With one hand, he pinned both my wrists above my head to the wall. With another hand, he raised my chin to force me to look at him. Such a scene was filled with ambiguous feelings and full of challenges.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I could feel his breath against my face. “So, Xiao Xiang Zi.” His voice, hoarse, was full of temptation as he said, “Why do you refuse to be a little more honest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He stared at me. The distance was so close, I could see into his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I blinked and looked at the top of his head. “I have been very honest, ah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, then say, what’s your heart thinking about now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He blew against my ear, warming it and giving me an unbearable itch. I moved my hands to try and scratch it, but Chu Kong only held me tighter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be good and speak honestly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was silent for a moment and then honestly said, “My period is leaking too much. The pocket can’t hold it anymore. We should get out of this place very fast and find a place to change it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The strength pinning my arms in place loosened. Chu Kong’s stunned expression was burning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I took the opportunity to free my hands and immediately used them to clutch my stomach. Then, walking forward without any expression, I declared, “Let’s go out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I didn’t know how Chu Kong’s face looked behind me. I only heard him slap a hand to it and bitterly sigh. He said, “You’re too honest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if I was really thick-skinned around him, I still couldn’t help the reddening of my face. Chu Kong’s breath and a man’s warmth were still lingering at my ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While I was fighting with this big storm, in my heart, I was howling: “Where the hell did you learn these tricks! Could you not be so successful at seducing people?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>We followed the female soul’s instructions. Not long after, we finally saw the sunlight. Though our stay in the cave was short, I was still happy to see the sun again after such an extended period of darkness. Joyful, I ran right out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>There was the sound of flowing water nearby. Now outside, I squinted, the sunlight a comfort but equally a problem for my night-adapted vision. Before us was a pebble shoal. A few more steps forward and I could hear the cheerful rushing of the river again. I looked up and across; on the other side of the river was a cliff. That was where Chu Kong and I had fallen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I looked back at the cave and said emotionally, “This place is actually not where Zihui used to live. Why were the things inside placed the same as at Zihui’s?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you still have to ask?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While walking, Chu Kong regained his usual composure. He glanced at me, once again dissatisfied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A dead woman’s most memorable memory is the moments she lived in happiness. That place must be an illusion created by her memories. The wall is false; the other things are then also false.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I nodded and, filled with a rush of compassion, said, “It was her. The one who was seeing things and thinking about another person...was her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong touched his chin and thought for a while. “Just now, did she say she was called a Luo?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“En, it should be her. Is something wrong with this name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong looked wistfully back at the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just thought about something that happened a long time ago in Heaven.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong glanced at me again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It happened before someone turned into an immortal. Even if I explained, you wouldn’t recall.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the words “turned into an immortal,” I narrowed my eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I looked at Chu Kong, also dissatisfied. Before I could speak, he said, “Say, did you see who that female soul resembled? Well...you can also say who looked like that female soul?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I looked at Chu Kong and said, “Who? You?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, what a joke.” Chu Kong laughed coldly. “In xiaoye’s memories, the only one who can match that stupidity is the you from the previous lifetime, the downright stupid silly Xiang. Don’t you feel that silly Xiang looked very much like that female soul?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was startled and at first didn’t refute Chu Kong. I honestly tried to find the memory of silly Xiang and compared it to a Luo. They were quite alike in some ways, weren’t they? I carefully pondered. A Luo said that Zihui is her husband. When they were alive, they must’ve been in love before they turned into husband and wife. Zihui must also have liked this a Luo. Seeing that a Luo has already died for a long time, she and Zihui must’ve been in love before silly Xiang was born. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Well...having concluded that...the reason Zihui wanted to marry me in the second lifetime was maybe because I looked like his “ex”...</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was still pondering when Chu Kong laughed heartily. “Ha, knowing that someone liked you not because you had the charms, but because you resembled someone else’s charms, I suddenly feel at ease, haha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you not laugh so vulgarly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This laugh of mine is called fun.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong and I had just started arguing when suddenly, a hoarse cry came from the distance: “General!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I looked up and saw Chu Yi leading dozens of soldiers running towards us.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is general alright?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I opened my mouth and subconsciously wanted to answer. Chu Kong was a step faster than me. “All is fine. Where’s the army?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“General, don’t worry. The army is at the front. The wounded are receiving treatments.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good,” Chu Kong nodded. “Follow ben jiang back to the camp. When I’ve ordered the army, we’ll enter Jinyang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I heard Chu Kong chuckling beside me. “Xiaoye will let Wei Country regret they came into this world.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hey...Chu Kong, are you serious?</span></p>
