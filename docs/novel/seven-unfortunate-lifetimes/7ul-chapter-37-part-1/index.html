 <p><span style>A roar sounded in the air. I looked up and saw gold lights, falling down like snowflakes. The bloodthirsty spell had been broken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I saw Chu Kon’s figure standing atop the snowy mountain, his long hair fluttering in the wind with his his robes. I couldn’t see his face, but it was unneeded. His silhouette alone was enough to leave me thunderstruck. I could feel how hard my heart was thumping inside my chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That thing…why was he posing in such a beautiful manner…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Chu Kong moved and turned in my direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zihui, who was beside me, smiled, waved at him, and shouted, “Shifu, long time no see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I couldn’t see Chu Kong’s expression, but the ground beneath my feet trembled. Zihui quietly put away the hand that was still on my waist and, with a face full of smiles, said, “Oops, I didn’t realize that Shifu is a god now. Looks like I can’t afford to mess with him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I narrowed my eyes and looked at Zihui. So this was how it was; everyone was an animal that bullied the weak but was afraid of the strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoever’s destroying the spell needs to die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demon hadn’t left yet. He stood there shouting up at the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I pointed at the long haired demon and asked Zihui, “What does that mean? The spell has already been broken. Does he think that if he shouts loud enough, we’ll be so scared that we’d lose all our nerves and drop dead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zihui smiled with squinted eyes. “A Xiang lady is still just as funny and lovely as I remember.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So noisy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong’s shout came from far away. His body shifted, and the next time it appeared again was above the head of the long haired demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The long haired demon immediately jumped to get to Chu Kong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong only stood still. He didn’t hide or try to dodge. An immortal seal appeared in his hand, and he put this above the long haired demon. It stiffened and immediately stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zihui nodded in approval. “En, Shifu really has some tactical skills.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was excited and ran to Chu Kong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well done, Chu Kong! Let’s just kill and eat him! I’ll dismember him. You go make fire to barbecue him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A Xiang…lady…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I left Zihui’s voice far behind and ran to the long haired demon, stroking his smooth fur.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This fur will be able to get a high price. I’ll ponder about where to knife him, but it can’t be here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The light in my eyes was really quite brilliant. Chu Kong suddenly came over and grabbed my hand, pulling it away from the fur.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was the one who caught him. You’re not allowed to eat him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was very angry. Chu Kong took one glance at me before looking at Zihui, who had just arrived. Then, he spat, “Don’t you have someone who’s willing to help you? You can let him catch one for you. This is what I’ve caught. I won’t let you eat it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zihui coughed twice. It seemed that he was quite embarrassed to have been caught in this quarrel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong glared at Zihui. At this point, I couldn’t be bothered with him and only glared at Chu Kong. I freely expressed my dissatisfaction about such childlike behavior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Between us, is there still a “you” and “me”? I scalp his fur, and the money that I get for it will be spent by us. I cut his meat and roast it; won’t that be eaten by us? Do you think it’s a fun joke to act up like this?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong thought for a while and then he half turned to look at me. “Us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was dazed and surprised. “Who else would it be?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that answer, Chu Kong finally fully turned and looked at me. His mouth curved up, but he quickly suppressed it and, with a straight face, said, “Humph, alright, I’ll reluctantly let you cut it. Xiaoye wants the meat of the spine. You must not cut that part badly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This guy…</span></p>
 <p><span style>I didn’t even bother to scold someone who got angry every three days. Instead, I turned my attention to the long haired demon and circled around his body. I felt that I should cut him from his belly. I told Chu Kong, “Turn him over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong was about to do it, when Zihui suddenly said, “I think…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no part for you,” Chu Kong interrupted him and looked at him coldly. “Xiaoye is generous. I won’t bother with the past debt. Now, you must go and hide someplace far away. Don’t let xiaoye see you again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zihui sighed. “What I want to say is that this is a demon. You eating it, isn’t that a bit…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I gave him a strange look. “Otherwise, what do we do with it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong also looked at Zihui strangely. “Otherwise, what do we do with it? This is a demon, not an animal. He guards this bloodthirsty spell; who knows how many people’s lives he has harmed. Eating it won’t be a loss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong said it like it was the right thing to do. Staying in my company for so long had clearly done him some good; his level had greatly improved!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong pulled up his sleeves. With a little strength, he turned the long haired demon over, letting the legs face the sky. I jumped on the long haired demon’s belly. Then, I stuck my hand out and said, “Knife.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong stretched his hand out at Zihui and said, “Knife.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zihui sighed. “I meant, eating something you don’t know isn’t a good habit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Still, while he spoke, he took out a dagger from his sleeve. He wanted to hand it to Chu Kong, but retracted his hand at the last second. Then, he said, “If you use my dagger, it should add at least a few safety measures to your cooking process…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong’s expression turned cold. I hurriedly went in front of Zihui and said, “En,en, good. Later, I’ll cut the front legs for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zihui willingly handed the dagger over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first cut would be in the middle of the demon’s collarbone. I raised my hand and was about to stab when the demon managed to say, “Broke…the bloodthirsty spell, the lord…will not…let you off.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I turned and exchanged a look with Chu Kong. Then I poked the demon’s neck with the tip of the dagger. “Come on, tell me honestly. Who is your lord? Where does he live?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demon no longer said anything. I exchanged a look again with Chu Kong. Chu Kong stroked his chin and said, “If he’s acting like this, someone must’ve put him under a spell. We won’t get anything from him. Just kill and eat it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait,” Zihui shouted. “You…really want to eat it? I thought you were just simply threatening it…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I glanced at Zihui. “Do I look like I’m pretending?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I blinked once and brought the dagger down with a “shua” sound. Blood spattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a small spell, a flame began to spin and casted the shadows of three people onto the snow. The demon’s meat was fresh and plump. Chu Kong and I lied on the snow with round stomachs. Only Zihui, holding the legs that I promised him, didn’t move. Zihui sighed. “You really ate it…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dissatisfied, Chu Kong said, “Do you have any comments?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He paused and seemed to grow angrier. “You’ve been standing there for so long... What do you mean by that? Who told you to come? Who let you stay here? Go away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A snowball directly hit my forehead. I was stunned and glared at Chu Kong. His glance toward me was cold, and he humphed before he said, “I think the you of now is no different from that silly Xiang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I also humphed coldly. “The you of now is just the same as that lifetime! Proud, arrogant, and likes to bully people!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong turned and glared at me. He frowned tightly. I didn’t want to be outdone by him and also glared at him. As we were confronting each other, Zihui suddenly laughed and said, “As long as you two are acting like this…other people can easily come between you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong didn’t say anything, grabbed some snow, and threw it at Zihui. Zihui calmly dodged it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Most women like mature and calm men. Shifu acting like this isn’t good. A Xiang lady, isn’t it right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faced with this question, I went silent for a while. Then, I straightforwardly said, “It’s true that I used to think like this in the past.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I looked at Chu Kong’s angry face, then I turned and looked at the sky. “But now, I think that everyone has their own personality. Someone’s personality is also not bad.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My cheeks felt warm. I paused and then continued. “And it’s quite unique.”</span></p>
