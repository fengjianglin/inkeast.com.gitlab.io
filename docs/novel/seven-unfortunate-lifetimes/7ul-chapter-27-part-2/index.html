 <p>I woke up at the first sign of daylight. I rolled out of the bed, pushed the door open, and startled at the sight in front of me.</p>
 <p>“Why are you kneeling again?”</p>
 <p>Chu Yi was kneeling in front of the door. After hearing me, he knocked his head against the floor and said, “General, please punish me. Those people escaped.”</p>
 <p>I squeezed the bridge of my nose. What ferocious temper did the former general have to scare everyone so? Why did his people like to kneel so much? I waved my hand and said, “Forget it. Let them escape.”</p>
 <p>In a blink of an eye, I was already walking in the direction of Chu Kong’s room. Chu Yi didn’t stand up yet and knocked his head against the floor once more.</p>
 <p>“General, about Lady Xinyun…you spent so long setting up this trap, and now you’re letting her get away?”</p>
 <p>I stopped in my tracks. My eyes fell on Chu Yi. The former general really had been suspicious of Lady Xinyun! It appeared that Chu Yi knew well what kind of trap the general had set. I narrowed my eyes and said, “Things have already gone this way. Now, all we can do is take a step back and calculate our next move.”</p>
 <p>Chu Yi’s head was still glued to the ground. Full of remorse, he said, “Blame this servant’s incompetence for letting Xinyun and those spies of Wei Country escape together!”</p>
 <p>I nodded as if I was completely unsurprised. So it turned out that Lady Xinyun was a spy from Wei Country. The former general must’ve seen through Xinyun’s identity. So, he went along with their plan and kept her by his side in order to get information about Wei Country. He really was a clever general. I said, “No harm done. Even when a soldier blocks the path, water can still pass. You get up first.”</p>
 <p>Chu Yi finally stood up. He glanced at me and said, full of worry: “General, for every day that passes, the situation at the border gets worse. I’m afraid that there’ll be war again. And since the last injury, your body...”</p>
 <p>His worried words went into my ear and most went out the other. But the four words that stayed in my heart were: “there’ll be war again.” I suddenly felt that the discussion I had about Chu Kong about the temple and the jianghu was wrong. Those two places weren’t that dangerous. No, the place where the most people die was on the battlefield, ah! Among the powerful army, even your dead body wouldn’t be found and brought back.</p>
 <p>I rubbed my temples and pretended to be calm.</p>
 <p>“En, I have my own plan.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, I didn’t look at him anymore and went straight to Chu Kong. This was something that we needed to talk about.</p>
 <p>The moment I walked into Chu Kong’s room, he was drinking medicine. The maid was feeding him with a beautiful little spoon. I saw him frown while drinking from it. It must’ve been painful for him to have to drink medicine that way.</p>
 <p>I walked towards the maid and took the bowl of medicine.</p>
 <p>“I’ll do it. You can retreat.”</p>
 <p>The maids looked at each other and didn’t go away until Chu Kong opened his mouth and ordered them to retreat. They walked out and shut the door.</p>
 <p>I unceremoniously sat down on his bed and handed the bowl to Chu Kong to let him drink it himself. Chu Kong gave me a look, dissatisfied.</p>
 <p>“You said you’d feed me, ah.”</p>
 <p>My heart was anxious. After hearing those words I didn’t bother to fight with him. I rose, lifted his chin and pinched his mouth. The bowl of medicine went in with “gudong gudong” sounds.</p>
 <p>It felt like that day when he forced me to drink the soup of oblivion.</p>
 <p>I put the bowl aside and said with a serious tone: “Big bad news.”</p>
 <p>A fist landed on my face.</p>
 <p>“You go die!”</p>
 <p>This fist of his felt like tickling, but it made him cough himself half to death. I grabbed his hand, patted his back, and continued speaking with a serious tone. “Chu Kong, I feel that now is the time to elope.”</p>
 <p>Chu Kong stopped coughing. He narrowed his eyes at me and said, not bothering to hide his contempt: “What did you do now?”</p>
 <p>“Do you know that Xinyun is a spy from Wei Country?”</p>
 <p>“En, I know.”</p>
 <p>“Qi Country and Wei Country may start a war again. I might be the one who’ll have to go to the battlefield!”</p>
 <p>“I already guessed that.”</p>
 <p>I gnashed my teeth together. “Why do you know everything already? And why haven’t you said anything to me?! You sinister man, you must want to see me die on the battlefield and then remarry someone else!”</p>
 <p>“I found out all this information when I was at Xinyun’s house. Xiaoye just didn’t find the opportunity to tell you,” Chu Kong said. “If my stomach didn’t suddenly hurt, those four guys would have been caught.”</p>
 <p>Bemused, I wondered, “Didn’t you lose all your powers?”</p>
 <p>Chu Kong laughed. “Some things are engraved deep in the soul. Forget it; even if I told you, you wouldn’t understand. Just know that it was this body that was in xiaoye’s way. If we swapped, see how I would’ve played with those tiny mortals!”</p>
 <p>I sighed: “The fact is that we don’t have a way to change, ah. So, let’s just run away. If you still want to stay and play, then I’ll run away first.”</p>
 <p>The words had just left my mouth when someone suddenly knocked on the door. A maid’s voice could be heard from outside: “General, the emperor has sent a decree. The general must go to the palace immediately.”</p>
 <p>Chu Kong looked at me and said, “Well, it looks like you can’t run away anymore.”</p>
 <p>I hugged my arms to my chest and silently cried, tears dripping down my cheeks.</p>
