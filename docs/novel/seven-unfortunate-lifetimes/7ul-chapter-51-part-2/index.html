 <p><a href="https://rosyfantasy.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/201402261522580.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class=" wp-image-1099 aligncenter" src="https://rosyfantasy.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/201402261522580.jpg?w=300" alt="201402261522580" width="359" height="269"></a></p>
 <p>Sure enough, it was the same as I had guessed. I tried heart to suppress the complex emotions in my heart. I rationally analysed.</p>
 <p>Three years ago, Jin Lian’s scattered immortal soul entered his body and began to tell him what had happened in the past and trying hard to lure him in the evil ways. Chu Kong didn’t listen to him, but the evil energy would certainly had an impact on Chu Kong.</p>
 <p>For three years, Chu Kong came back once in the month on the fifteenth. The fifteenth of each month was the time where it was the cleanest on earth. He came back to see me then, must be because he was fully able to neutralize the evil energy. After that he didn’t return for a few months. Probably his strength wasn’t enough to suppress the evil energy in his body.</p>
 <p>On New Year’s Eve he came back. After I told him all the things that happened in the past, he looked for a reason, found and excuse, said some hateful words to anger me and made me faint. He looked at me helplessly and told me again and again to not go look for him.</p>
 <p>When I thought about it with a calm mind, all these acts were actually him saying goodbye to me.</p>
 <p>He took Jin Lian to the place where former Chu Kong died together with Jin Lian. He wanted to put everything back to square one. He wanted me to take it as if in this lifetime I had never found him.</p>
 <p>I thought that meatball Kong was already no different from an ordinary human, but now I knew that he was still really stupid. He wanted to die with Jin Lian again and he was afraid that when he died, he wouldn’t know how to comfort me. So, he took preventive measures. Using such a clumsy way to let me be disappointed in him, to let me lose all hope in him. When he left, then I would not be sad.</p>
 <p>Really……</p>
 <p>So extremely stupid!</p>
 <p>He really thought that I was so stupid. He really thought that I couldn’t see his strange behaviour. Did he really think that if he did these things, he could protect me?</p>
 <p>I gritted my teeth. At this time, I really want to grab his collar and roar: “What sort of thing did you become in this life?! See, into what you turned your fine life to?!"</p>
 <p>But the things were now as they are. I should let them go. It could be considered that I won the bet between me and meatball Kong. As for the second bet……</p>
 <p>Meatball Kong, didn’t you want to protect me? Weren’t you really afraid of me leaving you?</p>
 <p>Well, I would stubbornly not let you be able to protect me. I had stubbornly died in front of you at least once to make you realize that what you did was wrong. It was useless!</p>
 <p>If you’re afraid of being left by me, practice cultivation with effort! Use all your effort to find your last mortal soul. Become an immortal with your own ability. Become celestial star Chu Kong. Become like a man and come search for me upright and frank in heaven.</p>
 <p>I bet that meatball Kong has that courage and ability.</p>
 <p>The Chu Kong in the mirror of the past was still choking with his head lowered. Perhaps for him, I’ve completely left. He needed time to walk out of the shadows. And I believed that Chu Kong’s heart had always been strong. Only that kind of Chu Kong was worthy of being liked by me.</p>
 <p>The deer horse demon beside him, used his horn to pat Chu Kong two times. It seemed like he wanted to comfort Chu Kong.</p>
 <p>I closed the mirror of the past and thought: After Chu Kong comes back; we’ll bring the deer horse demon to heaven. We’ll ride him together. After that, we’ll go let the promises that Chu Kong promised me come true.</p>
 <p>For five days, I didn’t touch the mirror of the past. Like in the past, I watched Yue Lao’s temple with sleep. The gamble in heaven about if I and Chu Kong could be together was getting more fire of speculation. Seeing that Chu Kong was now a mortal and seeing that I’m sleeping with an expression of not wanting to live anymore every day at Yue Lao temple, the immortals rushed to change their bet. They were resigned that we wouldn’t ever be together.</p>
 <p>Yue Lao quietly took out five golden teals out of his small coffer and put them together with his other five golden teals. A total of ten golden teals. All put on the side of “will be together”.</p>
 <p>The immortals thought that Yue Lao did it only to comfort me. And I know that Yue Lao, this sort of stingy immortal, wouldn’t comfort me with his money. He eventually believed me……</p>
 <p>Or, it was because every day while I wasn’t paying attention, he would quietly go into my room and look in the mirror of the past and believed in Chu Kong.</p>
 <p>Five days in heaven is five years in the human realm. Meatball Kong is twenty-three years old this year.</p>
 <p>Today, I still didn’t intend to go look into the mirror of the past. I knew my temperament. The more I look, the more anxious I would get. The more I think, it would be bad for this matter. Being calm was the best. If worst came to worst; Chu Kong died in this lifetime, the next lifetime I could just go look for him. At worst, he would forget me. I would then use all my virtue and charm from the heaven and the human realm to let him fall in love with me again.</p>
 <p>The most difficult thing of the humans was persistence.</p>
 <p>I yawned. In front of the temple I changed of position and was ready to go to sleep. Suddenly, I heard birds chirping at the other side. It was a movement to great a new god entering heaven.</p>
 <p>In this heaven beside I, who had been transformed into a half god by Yue Lao, it had been five hundred years since someone else had transformed into an immortal.</p>
 <p>To heaven, this was a happy event.</p>
 <p>In my heart, I had a vague guess, but I didn’t dare to hope that was real.</p>
 <p>I heard Yue Lao rushing while entering with laughter: “Haha ha! I bet right! The money is mine! My golden teals, wait for Yue Lao grandfather! I’ll go pick you up!”</p>
 <p>Looking at Yue Lao’s leaving back, I knew I really should be happy. But the knot in my heart didn’t let me take a step. What to say, what to do, I thought that I could calmly face it again. But when the reunion came, I just only knew now that at an important moment not knowing what to do, could be forgiven.</p>
 <p>I was still hesitating while suddenly at the horizon a black figure driving a black cloud was swaying leisurely to Yue Lao temple.</p>
 <p>He came really slowly as if he could fall at any time. I couldn’t help myself anymore from wanting to go help him to let him drive the dark clouds steadily.</p>
 <p>I didn’t even get to lift my hand; the man in the sky came down straight on the carpet made of clouds in front of the temple. A “pu “sound could be heard like a fart from a soul.</p>
 <p>I blinked and looked at the man who was having a difficult time of getting his head out of the carpet made of clouds.</p>
 <p>He was in such a sorry state. Hair being fried by lightning. Dirty face. His clothes were so dirty that you couldn’t see the color anymore. But I didn’t need to see his appearance; I know who he is.</p>
 <p>“Fuck!”</p>
 <p>He stood up and patted his clothes.</p>
 <p>“Are you blind? Don’t you know how to come and help xiaoye?!”</p>
 <p>I don’t know why, my eyes actually turned somewhat red.</p>
 <p>“Chu Kong…..”</p>
 <p>He was really as strong as I imagined. He got his last immortal soul himself. He cultivated into an immortal with his own effort. He overcome his misfortune and brought a complete him to me.</p>
 <p>Hearing me call him, Chu Kong also hesitated. Then he frowned and rubbed his forehead. Quite upset, he said: “No……wait, wait. Don’t hurry. Wait till I change my identity for a little bit. I need to ponder about which tone I should use to talk to you. Really confusing.”</p>
 <p>Seven lifetimes, I saw too many different types of Chu Kong. He was probably even more confused than me.</p>
 <p>However, what did it matter? There was only him out of all the people in my memories. This was my fortunate thing.</p>
 <p>But before being fortunate…..</p>
 <p>I held out my hand and said with a not so friendly tone: “Ten copper coins. Because of you, I lost them. You need to pay me back.”</p>
 <p>Chu Kong blinked and looked at me for a while. He stared at me in disbelief and said: "Xiaoye cultivated into an immortal like a mad man to come see you and my waistband is gone because of the lightening! You actually want me to give you ten copper coins? Where can I dig out ten copper coins for you?!”</p>
 <p>“Don’t have?”</p>
 <p>I raised an eyebrow and said with a serious tone: “Don’t pay me money back? Then give me your person. Pay me back with your body!”</p>
 <p>Chu Kong was stunned. He looked away and touched his nose. He whispered: “Hasn’t it already been yours a long time ago……” <em>(awwww)</em></p>
 <p>My heart went soft. I rushed forward. I didn’t care how sorry Chu Kong looked at this moment. I also didn’t care about how dirty his face was. I bit Chu Kong’s lip. Then I released him: “I stamped it! From today one you’re my worker! All the money you earn will be mine!”</p>
 <p>Chu Kong was severely shocked. He looked at me in daze for a moment and then sighed helplessly: “This thing isn’t done like how you did it.”</p>
 <p>He lowered his head. His lips touched my lips. A warm touch. It gradually deepened and slowly turned moist.</p>
 <p>Opposite of what his temperament was, he carefully taught me how to do this thing. Perhaps in the future, he would teach me more things……uh, serious things……</p>
 <p><em>(Pfff, I bet ten golden teals that they aren’t serious things)</em></p>
