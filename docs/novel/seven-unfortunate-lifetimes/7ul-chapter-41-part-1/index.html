 <p><span style>The heavy bag full of fluorites fell on the ground. Chu Kong and I landed exactly like that. The injury on my back made me unable to stand or sit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong could only use one hand. If he held me, he couldn’t hold the fluorites. We pondered for a while and then decided to rest in this place for a day, then leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That night, Chu Kong scavenged some firewood and lit it. I endured the pain and bound his arm with three branches. Then, I undressed and lied on the ground so Chu Kong could clean the wound with water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Using the princess’ and the general’s body in the previous lifetime felt like nothing. This lifetime, it was my own body. It made me a little embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I clutched my chest, lied on my stomach, and muttered, “Just massage my back like an honest gentleman would. Don’t have any other thoughts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong humphed coldly. “Looking at your burned and bloody appearance, do you still think I’d have the appetite to eat you? Be less worried about things that don’t exist.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Chu Kong’s words were really cold, the hand cleaning my wound was so gentle, it would’ve been easy to mistake it for another person’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though he was really gentle, the pain of an open flesh wound being soaked in water wasn’t something I could conceal. I hissed. Chu Kong didn’t dare to put his hand back on my back. I tightly gritted my teeth and didn’t make a sound anymore. The wound would just get worse if it didn’t get cleaned. All we had to do now was fill the hole and go back to Heaven. Being weak here would just waste time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cleaning continued. This time Chu Kong also put herbs on my back. I didn’t make a sound. My forehead was full of sweat from enduring the pain. Suddenly, I felt Chu Kong touch my head. With a low, sensual voice he said, “I’m sorry…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I didn’t know why he was apologizing. I answered groggily, “There are many reasons you should be apologizing to me for. Come, let me listen to some more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I figured that even if Chu Kong didn’t beat me this time, he’d still make some witty remark. I didn’t think that after waiting for half a day, I’d only hear one honest sentence out of him. “I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I turned to look at him, a little surprised. “Chu Kong! You’re sick!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He glanced at me once and then his gaze fell on my back again. I could feel his finger walking up my burned flesh. He said, “Although you always pretend to be a rough man without a care for appearance, a woman is still a woman. I let you suffer through this pain, so in the end, it’s my fault…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was foolishly stunned for a while. I found it hard to be moved by his mature appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s still you who is marrying something ugly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I lied back and closed my eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anyway, I’ll rely on you for here on out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Besides, Chu Kong had protected me. His back at that time was enough to make me feel at ease. An immortal’s body is hardier than a human’s body. Although such a wound of the flesh couldn’t be completely healed, it would pass reluctantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong and I hurried the next day to Hua Mountain. That was the location of the hole. After filling it, our seven lifetimes of fated love would finally be settled!</span></p>
 <p><span style>So close to our goal, my head was filled with wishful thoughts. After being burned by the flamed beast, I hurt my soul, so after going back to Heaven, I needed to spend Chu Kong’s money to nourish myself well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Mountain was the place where Chu Kong and I stayed when we were a tiger and a pig. Walking on this ground again was quite odd, but I was really happy. Chu Kong expression was really bad. I honestly could understand his gloominess. Nobody wanted to remember how they looked like as a pig. It was only when I saw the cave from the previous lifetime that I grew shocked. It turned out that Chu Kong’s expression was so serious because the evil energy leaking from there was already beyond our imagination. The evil energy was extremely concentrated in there. The vegetation next to it had already died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>We went into the cave. Our first step into the cave made an odd sound. I stiffened and looked down. I had stepped on a pile of broken bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong’s expression turned more serious. “After that time, more people must’ve come to worship. No wonder the evil energy leaked so fast.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He turned and ordered, “Your soul has been damaged. You should not enter. Wait outside for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He grabbed the bag filled with fluorites and walked with several big strides into the cave. After every step he made, the sound of breaking bones would echo back to the entrance. I couldn’t help it and hugged my arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With such a thick and evil energy, there shouldn’t be a more powerful monster that could hurt people. There wasn’t much that I could help him with while he was filling the hole. So, I eased my heart and squatted down. At the same time, I began to purify the surrounding air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I waited for a long time and still didn’t see Chu Kong come out. I peered into the cave, feeling a little uneasy. Eventually, I couldn’t hold it any longer and shouted, “Chu Kong, are you finished yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound echoed back and forth in the cave, but no answer came from Chu Kong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I waited for a little while and suddenly heard a muffled sound coming from inside the cave. My heart jumped. I knew that it wasn’t good. I turned on the balls of my feet to enter the cave. Suddenly, a golden light flashed in front of my eyes. A surge of cold breath blew in my direction. My whole body flew back and collided with a dead tree trunk. The impact opened the wound on my back again. The pain was unbearable. A cold wind wandered into my heart and I vomited blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, there’s still a little fairy out here,” a strange man’s voice said. He had a somewhat leisurely elegance and callous cruelty.</span></p>
