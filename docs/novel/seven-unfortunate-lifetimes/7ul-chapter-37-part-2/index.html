 <p><a href="https://rosyfantasy.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/55d14ba5cadfcbb9f894c7fa7a550f24.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class=" wp-image-926 aligncenter" src="https://rosyfantasy.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/55d14ba5cadfcbb9f894c7fa7a550f24.jpg?w=219" alt="55d14ba5cadfcbb9f894c7fa7a550f24" width="271" height="372"></a><span style>It was silent for a while. Then, Zihui laughed. “A Xiang lady really knows how to praise someone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who allowed you to speak?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I heard Chu Kong shout through gritted teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph, you’re a real sly demon, aren’t you? Acting all mature and calm. Letting people like you. Letting people lose their soul as they still think about you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zihui was stunned and asked, “What does Shifu mean with those words?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong sneered. “I don’t have a player for a disciple.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Chu Kong was talking, I remembered the soul from the cave. I said, “Oh, I almost forgot. Zihui, do you have a deceased wife? Her soul asked us to come find you and tell you to look for her. Go quickly; if you’re late, her soul will already have been scattered.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zihui let the already cooked leg cook again on the fire. He smiled and said, “A Xiang lady has got the wrong guy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I hesitated and looked at Chu Kong. Chu Kong narrowed his eyes and looked at Zihui. I said, “That woman asked me to pass on some words: ‘A Luo has always been waiting for you.’ Do you know her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The air was full of the smell of the meat. Zihui didn’t move and quietly replied, “Don’t know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I pouted and didn’t say anything anymore. Chu Kong stroked his hand. The flame melted the meat. The meat fell on the snow and rolled away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This smell is making xiaoye upset.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zihui smiled. “I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He paused and then continued. “Where are you two planning to go next?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong was immediately alarmed. “What do you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have nothing to do now. If you two need help, I’ll use all my strength to help you in order to pay back Chu Kong’s grace for saving me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t need it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good,” I shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong frowned. I wondered, “A person is taking the initiative to repay you, so why don’t you want it? Having someone around to run errands and do odd jobs is really good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This is what I wished for in the lifetime when I was stupid. That lifetime, I failed to accomplish it. Now, it would be good if I could have that wish come true.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong put on a stinky face. “No, xiaoye is happy to have him owe me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was silent and hadn’t yet had the time to speak again when Zihui said, “As the saying goes, as long as the hoe plays well, there’s no wall that he can’t dig down. Is Chu Kong afraid of me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing that, I winked and looked at Chu Kong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong saw our actions. Slowly, his ears began to turn red. “Afraid your uncle!” he shouted, and turned away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want to follow us, then follow. Wait and see how xiaoye will handle you! This is what you asked yourself; don’t blame me for not warning you! Hmph!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>So, the road that Chu Kong and I had to walk to go get the stones now had an additional person, or better said…an additional stone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Use him to fill the hole.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zihui bought a fur coat for me at a small tent. I wore it and felt warm. I looked at Zihui and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sitting on the chair inside the inn, Zihui went to get something to eat. Chu Kong immediately gave me a cold look. “He’s just a stone demon, so we can just use him to fill the hole. That will let him pay us back for saving him, and also solve our matter. Kill two birds with one stone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My mouth twitched. “Don’t you feel despicable and treacherous, speaking about these things behind a person’s back?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong hmphed coldly. “I didn’t say it behind his back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is Chu Kong so disgusted with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zihui put a bowl of buns in front of me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A Xiang lady, eat while it’s hot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He laughed and looked at Chu Kong. “I’m dedicatedly working to show my gratitude, but in exchange, I got such words from Chu Kong. It really makes me sad. Moreover, what a Xiang lady told me is that the hole is leaking evil energy. Using pure and clean stones can block the evil energy from leaking. If you use me, a stone demon, I’m afraid the more you use, the more it’ll leak.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong’s hand reached for my face that was full of buns and squeezed it, letting the oil from my mouth fall onto his hands. He didn’t let go. “You told him everything, ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isnhn’t he geoing to gelp us…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zihui helped me translate. “She said, isn’t he going to help us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong angrily interrupted him. “I understand what she said!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong pushed my face away and wiped his hand with disgust.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You, cheap thing. Someone gives you a little benefit and you’re bought. Thing without a backbone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I swallowed the buns in my mouth and looked at him. “You have backbone. Don’t eat my buns. Don’t stay at the inn that Zihui found.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoye just won’t stay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong kicked the chair and stood up. “Today ye will go stay at the </span><i><span style>Red House1</span></i><span style>. You two can stay here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I blinked and watched Chu Kong’s leaving figure, forgetting all about the buns.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where did…did he say he was going to stay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He was talking about the Red House.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I nodded. “Is he going to look for a flower girl, ah?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zihui drank a mouthful tea. “Is a Xiang lady jealous?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I buried my face in the buns. “Hmph, who has the spare time to be jealous?! Let him get ten girls tonight. Let him contract flower transmitted diseases.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zihui coughed twice and joked, “Since you two like each other so much, why don’t you be a little more honest? These two days we were walking together, Chu Kong was really angry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That I like him…is it really that obvious?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really obvious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was silent and didn’t know what more to say. That’s right, ah. I’ve already been so obvious…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong, you stupid thing, confess to me, let me stay at ease with you and see what’s like!</span></p>
 <p><span style>I angrily stuffed another bun in my mouth. Zihui said, “Just tell him directly. With Chu Kong’s temper, it’ll be a difficult task to get him to open his mouth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t that I haven’t given him any hints! He just never says it clearly to me. It must be because there’s still a little small white flower waiting for him in Heaven! They’ll also go look at the stars…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I startled even myself by blurting out those words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So…deep in my heart, I had been skeptical about Chu Kong. Giving him hints again and again, being thick-skinned and telling him that he likes me... But every time we got to that point, my heart wanted him to get the courage to tell me directly, to give me a definite answer. But every time…he didn’t give me a direct answer. His performance, his behavior wasn’t as good and real as that one solid sentence: “that’s right, I like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The small white flower named Ying Shi that I saw in the Netherworld was always a shadow in my heart, reminding me that Chu Kong could be gentle to another woman. Alone, I looked forward to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I used my chopsticks to pick at the steamed bun. After a long time, I picked some meat out. “Nobody has ever asked me to go watch the stars.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If that’s so, then a Xiang lady, let’s go watch the stars today. You and me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I looked up at him. Zihui smiled. “We’ll go to the Red House to watch stars.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My eyebrow raised. I was instantly suspicious. “What do you want to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zihui smiled mysteriously. “Let Celestial Star Chu Kong say what’s in his heart. Doesn’t a Xiang lady want to hear?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t want…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the meat in the buns have been poked out by me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“…It will be a lie.”</span></p>
