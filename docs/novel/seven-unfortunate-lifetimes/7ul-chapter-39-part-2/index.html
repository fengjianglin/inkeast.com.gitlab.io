 <p><span style>The wind whistled against my ear. I could hear the air’s strange silence. When I turned again, that side didn’t even have a shadow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong, he actually…fled…</span></p>
 <p><span style>When I returned to the inn, Zihui was sitting in the empty hall, all dressed. Seeing that I was back, he smiled with squinted eyes: “Just now, Chu Kong, while holding his clothes, hurriedly went back into his room. Then a Xiang lady came back refreshed. How come this scene is reversed from what I expected?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong saw Zihui and actually didn’t beat him?! It seemed that his heart must’ve really been in chaos. Being and immortal without desires, he almost did it with me outside…</span></p>
 <p><span style>He has a proud temper and he also lost his pants in front of me. The activity in Chu Kong’s heart must be as exciting as it can be.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I approached and grabbed Zihui’s collar. I coldly asked, “You actually dare to stay here waiting for us?! Tell me, what was that wine?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zihui leisurely laughed. “That wine is called “Truth-Telling Wine”. When people drink it, it’ll make them tell the truth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Full of hate, I spat, “Then what were you intending to make happen by letting me drink it after you went away?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, actually I wanted to let you two drink it together. But regardless who drank it, it shouldn’t be like this, ah. A Xiang lady and Chu Kong are really different from ordinary people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I scratched my head in distress. I let go of Zihui and warned him, “I don’t need you to be the good person. We’ll solve our matter ourselves!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I turned and went upstairs. With mixed feelings, I stood in front of Chu Kong’s door for long while. Eventually, I decided that we needed to calm down by ourselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I lied on my bed for half a night, but I couldn’t sleep. It felt like there was always Chu Kong lying next to me, close to my neck and sucking at the place where my aorta was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At dawn, the door made squeaking sounds. I was only sleeping lightly, so it immediately woke me up. When I saw the guy standing at the edge of my bed, I foolishly didn’t move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blush on his face looked like an iron branded it. It burned nonstop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I know! Alright! Just let it be like this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He came over just to say such strange words. I blinked and looked at him. He took a deep breath and turned his head. “I’ll give…give you a chance to like me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The morning light came through the window and stayed on Chu Kong’s body. His hair was down, and went all the way till his feet. I stared at him and was in trance. His eyes looked everywhere but me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, today I went overboard. Xiaoye…xiaoye will take responsibility!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong’s eyes glanced once at my neck. Then he closed his eyes. He almost shouted, “When we go back to Heaven, I’ll marry you, alright?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was in shock. It took a while before I reacted. Full of disbelief, I asked, “Are you, you proposing, marriage?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong looked at me, chin up so high I could see his nostrils. “It’s giving you a chance to marry me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was silent for a while. Then, I held my hand out. “Where’s the dowry? Without a dowry, I won’t marry you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Chu Kong and I got together, I’d lose an entire ten copper coins! Naturally, there was nothing else to say; Chu Kong needed to pay me those ten copper coins back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>My business-like attitude made Chu Kong’s bright-red face cool down. He stared at me for a while before finally scratching his head in irritation. “Once we’re back in Heaven, I’ll give it to you! I’ll give you as much as you want! Really, you’re someone who only knows how to gain more benefits for yourself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I sat up and asked solemnly, “You still have to tell me who Ying Shi is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ying Shi? Why ask about her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course I need to ask. My man can only be mine, from the inside to the outside. He needs to report all the women around him clearly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two words “my man” let Chu Kong’s face become red. He honestly answered, “My little junior sister.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Full of disdain, I said, “Who do you want to deceive?! Don’t think I don’t know. In the Morning God’s estate, the twelve Celestial Stars are scattered immortals that he found outside. I never heard you twelve becoming a disciple of a Shifu. Where did you get a junior sister?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong scowled. “In my childhood, I was a disciple of an immortal. But because such a long time has passed and at the time I was still small, my memories are a little blurred. Then, that master of mine disappeared. All the disciples scattered to the four directions. Ying Shi and I were too small. We wandered in Heaven for a while and then were recruited by the Morning God.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After listening to his explanation, I finally nodded. “Then let’s go back to Heaven and get married. In the future, you’ll support me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong turned away and headed out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First, find the fluorite and close the hole leaking the evil energy. Then we’ll talk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He went out of my room. The sun rose. The room was bright. I sat on the couch, holding my knees and silently blushed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Marry someone, ah. Marry Chu Kong…such a proud guy proposed to me. From now on, we can be together. If we wanted to kiss each other, then we could kiss each other all we wanted. If we want to hug each other, then we could hug each other for as long as we wanted. He and I could finally be referred to as…us.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When it was time to leave the inn, I finally discovered that Zihui disappeared. The waiter of the inn said that Zihui left us a letter and a fan. Chu Kong grabbed Zihui’s letter. After he read it, he crumpled it into a ball. Then he handed the fan over to me and snappily said, “He said to let you stay obediently by my side. This fan is as an apology to us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong humphed coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A broken fan and he still dared to give it as a gift. However, we can use it as a replacement. Use it as a self-defense instrument. In the future, I’ll give you a better one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I took the fan from him and let my gaze lightly sweep over Chu Kong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t need to eat vinegar. I don’t like him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Humph, who has the time to eat vinegar. Women are really hypocritical.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who was being more hypocritical here, ah…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maybe it was because we were hurrying to go back to Heaven to marry, or maybe it was because we saw more and more demons being awakened by the evil energy, but Chu Kong and I accelerated the speed of our feet. After many days, we finally arrived at Kun Wu Mountain. The fluorite is where the air was stronger, and guarding the fluorite was some beast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong took an estimation of our powers and temporarily drew out a plan. It was as follows: Chu Kong will go and fight the beast to distract him. I’d go in and steal the fluorites. After I got the fluorites outside, I’d send him a signal. Then, we’d leave the territory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong warned me again and again, “The beast is covered in flames and burning in rage. Your body is a cloud. Don’t let it grill you. So when you see fire, quickly hide. Don’t be brave. Stones can be taken again, but there’s only one life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t need to remind me. I repeatedly nodded to express that I knew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Kong scheduled the time that we’d steal the fluorite: at night. At night, the beast was covered in flames, so we could see him clearly. But he couldn’t see us. The enemy was in the dark, but we had the light; it was a good opportunity to attack.</span></p>
