   <p>“I didn’t given birth to you! I didn’t give birth to you!”</p>
   <p>Yan country’s officials were extreme believers. Yan country was known for the saying that a crazy child would bring misfortune. Presumably this concubine had been banished by the emperor to the cold palace after giving birth to silly Chu Kong. Her whole life could be regarded as ruined. No wonder she hated her own child so much. But it happened that her son was the only one she could rely on……</p>
   <p>The woman suddenly stood up and came out. She slapped meatball Kong on his face, her sharp nails left three bloodstains on the child’s face. Although the child was somewhat stupid, he still knew pain. Big tears fell out of his eyes on his whole face: “Mother……”</p>
   <p>“How good would it be if I haven't given birth to you?!”</p>
   <p>The woman began to beat him uncontrollably.</p>
   <p>“How good will it be if you didn’t come to this world?! Go away! Go away……”</p>
   <p>I let my body be visible. I stood before Chu Kong and grabbed the woman’s wrist. I glared at her: “Children aren’t here to let you vent your anger on.”</p>
   <p>I continued: “I’m really sorry that he came out of your belly. Since you don’t care for him, I’ll care for him.”</p>
   <p>I let go of her hand. The woman’s body went soft and slumped on the ground: “Ghost……ghost!”</p>
   <p>“I’m not a ghost.”</p>
   <p>Before I finished talking, that person breathed fast, her eyes turned white and fainted.</p>
   <p>I didn’t care about her, squatted down and touched meatball Kong disrupted hair. His eyes rested on the purple pearl. I didn’t hesitate, took it down and put it on Chu Kong’s chest. The one immortal soul and four mortal souls floated out and entered meatball Kong’s body. I saw his dull eyes changed and showed a bit of cleverness.</p>
   <p>I wear the purple pearl once again. I took out a handkerchief to wipe his face full of blood and tears. I said: “From today on, you’re called Chu Kong and is someone cultivating to be an immortal. I’m called Xiao Xiang and I am……your shifu.”</p>
   <p>He didn’t say anything and I also didn’t know what to say anymore. I put my hand out in front of him. He stared at it blankly for half an incense stick before he put his meaty hand in my palm. I gripped his hand, smiled and said: “Let’s see if you can escape my palm in this lifetime, hehehe he.”</p>
   <p>Chu Kong wasn’t fit to live in crowded places right now. Besides, he was a prince. I wasn't sure whether the future struggle of the court wouldn’t harm him. I simply took him to the forest to live there safely.</p>
   <p>On the foot of Lu Hua Mountain, I built a house and lived there with Chu Kong. With one more immortal soul and four mortal souls, Chu Kong was much smarter than before. I taught him how to read. I write down all the spells that Chu Kong taught me before for him to practice. But he still learned slowly. I couldn’t help but feel impatient. This lifetime he was just a human. What would I do if he hadn’t cultivated into an immortal, but has already died? After all, I would be alive, living forever. I still had to search. The longer I am together with Chu Kong, the more afraid I was that he would be gone again.</p>
   <p>Time passed quietly with me being a worried guardian. Chu Kong was already ten years old. There was still one mortal and one immortal soul left before Chu Kong’s soul would be complete.</p>
   <p>But I didn’t know why, Chu Kong had become increasingly against cultivation. He used all means to be lazy and played with all kinds of demons on the mountain. One time, a tree demon helped him write a talisman and he went to play with the tiger demon in town. He didn’t return for two days. I was worried searched for him for two whole days. On the third day, I saw him hobbling back refreshingly. Blood shot to my eyes. I looked at him with a pale face: “Where have you been?”</p>
   <p>Chu Kong’s happy face stiffened. He looked at me afraid: “Xiao Xiang……”</p>
   <p>I rustled my hand through my hair. I stood up, snapped a leg of a chair and hold it tightly in my hand. With a calm tone I said: “Come here, we’ll have some talk.”</p>
   <p>Chu Kong took a step back, startled. I slowly walked to him and squatted down. I asked: “Say, with whom did you go to play? Where did you go play?”</p>
   <p>He tweaked for a long time and finally, weakly admitted under my forced eyes: “The town below the mountain…….together with Da Hua.”</p>
   <p>Da Hua was the tiger demon's name.</p>
   <p>“Who told you to go?”</p>
   <p>“The, the demons in the mountain said that I shouldn’t always stay on the mountain. Should go out to see the world……”</p>
   <p>I nodded in understanding. I took the leg of the chair and went out. I beat all the demons in the mountain. At the foot of Lu Hua Mountain the demons were crying loudly. Finally, I bound the tiger demon Da Hua with a cable and brought him back. When Chu Kong saw Da Hua, he immediately rushed to him and asked: “Da Hua, did you suffer a beating? Does it hurt? I’m sorry……”</p>
   <p>I sat on a chair, drank a mouthful of tea, calmed some of my emotions before I said: “What motive do you have to take Chu Kong down the mountain?”</p>
   <p>Chu Kong’s age, his fine skin, soft meat and his body with a little immortal cultivation were the favorite food for the demons who walked the evil ways. That they coaxed him to go down the mountain really made me worried. Before, when I let Chu Kong be in touch with the demons on this mountain was because I knew that the demons weren’t bad. And if they had a hidden agenda on Chu Kong……</p>
   <p>Listening to my questioning, Da Hua was so scared that he immediately cried: “Have mercy, fairy. This little demon wouldn’t dare again. This little demon only felt that Chu Kong was on the mountain every day cultivating to be an immortal; his days are really monotonous. I kindly invited him down the mountain for a tour. I don’t have any malicious intent! Woowoo, fairy, have mercy, woo woo.”</p>
   <p>I put the teacup down and was about to speak when Chu Kong opened his arms and stood in front of Da Hua. He said: “Xiao Xiang, don’t hit Da Hua. It’s Chu Kong’s fault. Chu Kong shouldn’t have fun. I won’t do it again. Don’t hit her……”</p>
   <p>Him being like this made me think of Lu Hai Kong. I didn’t know in what year, he also stood in front of me protecting me from my prime minister father. And now he had totally forgotten it.</p>
   <p>I came out of daze. I rubbed my forehead and said: “Chu Kong doesn’t need to go down to see the world. After he cultivated an immortal body, he’ll have a lot of time to play……”</p>
   <p>My words hardly left when I heard Chu Kong say in a low voice with his head looking at the ground: “Why do I have to cultivate an immortal body?”</p>
   <p>I was startled: “What did you say?”</p>
   <p>Chu Kong gritted his teeth and said frankly: “Why does Chu Kong have to cultivate into an immortal? Why should I listen to Xiao Xiang’s?”</p>
   <p>Because if you don’t cultivate into an immortal, how will you spend your life with me? If you don’t cultivate into an immortal, how would you become celestial Chu Kong again? If you didn’t cultivate into an immortal, how would you go back to heaven and marry me? And you still have so many promises that you didn’t realize, why shouldn’t you listen to me? Why not work hard to cultivate……</p>
   <p>However, I was shocked for a moment and suddenly, I had woken up. The Chu Kong standing in front of me wasn’t the Chu Kong of the past anymore. To him the promises that celestial star Chu Kong made to me are like promises that someone he didn’t know made to me. It had nothing to do with him. He didn’t have the memories of the past. He was a new person.</p>
   <p>What right do I have to put my own desires on him?</p>
   <p>I froze from my own awareness. I just listened to Chu Kong who lowered his head. He said with a soft but firm voice: “I don’t want to cultivate. I want to be like Da Hua. Because of such a thing you bully them. Xiao Xiang is unreasonable.”</p>
   <p>Faced with such accusations, I was speechless. I was silent for a while before I said: “Since you don’t want to cultivate, I am wrong.”</p>
   <p>I retrieved the rope tying Da Hua and silently went into the house. Before closing the door, I said to them: “In the future if you don’t come back, remember to tell me. Don’t let me worry.”</p>
   <p>Outside, two children’s clear voices passed into my ears: “Chu Kong, fairy seems really sad, ah. You should go apologize.”</p>
   <p>Chu Kong sounded somewhat at loss: “How should I apologize?”</p>
   <p>It should be me who should be apologizing to them. Suddenly the purple pearl in front of my chest brightened. This pearl dealt often with Chu Kong’s souls. It’ll react like it had some spiritual connection with them. Was Chu Kong’s soul near here? I put aside my complicated state of mind. I opened the window, jumped out and followed the direction of the purple pearl.</p>

 <p>However, I was shocked for a moment and suddenly, I had woken up. The Chu Kong standing in front of me wasn’t the Chu Kong of the past anymore. To him the promises that celestial star Chu Kong made to me are like promises that someone he didn’t know made to me. It had nothing to do with him. He didn’t have the memories of the past. He was a new person.</p>
 <p>What right do I have to put my own desires on him?</p>
 <p>I froze from my own awareness. I just listened to Chu Kong who lowered his head. He said with a soft but firm voice: “I don’t want to cultivate. I want to be like Da Hua. Because of such a thing you bully them. Xiao Xiang is unreasonable.”</p>
 <p>Faced with such accusations, I was speechless. I was silent for a while before I said: “Since you don’t want to cultivate, I am wrong.”</p>
 <p>I retrieved the rope tying Da Hua and silently went into the house. Before closing the door, I said to them: “In the future if you don’t come back, remember to tell me. Don’t let me worry.”</p>
 <p>Outside, two children’s clear voices passed into my ears: “Chu Kong, fairy seems really sad, ah. You should go apologize.”</p>
 <p>Chu Kong sounded somewhat at loss: “How should I apologize?”</p>
 <p>It should be me who should be apologizing to them. Suddenly the purple pearl in front of my chest brightened. This pearl dealt often with Chu Kong’s souls. It’ll react like it had some spiritual connection with them. Was Chu Kong’s soul near here? I put aside my complicated state of mind. I opened the window, jumped out and followed the direction of the purple pearl.</p>
