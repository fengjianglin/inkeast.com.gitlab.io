 <p>I'm standing before the well of reincarnation once again. But I’m not accustomed to the silence of this time. I turned back to look. The road to the netherworld was still the same. Nothing had changed. But I think that this time, the netherworld was colder than before.</p>
 <p>The soul attached to the purple bead wandered out and went into the well of reincarnation to be reincarnated. Watching the soul disappear before me, I suddenly had some fear. I didn’t know in which family Chu Kong would be reincarnated in the next lifetime. I didn’t know when I would find him in such a big world. I also didn’t know if when I see him again, how his appearance would be, but……</p>
 <p>Since I couldn’t change reality, I could only put on an armor and face it. I keep the purple bead safely on me. Then I also jumped into the well of reincarnation.</p>
 <p>Three years had passed on the human realm. Without Chu Kong at my side, this superficial lifetime was really splendid. Finally, I could enjoy it slowly. Without anyone to quarrel with, my life was surprisingly comfortable. Only until now, did I know how much trouble and unhappiness that arrogant Chu Kong brought.</p>
 <p>However, every night, when I am quietly watching the stars, I would still think of Chu Kong. When such unbearable thing happening all the time, it would let me shamelessly miss him. Chu Kong was never perfect. He had a cheap mouth and a bad temper. He also didn’t do anything particular to make me happy. Even the fan, he had said himself that wanted to repay me, hasn’t been repaid. But he had knocked a hole through my cold and steely heart and blatantly walked in it and looked at me arrogantly: “Xiaoye came to live inside it, what can you do about it?”</p>
 <p>I wished that I could crush him to death, but I couldn’t do anything. So I could only let him live inside it. He became a thorn, that I was unable to swallow and also unable to be spit out.</p>
 <p>I didn’t know if this kind of feeling was the so-called “love between man and woman”. I only know that the moment I wanted to see him and could see him, my sky will be cloudless.</p>
 <p>So, to be able to see him at the moment I wanted to see him, these three years, I used all my effort to search for Chu Kong’s immortal soul and four mortal souls. There was still one immortal soul and two mortal souls missing. I already did half of what the magistrate said would be done in a thousand years. Perhaps it was destiny. Or perhaps Chu Kong’s souls were also searching for me.</p>
 <p>It was the end of March. Lovely flowers bloomed everywhere. I enjoyed the flowers all the way to Yan country’s capital. It was said that ghosts currently haunted Yan country’s palace. Originally, it was normal for the palace to have some rumors about ghost. But now I couldn’t afford to let go of even a little clue.</p>
 <p>After entering the capital, I searched for an inn and registered in it. I paid for the room and immediately went to the palace’s wall. I made a stealthy decision and entered the palace. I thought that most time the haunted place would be at the cold palace. I searched for a while before I found some palace maids who were bringing food to the cold palace. I followed behind them to find out the direction to the cold palace. I wanted to come back at night to take a careful look. But suddenly the purple pearl that I’m wearing around my neck brightened. I stared at it blankly for a while.</p>
 <p>The one immortal soul and four mortal souls that I found, I put them in this purple pearl. There was a connection between souls. After I found one missing soul, every time I found another missing soul, this purple pearl would brighten. This was also one of the reason why I could find one immortal soul and four mortal souls so fast. It seemed that in this palace there was really Chu Kong’s missing soul.</p>
 <p>I was so deep in thoughts and entered the cold palace together with the palace maids. The purple pearl brightened at once. This hadn’t happened before. Could it be that here there was many of Chu Kong’s souls hidden?</p>
 <p>I looked up, puzzled. Under a dead tree in the cold palace, a meatball dressed in red sat on the ground. His pair of big eyes peered at my…..purple pearl in front of my chest. I was also staring at him. This child facial features were seventy or eighty percent like Chu Kong or even the once Lu Hai Kong.</p>
 <p>I couldn’t help but stare at him for a long time. But this child stared at me for a while and then turned and looked blankly at the sky. He looked a bit stiff. This body which had one immortal soul and one mortal soul surely would be deformed.</p>
 <p>The purple pearl floated up and seemed to be anxious to fuse together with the souls in the body. I looked at the room full of palace maids and quietly pressed the purple pearl down.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, after the palace maids brought the food, they went away. Not long after, a thin woman walked out of the room. She sat at the table and called weakly: “Come eat.”</p>
 <p>I could see that she was calling meatball Kong, but meatball Kong ignored her. He just sat there and stared at the sky blankly.</p>
 <p>I didn’t know which nerve of the woman in the room had been poked. Suddenly she slammed on the table and swept half of the dishes to the ground. The voice of the broken plates tingled in my eardrum. Meatball Kong finally turned around and looked at the woman blankly: “Mother…..”</p>
 <p>“Don’t call me!”</p>
 <p>The woman grabbed her withered hair and screamed: “I’m not your mother! All is because of you! Because of you I’ve come to this state! I’m not your mother! I’m not!”</p>
 <p>Her voice was shrill, but it only exchanged a word from meatball Kong: “Mother.”</p>
