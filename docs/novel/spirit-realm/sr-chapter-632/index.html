 <p><strong>Chapter 632: Number One</strong></p>
 <p>Flaming Sun Island.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie was seated on a large and oval-shaped coral at the reef area. He was facing the sea and cultivating hard under the reddened sky of the sunset.</p>
 <p>The Demon Sealing Tombstone also lay on the rock looking like a sharp weapon that had been stabbed into a rock.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie softly pressed both his hands against its surface.</p>
 <p>Wisps of scarlet fiendish blood aura flew out of the Demon Sealing Tombstone like a bloody mist and gradually entered his blood vessels through his fingers.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie circulated the Blood Spirit Art and used the blood inside his body to absorb the berserk blood aura. He felt as if his blood was boiling as hot as lava.</p>
 <p>While enduring the pain that felt like his blood vessels bursting, he began refining blood essences in his veins with the help of the Blood Refinement Art.</p>
 <p>Time passed quickly.</p>
 <p>A day and a night later, five translucent blood droplets that looked like bloodstones emerged from beneath the skin of his palm.</p>
 <p>The five beads of blood essences lay silently on his palm, traces of pure blood energy seeping out of them.</p>
 <p>All Blood Fiend Sect disciples would create their own lifeblood essences after reaching a certain realm.</p>
 <p>Lifeblood essences were created from one’s blood. They contained a thick amount of refined blood energy that was the essence of one’s blood.</p>
 <p>To a Blood Fiend Sect disciple, a lifeblood essence enabled them to unleash “Blood Arts: Soul Shackle” or create a blood demon with their blood essences too.</p>
 <p>The activation of “Blood Escape” also required a lifeblood essence.</p>
 <p>One could say that a lifeblood essence was full of wonders.</p>
 <p>Previously, the lifeblood essences Qin Lie had created had all been mixed into the life essences of the six great spirit bodies that had evolved into spirits of Void and Chaos.</p>
 <p>Now that all six Spirits of Void and Chaos had been successfully born, he could finally refine new lifeblood essences that could be used to activate the secret arts of Blood Fiend Sect during critical moments.</p>
 <p>He allowed the five lifeblood essences refined from his blood to stay on his palm for a little while. Then, he got ready to withdraw them into his body.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, five godly lights stretched out from inside the Demon Sealing Tombstone and wrapped around the five blood essences like a tongue.</p>
 <p>The five blood essences he refined with his blood were instantly withdrawn into the Demon Sealing Tombstone. In an instant, the supposedly blank tombstone began displaying countless blurry and indiscernible runes that shone magnificently as if rivers of stars came alive on its surface, orbiting in mysterious patterns.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie was shocked by this turn of events.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, he could hear an ancient, desolate and deep calls of summon from the Demon Sealing Tombstone’s surface. It was a demonic voice that reached deep into his heart, causing his very soul to tremble.</p>
 <p>Countless blurry divine runes and dancing stars were orbiting with dazzling speed.</p>
 <p>The ancient divine languages and demonic voices caused invisible ripples that spread towards the sky and beyond.</p>
 <p>The entire process lasted for about five to six minutes. Then, the runes on the tombstone’s surface slowly disappeared, and the divine languages and the demonic voices subsided until they could no longer be heard.</p>
 <p>The Demon Sealing Tombstone regained its former appearance while the five blood essences that had appeared from Qin Lie’s palm had disappeared completely.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie sat there on the reef, completely dumbfounded. He wasn’t sure what had just happened. He didn’t know why runes had appeared on the tombstone’s surface, or where that divine languages and demonic languages that shook his soul had come from. He didn’t know what kind of powers they contained.</p>
 <p>There was one thing that he did figure though—it seemed that he could sneak a peek into the secrets contained inside the Demon Sealing Tombstone by using his lifeblood essences.</p>
 <p>He frowned and pondered.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, many gigantic heads appeared from the sea in front of the reef.</p>
 <p>They were the eight god corpses!</p>
 <p>The eight god corpses had actually appeared of their own accord from the sea even though he hadn’t summoned them.</p>
 <p>Eight giant heads appeared before him yet their bodies did not surface.</p>
 <p>The eight god corpses were flashing with a mysterious dark light. They looked like they were expecting something.</p>
 <p>The series of bizarre occurrences one after another confused Qin Lie more and more, yet his desire to figure out what was going on grew.</p>
 <p>And so, he continued to refine new blood essences with the fiendish blood aura inside the Demon Sealing Tombstone and his own blood as the source.</p>
 <p>Two days later, eleven lifeblood essences appeared on his two palms.</p>
 <p>Rays of godly light flew out of the Demon Sealing Tombstone once more and took away the eleven lifeblood essences.</p>
 <p>Miraculous shining runes that looked like rivers of stars appeared once more on the tombstone’s surface, and spun madly like a deep and mysterious whirlpool of stars.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the divine languages and demonic voices that could make the soul tremble spread out once more as if they wanted to reach the end of the sky and the edge of the sea.</p>
 <p>These abnormal occurrences lasted for almost fifteen minutes before finally subsiding and returning to normal.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie waited for a long while, but didn’t see anything even more unusual. Neither the Blood Fiend Ten Elders nor Xue Li came to learn what had happened earlier.</p>
 <p>Not able to suppress his curiosity, he sought out Flaming Sun Island’s Mo Jun and the others and checked with them to see if they had sensed anything.</p>
 <p>However, everyone shook their heads and said that everything had been normal.</p>
 <p>The divine languages and demonic voices inside the Demon Sealing Tombstone, along with the strange ripples that seemed like they would spread to the end of the sky didn’t appear real to anyone but him. No one else in Fallen Sun Islands could hear or detect them.</p>
 <p>This made Qin lie feel weirder and weirder.</p>
 <p>He didn’t know exactly what just happened, but he could sense that the Demon Sealing Tombstone was calling out to something out in the world.</p>
 <p>These things that were being summoned seemed to have been closely related to the eight god corpses. This was clear from the fact that the eight god corpses had appeared on their own while wearing expectant looks on their faces.</p>
 <p>However, he still didn’t know what the divine languages and demonic voices inside the Demon Sealing Tombstone were calling out to for the eight god corpses.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families were about to arrive, he stopped creating lifeblood essences and temporarily put away the Demon Sealing Tombstone.</p>
 <p>The eight god corpses looked towards the empty sky again the moment the Demon Sealing Tombstone was put back into the spatial ring. Then, they sank into the bottom of the sea once more.</p>
 <p>It was as if nothing had ever happened.</p>
 <p>But Qin Lie knew that something might step across millions and millions of kilometers and come over in the near future.</p>
 <p>These were just the guesses and speculations he had formed from the divine languages and demonic voices inside the Demon Sealing Tombstone and the calls it sent out.</p>
 <p>Seven days later.</p>
 <p>Xing Yumiao successfully entered Nirvana Realm after refining the ancient elite remain and absorbing the power of metal inside it!</p>
 <p>A day later, Xing Shengnan also broke through, to the middle stage of the Fragmentation Realm.</p>
 <p>Two more days passed, and Lang Xie also ascended to the late stage of Fulfillment Realm!</p>
 <p>In face of Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families’ terrifying pressure and incoming adversity, Xing Yumiao, Xing Shengnan and Lang Xie all displayed their outstanding talents and broke through their limits.</p>
 <p>Blood Fiend Sect and the martial practitioners of Gold Sun Island were all motivated by their subsequent breakthroughs.</p>
 <p>Another three days had passed, and Gold Sun Island and Blood Fiend Sect’s forces had all gathered together at three small islands sitting next to one another.</p>
 <p>By now, they had received concrete information that Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families’ martial practitioners would be arriving a day later.</p>
 <p>Everyone was gathering their strength and waiting for the inevitable.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>At the valley named Thunder’s Roar.</p>
 <p>Forefather Terminator was cultivating hard as usual. Every wisp of his soul consciousness was entangled with countless strands of lightning, causing the entire valley to roar angrily like a thunder god.</p>
 <p>“Crack!”</p>
 <p>A clear and visible spatial rift appeared inside the valley, and a ball of refined soul that belonged to Nan Zhengtian actually emerged from the spatial rift.</p>
 <p>It was one of his soul fragments.</p>
 <p>The soul fragment instantly merged with his main soul like a stream that had flowed into the sea. Nan Zhengtian opened his eyes and pondered quietly about the sudden message from his soul.</p>
 <p>Before long, Lei Yan came in from outside the valley and stood respectfully beneath the thunder platform. He asked, “What did you call me for, senior brother?”</p>
 <p>“Are Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families about to invade Fallen Sun Islands and start a decisive war against Blood Fiend Sect?” Forefather Terminator frowned.</p>
 <p>“It should happen by today or tomorrow.” Lei Yan nodded.</p>
 <p>“Send a message to Guan Xian and tell him that that kid called Qin Lie in Blood Fiend Sect is my direct disciple.” Forefather Terminator ordered directly.</p>
 <p>“Huh? Senior brother… this... seems to be against the rules.” Lei Yan smiled wryly.</p>
 <p>“Rules?” Forefather Terminator grinned and laughed madly, “To hell with the rules! Whoever has the biggest fist in the Land of Chaos is the rule! Don’t worry about anything and just tell Guan Xian that Qin Lie is my direct disciple. I’ll be interested to know if there’s anyone in Black Voodoo Cult or the three great families who are foolish enough to harm him!”</p>
 <p>“This…” Lei Yan was feeling a headache coming on. “Black Voodoo Cult’s Pope, Jiang An, isn’t a weakling, though!”</p>
 <p>“Jiang An?” Nan Zhengtian chuckled oddly, “I would very much like to meet him if he would show up! For the past years he had been hiding inside Black Voodoo Cult weaving god knows how many cunning plots and machinations. I haven’t run into him even once while I was roaming the chaotic streams of space. I’m actually troubled that he isn’t showing his face!”</p>
 <p>“Black Voodoo Cult is currently in alliance with the three great families. There’s no need for us to get involved in this.” Lei Yan added.</p>
 <p>“The three great families?” Nan Zhengtian’s face was filled with disdain. “They’re nothing before genuine Silver rank force even if they combine their forces! They’re nothing but passing clowns!”</p>
 <p>“Senior brother, are you sure we want to send this message?” Lei Yan confirmed again.</p>
 <p>“Send that message to Guan Xian now!” Nan Zhengtian said impatiently.</p>
 <p>“Alright, alright.” Lei Yan said helplessly.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Deep inside the sea, on board a large ship, Guan Xian suddenly crushed a message crystal with a dark face.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong, instructor?” A Black Voodoo Cult elder asked carefully.</p>
 <p>“Nan Zhengtian asked someone to send a message to me, saying that that Blood Fiend Sect’s Qin Lie is his direct disciple.” Guan Xian said eeriely.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie? Is he that junior who brought the ancient elite remains out of the Graveyard of Gods? That fellow has been pretty famous recently, and it is said that he is extremely capable, as he was able to defeat all opponents inside the Graveyard of Gods while suffering little to no losses! If this person were to survive, he… would most definitely become a huge threat in the future!” The elder exclaimed in shock.</p>
 <p>“Do you think I don’t know about this?!” Guan Xian snorted coldly.</p>
 <p>After pondering for a moment, he put down the secret formation as black light gathered inside his pupils. He contacted the Pope of Black Voodoo Cult with his soul.</p>
 <p>Inside the formation, many voodoo insects appeared and flapped their wings in a bizarre fashion. They transmitted the message across thousands of kilometers of distance to Black Voodoo Cult.</p>
 <p>After that, Guan Xian waited patiently for a reply.</p>
 <p>A dozen or so seconds later, a hidden, cryptic message was transmitted back from the secret formation.</p>
 <p>Guan Xian narrowed his eyes and listened for a moment. Then, he sighed, “The Pope says that we… will allow that Qin Lie live for now until the first voodoo creature has completely recovered.”</p>
 <p>“Even the Pope isn’t willing to clash head-on against Nan Zhengtian?!” The elder exclaimed.</p>
 <p>“For now, Nan Zhengtian… is still the number one martial practitioner on the Land of Chaos.” Guan Xian also looked helpless.</p>
