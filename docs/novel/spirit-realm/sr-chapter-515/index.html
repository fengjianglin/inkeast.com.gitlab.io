 <p><b>Chapter 515: Leave!</b></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie stepped out of the ice and walked forward, shattering it to pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cold white mist wrapped around him like thick smoke, moving with him and spreading its icy energy into the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The extreme cold felt like icicles slowly sinking into everyone’s bodies, threatening to freeze their blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The martial practitioners of the three forces wore fearful expressions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them originally thought that Qin Lie had frozen to death… that his nightmarish oppression wouldn’t happen again. They hadn’t expected him to spring back to life before they could even finish making threats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Focusing their soul perceptions, the remaining martial practitioners of Black Voodoo Sect, the three great families, Celestial Artifact Sect, and Ten Thousand Beast Mountain were shocked to discover that the frost concept emanating from Qin Lie’s body felt extremely similar to the cold of the Forbidden Land of Ice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking amongst each other, they could see the shock in the eyes of those beside them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie didn’t cultivate a frost spirit art for fun—he was just as skilled with it as he was with his thunder spirit art!</span></p>
 <p><span style>His frost spirit art even resonated with the cold of the Forbidden Land of Ice!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just how absurd was this situation?</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of this stunned Huang Zhuli and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qin Lie?” Song Tingyu called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She and the rest of Qin Lie’s companions wore strange expressions, gazing at him with eyes full of questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Qin Lie exuded an extraordinarily intimidating presence. Continuously pulling in all of the surrounding icy energy, he seemed to be the source of all cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bizarre cracking sounds emanated from Qin Lie, echoing through the air. The sounds made it seem as if the whole world were going to freeze over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s eyes were a strange silvery white. They resembled clear, solid ice and gave off a cold, serene feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have all six Pure Soul Springs. What are you going to do about it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie marched through the thick snow, walking from Song Tingyu’s side until he stood directly in front of Ye Yihao and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wherever he moved, whatever snow he passed through, quickly grew colder, leaving a trail of ice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wisps of white frost energy hovered above his head like silver clouds, gently swirling around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh whoosh whoosh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gusts of frigid wind converged on this location from far in the distance, a harbinger for the flood of frost energy that seemed to be approaching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...” Ye Yihao was at a loss for words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked at Qin Lie, at how Qin Lie was controlling the entire situation yet again, and he felt as if he were back in the Forbidden Land of Thunder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And he wasn’t the only one. Huang Zhuli, Feng Yiyou, Yu Men, and the others gritted their teeth, their faces pale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s challenge made them secretly regret choosing to come here and cause trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Pure Soul Springs are in my possession. You want them?” Qin Lie took another step forward. “Come and get them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With this step, he was only ten meters away from Ye Yihao and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white mist swirling around his body slowly spread toward them, carrying a bone-chilling cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crack! Crack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Terrifying sounds came from the shields of light of martial practitioners from the three great families. They sounded like glass under an enormous pressure that threatened to crush them into powder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a sign that their shields of light could no longer endure the frost energy, threatening to collapse as the freezing energy spread.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Retreat!” Su Yan yelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her face was dark and hostile, but she moved backward, forcing herself to give the order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing her say this, the Su Family martial practitioners behind her secretly sighed in relief and hurriedly retreated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lin Family and Xiahou Family martial practitioners looked to Xiahou Yuan and Lin Dongxing at the same time, their eyes filled with desperation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the frost energy approaching, the shields of light protecting them were on the verge of failing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They wouldn’t be able to last much longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Retreat!” Xiahou Yuan and Lin Dongxing ordered in unison, each gritting their teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the martial practitioners of the three great families retreated, the crunch of their feet against the snow ringing sharply in everyone’s ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other martial practitioners on their side felt uneasy, anxious expressions surfacing on their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Qin Lie moved farther forward, reducing the distance between him and Ye Yihao to five paces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would soon reach Ye Yihao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want the Pure Soul Springs… why don’t you try taking them from me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s icy expression suddenly disappeared. His gaze became warm, his tone uncharacteristically peaceful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>—Yet the icy energy emanating from his body began to spread even faster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kra-kra-kra-krak—!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shields of light of other martial practitioners of the three forces began to fracture. They seemed like they would shatter at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you can’t endure any more of this...” Feng Yiyou yelled, “...then get back!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he was unwilling to back down from Qin Lie, Feng Yiyou was intelligent enough to know that he had to give the order.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Celestial Artifact Sect martial practitioners retreated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then everyone looked at Ye Yihao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Each of Qin Lie’s companions gazed at him with bright, energetic expressions, beaming smiles on their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Qin… really is a good man!” Pan Qianqian exclaimed, covering her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Moyan’s lips had long since curved into a beautiful smile. Her elation was obvious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The terrifying winds that wreak havoc across the Forbidden Land of Ice are converging here. They’re probably heading… for Qin Lie!” Huang Zhuli exclaimed, realization spread across her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment she said this, terror filled the hearts of everyone within earshot, especially Ye Yihao and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Move! Get farther away from Qin Lie!” Yu Men shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the martial practitioners from Ten Thousand Beast Mountain, including Yu Men himself, rushed backward, trying to distance themselves from Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The martial practitioners from Black Voodoo Cult pulled back, not bothering to wait for Huang Zhuli or Ye Yihao to issue orders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, only Huang Zhuli and Ye Yihao stood before Qin Lie. They had yet to move even a millimeter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their eyes, however, were filled with terror and hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fine,” Huang Zhuli eventually said. “We’ll leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She came to the conclusion that, even if they did fight Qin Lie, they probably wouldn’t benefit from it. It was possible that they would just suffer heavy losses again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>—And they couldn’t afford any more deaths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She finally decided to back down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to kill you!” Ye Yihao exclaimed, slowly emphasizing each word. “I, Ye Yihao, swear… that you will die by my hands!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Yihao moved backward as he spoke, glaring at Qin Lie the entire time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>—It was clear that he understood his current situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Qin Lie disagreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You think you can come and go as you please?” Qin Lie asked in a low tone. “Life isn’t that simple!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The instant he finished speaking, an earsplitting shriek pierced the surroundings. Streams of frost energy converged on their location, but upon arrival, they went eerily still.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huang Zhuli!” Qin Lie barked, his eyes dark and cold. “Hand over the Spring of Life that you stole from Xue Moyan! If you don’t, none of you will leave this place alive!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that declaration, the white mists of frost energy began to move once more, each resembling an icy dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Yihao and the others started to panic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they watched these strange changes occur in the wisps of frost energy, seeing how bizarre their movements were, it dawned on them that Qin Lie could control the frost energy of the Forbidden Land of Ice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them knew how terrifying the frost energy was. They also knew that the corpses they had come across on the way here belonged to scarlet and white barbarians that fell prey to the frost energy and died as a result.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A portion of their group had also been swallowed up by the frost energy. They hadn’t been able to keep their shields of light up long enough and collapsed shortly after being exposed to it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon seeing Qin Lie display a miraculous amount of control over the situation in the Forbidden Land of Ice, the people of Black Voodoo Cult felt extremely regretful. They cursed their bad eyesight and how they essentially came here in search of death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet Huang Zhuli was the one who felt the most bitter. She watched as the streams of misty frost energy writhed through the air, her face the epitome of regret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll count to three!” Qin Lie said, immediately starting the count. “One! Two! Thr—!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll give you the Spring of Life!” Huang Zhuli screamed. “All of it! Every last drop!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She trembled as she took a dark green bottle out of her spatial ring and threw it at Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie had nearly driven her mad, helplessness and defeat covering her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Never before had she been reduced to such a sorry state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Th-the Spring of Life!” Pan Qianqian exclaimed with joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Moyan stared at Qin Lie in disbelief. Emotions welled in her heart, her face positively glowing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under her gaze, Qin Lie leisurely caught the green bottle then threw it to her without hesitation, saying, “Inspect it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hurriedly received the green bottle, twisted the cork from its mouth, and took a whiff of the clear fragrance that emerged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” Xue Moyan said excitedly. “It is the Spring of Life!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie nodded slightly, then waved the three forces off with contempt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This angered Huang Zhuli and Ye Yihao so much, they gritted their teeth hard enough to nearly chip them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet they didn’t dare to act at this moment. They could only shoot poisonous glares at Qin Lie as they slowly retreated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re leaving!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>And just like that, the three forces turned tail and left.</span></p>
