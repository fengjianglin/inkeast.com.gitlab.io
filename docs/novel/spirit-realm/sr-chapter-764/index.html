 <p><b>Chapter 764: Schadenfreude</b></p>
 <p><span style>Riding on a Golden Winged Luan, Qin Lie descended on a sand hill situated at a hot desert.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was Jewel Flame Manor’s territory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was noon, and the sunlight shining down from above the sky made the place incredibly hot and stifling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow sand hills that were several hundred meters tall were scattered at various different places.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This damnable place is even hotter than it was before!” Chu Li wiped the sweat on his forehead and swore involuntarily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please tell everyone to come over for a moment.” Qin Lie said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s… everyone?” Shen Yue asked in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie cast a glance at the people who had gathered around him on their own accord.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Yue lowered her voice after being startled for a moment, “What are you trying to say? It’s best to keep your… special bloodline in wraps. It will draw a lot of trouble otherwise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She could sense an unusual tremor of energy and blood energy inside Qin Lie, and from that guess what Qin Lie was trying to do. She couldn’t help but remind him of the consequences.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will say that it is all the Demon Sealing Tombstone’s work,” Qin Lie had an answer to this since a long time ago, “I need a logical reason to explain why I can detect the foreign race and cause them to self combust anyway. This is the best way to keep their imagination from running wild.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Yue’s eyes glittered as she mulled over Qin Lie’s words seriously. A while later, she nodded slightly, “You are right. You do need a reason.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She knew that the thousands of Netherpassage, Fulfillment, Fragmentation, and Nirvana Realm martial practitioners of four great silver forces—Terminator Sect, Heavenly Sword Mountain, Ten Thousand Beast Mountain, and Celestial Artifact Sect—had to be puzzling over Qin Lie’s secrets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why could he cause some outsiders to self combust? Why could he detect their movements so accurately?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had to give a logical explanation eventually.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, the Demon Sealing Tombstone was a great excuse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Should I tell them to come over now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, wait. Give me another thirty seconds.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Sealing Tombstone appeared and stood vertically on a piece of sandstone. A lifeblood essence that looked as translucent as blood diamonds appeared from the cut skin at Qin Lie’s fingertip.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Yue stared deeply at the blood essence as excitement and anticipation rose silently from behind her pupils.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just when Qin Lie was about to drip that lifeblood essence onto the tombstone’s surface, he noticed her passionate gaze and was startled by it. He paused his movements and asked, “How did you know about my bloodline?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uncle Xu Ran told me about it.” Shen Yue answered carelessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie frowned again and asked, “He urged me repeatedly that day not to expose my bloodline to anyone. So why would he tell you this voluntarily?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m… a little special.” Shen Yue turned red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh?” Qin Lie’s eyes were filled with the desire to know.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll tell you someday. I’ll tell you the reason when you’ve... agreed to my request, and when we’ve… gotten together.” Shen Yue said in slightly embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie was finding the situation more and more queer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t push Shen Yue further seeing that she didn’t wish to explain things. He focused his mind once more and dripped the lifeblood essence onto the Demon Sealing Tombstone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s done.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll call them right away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Shen Yue left, her well-rounded figure seemed a little hasty and panicky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bastard! He just won’t let it go! And why is he so sensitive!” She cursed inwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Qin Lie is summoning us over?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll know once we head over!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before long, Bi You, He Yi, Tu Mou, ten unfamiliar Fragmentation and Nirvana realm martial practitioners, and special juniors such as Luo Chen, Du Xiangyang, Xue Moyan, Tian Yu and Luo Kexin had rushed over from the surroundings and gathered beside Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Demon Sealing Tombstone!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Yiyou and Yu Men exclaimed the moment they saw the object.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Naturally, they all noticed the Demon Sealing Tombstone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The older generation martial practitioners such as He Yi and Bi You instantly had their attention drawn towards the Demon Sealing Tombstone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, an image was appearing clearly above the blank tombstone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the image, many foreign clansmen were gathered at one place while engaged in what seemed like a discussion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They just couldn’t hear what they were actually talking about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is…” He Yi exclaimed in admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is a scene from the enemy’s closest gathering spot. They are currently discussing on how to fight us. You cannot hear their voices, but I can.” Qin Lie said calmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In reality, he could broadcast their voices from the Demon Sealing Tombstone if he wanted to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the great ghoul races’ clansmen were currently discussing about his bloodline and how best to eliminate the remnant of the Blaze Family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t want anyone to know about his bloodline, so of course he kept the sounds muffled and didn’t present the full details of the discussion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I obtained this Demon Sealing Tombstone from inside a God Corpse. It appears to be the key to the Graveyard of Gods, and the Graveyard of Gods is… related to the Heaven Fighting Race.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right now, a total of three races are invading the Land of Chaos. They are all part of the three great ghoul races, and they are called the Heaven Ghoul Race, the Blue Ghoul Race and the Earth Ghoul Race.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The three great ghoul races once ruled Spirit Realm alongside other powerful races such as the Giant Dragons, Ancient Beasts, Dark Nether Race and so on. However, the Heaven Fighting Race came and attempted to commit genocide, so they were forced to depart from Spirit Realm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When they left Spirit Realm, they were branded with a permanent mark by the Heaven Fighting Race experts. These marks contain a terrifying amount of energy and willpower that couldn’t be eliminated even though they had been corroding their bodies for over tens of thousand years.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This remains true even though thirty thousand years have passed since their return to Spirit Realm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Through the Demon Sealing Tombstone, I am able to detect the imprints inside their bodies and activate them at will!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie explained with a serious look on his face. Most of what he said was true, and he concealed only the matter of his bloodline.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the experts who had came over to listen to him were absolutely stunned by the revelation. They listened closely, afraid that they would miss out on a single sentence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone’s doubts were “solved” when he was done explaining. Plus, it was true that the Demon Sealing Tombstone played a major role in detecting the outsiders and burning them to death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are they right now?” He Yi asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd’s attention returned back to the Demon Sealing Tombstone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, a dozen or so three ghoul races’ clansmen were gathered in a dark underground palace. Judging from the palace’s structure, it was probably a building beneath a graveyard somewhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This place is the Absolute Yin Graveyard eight thousand kilometers away from us.” Chu Li frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was looking at him in astonishment when he said this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know that place from when I ventured across Prism Continent a long time ago. The Absolute Yin Graveyard is eternally enshrouded in dark and icy aura, and this aura is so strong that it stopped even sunlight from penetrating it.” Chu Li explained, “It is said that this Absolute Yin Graveyard is a place where Moon Worshipping Cult used to bury their dead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Moon Worshipping Cult?” Everyone’s faces turned a little unnatural at this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moon Worshipping Cult used to be a powerful Silver rank force on the Land of Chaos. At its peak, it was even stronger than the current Terminator Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Later on, Moon Worshipping Cult gradually declined due to an unknown reason. That was why Terminator Sect was able to replace them to become the new greatest power on the Heavenly Silence Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every older generation martial practitioner had heard of the infamous Moon Worshipping Cult before. They were both fearful and respectful of this evil cult.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This remained true even though Moon Worshipping Cult was gone since a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s nothing there. I once explored the place but found only many graves and some bones and corpses inside them.” Chu Li said uncaringly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s right. There are a thousand or so clansmen of the three great ghoul races that are gathered at the Absolute Yin Graveyard right now. Excluding the spatial rifts at the center of Prism Continent, it has the second greatest concentration of ghoul clansmen and is the closest place to our current location!” Qin Lie said affirmatively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are they trying to lay an ambush at the Absolute Yin Graveyard and attack us further?” Luo Kexin asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re still in discussion. Please wait while I listen in on them for a while longer.” Qin Lie narrowed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone fell silent and kept their mouths shut upon hearing this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were all staring at the scene happening above the Demon Sealing Tombstone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the scene eventually turned blurry until it faded away completely. Just as they grew anxious and was going to inquire deeper into the matter, they noticed that Qin Lie’s complexion looked odd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong?” Even Shen Yue couldn’t help but ask.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did they say?” Du Xiangyang asked anxiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Demon Sealing Tombstone can only spy on them for a fixed period of time. It can only be used again after a period of cooldown.” He put away the Demon Sealing Tombstone first before pondering for a moment. Finally, he spoke again, “We are not the only ones they’d engaged.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone subconsciously trembled and turned pale when they heard this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You mean?” He Yi’s lips shuddered slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie nodded, “The Earth Ghoul Race and Blue Ghoul Race are currently committing slaughter at two other places.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Which two places?” Luo Kexin screamed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anxiety piqued in everyone’s hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The cities of Sky Flame, the copper rank force situated at a corner of the Heavenly Slaughter Continent… is currently under attack by Blue Ghoul clansmen who descended from the sky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Moreover, Razed Desert, Black Jade City, Scattered Rain City, and Blue Flame City at the Heavenly Calamity Continent were ambushed by the Earth Ghoul Race. These forces suffered huge casualties and are in war right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie said as he looked at everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Surprisingly, He Yi, Tu Mou, Luo Kexin, Luo Chen and every other martial practitioner present in the area let out long sighs of relief upon realizing that the two battles had not happened on their territory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, Du Xiangyang was even revelling in those people’s misfortune, “Now Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families have no choice but to fight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not sure why, but I actually feel quite… happy to hear this!” Chu Li also let out an odd laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families are obviously planning to preserve their own strength while everyone else is fighting the three ghoul races. Hehe, now that the evil races have entered the Heavenly Calamity Continent, Black Voodoo Cult has no choice but to defend the three great families they view as their vassal forces!” Luo Kexin was also smiling slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was wearing a relaxed expression on their faces, and even the seniors such as He Yi, Bi You and Tu Mou were stroking their beards with odd expressions on their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Illusory Demon Sect was under attack too.” Xue Moyan suddenly said softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her words caused everyone to frown and fall silent. No one offered an opinion on this matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Moyan looked up and swept a glance across everyone with pure, bright eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked downcast upon doing so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn’t see a shred of worry or anxiety from these people’s eyes or faces at all. She could only see plain indifference.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She suddenly noticed that Shi Xiuling’s abrupt decision to back out of the operation had caused Illusory Demon Sect to be kicked out of this little alliance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, she turned to look at Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, there was only gravity and stern indifference in Qin Lie’s eyes. She couldn’t find a shred of pity for the Illusory Demon Sect in him at all.</span></p>
