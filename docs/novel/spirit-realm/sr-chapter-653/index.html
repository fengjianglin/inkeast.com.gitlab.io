 <p><strong>Chapter 653: A Conversation at Night</strong></p>
 <p><span>Blood Fiend Sect and Gold Sun Island quickly finished preparations.</span></p>
 <p><span>After all of the Miao Family members have been captured and tied up, two Flowing Gold Fire Phoenixes cried as they rose into the sky and flew away.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie was atop one of them.</span></p>
 <p><span>It was already dark. Mo Lingye and Mo Jun stood on the island and watched the phoenixes fly away. Their expressions were slightly darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Qin Lie is more mysterious than we all thought. Old Monster Terminator wants him alive, Duan Qianjie came in person, Li Mu is supporting him from the shadows.” Mo Jun’s gaze was deep. “His potential is unfathomable, while his origins are unknown. He is able to control the eight god corpses, and he also benefited tremendously in the Graveyard of Gods.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“What do you want to say?” Mo Lingye’s expression was cool.</span></p>
 <p><span>“While Qin Lie cultivates the Blood Spirit Art, he is not a member of Blood Fiend Sect.” Mo Jun sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Are you worried?” Mo Lingye frowned slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Not worried, more like slightly helpless. He cultivates the Blood Spirit Art and is familiar with the secret arts of Blood Fiend Sect yet he does not treat Blood Spirit Art as his main and only spirit art.” Mo Jun’s face was full of regret.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It is our good fortune he cultivates Blood Spirit Art and is willing to have a connection with Blood Fiend Sect.” After a moment of silence, Mo Lingye said seriously, “We have to treat him well, we cannot have him feel any hate towards Blood Fiend Sect, his friendship… is crucial for Blood Fiend Sect.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Mo Jun was silent.</span></p>
 <p><span>“My family owes him too much,” Mo Lingye said. “Without him, Xue Li would not have been able to break free. Without him, Moyan would have died in the Graveyard of Gods, and I… would not have been able to wake up.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“I understand,” Mo Jun said.</span></p>
 <p><span>On the wing of the Flowing Gold Fire Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie sat silently inside the wooden tower, his breathing stopped in the dark as he continued to adjust and recover his spirit power.</span></p>
 <p><span>He quickly slipped into the state of Thoughtless Tranquility.</span></p>
 <p><span>In that state, there were no stray thoughts or distractions in his mind. He seemed to be one with the world. The speed at which he gathered the spirit energy of the world was much faster.</span></p>
 <p><span>Threads of spirit energy came from all directions. They burrowed into the wooden tower and shrouded the area in mist making it appear like a divine realm.</span></p>
 <p><span>Time silently passed.</span></p>
 <p><span>A while later, Qin Lie opened his eyes which flashed with light.</span></p>
 <p><span>The faint spirit energy that shrouded the room suddenly scattered as his awakening forcibly ended the state of Thoughtless Tranquility.</span></p>
 <p><span>He probed himself with his mind consciousness and found that his nine natal palaces were filled with pure power of frost, thunder and earth and were on the verge of spilling out..</span></p>
 <p><span>Even his Soul Lake had grown slightly bigger, while his True Soul became even clearer and brighter.</span></p>
 <p><span>He suddenly had a feeling that his True Soul was about to come out of his body.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Going to reach a breakthrough again…” Qin Lie said to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span>He gradually realized that intense fighting and mad slaughter were effective ways of increasing his cultivation and strength.</span></p>
 <p><span>The “Limit Sublimation Art” was wondrous and was able to stimulate potential and cause oneself to transform.</span></p>
 <p><span>That transformation included spirit power, soul power, the body and all of the potential of life.</span></p>
 <p><span>In this battle, he had reached a state of being completely impoverished two times. After using the Limit Sublimation Art two times, he could clearly feel the indescribable benefits that this secret art gave to him.</span></p>
 <p><span>He eve felt as thtough the reason he had reached the doorway to Fulfillment Realm so quickly was due to the help of the Limit Sublimation Art.</span></p>
 <p><span>The reason he requested to come along on this trip to Blue Moon Valley was because he hoped that he could continue to fight, use up all of his power, and continue to cultivate the Limit Sublimation Art.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Setting Sun Islands and Blue Moon Valley were a fair distance apart. Qin Lie was not in a hurry and prepared to keep meditating to recover soul power.</span></p>
 <p><span>A ripple of soul vibration suddenly came from a distance, its source standing in front of his wooden tower.</span></p>
 <p><span>Due to his sensitive soul perception, even before the soul presence came near, he knew that the incomer was Xue Moyan.</span></p>
 <p><span>He waited for her to knock.</span></p>
 <p><span>Tens of seconds later, Xue Moyan still did not move. This surprised him.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Cough…” he suddenly coughed lightly.</span></p>
 <p><span>An alarmed expression appeared on Xue Moyan’s beautiful face. She almost cried out.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Does Senior Sister Xue have something to discuss with me?” Qin Lie said softly.</span></p>
 <p><span>As he spoke, Qin Lie came down from the wooden tower. He walked to the door and opened it to invite Xue Moyan in.</span></p>
 <p><span>Xue Moyan dressed in a pale green silk dress entered the room and her expression quickly calmed down. She said, “I came to thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Thank me for what?” Qin Lie smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Without you, my family would not have been able to reunite. WIthout you, it would have been very difficult for Blood Fiend Sect to overcome this obstacle,” Xue Moyan said sincerely.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I cultivate Blood Spirit Art. Also, back in the Scarlet Tide Continent, Elder Xue Li helped me many times. Truthfully… I also need to gather spirit materials, and Blood Fiend Sect can help me do it.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“If you want to gather spirit materials, you can take the remains of the ancient elites and go to Heavenly Sword Mountain or Terminator Sect to trade for them. I know both Li Mu and Forefather Terminator would be happy to see you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“That’s true. However, I’m too young and too weak. Even if I go to Terminator Sect and Heavenly Sword Mountain, I will not be treated with due respect or have a right to speak.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The reason that Qin Lie was willing to risk being grouped together with Blood Fiend Sect was because he cultivated Blood Spirit Art, and it had been known by people like Feng Yiyou and Yu Men. He could not separate himself from Blood Fiend Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span>Also, if he did go to Heavenly Sword Mountain and Terminator Sect, he would be just a junior with no right to speak, and he would have to rely on other people if he wanted to do anything.</span></p>
 <p><span>In Blood Fiend Sect, because of his connection to Xue Li, he was quite unrestrained. He had more freedom and more room for demands.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Junior Brother Qin, I…” Xue Moyan halted.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie’s expression was strange. “Senior Sister Xue, say what you need to, there is no need to stammer.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Your help to my family and Blood Fiend Sect is too great, so great… that Blood Fiend Sect and my family has no way to pay you back.” Xue Moyan bowed her head and didn’t dare to look at him. She said softly, “My mother and the Blood Fiend Ten Elders will do all they can to hold onto you and pull you closer to Blood Fiend Sect. Knowing them, I think that they will try to hold you through a marriage, that is, a marriage between me and you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie stilled.</span></p>
 <p><span>“You already have Sister Tingyu and I heard from Sister Tingyu you also have Miss Ling Yushi.” Xue Moyan’s face flushed slightly as she said, “I do not want to damage the relationship between you all, and I do not want to become the third person, so I hope…”</span></p>
 <p><span>“I understand.” Qin Lie nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Also, I too have someone I am interested in. I do not want to become a tool of the sect, and I also do not want to see you controlled by the sect with this method,” Xue Moyan said softly.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Don’t worry, if they really make this suggestion, I will refuse,” Qin Lie said coolly.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Thank you.” Xue Moyan sighed in relief.</span></p>
 <p><span>……</span></p>
