 <p><strong>Chapter 112: I Will Kill You!</strong></p>
 <p>“Boom!”</p>
 <p>A thunderous boom suddenly exploded out.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie abruptly rushed out to the center and forcefully rammed into Du Heng and Wei Li’s group with lightning and thunder wildly discharging from his entire body.</p>
 <p>Du Heng and Wei Li were knocked away in an instant. Electricity flowed throughout their bodies, and their hairs were burnt black. Even their clean, white faces were now completely black.</p>
 <p>Chu Peng laid feebly on the ground in a pool of blood, but his eyes were filled with unforgettable hatred.</p>
 <p>“Out of the way!”</p>
 <p>Tu Ze, Zhuo Qian, and Kang Zhi roared as they attacked Liu Ting and her people with brutal expressions.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie lowered his head and glanced once at Chu Peng. Then, he stared at Du Heng and Wei Li before rushing out into the open. From his lap he took out the wooden sculpture with his right hand and channeled his energy at Du Heng and his group.</p>
 <p>“Zzt Zzzt Zzzt!”</p>
 <p>Blazing, chaotic thunder and lightning gathered to form many thumb-sized electrical snakes, all rushing in unison at Du Heng and Wei Li’s chests.</p>
 <p>They writhed and couldn’t help but screech in pain the moment they were struck by the electrical snakes.</p>
 <p>“You dare?!” Liu Ting screeched, “Qin Lie, you still dare to defy us even at this moment, do you really want to die?!”</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie!”</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie!”</p>
 <p>Both Tu Ze and Zhuo Qian’s expression changed, and they cried out in a hurry the moment they saw his crazed expression.</p>
 <p>Kang Zhi and Han Feng glanced at each other once before they rushed to Qin Lie’s sides and stopped him with everything they had. They were afraid that Qin Lie really would kill both Du Heng and Wei Li at this point in time.</p>
 <p>Du Heng and Wei Li had not broken through to the Natal Opening Realm. If Qin Lie were to unleash everything he had, there was no way they could endure it. They would be beaten to death alive.</p>
 <p>Right now, Dark Asura Hall’s First Hall Master, Yuan Tianya, was just inside the pavilion, and Liu Yuntao, Du Haitian, and Wei Xing were now in power.</p>
 <p>If Qin Lie had killed Du Heng and Wei Li, there was no way he could survive. He would be condemned with felony and killed by the pavilion; there was no way he would be spared.</p>
 <p>Tu Ze and the rest knew that the Ling Family’s death had caused a terrible hatred to be barely repressed inside Qin Lie heart. They were afraid that Qin Lie would also lose control and become as hysterical as Chu Peng was. That was why they were all anxious.</p>
 <p>Zhuo Qian could no longer be bothered with Liu Ting as she quickly went to stop Qin Lie and held him back in a death grip. She said in a low tone, “You must not be rash. Right now, the heads of each side is right inside the pavilion. It will not benefit us to cause trouble.”</p>
 <p>“Kang Zhi, Hang Feng. Quickly, take Chu Peng away and give him medical treatment!” Tu Ze yelled.</p>
 <p>Kang Zhi and Han Feng hurriedly carried the bloodied Chu Peng with them and left the area first.</p>
 <p>“Zzzt Zzzt Zzzt.”</p>
 <p>Lightning jumped erratically on both Du Heng and Wei Li’s body, and as if under a chill, their bodies shivered from time to time. Their eyes were filled with shock and horror.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on?” Du Haitian walked out of the Procedural Hall as he stared at the people coldly. “What the hell are you people doing? We have an important guest today. Why are you arguing at such a time?”</p>
 <p>Inside the Procedural Hall, both Tu Mo and Han Qingrui had also received the news, but because Yuan Tianya was around, they could not move away. They had no choice but to accompany him.</p>
 <p>It was still a day or two before Discipline Hall Elder, Ye Yangqiu, could return. Therefore, the Discipline Hall members remaining inside the Pavilion did not dare to interfere with Tu Ze and Liu Ting’s conflict. They could only pretend not to see them despite hearing about the fight. They had even all temporarily hid themselves.</p>
 <p>That was why Du Haitian had become the one to step forth.</p>
 <p>“Chu Peng had suddenly tried to kill us from inside the crowd while there were many people.” Liu Ting’s bright eyes were ice cold as she explained, “Du Heng had been stabbed from behind. If it weren’t for the heart protection armor Du Heng was wearing, his heart might have been pierced.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you uncle for the heart protection armor you gifted me. Otherwise, I would already be dead.”</p>
 <p>Du Heng faced the crowd with his back. His shirt was torn where his heart was, and there was silver armor about the size of a bronze mirror on his back. It had defended him against Chu Peng’s attacks.</p>
 <p>Du Haitian’s expression darkened. “Where is Chu Peng?”</p>
 <p>“Elder Du, it’s like this…” Someone explained from beside him, “Tu Ze rushed over and ended the fight between the two sides. The severely injured Chu Peng had been carried away.”</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie had rushed over and fought against Du Heng and Wei Li, but Tu Ze and the others had stopped him.”</p>
 <p>“Du Heng and Wei Li had only taken some small losses. It was nothing serious. This is just an argument among juniors, surely there is no need to make a big fuss about it?”</p>
 <p>“……”</p>
 <p>There were also people discussing at the sides and explaining the matter from beginning to the end. They all hoped that the matter would be settled peacefully.</p>
 <p>Du Haitian’s expression was unpleasant as he looked towards Tu Ze and Zhuo Qian before reprimanding them with a frown, “Hall Master Yuan from Dark Asura Hall had personally arrived today. I can’t believe the few of you are so insensible as to act as recklessly as Chu Peng.”</p>
 <p>Tu Ze and Zhuo Qian simply frowned without a word.</p>
 <p>He looked towards Qin Lie and humphed coldly. “Wherever you are there will always be trouble. Qin Lie, you better know your place in Nebula Pavilion, or else…”</p>
 <p>“Or else what?” Qin Lie lifted his head with just as cold an expression.</p>
 <p>“You know on the inside what will happen.” A killing intent flashed before Du Haitian’s eyes as he said in a dark tone, “This is it for the day. Disperse. You all had better not cause anymore trouble.”</p>
 <p>The few martial practitioners under his command began yelling and broke up the crowd. Soon, there were no third party remained in this area.</p>
 <p>At this moment Du Haitian had walked up right in front of Qin Lie. Standing face to face with Qin Lie he said in a low tone, “I will always have a way to kill whoever I want. Even if Ling Yushi and Ling Xuanxuan have joined Jiu Liuyu’s sect, I will still kill the entire Ling Family. What can the sisters possibly do to me?”</p>
 <p>Although he had lowered his voice, both Tu Ze and Zhuo Qian at the side could still hear what he said. Both of them turned frigid the moment they heard his words.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Liu Ting, Du Heng, and Wei Li turned spirited as chilly smiles broke out on their faces.</p>
 <p>“I will kill you,” uttered Qin Lie as he grit his teeth.</p>
 <p>“You?” Du Haitian laughed devilishly. “I can guarantee you that you won’t live over a month if you continue to stay inside Icestone City! One after another, you will die just like the remaining Ling Family clansmen.”</p>
 <p>Once finished, he walked passed Qin Lie and said, “Disperse. We shall wait for Discipline Hall’s Ye Yangqiu to settle Chu Peng’s error today.”</p>
 <p>Liu Ting, Du Heng, and Wei Li followed behind him with cold laughter as they left.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie continued to stand in the same spot with a dark face. The killing intent in his eyes looked like it was about to gush out at any moment.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie, once Liu Yuntao has taken over Nebula Pavilion, you must leave immediately.” Zhuo Qian exclaimed and walked over while saying, “You absolutely must not stay here any longer!”</p>
 <p>“You have to go! If Du Haitian dares to threaten you so brazenly, then he will definitely attempt to kill you. You cannot stay still and do nothing!” seriously exclaimed Tu Ze. “You should go to Li’s Shop as soon as possible and do your best not to leave Commerce Street. You musn’t give Du Haitian the opportunity to act against you!”</p>
 <p>Even the two of them had not expected Du Haitian to be so brazen as to claim that he would kill Qin Lie and the entire Ling Family right in front of their faces.</p>
 <p>It was also at this moment that they suddenly realized that the power balance in Nebula Pavilion had already shifted towards Liu Yuntao’s side, following the fact that Du Haitian and Liu Yuntao had grown closer to the First Hall Master, Yuan Tianya.</p>
 <p>“I’m going to turn in the rest of my contribution points for spirit stones,” said Qin Lie after a moment of silence.</p>
 <p>“Good, that’s what you should do. It’s good that you can figure it out.” Tu Ze consoled him, “While there's life, there's hope. When your cultivation realm is powerful and you’ve entered a high level force, it will not be difficult to deal with a character such as Du Haitian. The power balance is on his side now, so there is no reason to fight him to the death. This will not benefit you in anyway.”</p>
 <p>“You should leave soon. You can’t stay in Nevula Pavilion any longer,” added on Zhuo Qian.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie did not answer. He merely went to the stockroom and traded in the rest of his contribution points for spirit stones.</p>
 <p>Then, he went back to his own house and took out the remaining three Terminator Profound Bombs. Forcing himself to calm down, he began inscribing the first spirit diagram for the Terminator Profound Bomb.</p>
 <p>Amazingly, his inscription this time had gone extremely smoothly, and he was not hindered in the least.</p>
 <p>Inside the Terminator Profound Bomb, the jumping light spots glittered and agilely wriggled forward, drawing a complex and wonderful diagram network.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!”</p>
 <p>Circles of blue light were abruptly discharged from the round, walnut-sized balls. A crackle of thunder resounded faintly from inside the ball-shaped Terminator Profound Bomb.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie abruptly withdrew himself as an odd light flashed across his eyes, and in a low tone, he exclaimed, “I actually I did it!”</p>
 <p>With the core spirit diagram on the inside, the Terminator Profound Bomb emitted blue light. It was cool to touch and felt just a tad heavier than before...</p>
 <p>“Let’s continue!” After playing with it for a while, he took out a new Terminator Profound Bomb and continued inscribing.</p>
 <p>Two days later.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh Whoosh!”</p>
 <p>Three Terminator Profound Bombs let out an faint blue flash from atop the wooden table. When he touched them, he could feel the thunderous waves suppressed inside the ball-shaped objects.</p>
 <p>It was already late at night, and the surroundings were quiet, so Qin Lie leaned against the window while pondering for a moment.</p>
 <p>He quietly got up, stealthily made his way to the sealed Artifact Forging Hall and snuck inside the empty hall.</p>
 <p>All of the cupboards inside the hall had been sealed, and there were no longer any usable spirit materials to be seen. The only thing left was the central furnace that was too big to get rid of.</p>
 <p>With excited light shining out of Qin Lie’s eyes, he injected the power of thunder and lightning into a Terminator Profound Bomb in his hand. The power slipped into the thunder ball and was conducted inside the Amplification spirit diagram through the Spirit Gathering spirit diagram. It was then cycled inside the Amplification spirit diagram again and again...</p>
 <p>Gradually, the thunder energy within the Terminator Profound Bomb become more and more frantic!</p>
 <p>Holding the Terminator Profound Bomb, he could feel the thunder energy inside growing more and more violent as it was amplified!</p>
 <p>A stroke of thunder and lightning energy had activated the spirit diagram inside the Terminator Profound Bomb. It activated the Ice Soul Python’s beast core and gathered the thunder energy into one, then cycled it continuously inside the Amplification spirit diagram.</p>
 <p>With every cycle, the thunder energy inside would double in power and become just a tad more violent.</p>
 <p>After a few cycles, the transformed thunder energy inside the Terminator Profound Bomb gushed like the flood towards the Spirit Storage diagram’s entrance.</p>
 <p>Just as the raging thunder energy was about to enter the Spirit Storage diagram, Qin Lie quickly threw the Terminator Profound Bomb into the large furnace before hastily closing the furnace with its cover.</p>
 <p>Then, he immediately retreated backwards.</p>
 <p>He moved all the way until he was outside the Artifact Forging Hall, and only after he put a few meters of distance between them, did he begin to count.</p>
 <p>“One, two, three…”</p>
 <p>“BOOM!”</p>
 <p>When he counted to five, a deafening explosion roared into existence, and that furnace which Yao Tai had thought of like a treasure but could not take away suddenly exploded into a million pieces.</p>
 <p>The shrapnel from the furnace that had shot out after the explosion blasted dozens of fist-sized holes around the Artifact Forging Hall, and it had jolted every martial practitioner awake.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie stood outside the Artifact Forging Hall and watched the shattered furnace inside through these holes. Finally, after a few seconds, he left with a slightly pale expression.</p>
