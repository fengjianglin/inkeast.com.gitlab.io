 <p><strong>Chapter 417: Things Unknown</strong></p>
 <p>Five days later.</p>
 <p>The floating island moved toward the islands in the sea below at a steady rate.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie and the others had taken five days of rest on the floating island. Each of them honed themselves, using the spirit stones, pills, and medicines to get in their best condition.</p>
 <p>They did not need to worry that others would spy on them here, so Qin Lie dared to cultivate the Blood Spirit Art and tried to use the strange methods recorded in the Blood Codex.</p>
 <p>“Your token was obtained from a dead Xiahou Family member. The Xiahou Family could recognize you. In order to avoid unnecessary trouble, do not be in a hurry to enter. Wait for the participants of the Xiahou Family, the Lin Family, and the Su Family to enter before you,” Li Mu said softly.</p>
 <p>“Wouldn’t they be mistakenly believed to have cultivated the Blood Spirit Art, Uncle Li?” Qin Lie asked.</p>
 <p>Song Tingyu and the others had been staying with Feng Rong. Feng Rong’s Blood Spirit Art had been discovered, so Song Tingyu and the others might be considered remnants of Blood Fiend Sect.</p>
 <p>“It’s fine.” Li Mu smiled. “They haven’t really cultivated the Blood Spirit Art. If they can come out of the secret realm alive, they will be qualified to enter Heavenly Sword Mountain. The three great families on the Heavenly Calamity Continent naturally wouldn’t dare to say more.”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie nodded.</p>
 <p>A short while later, the floating island came to be suspended above a part of the sea. Qin Lie and the others looked down and saw the island they had once left.</p>
 <p>Many youths were gathered in the south side of the island. They all seemed alert and in peak condition.</p>
 <p>The people of Celestial Artifact Sect and Ten Thousand Beast Mountain in the same area were shouting something, seemingly maintaining order.</p>
 <p>At dusk, an enormous whirlpool suddenly appeared in the water south of the island.</p>
 <p>Bright lightning could seen in the depths of the whirlpool. The whirlpool was deep, and there was no telling where it led.</p>
 <p>“That is the entrance,” Li Mu said with narrowed eyes.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie and the others became alert. They examined the entrance intensely and prepared.</p>
 <p>“Do not rush. Let other people enter first. This entrance will be open for two hours,” Li Mu reassured them.</p>
 <p>Everyone calmed down.</p>
 <p>“There is something you need to remember. Even if all of you go in together, you might not be together when you reach the Graveyard of Gods,” Li Mu warned them, suddenly remembering something important. “In other words, every participant can be thrown to different parts of the secret realm the moment they enter. The moment the four of you enter, there is a possibility that you will be separated. It would not be a surprise for you to end up tens of thousands of kilometers apart.”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie was shocked.</p>
 <p>“The sword tokens that Heavenly Sword Mountain forged can detect each other within a distance of fifty kilometers. This was done to make it convenient for the participants to communicate.” Li Mu explained the feature of the sword tokens. “You can only find other members of Heavenly Sword Mountain that are within fifty kilometers of you. However, Luo Chen is the leader of Heavenly Sword Mountain’s participants. This was done to make it easy for Luo Chen to gather everyone. In light of that, the people that you detect within fifty kilometers of you might not be you four.”</p>
 <p>Li Mu frowned and then said, “Oh, that’s not exactly right. Gao Yu has a token from the Xiahou Family. After you enter, it would best for you to immediately throw the token away. Otherwise, the Xiahou family will target you.”</p>
 <p>Gao Yu nodded slightly.</p>
 <p>“The rest of you...” Li Mu looked at Qin Lie, Song Tingyu, and Xie Jingxuan. After a moment of thought, he gravely suggested, “It would best for you three to also throw away the tokens after you enter.”</p>
 <p>“Why?” Xie Jingxuan asked.</p>
 <p>“To lessen the risk.” Li Mu sighed and said, “The nine great Silver rank forces forged similar tokens that can communicate with each other. This has it benefits, but also has its disadvantages...”</p>
 <p>After pausing for a moment, he continued to explain, “Since people like Ye Yihao of Black Voodoo Cult, Xue Moyan of Illusory Demon Sect, Chu Li of Terminator Sect, and others are strong enough, they will take the tokens after killing martial practitioners of other forces. They will have tokens from various factions and try to sense their targets within the Graveyard of Gods. They will constantly eliminate others and decrease the number of participants inside.</p>
 <p>“In the end, the strongest participant will have tokens from the nine forces and use them to find prey. If you have tokens, they will be able to track you within fifty kilometers and kill you.</p>
 <p>“Unless you are confident that you can fight them, throw away your tokens after entering. Find a remote place and hide. If you are not found in one year, you will be considered to have successfully survived and will receive a reward when you come out.”</p>
 <p>“I’m not going in to hide.” Qin Lie shook his head.</p>
 <p>“Neither am I,” Gao Yu declared.</p>
 <p>The two of them belonged to the group of participants with the lowest realms, yet their eyes flashed with viciousness and ambition.</p>
 <p>This made Li Mu smile, shake his head, and laugh. “Two people who are unfamiliar with the world.”</p>
 <p>“How large is the Graveyard of Gods?” Song Tingyu suddenly asked.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know. No one knows.” Li Mu thought to himself and then said, “If you go in and walk through all of the Graveyard of Gods, maybe you’ll find out.”</p>
 <p>“What about the previous secret realms?” she asked.</p>
 <p>“Some were as large as the Scarlet Tide Continent, others were as small as an island. There were also those that were bigger than the Land of Chaos.” Li Mu’s eyes narrowed and his expression became grim. “Remember! Everything about this secret realm is unknown. The only person who has entered before has already died, and his soul was destroyed. Those with high realms are restricted from entering and cannot even detect anything with their souls!”</p>
 <p>Li Mu took a deep breath. “Highly intelligent races and powerful beasts might be in there!”</p>
 <p>When these words were spoken, everyone paled and looked terrified.</p>
 <p>“In the past, the Land of Chaos found a passageway to a secret realm and they held a Trial. The end result was the death of every participant.” Li Mu grimaced and sighed deeply. He said, “That secret realm was the present Asura Realm.”</p>
 <p>“The Asura Realm that just formed an alliance with Terminator Sect?” Song Tingyu shrieked.</p>
 <p>Li Mu nodded.</p>
 <p>“Heavens!” Song Tingyu gaped.</p>
 <p>There were many spatial passageways in the Land of Chaos that led to different sub worlds.</p>
 <p>Asura Realm was like the Cloud Realm that the Gray Wing Race lived in. It was a separate sub world that the extremely bloodthirsty, vicious Asura Race lived in.</p>
 <p>Seven hundred years ago, the Asura Race invaded the Land of Chaos. The great Silver rank forces banded together to fight back and both sides paid a heavy price.</p>
 <p>In the end, Forefather Terminator of Terminator Sect used the combined apocalyptic power of nine terrifying Terminator Profound Bombs to destroy the strongest invaders of the Asura Race. This was a heavy blow to the Asura Race, and they were forced to make a non-aggression pact with the Land of Chaos.</p>
 <p>This was similar to how Qin Lie had used the Terminator Profound Bombs in the past, killing the strongest of the five Copper rank forces.</p>
 <p>The Asura Race respected those that were stronger than them. They feared the Terminator Profound Bombs of Forefather Terminator. Rather than holding a grudge, they instead sought out Forefather Terminator and requested an alliance with Terminator Sect who desired a business relationship.</p>
 <p>Terminator Sect became powerful through the rare spirit materials that flowed to them through the Asura Race from the Asura Realm. This single sect controlled an entire continent—the Heavenly Silence Continent.</p>
 <p>“Asura Realm was the secret realm for the Trial after it was discovered?” Xie Jingxuan’s gaze became complex.</p>
 <p>“Yes. Many great people were among those that participated then. There were even people that were stronger than me. It’s a pity that their luck wasn’t good. They didn’t even manage to last three months before they were all killed.” Li Mu sighed. “The Asura Race managed to force them to reveal the spatial passageway that led to the Land of Chaos, invading and creating a storm of blood.”</p>
 <p>“I hope that we won’t be that unlucky.” Song Tingyu could only pray on the inside.</p>
 <p>“That usually isn’t the case. However, the Graveyard of Gods is also wondrous. Be careful after entering. If you encounter highly intelligent races that are alive... then flee as far as possible,” Li Mu reminded them with good intentions.</p>
 <p>Everyone went silent.</p>
 <p>“I’ve said what needs to be said. I can only wish you good luck in surviving. The time is about right, you can enter.” Li Mu manipulated the floating island. This island slowly descended from the clouds.</p>
 <p>“The floating island! Are you Elder Li Mu of Heavenly Sword Mountain?” someone on the island below shouted.</p>
 <p>“Mn, I’m sending off some people who are participating in the Trial.” Li Mu smiled.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie and the others took out their tokens and raised their hands.</p>
 <p>That person looked at the token Gao Yu had. Curiosity showed on his face, but he did not say anything. “You are the only ones remaining. Please enter as soon as possible so I can seal the passageway from the outside.”</p>
 <p>“Go,” Li Mu urged.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie and the others jumped directly into the spatial passageway and disappeared.</p>
