 <p><b>Chapter 208: A Word for Love</b></p>
 <p>Lang Xie’s strength was deeply imprinted into everyone’s minds. Even Eight Extreme Temple and Profound Heaven Alliance were wary of him.</p>
 <p>When those two forces decided to act against Armament Sect, they understood that Lang Xie would be a potential threat. They had to take care of Lang Xie before they would have a good chance of being able to invade Armament Sect .</p>
 <p>Therefore, Lang Xie was lured to where Blood Shadow, Liang Yangzu, Di Shijiu, and Yuan Tianya were. Liang Yangzu, Di Shijiu, and Yuan Tianya were going to team up and kill Lang Xie together.</p>
 <p>But Lang Xie actually broke free from the trap!</p>
 <p>After that, Di Shijiu pursued Lang Xie to try to eliminate Lang Xie.</p>
 <p>From Yuan Tianya and the others’ point of view, with Eight Extreme Temple’s Tu Xi and Di Shijiu, Lang Xie was fated to die.</p>
 <p>But right now, Lang Xie was standing in front of them covered in blood, and the head of Tu Xi, who they were counting on, was rolling on the ground right next to their feet.</p>
 <p>Tu Xi was in the early stage of the Fulfillment Realm, yet he had died such a horrific death even with Di Shijiu helping him. Just how strong was Lang Xie?</p>
 <p>The three masterminds, Shi Jingyun, Wu Tuo, and Su Ziying, now had ugly expressions and became silent.</p>
 <p>“So interesting! Haha! Interesting!” Xue Li, whose body was covered in green feathers, suddenly grinned at Lang Xie with a pleased expression. “Not bad, not bad! He is able to cultivate the incomplete blood spirit art to such a degree with such a heterogeneous mix of blood in his body, yet has not gone crazy and maintained his intelligence. Hah, commendable!”</p>
 <p>He didn’t disguise his admiration of Lang Xie at all.</p>
 <p>Lang Xie’s expression was dark, and he did not respond; instead, he walked next to Ying Xingran, bowed, and then said, “Greetings, Sect Master.”</p>
 <p>“Good! As expected, you did not let us down, you’ve returned!” Ying Xingran exclaimed excitedly.</p>
 <p>“Di Shijiu?” Feng Rong inserted.</p>
 <p>“Di Shijiu was heavily wounded and fled.” As Lang Xie spoke, the beads of blood on him slowly merged back into his body.</p>
 <p>Every time a bead of blood disappeared into his skin, a hint of blood would appear on Lang Xie’s face and the bloody light in his eyes would grow brighter.</p>
 <p>When Shi Jingyun, Wu Tuo, and Su Ziying looked at him, they felt the pressure increase even further. At this time, the martial practitioners that had come from Dark Asura Hall were being crazily massacred by a blood man.</p>
 <p>A massacre in which they had no power to fight back!</p>
 <p>Liang Yangzu had secretly cultivated the blood spirit art for more than three decades and reached the late stage of the Netherpassage Realm. In the last two years, he survived by drinking the blood of others and the level You Hongzhi’s had reached in the past.</p>
 <p>You Hongzhi had been ghastly and inhuman at his peak. Even though he had started to drink human blood and eat human flesh, his combat strength was the strongest of everyone around!</p>
 <p>Lang Xie, Feng Yong, Ying Xingran, and the three reverends had to use a slow-acting poison to corrode his body and mind in order to kill him, and they also had to mount a surprise attack when he was cultivating and unguarded…</p>
 <p>It was clear from this just how terrifying You Hongzhi had been at the time.</p>
 <p>The present Liang Yangzu had reached the terrifying level that You Hongzhi had been at and cultivated the incomplete blood spirit art to a twisted extreme!</p>
 <p>The blood slave that was formed from his lifeblood essence could kill Yuan Tianya in a short period of time after being powered up by Xue Li. One could only imagine the damage that it could do to Yuan Tianya’s commanders!</p>
 <p>A streak of bloody light flew around those Dark Asura Hall martial practitioners. Wherever the bloody light passed, the Dark Asura Hall martial practitioners wailed and cried. Their blood was being pulled by what seemed to be a magnetic force which caused their bodies to explode.</p>
 <p>They could not stop their own blood from going crazy!</p>
 <p>As the martial practitioners exploded one after another, more fresh blood fell to the ground. That blood man swept over the bloody puddles and sucked up all the blood. Its bloody energy fluctuation did not decrease at all.</p>
 <p>Xue Li laughed strangely, “As long as the blood slave continuously consumes fresh blood, it can absorb power from the blood and lengthen its existence.”</p>
 <p>He looked at Shi Jingyun and the others as he asked Qin Lie, “Capture or kill?”</p>
 <p>“Lord Lang Xie, what do you think?” Qin Lie hesitated.</p>
 <p>“Capture alive, and demand a high price in exchange!” Lang Xie’s expression was dark, and a bloody light flashed in his eyes. “Our Armament Pavilions are spread out in the cities of the five major factions, and many of our people are there. Right now, they are being imprisoned. I need a few people alive to trade for the safety of our members.”</p>
 <p>“Seize them!” Qin Lie announced.</p>
 <p>Xue Li grinned widely.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh whoosh whoosh!”</p>
 <p>Thick, long chains marked with blood suddenly shot out of the spirit pattern pillars behind Qin Lie like bloody pythons.</p>
 <p>Those were the chains that were imprisoning Xue Li’s true body!</p>
 <p>Eleven chains, dripping in blood moved through the air. It caused the air everywhere to be filled with the terrifying and thick fiendish aura of blood. Armament City seemed to have been swallowed up by a bloody serpent!</p>
 <p>The blood fiend aura instantly covered the entire city and caused the sky to change color.</p>
 <p>It was as though the clear blue sky had been dyed dark red. Even the strong light of the sun was blocked by the bloody color, unable to pierce through.</p>
 <p>A restlessness, bloodthirsty, frenzied, and violent aura spread from the plaza into every corner of Armament City!</p>
 <p>“Crack crack crack! Crack crack crack!”</p>
 <p>The thick blood-stained chains coiled around Shi Jingyun, Wu Tuo, and Su Ziying like enormous serpents and tied them to the spirit pattern pillars.</p>
 <p>The moment the chains flew out, Shi Jingyun, Wu Tuo, and Su Ziying paled and realized the enormous difference in power between them and Xue Li almost instantaneously.</p>
 <p>So they did not try to resist.</p>
 <p>“Leave Shi Jingyun, Wu Tuo, and Su Ziying, you can kill everyone else,” Lang Xie said.</p>
 <p>Once the words came out, the trio that was tied to the spirit pattern pillars started to shout furiously.</p>
 <p>Lu Li, Ling Yushi, Ling Xuanxuan, Pang Feng, and the other people who came from the five factions had ashen faces as though they were seeing death just around the corner.</p>
 <p>“Lang Xie?” Ying Xingran’s expression changed slightly.</p>
 <p>Luo Zhichang and the other two reverends also frowned.</p>
 <p>They didn’t dare to be too harsh. They were still afraid of retaliation from Eight Extreme Temple and Profound Heaven Alliance.</p>
 <p>“They have to pay a price.” Lang Xie narrowed his eyes and said, “Sixteen Blood Knives, Seven Great Blood Spears!”</p>
 <p>Nine martial practitioners dressed in blood robes came out of the shadows. These nine people were covered in blood, many of them without limbs, and had bloody holes in them that still had blood seeping out of them.</p>
 <p>Lang Xie had personally picked the Sixteen Blood Knives and Seven Great Blood Spears and had trained them personally. All of them had experienced blood and battle and were strong people who climbed out of piles of corpses.</p>
 <p>Yet there were only six of the Sixteen Blood Knives left and three of the Seven Great Blood Spears remaining.</p>
 <p>“In this battle, almost seventy percent of Blood Spear’ martial practitioners died!” Lang Xie stared hard at Shi Jingyun, Wu Tuo, and Su Ziying with red eyes. “Should they not pay a price?”</p>
 <p>Ying Xingran was silent.</p>
 <p>The three great reverends sighed and shook their heads. They did not try to stop Lang Xie anymore.</p>
 <p>“Kill! Kill these culprits!” Tong Jihua shouted angrily.</p>
 <p>“Kill! Kill! Kill!” the remaining six Blood Blades and the three Blood Spears shouted together.</p>
 <p>A thick smell of blood came from the bodies of these nine. They approached Lu Li, Ling Yushi, and the others.</p>
 <p>“Woosh woosh woosh! Clang-clang-clang!”</p>
 <p>The thick chains that were from Xue Li’s actual body swam in the air and slithered on the ground like enormous pythons on the prowl in search of a new target.</p>
 <p>When the chains slithered near the five factions’ martial practitioners, those people had white faces and did not dare to move.</p>
 <p>Xue Li looked at Qin Lie. “Kid, what do you think?”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie’s expression was dark. He looked at Lu Li, Ling Yushi, Ling Xuanxuan, and Pang Feng.</p>
 <p>Pang Feng’s face was dark. He stood as straight as a boulder, and when Qin Lie looked over, he chose to meet Qin Lie’s gaze.</p>
 <p>He looked at Qin Lie and then looked at Ling Yushi and Ling Xuanxuan. His gaze was very strange…</p>
 <p>Of everyone here, he was the only one who knew Qin Lie’s true identity. He knew of the connection between Qin Lie and Ling Yushi, so he was very curious what Qin Lie would do.</p>
 <p>Because among the people that Lang Xie wanted to kill, there was Qin Lie’s former fiancée, the person Qin Lie loved!</p>
 <p>“What will you do?” Pang Feng thought inside.</p>
 <p>“Kill or not?” Xue Li looked at Qin Lie and asked impatiently.</p>
 <p>The only opinion he cared about was Qin Lie’s.</p>
 <p>Because Qin Lie had imprisoned half of his soul.</p>
 <p>“Little sis, I had not expected something like this to happen. I just wanted to come watch,” Ling Yushi suddenly gripped Ling Xuanxuan’s hand.</p>
 <p>The sisters’ hands were trembling. They did not want to die.</p>
 <p>But this kind of situation was not something they could prevent. Here, in the eyes of Lang Xie and the Blood Spear martial practitioners, they were just lambs—lambs to the slaughter.</p>
 <p>“Sis, do you regret leaving Ling Town? Do you regret… leaving Qin Lie?” Ling Xuanxuan asked in a small voice.</p>
 <p>“He was the one who sent us away. He said he would come find me, he promised me, but he didn’t come…” Ling Yushi’s eyes turned red. She started to feel hopeless. “I’m afraid that I cannot wait for him to find me.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, she really felt regret. She regretted leaving Ling Town, regretted leaving Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>If she could return to three years ago, she would have not listened to Qin Lie. She would have persisted in staying with Qin Lie in Ling Town.</p>
 <p>“He has already done enough for our Ling Family,” Ling Xuanxuan said serenely.</p>
 <p>“Mn, I owe him this entire life. I had thought to slowly pay him back, but now… I probably won’t have the chance. In the next life, I will repay what I owe him in my next life…” Ling Yushi’s expression was helpless.</p>
 <p>“I don’t care about anyone else, but I want these two sisters alive!”</p>
 <p>At this time, Qin Lie suddenly pointed at Ling Yushi and Ling Xuanxuan.</p>
 <p>He looked at Lang Xie, looked at Ying Xingran, and looked at the three reverends and the seven great elders. He looked at the martial practitioners brimming with killing intent and shouted, “Whoever touches the sisters, no matter who he is, I want him killed on the spot!”</p>
 <p>Everyone in the plaza changed expressions when those words came out. Even Shi Jingyun and the two others as well, as Ying Xingran’s group, were shocked.</p>
 <p>The ones that wanted to kill Lu Li, Ling Yushi, Ling Xuanxuan was Lang Xie and those who belonged to Blood Spear.</p>
 <p>Sect Master Ying Xingran and the three reverends had given their silent consent. This meant that all of Armament Sect had reached an agreement..</p>
 <p>Yet, as the major player, Qin Lie suddenly said this. Why did he do this?</p>
 <p>Many people were shocked but did not understand what Qin Lie was thinking.</p>
 <p>Only Pang Feng understood.</p>
 <p>But he did not say anything. Like a hard and stubborn rock, he was silent, but a light flashed through his eyes.</p>
 <p>Xue Li didn’t understand either, but he knew he had to listen to Qin Lie. He nodded and said simply, “Alright, I’ll kill anyone that dares to attack these two girls.”</p>
 <p>Everyone looked at Ling Yushi and Ling Xuanxuan. They found that the two sisters suddenly shook, tears brimming in their eyes as they looked hard at Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>Everyone only assumed the two were crying in joy and were grateful to Qin Lie. What the others did not know was that the two had heard from Qin Lie’s voice that had lost control in the end due to excitement and guessed his identity—Qin Bing was Qin Lie!</p>
