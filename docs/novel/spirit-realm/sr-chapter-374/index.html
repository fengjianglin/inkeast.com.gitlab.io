 <p><strong>Chapter 374: Tear Them Apart!</strong></p>
 <p>No one could have imagined that, seated atop the head of a giant beast, Qin Lie would so carelessly and arrogantly show up out of nowhere.</p>
 <p>“I heard that the forces and martial practitioners of the entire Scarlet Tide Continent were incessant in their search for my whereabouts—to the point that they’d even dig three feet into the ground.” He paused for a moment before looking at the crowd and saying, “Now I’m here. What are you going to do about it?”</p>
 <p>“Aooo!”</p>
 <p>The giant golden ape roared and bared its fangs. Its eyes revealed a cruel, tyrannical expression as it impatiently prepared to attack.</p>
 <p>“Roar!”</p>
 <p>“Nguuu!”</p>
 <p>“Awooo!”</p>
 <p>All sorts of crazy roars came from the mouths of the giant beasts. These recently emancipated ancient beasts had been oppressed for far too long and desperately needed a bloody feast to vent their emotions.</p>
 <p>The people of Profound Heaven Alliance, Joyful Union Sect, and Eight Extreme Temple were nothing more than tasty meals in their eyes. They would drink the blood of the three forces and satisfy their bloodlust. They would use a baptism of blood to tell the entire world that the Giant Spirit Race had reappeared!</p>
 <p>“Q-Qin Lie! Do you know what you’re doing?” Profound Heaven Alliance’s brain, Song Zhi, was shocked by the spectacle before him. Seeing so many sinister, terrifying beasts gathered in one place, he was terrified out of his wits. Yet he still pretended to be calm and yelled, “These vicious beasts will start a terrible slaughter and cause countless deaths on the Scarlet Tide Continent. Qin Lie, have you thought of the consequences?!”</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie! This is madness!” Xie Zhizhang also cried out in shock.</p>
 <p>Song Yu, Xie Yaoyang, Nie Yun, Li Yi, and the others were all quiet and wore incredibly heavy expressions. They all noticed that the situation was getting a little out of hand.</p>
 <p>They could not ascertain the strength of the ferocious beasts that had suddenly appeared, but they did know that these ancient beasts were extremely powerful by using their soul perception.</p>
 <p>They were not confident that they could go up against the beasts, so they did not say anything unnecessary. Rather, they were afraid that doing so would a provoke an unimaginable attack.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, they were still delusional, believing that Song Zhi’s and Xie Zhizhang’s urging Qin Lie to look at the bigger picture could stop these ferocious beasts from acting senselessly.</p>
 <p>“Consequences? Hahaha, now you’re lecturing me about consequences?”</p>
 <p>Under everyone’s gazes, Qin Lie laughed wildly. His laughter was filled with scorn and ridicule.</p>
 <p>“I heard that you were the one that thought of using me to acquire the Profound Yin Nine Leaf Lotus from the Horned Demon Race and destroying the evil nether passageway while their defenses were weak.” Qin Lie laughed loudly as he pointed at Song Zhi and said, “Did you ever think of the consequences when you set me up with such an evil scheme and wanted to force the entire Horned Demon Race to their deaths? I did not wish to start conflict. All I wanted was to send the Horned Demon Race away through the spatial teleportation formation, yet you are the ones who appeared at a critical moment and blocked my escape route once more. Have you ever considered what the consequences would be if you did that?!”</p>
 <p>“When all is said and done, they are the evil races! They deserve whatever they get, even if it means that all of them die!” Song Zhi said coldly.</p>
 <p>This was the voice within the heart of every person in Profound Heaven Alliance, Eight Extreme Temple, and Joyful Union Sect.</p>
 <p>To put it bluntly, they had never been able to open their minds when it came to foreign races. They had always thought of the foreign races as mortal enemies. No matter how despicable or dishonest a method was, as long as it was used against foreign races, it was considered acceptable.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie! How dare you show your face after assisting the evil races in opposing our human race!” Nie Yun yelled severely.</p>
 <p>“It truly is a waste of time to talk with all of you.” Qin Lie shook his head. He knew that, at this point, there was no reason in talking.</p>
 <p>He waved his hand and cruelly said, “Begin the attack! Slaughter every martial practitioner of Eight Extreme Temple, Joyful Union Sect, and Profound Heaven Alliance that has gathered here! Destroy them all!”</p>
 <p>“Aooo!” Mang Wang let out an explosive roar.</p>
 <p>Following Mang Wang’s roars, the twenty Giant Spirit clansmen all howled at the sky.</p>
 <p>The angry, earthshaking howls spread out from Herb Mountain. It was as if the entire Scarlet Tide Continent was trembling in fear.</p>
 <p>Their howls were also answered by the giant beasts that were headed towards Skypiercing Mountain and Profound Heaven City.</p>
 <p>For a time, bestial howls resonated from three directions on the Scarlet Tide Continent. The continent shook until the sky itself was dark without daylight.</p>
 <p>“Giants beasts are replying to them!” Song Yu’s expression changed greatly.</p>
 <p>Li Yi looked in the direction of Skypiercing Mountain and realized that things were taking a turn for the worse. He looked at Qin Lie sternly and asked, “What else have you done?”</p>
 <p>“Oh, I forgot to tell you.” Qin Lie slapped his head as if he just remembered something before bowing apologetically and chuckling. “The other dozen or so of these ferocious beasts are headed to Skypiercing Mountain and Profound Heaven City. If there are no surprises, then the two Copper forces of the Scarlet Tide Continent shall be utterly flattened!”</p>
 <p>The moment he said this, the eyes of every man and woman of Profound Heaven Alliance and Eight Extreme Temple were filled with fear. Even Song Yu and Li Yi went pale from the shock.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie! How dare you!” Nie Yun was the first to rush toward Qin Lie out of anger.</p>
 <p>“You’ve gone crazy!” Song Yu also cried out in shock.</p>
 <p>Xie Yaoyang was the only one who looked at the current Qin Lie and felt an icy chill.</p>
 <p>When Song Zhi schemed against the Horned Demon Race, Xie Yaoyang had actually been against it because he thought that it was dishonorable.</p>
 <p>However, since Nie Yun and Song Yu insisted on supporting the plan and Xie Yaoyang momentarily gave in to his desire for the Profound Yin Nine Leaf Lotus, he eventually agreed to the plan as well.</p>
 <p>At this moment, as he watched Qin Lie appear with twenty ferocious beasts and intimidate everyone here in a deranged, tyrannical way, he suddenly felt a profound sense of regret.</p>
 <p>“Oh, Qin Lie…”</p>
 <p>Song Tingyu was also among the martial practitioners of Profound Heaven Alliance overwhelmed with shock. In reality, she had already noticed that things were going south the moment that the bestial roars resounded from the Arctic Mountain Range.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, she had not imagined that Qin Lie would actually have the means to command twenty ancient beasts.</p>
 <p>What did this mean?</p>
 <p>This meant that Qin Lie had the power to go up against the combined strength of Profound Heaven Alliance, Eight Extreme Temple, and Joyful Union Sect from the very beginning!</p>
 <p>Yet Qin Lie did not do so.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie had yielded and restrained himself over and over to avoid unleashing these beasts and harming the lives of those on the Scarlet Tide Continent.</p>
 <p>However, Profound Heaven Alliance and Eight Extreme Temple had forced Qin Lie into a dead end. This was also where they had finally, truly angered him.</p>
 <p>“Sigh. They’ve truly caused their own destruction.”</p>
 <p>Hearing Qin Lie’s cruel order and seeing the shocked fear on the face of every martial practitioner of the combined forces, Song Tingyu wondered why she didn’t feel a trace of pity for them. In fact, she even felt pleased.</p>
 <p>“Serves you right!” she yelled in her heart.</p>
 <p>The other person who held the same opinion as her was Xie Jingxuan. Next to Xie Zhizhang, she icily said, “I had already learned the extent of Qin Lie’s madness when we surrounded Armament Sect. He completely destroyed the leaders of Dark Asura Hall and the four other forces with Terminator Profound Bombs, yet all of you couldn’t stop yourselves from provoking him. I truly don’t understand how your minds work.”</p>
 <p>“H-he was just a Manifestation Realm martial practitioner. No one could have imagined that he would have such power.” Xie Zhizhang’s expression was bitter.</p>
 <p>He was also starting to feel regret.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie can forge Terminator Profound Bombs. As long as he is alive, he only needed to spend a certain amount of time to forge several hundred Terminator Profound Bombs.” Xie Zhizhang frowned and said coldly, “Even without these beasts, it wouldn’t be too hard for him to destroy both Profound Heaven City and Skypiercing Mountain.”</p>
 <p>Aside from Xie Zhizhang even Xie Yaoyang was regretting his decisions when she said this.</p>
 <p>He also noticed that, as long as Qin Lie was alive, his malefic existence had the power to raise hell on the Scarlet Tide Continent.</p>
 <p>“Boom boom boom!”</p>
 <p>Dull, thundering rumbles roared from deep within the clouds. They were accompanied by serpentine lightning that constantly struck the ground.</p>
 <p>Nie Yun, Profound Heaven Alliance’s Nie Family patriarch, was in the Fragmentation Realm. With a longsword in hand and gleaming armor on his body, he charged through the sky at Qin Lie like a god.</p>
 <p>However, at the halfway point, he was given a baptism of heavenly thunder.</p>
 <p>Mang Wang’s angry roars were so loud that it seemed as if the sky would collapse. From deep within the clouds, like prismatic rays that threatened to destroy the world, lightning bolts crazily descended like shining waterfalls.</p>
 <p>It was as if the sky and the earth had been connected by thousands of lightning bolts!</p>
 <p>Amidst the glaring lightning and earthshaking rumbling, the thickest, longest, most berserk series of lightning struck Nie Yun like they had grown eyes of their own.</p>
 <p>“Krak krak krak!”</p>
 <p>The armor on Nie Yun’s body that glittered with godly light was shattered almost instantly.</p>
 <p>His handsome figure, which had been walking through the sky, was instantly burned into black charcoal. He had barely moved a few steps before being struck down by thunder and lightning.</p>
 <p>“Patriarch!”</p>
 <p>“Father!”</p>
 <p>“Big Brother!”</p>
 <p>The people of the Nie Family all screamed madly when they saw that Nie Yun had been struck down.</p>
 <p>Song Yu, Li Yi, and Zhao Changsheng had originally been preparing to capture Qin Lie and use him as a hostage to control the beasts.</p>
 <p>However, when they saw that Nie Yun had been struck down by the lightning filled sky before managing to take more than a few steps, their expressions changed.</p>
 <p>“Mang Wang, can your clansmen… deal with everything before us? What are their realms and cultivations?”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie had originally been a bit worried when he saw Nie Yun’s aggressive approach, but now he relaxed and carefully inquired with his soul.</p>
 <p>“According to the present power level hierarchy, if I were in peak condition, I would be considered equal to a Rank Eight spirit beast or one of your Imperishable Realm martial practitioners. However, that was in the past. My current power is greatly diminished, and I can only unleash power in the early stage of a Rank Seven spirit beast, which is about the same as a martial practitioner in the early stage of the Nirvana Realm. I will need to recover for a long time before once again being at my best.</p>
 <p>“As for my clansmen, all of them at their peak would be around the level of a Rank Seven spirit beast. They are currently just as weakened as I and are only able to unleash the strength of a Rank Six spirit beast, the equivalent of a middle or late stage Fragmentation Realm martial practitioner.</p>
 <p>“Although this long sleep has weakened them significantly, it is still child’s play to dispose of all life on the Scarlet Tide Continent!”</p>
 <p>Mang Wang answered with great confidence. From his perspective, the Scarlet Tide Continent wasn’t the only continent incapable of withstanding their might. Even the Copper forces of the nearby Flowing Cloud Continent and Heavenly Fate Continent currently did not have the strength to oppose them.</p>
 <p>“Even if your power has been diminished by a level, it will be enough for you to have the power of a Nirvana Realm martial practitioner.” Qin Lie relaxed completely.</p>
 <p>Even in their weakened state, the Giant Spirit Race clansmen were equal to one Nirvana Realm martial practitioner and thirty or so middle to late stage Fragmentation Realm martial practitioners. It wouldn’t be a problem for this powerful force to destroy Profound Heaven Alliance, Eight Extreme Temple, and Joyful Union Sect.</p>
 <p>Not to mention that the four great elites of the Horned Demon Race were also supporting Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>“Then tear them apart!”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie pointed at Song Zhi, Song Yu, Nie Yun, Li Yi, and the others before ordering with an icy cool expression. He would vent all of his long endured frustration all at once.</p>
 <p>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”</p>
 <p>The gigantic beasts, either soaring through the air or charging wildly across the ground, instantly surrounded Herb Mountain and began to mercilessly bite and tear apart their enemies.</p>
