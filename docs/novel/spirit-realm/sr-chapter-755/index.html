 <p><b>Chapter 755: Repairing the Flying Sword</b></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Yue and Xu Ran’s act was a little obvious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie could sense Shen Yue’s great interest in him. She seemed to be observing his every move and plotting something in her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought he knew what Shen Yue wanted. That was why he cooperated with her and supported her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This dumbfounded him, however.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Sister Shen, can you really help us?” Qin Lie asked without revealing his thoughts after pondering for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Yue nodded smilingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t mind us, we’re heading to the front for a look,” Xu Ran held Tong Zhenzhen’s hand and led her to the ship before them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tong Zhenzhen cast a glance at Lin Liang’er.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Liang’er quietly followed behind them with an indifferent look on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was how Qin Lie and Shen Yue were the only ones left inside the somewhat spacious meeting hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of the Terminator Sect martial practitioners were either waiting by cultivation areas or preparing themselves for the next battle. No one had the time to come here for an idle chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please teach me, senior sister.” Qin Lie bowed slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Yue suddenly sat down on a soft chair and relaxed her body completely. She beckoned him to come over her and said, “Have a seat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were plenty of soft chairs inside the meeting hall. They were there to make conversations flow easier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie smiled and walked towards her. He plopped down on the closest seat next to Shen Yue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He turned around to look at her. Electricity ran through his eyes. “What do you need me for, senior sister?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Smart and direct. I like it.” Shen Yue didn’t avoid his eyes. In fact, she even turned around to stare right back into his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Yue’s eyes slowly glowed with a kind of light that tugged at men’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They stared at each other for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if pulled by a pair of magnets, Qin Lie felt as if his mind and soul were about to succumb in the light rippling in Shen Yue’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He sensed something deep inside Shen Yue’s pupils. It was a wondrous feeling that could pull someone right to the center and make them never want to let go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wondrous feeling of souls intermingling with each other resonated into his mind. His soul couldn’t help but tremble at the feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie abruptly shuddered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do I look pretty, Junior Brother Qin?” Shen Yue’s erotic voice seemed to ring from the heaven itself. He felt as if a wondrous melody had wormed its way right into his Soul Lake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Yue’s eyes glittered with deep, bottomless light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dim light seemed capable of pulling his soul slowly into a wondrous place that existed deep inside Shen Yue’s pupils.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s soul floated through the bridge that was their gazes and threatened to sink into Shen Yue’s eyes just like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was moving completely out of his rational conscious control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie was shocked by this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can help you solve your current problem, but not for free. I want you to give me something,” Shen Yue said sweetly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her gentle voice was like sweet nectar dripping into Qin Lie’s heart. It made him feel indescribably comfortable and relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want?” He didn’t voice the words with his mouth. His soul thought emerged from his mind and expressed his intentions clearly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the heart language.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was rumored that males and females whose hearts were linked as one could talked to each other using the heart language with their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His partner could sense everything he thought the moment they appeared in his mind. This was the mysterious heart language operates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want you.” An erotic, rosy color sprung onto Shen Yue’s cheeks. Her pupils looked like webs of love that wanted very much to snare him whole.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie was immediately stunned by her declaration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next moment, the near indiscernible bridge of light that was built between their gazes parted and returned back their original spot like falling tides.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Frost Arts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cold air abruptly appeared from his pores and flooded him over. Bone chilling frost concept filled every part of his bones, limbs, and mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He slowly regained his cool.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He inhaled deeply before casting an odd look at Shen Yue. He asked in surprise, “What did you say, senior sister?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He assumed that his mind was playing tricks on him earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want you.” Shen Yue said again with a bit of embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s mouth fell open as he stared at her blankly. He forgot what he should say in reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry for scaring you like this.” Shen Yue smiled and shedded her the color of embarrassment on her cheeks quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She quickly readjusted herself and regained her cool. Wrapping a clump of black hair around her finger, she said naturally and calmly like she was discussing a business transaction, “I’ll take care of your problems, and you’ll take care of my physical needs. You’re the one who will benefit the most out of his trade no matter how you look at it. What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie had no idea how to react.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had never met a woman like Shen Yue since he started on the path of cultivation, nor had he ever encountered a beautiful woman offering to have an “affair” with him of her own accord. Shen Yue’s natural and unrestrained manner made him feel like they were discussing about the cultivation of the martial way or a business transaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if she wasn’t talking about the taboos between men and women.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had to admit that he was somewhat stunned by this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As you may have noticed, I am not an ugly woman. Moreover, our souls touched each other briefly and generated a rather wondrous feeling, did they not?” Shen Yue’s tone was easy, and she looked like she was growing calmer by the second, “This means that you subconsciously think of me as a good woman that is capable of bringing you real pleasure. Is that not enough?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie stared at her blankly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A long while later, Qin Lie finally asked with an odd expression, “Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why? Is a reason really necessary in this regard?” Shen Yue’s eyes seemed capable of seeing through the heart. “You’ve probably experienced emotions and delusions when you encountered an extraordinarily beautiful woman. You’ve probably imagined getting close to them. The day I came down from the sky, I could already see the favor and the… fantasies in Du Xiangyang and Luo Chen’s eyes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie looked astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unfortunately for them, they do not interest me.” Shen Yue smiled and played with her own hair coquettishly some more. She said slowly, “Just like how they fantasize about me, females also fantasize about the men they like. I… fantasize about you in that way, too. However, ninety-nine out of a hundred women would only stick to their fantasies and do nothing about it. At best, there would be one woman who not only dares to fantasize, but also acts on it decisively and without delay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It so happens that I am the latter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie stared at her with deep admiration. He told her the truth, “Words cannot describe my admiration for you, senior sister.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Yue was one of the very few women he met in his life who dared to ignore and destroy the countless moral barriers that stood between men and women.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He truly admired her from the bottom of his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You may not be used to my style for now, but that’s okay. You have my permission to take as long as you need to come to a decision,” Shen Yue said unhurriedly. “You may go and busy yourself with your work. Return to me once you’ve made your mind. I’m not in a hurry anyway.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie nodded and went out with a dazed look on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After leaving Shen Yue, Qin Lie really felt like seeking out Chu Li and asking his opinion on Shen Yue. He wanted to know what kind of woman she really was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Chu Li and Shen Yue were the proud children of Terminator Sect. Their paths of life ran pretty close to each other, so they were familiar with each other too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, Nan Zhengtian’s high regard of him had caused a knot to form in Chu Li’s heart and a crack to appear in their relationship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For now, he wasn’t able to find a way to mend the cracks between them. He had no choice but to give up on looking for Chu Li since it would be awkward to be alone with him now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe Du Xiangyang knows Shen Yue too. Plus, it’s about time I returned him the Five Flames Flowing Light Sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He left the place and rode on a crystalline war chariot to Heavenly Sword Mountain after a moment of thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heavenly Sword Mountain’s Luo Nan and others were currently speaking with Forefather Terminator and others at the forefront group. After Qin Lie went to Heavenly Sword Mountain’s group and expressed his intentions, someone quickly went to inform Du Xiangyang and Luo Chen about his imminent arrival.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The duo quickly walked out to meet him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The war is about to begin. Why are you here at such a time?” Du Xiangyang asked in astonishment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m here to return you what’s yours.” Qin Lie took out the Five Flames Flowing Light Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I told you that it’s yours, didn’t I?” Du Xiangyang led Qin Lie to the cultivation room he was in while saying, “I’ve already made preparations to buy a new flying sword for myself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Perhaps this sword is more suited for you,” Qin Lie passed the Five Flames Flowing Light Sword to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A spirit artifact that can’t be repaired may cause an unpredictable accident in combat. No matter how good the spirit artifact is, it cannot qualify as a weapon that will last a lifetime if it is irreparably damaged,” Du Xiangyang said regretfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite saying this, he still accepted the Five Flames Flowing Light Sword with obvious longing in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give it a try,” Qin Lie encouraged him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Du Xiangyang was caught off guard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give the sword a try!” Qin Lie exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Chen’s eyes lit up a little as expectation welled inside his heart. He too urged Du Xiangyang and said, “Just give it a try already.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Half-skeptical, Du Xiangyang gathered a bit of fire spirit energy and poured it into the flying sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Swoosh swoosh swoosh swoosh swoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Five flames of different colors instantly spread out from the sword’s blade. At first glance, it was as if the sword had transformed into six swords at once!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The actual blade aside, the five flames were also spitting out equal amounts of fiery energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Du Xiangyang trembled greatly as wild joy erupted from Du Xiangyang’s eyes. His shaking didn’t stop even as he exclaimed in great excitement, “How could this be? How could this be?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He almost couldn’t believe his own eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Luo Chen was expecting this to happen, the magical transformation the sword had undergone still shocked him greatly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qin Lie! You, you actually managed to fix this sword?” Du Xiangyang looked like he was about to go insane.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie nodded smilingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Holy shit, you’re such a freak, man! I can’t believe you actually know how to forge spirit artifacts too!” Du Xiangyang powerfully pounded his chest to show just how happy he was. The smile on his face was unbelievably bright.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How does it feel?” Qin Lie asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Du Xiangyang didn’t answer him immediately. Instead, he poured even more spirit energy into the blade and watched as the Five Flames Flowing Light Sword transformed into six fiery swords. As he made variations to his spirit art, the six fiery swords began making all kinds of agile movements like six burning spirit snakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This sword is absolutely no ordinary sword!” Luo Chen exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought that it was an Earth Grade spirit artifact too before I repaired the internal spirit diagrams. But now… it would seem that this sword’s grade has exceeded our expectations,” Qin Lie told Du Xiangyang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zzzt zzt zzzt!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Du Xiangyang was so excited that he was burned by the sparks falling off the six blade beams.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He nearly jumped to his feet with a fully flushed face. He shouted loudly, “What did you just say, Qin Lie? Can you repeat what you just said?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m saying that this flying sword may be a Heaven Grade spirit artifact!” Qin Lie told him his assumption.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Du Xiangyang and Luo Chen screamed at the same time.</span></p>
