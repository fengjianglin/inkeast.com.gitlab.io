 <p><b>Chapter 523: Meteor Shower</b></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Tianxing howled into the sky and its harsh, frigid winds, his eyes flashing with bloody light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie and the others tensed up, immediately becoming more vigilant. They instinctively took out their spirit artifacts to prepare for any sudden changes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They hadn’t expected that Jiang Tianxing would be in cahoots with Di Fei of the Scarlet Barbarian Tribe. His actions made it seem like they were close allies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ve killed numerous scarlet barbarians,” Du Xiangyang said, his expression grim. “That Di Fei has definitely been searching for us. It’ll be difficult to escape once he arrives.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Every barbarian in the Graveyard of Gods is in the Netherpassage Realm.” Song Tingyu furrowed her brow. “If we fight all three tribes, we won’t have any hope of prevailing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But… the ice spirit is at the bottom of that frozen lake! And the Land of Buried Gods could also be down there! We’ve gone through so much to get here. Are we just going to give up?” Pan Qianqian’s hands were balled into fists, her face filled with frustration. “Jiang Tianxing also knows that the ice spirit is here. Once Di Fei arrives, he’ll discover this as well. If we allow them to break through the ice and the Land of Buried Gods really is down there, we’ll have gained absolutely nothing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie was silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Judging by the expressions of his companions, he could see that everyone deeply yearned to enter the Land of Buried Gods. None of them wanted to give up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Fei of the Scarlet Barbarian Tribe would soon arrive with his tribesmen. The black and white barbarians were probably close as well...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s group didn’t have the power to fight against all of the eastern barbarians. Even if the other forces of the Land of Chaos—Black Voodoo Cult, the three great Families, Ten Thousand Beast Mountain, and Celestial Artifact Sect—were thrown into the mix, they still wouldn’t be able to face all of the barbarians.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t count on any reinforcements,” Jiang Tianxing suddenly snarled, licking his lips. “Within the Forbidden Land of Ice, only five Land of Chaos martial practitioners are left: Ye Yihao and Huang Zhuli of Black Voodoo Cult, Feng Yiyou of Celestial Artifact Sect, Yu Men of Ten Thousand Beast Mountain, and Su Yan of the Su Family! We’ve killed everyone else, even Lin Dongxing and Xiahou Yuan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The smile on Jiang Tianxing’s face showed how increasingly arrogant he was becoming. “They might be able to find this place, but even if they did, they’d just be courting death! Haahaha!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing him say this, everyone grew even more anxious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Out of everyone from the forces in the Land of Chaos, only some of the ringers, the so-called geniuses, remained. Even Lin Dongxing and Xiahou Yuan from two of the three great families had been killed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If that truly were the case, then who could oppose to the eastern barbarians in the Forbidden Land of Ice?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Tingyu subconsciously looked at Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s eyebrows were tightly knit. He didn’t know what to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We don’t have any tokens for them to track us through. If we leave, they won’t be able to pin us down.” Du Xiangyang sighed. “Should we survive until the exit portals are opened, we might be able to get out of here alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He clearly wanted to retreat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“With just our strength alone… we probably won’t be able to steal anything from the eastern barbarians,” Luo Chen said, dissatisfaction on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think?” Xue Moyan looked at Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone else turned to look at him as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, he had the power to decide what they would do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire group had chosen to follow him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without hesitation, Qin Lie spoke in a solemn tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to meet Di Fei!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>These words made everyone freeze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if two hundred scarlet barbarians entered the Graveyard of Gods… between the fighting throughout the Forbidden Lands of Metal, Earth, and Water, and freezing to death in the Forbidden Land of Ice, there should only be around half of them left.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie spoke in a frosty tone, his eyes calm as he continued, “We killed three teams of scarlet barbarians, forty-five barbarians in the Netherpassage Realm overall. This should leave about fifty or so scarlet barbarians.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone wore pensive expressions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ve fought these scarlet barbarians. We know that, individually, their strength isn’t much.” Qin Lie looked at each of them one by one, his eyes bright. “On our side, we have Luo Chen, Xue Moyan, and you, Du Xiangyang. Out of everyone here, you three are the most outstanding. Jingxuan and Tingyu are strong as well, having cultivated to the late stages of the Netherpassage Realm. Even Pan Qianqian is in the middle stage of the Netherpassage Realm. Her individual strength is greater than that of scarlet barbarians in the same realm…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie paused for a moment, then excitedly said, “As of now, our only enemies are the scarlet barbarians! Before the black and white barbarians get here, we have a chance!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, everyone’s thoughts of retreating vanished. Their eyes shone with determination, their spirits alight once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright! Then we’ll stay and fight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to see what makes Di Fei so special!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph! We’ve suppressed these eastern barbarians for years. Do they really think they can do whatever they want in the Graveyard of Gods?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The decision was made. They weren’t going to retreat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ignoring Jiang Tianxing who stood at the peak of a neighboring mountain, they dug a cave out of their own icy mountain peak and settled in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Each of them took out spirit stones and silently began to replenish their spirit energy. They tried to make the process as fast as possible, preparing for the arrival of the scarlet barbarians.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Tianxing went still at the sight of Qin Lie’s group resting in plain sight. He hadn’t expected them to be so audacious and choose not to escape when they knew that the strongest combatants of the Scarlet Barbarian Tribe were approaching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha! Birds die for food, and people die for wealth.” Jiang Tianxing smirked as he sent a message to Di Fei. He secretly left the mountain, moving closer to Qin Lie’s group. “Just for the ice spirit and the remains of elites in the Land of Buried Gods… looks like they don’t want to live.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two hours later, a barbarian dressed in scarlet carrying an enormous bow appeared. He stood at the midpoint of a mountain, the peak of which Qin Lie’s group currently was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scarlet barbarians thought that Qin Lie’s group would eventually regret their decision and attempt to retreat, so they split up to surround them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You were right, Qin Lie! There’s only a bit more than sixty of them, most in the middle stages of the Netherpassage Realm,” Du Xiangyang exclaimed, peering down the side of the mountain and taking note. “Wait for them to get closer! These icy boulders will do more damage if they’re close!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Off to the side of Qin Lie’s group, dozens of icy boulders were arranged in rows, poised to be roll down and strike the barbarians below.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had just carved these extremely large, icy boulders from the mountain. If they rolled down from the peak and struck the scarlet barbarians, the barbarians would definitely suffer severe injuries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They probably rushed here from other areas, so they should be low on spirit energy.” Song Tingyu smiled coldly. “In addition to that, we have the high ground! We can take advantage of that and wait because their arrows won’t be effective!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright then!” Qin Lie shouted. “We wait!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The wait ended up lasting fifteen minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Attack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Icy boulders the size of millstones rained down from the peak of the mountain like meteors through the sky. A dull rumble accompanied them as they traversed the glacial mountainside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These boulders also contained the spirit energy of everyone in Qin Lie’s group. Some sparked with lightning, others radiated an intimidating sword aura, and others glowed with green essence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A shower of icy meteors hurtled downward, their world-shaking presence making the scarlet barbarians in their path go pale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take cover!” Di Fei yelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Standing among them, Jiang Tianxing wore a shocked expression as he rushed to find somewhere to hide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boom boom!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bam!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aaaahh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dull thud of stone against flesh, the crack of breaking bones, and pitiful wails echoed across the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An ice boulder struck a scarlet barbarian in a flash of lightning. Before he could make a sound, his head promptly exploded, and the remainder of his body fell to the bottom of the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sharp swords seemed to pierce through the shields of light of other scarlet barbarian right before icy boulders struck them. Their exposed bodies exploded upon collision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This shower of icy meteors resulted in eight scarlet barbarians dead, and at least ten seriously injured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They can’t even take a hit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the peak of the mountain, Luo Chen shook his head and smirked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eight dead and even more injured.” Glee filled Song Tingyu’s eyes. “Even if there are more them, they’ve used a lot of spirit energy. What is there to be afraid of?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let them come!” Xie Jingxuan smiled coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Tianxing! Come on up here!” Du Xiangyang shouted, laughing. “Come on, didn’t you want to kill us all? I’m waiting for you right up here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From their position halfway of the mountain, the scarlet barbarians howled, eyes red with anger. Every single one resembled frenzied beasts glaring at Qin Lie’s group up on the mountain peak.</span></p>
