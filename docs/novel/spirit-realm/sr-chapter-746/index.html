 <p><b>Chapter 746: Anger</b></p>
 <p><span style>Tian Yu and the others who were about to leave subconsciously stopped when they heard the unusual reaction of the lightning from the cabin behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Kexin of Heavenly Artifact Sect stopped her scorning. She frowned slightly and paid attention to the ripples of lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Members of young generation came over on their crystalline war chariots. People like Luo Chen and Du Xiangyang went straight onto the ship while the others were all close by.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zzt zzzt zzt!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strands of electricity came from the ship cabin like coiling snakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many of the Terminator Sect martial practitioners had left this area under Nan Zhengtian’s orders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The martial practitioners that remained had high enough cultivation to not fear the roaming currents of electricity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many people walked out and gathered on the deck of the ships. They observed silently along with Chu Li and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A while later, threads of blue lightning that were the thickness of a finger and three to five meters long climbed over the entire cabin like vines.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The electricity tangled together. Some twisted together while others seemed to be fighting. It was wondrous to see.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Occasionally, the roar of thunder would come from that room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thunder were drums that beat on people’s chests and caused their hearts to speed up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Kexin’s brow furrowed slightly. Her fingers flickered at an unique rhythm. On her finger, the exquisite spatial rings gave off multicolored spirit lights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The spirit lights were like the chords of a zither that pulsed with the movements of her fingers and give off pleasing sounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Threads of soul intent shot into that lightning-filled room as the spirit lights pulsed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Kexin’s expression became strange and her eyes lit up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was using the sound to measure True Soul fluctuations using the ten specially forged spatial rings and the ancient secret art “Ten Chord Flowing Light Sound.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the reflected sound, she detected all kinds of extreme emotions such as savagery, bloodlust, madness, hopelessness and anger. What was even scarier was that those emotions were surrounded by blaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The vibrations the sound waves sent back were even stranger as they could slowly affect her soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was inwardly shocked. She quickly realized that Feng Yiyou’s loss in the Graveyard of Gods was not a fluke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other side, Tian Yu was not skilled in the arts of the soul. She did not make any actions and was waiting with clear boredom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Sister Xue, what is the relationship between you and that Qin Lie?” a female dressed in the robes of Illusory Demon Sect asked with a laugh. She came next to Xue Moyan. “They say that he’s your father’s godson? Is this the case?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Moyan turned her head and glanced coldly at the other. “Junior Sister Ju, why are you always so curious about my affairs?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ju Ruijie giggled and said softly, “Because I always thought of you as my rival.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Moyan frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even though you left Illusory Demon Sect and can no longer threaten me, I cannot change so easily,” Ju Ruijie said softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was the same as Xue Moyan, a direct disciple of Yu Lingwei, the sect master of Illusory Demon Sect. Ever since she entered the sect, she had the goal of becoming the sect master of Illusory Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Moyan was her biggest opponent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Xue Moyan revealed her status and became connected to Blood Fiend Sect, Xue Moyan had always been a level higher than her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had done her best to compete against Xue Moyan for the spot in the Trial of the Graveyard of Gods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alas, in the last competition, she lost to Xue Moyan and did not qualify to enter the trial.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had thought she would be forever losing to Xue Moyan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hadn’t expected that when the Trial ended, Celestial Artifact Sect and Ten Thousand Beast Mountain had spread the news that Xue Moyan cultivated the Blood Spirit Art and was Xue Li and Mo Lingye’s daughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ju Ruijie immediately saw a light of hope.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, not long after, the sect master of Illusory Demon Sect, Yu Lingwei, gathered the elders of the sect and announced Xue Moyan’s identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Yu Lingwei still thought of Xue Moyan as her student, everyone knew that Xue Moyan had no hope of becoming the leader of Illusory Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The position that belonged to her was naturally taken by Ju Ruijie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Recently, Ju Ruijie was filled with pride. She did not pass on any chance to criticize Xue Moyan. Seeing the furor, she immediately hurried over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I do not share any deep connection with Junior Brother Qin,” Xue Moyan said harshly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No connection?” Ju Ruijie laughed lowly and clicked her tongue. “There’s nothing between you two, yet he gave you the Spring of Life? No connection, but he gave the body of the Blood Progenitor to your father? There is no connection, and yet he still puts his life on the line for Blood Fiend Sect? I heard people say that you traded for all this with your body… I wonder if it’s true or not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her voice was not low when she spoke. The martial practitioners that were paying attention to the pair looked over in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was purposefully making things difficult for Xue Moyan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Moyan’s body froze. Pausing, she bit her lips and then said coldly, “Junior Sister Ju! Control your mouth!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She and Ju Ruijie hailed from the same sect. Illusory Demon Sect had helped her entire family, so even though she had left Illusory Demon Sect, she did not want to fight with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, why? Did I guess right?” Ju Ruijie’s eyes turned cold. She raised her eyebrows and snorted. “You think you are still the genius of Illusory Demon Sect? The future hope of the sect?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Blood Fiend Sect of today had to rely on Illusory Demon Sect in many areas. Even the Setting Sun Islands where Blood Fiend Sect was, strictly speaking, belonged to Illusory Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many members of Illusory Demon Sect had a sense of superiority when facing people from Blood Fiend Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They thought that Blood Fiend Sect only existed up to that day because of Illusy Demon Sect’s help.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They also thought that the reason Blood Fiend Sect could publicly resurface was because Illusory Demon Sect helped by contacting Heavenly Sword Mountain and Terminator Sect. They thought that Illusory Demon Sect helped Blood Fiend Sect wash away their status as an unorthodox, evil sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood Fiend Sect of the Setting Sun Islands took Gold Sun Island under them, and many people were dissatisfied with this and how they had also took over territories of the Pan Family, Blue Moon Valley and the other local factions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One reason was Wen Ben driving a wedge, making use of the fact that others didn’t know of the close relationship between Yu Lingwei and Mo Lingye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many of them thought that Blood Fiend Sect were ingrates, and Blood Fiend Sect was eroding their territory and benefits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to this, not just Ju Ruijie, many of the older members of Illusory Demon Sect disliked Xue Moyan and Blood Fiend Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Yu Lingwei hadn’t made her opinion clear on this matter, Illusory Demon Sect and Blood Fiend Sect would have most likely gotten into conflict already.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to talk with you anymore!” Xue Moyan took a deep breath to calm herself down. She did not explode immediately. Without waiting for Qin Lie to come out, she left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shameless!” Ju Ruijie gazed at her back and twisted her mouth as she shouted rudely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Moyan’s body shook. She endured it. She did not turn back and moved away faster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ju Ruijie raised her head with a proud expression, her eyes filled with disdain. “Without Illusory Demon Sect’s aid, a thousand years ago, the Blood Fiend Sect that’s currently at the Setting Sun Islands would have been exterminated to the last! And you repay by stealing the power of Gold Sun Island, the Pan Family, the Blue Moon Valley, and also Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she said the words, many of Illusory Demon Sect’s members wore expressions of dislike.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In their eyes, Gold Sun Island, the Pan Family, and Blue Moon Valley were all Illusory Demon Sect’s forces. Because Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion were close to Illusory Demon Sect, they should have been the one to take over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet this enormous territory was now under the Setting Sun Island’s supervision and a territory of Blood Fiend Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many of Illusory Demon Sect members could not tolerate this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Blood Fiend Sect’s territory was originally on the Heavenly Calamity Continent.” Celestial Artifact Sect’s Luo Kexin thought for a moment and then smiled faintly. She said, “They cannot return to the Heavenly Calamity Continent right now so they reestablished themselves in what was originally Illusory Demon Sect’s territory. They are clearly intruding on Illusory Demon Sect, no wonder they are so angry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bang bang bang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the people outside conversed, a room inside the ship exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A disheveled Qin Lie charged out, scorched black by the lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hm, what are so many people doing here?!” When he came out, he stilled and shouted in shock.</span></p>
