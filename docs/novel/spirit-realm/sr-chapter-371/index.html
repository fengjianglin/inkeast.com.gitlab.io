 <p><strong>Chapter 371: Self-satisfaction</strong></p>
 <p>Herb Mountain.</p>
 <p>After Qin Lie took the Spatial Spirit Stones and disappeared, Song Zhi’s expression looked somewhat startled. He was momentarily struck with panic.</p>
 <p>From what he could ascertain, Qin Lie was able to teleport into Herb Mountain using a spatial spirit artifact.</p>
 <p>Song Zhi had thought that Herb Mountain was the artifact’s destination point, and by extension, that every Horned Demon clansman was hiding inside of it.</p>
 <p>However, Qin Lie’s sudden disappearance clearly seemed strange, signifying that the receiving end of the spatial spirit artifact wasn’t actually at Herb Mountain.</p>
 <p>“How strange, really…” Song Zhi frowned deeply.</p>
 <p>He didn’t see that Song Tingyu’s beautiful face was already covered with frost and her shoulders were trembling slightly. Her bright eyes shone with a ruthless icy chill.</p>
 <p>“You actually followed me!” Song Tingyu gritted her teeth, her expression ashen. She had never been this angry before.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Xie Jinxuan’s harsh shouting echoed from a distance. “Second Uncle, why are you here?”</p>
 <p>Xie Jingxuan, wearing a uniformly white garment, glowered at Xie Zhizhang, her face also filled with icy frost.</p>
 <p>At the foot of Herb Mountain, Xie Zhizhang laughed in an embarrassed manner and explained, “I heard that you and Song Tingyu had secretly left Profound Heaven Alliance and gone toward Ling Town. Your father isn’t… certain about you, and he had me follow you to keep an eye on things.”</p>
 <p>He had actually come with Song Zhi.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie and evil races had suddenly disappeared, making Profound Heaven Alliance, Eight Extreme Temple, and Joyful Union Sect extremely anxious. The three great forces were so anxious that they went to extreme measures to find Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>They secretly monitored everyone in the Scarlet Tide Continent who had close relations with Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>After waiting for a while, they discovered that the whereabouts of Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan seemed suspicious. Song Zhi and Xie Zhizhang stealthily tracked them down almost immediately, moderating their breathing for the entire journey, and they cautiously arrived at Ling Town.</p>
 <p>“Keep an eye on me?” Xie Jingxuan was just as angry as Song Tingyu. “You’ve been following us the entire time, huh?”</p>
 <p>She saw that Song Zhi was next to Song Tingyu.</p>
 <p>“We had no choice but to do so. This matter is one of great concern.” Xie Zhizhang wore a helpless expression.</p>
 <p>“You girls are always letting emotions affect your decision-making. We didn’t have any choice but to do this.” Halfway up the mountain, Song Zhi laughed in spite of Song Tingyu’s glare and said, “Don’t you see? If it we hadn’t come, Qin Lie and the evil races would have easily escaped. The plan that Profound Heaven Alliance has been working on for so long... wouldn’t all our efforts have gone to waste?”</p>
 <p>“I hadn’t expected that you wouldn’t even trust us!” Song Tingyu’s heart went completely cold.</p>
 <p>“When it came to Qin Lie, you girls were excessively loyal and disregarded the interest of our clans,” Song Zhi said honestly, sizing them up.</p>
 <p>“Soon, all of the Scarlet Tide Continent’s peak experts will gather here.” Xie Zhizhang looked toward Herb Mountain with a heavy expression and said, “This time, no matter how many of the evil races are hiding within Herb Mountain, they won’t be able to escape.”</p>
 <p>As expected.</p>
 <p>Soon enough, a giant golden chariot, a crystalline war chariot, a giant crimson tent, Golden Winged Condors, Green Hunting Bats, and other flying creatures... each and every one of them gathered from every direction in just half a day.</p>
 <p>“Found it!”</p>
 <p>“It’s actually inside of Herb Mountain.”</p>
 <p>“We can attack all of them this time!”</p>
 <p>The martial practitioners from Profound Heaven Alliance, Eight Extreme Temple, and Joyful Union Sect that had come were all in high spirits after surrounding the entirety of Herb Mountain.</p>
 <p>Song Yu, Xie Yaoyang, Nie Yun, Li Yi, and Zhao Changsheng came directly to where Qin Lie had opened up the cave entrance.</p>
 <p>“Father!”</p>
 <p>“Father!”</p>
 <p>Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan wore gloomy expressions. After Song Yu and Xie Yaoyang came over with gritted teeth.</p>
 <p>“Mn, both of you have worked hard. You may go and rest.” Song Yu waved his hands and signaled Song Zhi and Xie Zhizhang with his eyes, hinting for them to persuade Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan to leave.</p>
 <p>By saying this, it was obvious that he was protecting Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan. In doing so, he was giving Joyful Union Sect and Eight Extreme Temple the impression that Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan appeared at Herb Mountain and contacted Qin Lie in order to help Profound Heaven Alliance find him.</p>
 <p>“You two are definitely the most capable within the younger generation of Profound Heaven Alliance. Beautifully done!” Zhao Changsheng praised them with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Well done!” Li Yi also nodded his head.</p>
 <p>They acted as if Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan had really done this for Profound Heaven Alliance, as if they had thought of the big picture and gotten close to Qin Lie to lure him out.</p>
 <p>“I…” Xie Jingxuan opened her mouth to speak, a cold expression on her face.</p>
 <p>Yet she was pulled back by Xie Zhizhang. He dragged her to the foot of the mountain, preventing her from saying anything.</p>
 <p>Song Tingyu was somewhat calmer than Xie Jingxuan. She knew what was happening, but she also understood that nothing could be done to reverse the situation. Nothing could be done to change her father’s decision, so, as a result, she kept her silence.</p>
 <p>Without Song Zhi saying anything, Song Tingyu headed to the foot of the mountain with Xie Jingxuan, looking at the experts from the three great forces flock here from every direction. She suddenly thought of what Qin Lie had said before teleporting. She felt a faint sense of anxiety in her heart.</p>
 <p>Before Qin Lie had left, he appeared to be extremely calm, which was somewhat strange.</p>
 <p>She knew Qin Lie very well. She knew how scary Qin Lie could be when he got like that.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie, things have escalated this far. What else could you possibly do…?” Song Tingyu sighed deeply in her heart.</p>
 <p>“A teleportation formation! There’s a teleportation formation inside!” Song Zhi’s called out loudly. His alarmed voice rang out from the belly of the mountain, making Zhao Changsheng, Li Yi, and the other experts of Profound Heaven Alliance come in.</p>
 <p>The strongest martial practitioners of the Scarlet Tide Continent quickly gathered beside the teleportation formation.</p>
 <p>“The pinnacle of perfection! This is simply the pinnacle!” Li Yi praised.</p>
 <p>“A teleportation formation that’s completely intact... We are only lacking the Spatial Spirit Stone needed to activate it. I never would have thought that in this empty Herb Mountain at this poor, rural Ling Town there would actually be a teleportation formation like this!” Song Zhi exclaimed in astonishment.</p>
 <p>Song Yu, Xie Yaoyang, and Nie Yun were overwhelmingly thrilled as well.</p>
 <p>“This is a window that leads to the outside world. With the existence of this teleportation formation, the Scarlet Tide Continent will be soon bustling with excitement! The people from the Heaven Fate Continent and the Flowing Cloud Continent will definitely be interested in this formation as well. Temple Master Li, Alliance Chief Song, I hadn’t foreseen that there would be such a shocking discovery during our journey to kill the evil races!” Zhao Changsheng was also wild with joy.</p>
 <p>“The evil races… where are they?” Mo He asked after regaining his senses.</p>
 <p>“I just checked. They’re not inside. There isn’t the slightest bit of life in the belly of this mountain. The evil races simply aren’t here!” Xie Yaoyang said.</p>
 <p>“I think they were supposed to leave the Scarlet Tide Continent using this formation. I already know that they have Spatial Spirit Stones,” Nie Yun sneered, saying calmly amidst of the chaos. “We just have to guard this formation and Qin Lie and the evil races will then be at their wit’s end! They will only be able to leave by relying on this teleportation formation!”</p>
 <p>“That’s right!” Song Yu smiled.</p>
 <p>“Contact Master Gu Ping and quickly have him come here. He has some understanding of teleportation formations. Have him come and carefully examine where it leads!” Xie Yaoyang shouted.</p>
 <p>“Right away!” Song Zhi responded.</p>
