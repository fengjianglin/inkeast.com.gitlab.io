 <p><b>Chapter 678: Blood Fiend Sect’s Sincerity</b></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie was not skilled in stocktaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me help you.” Song Tingyu said, her face glowing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was clearly in a good mood, her eyes betraying her excitement. Anyone could see with a glance at the smile on her face that she was in a very cheerful mood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re skilled in things like this?” Qin Lie asked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Back at Profound Heaven Alliance, Tingyu helped me stocktake the resources of the family. She has astounding talent in this area, you do not have to worry,” Song Yu added with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sister Tingyu really does know how to manage resources,” Xie Jingxuan added softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s eyes lit up slightly. “Alright, you can go and see how much resources Flaming Sun Island has right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Steering a crystalline war chariot, Song Tingyu laughed as she descended down towards the towers of Flaming Sun Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go to that island.” Mo Hai pointed at the island where the ancient elite remains were stored.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie nodded with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This island is gray, let’s call it Gray Island,” Tang Siqi said softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking down from the sky, they found that no plants could be seen covering the island and even the sand was a gray-brown color.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, Gray Island,” Qin Lie said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Siqi had a happy expression and she happily took the people from Armament Sect along with Mo Hai and Lian Rou to Gray Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to Lang Xie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Controlling the crystalline war chariot, Qin Lie turned into a cold streak of glowing light that shot towards the island where Blood Spear was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Yu and Xie Yaoyang on Xie Jingxuan’s crystalline war chariot looked at the Setting Sun Islands. They looked at a gathering of Blood Fiend Sect’s martial practitioners, as well as where the Xing Family of Gold Sun Island was. They were inwardly calculating something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems that we still underestimated Qin Lie.” Xie Yaoyang suddenly sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Yu thought for a moment before nodding. “I hadn’t expected that he would have his own land here already.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This boy is really good at making trouble!” Xie Yaoyang said in praise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected, extraordinary!” Song Yu agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Hong Bowen of the Blood Fiend Ten Elders finished explaining, he left Flaming Sun Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He directly landed where Mo Lingye, Mo Jun and the others were gathered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How was it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing him return, Mo Jun’s expression changed. He stood up straight and looked with a burning gaze at Hong Bowen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Lingye and the others from the Blood Fiend Ten Elders also looked at Hong Bowen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve told him what I needed to, I don’t think I missed anything.” Hong Bowen’s expression was strict. “Blood Fiend Sect has shown our intentions. I saw that Qin Lie was very surprised. He should be very happy with our arrangements. However…” After a pause, he continued. “Isn’t the price too high?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The others of the Blood Fiend Ten Elders also had expressions of pain as though a piece of their flesh had been cut off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood Fiend Sect had used almost a hundred experts and a lot of limestone to build over the three islands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had given Qin Lie almost half of the crystalline war chariots, ships, large-scale flight artifacts, and resources that they had recently obtained from Black Voodoo Cult, and the three families as well as the spirit materials, stones, and pills they obtained from Heavenly Sea Pavilion and Black Cloud Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, almost half of their gains were piled up on Qin Lie’s three islands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For Blood Fiend Sect that had not been in their best state these past thousand years, the materials were very important. Giving away half of them came with a great pain to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not even half of our wealth is equal to one arm of the progenitor,” Mo Lingye said serenely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone immediately felt better.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to the body of the Blood Progenitor, the spirit materials they had obtained recently were not much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Also, Qin Lie deserves it.” Mo Lingye looked at the ten elders and said coolly, “Without Qin Lie’s help multiple times, Blood Fiend Sect would not have been able to establish themselves at the Setting Sun Islands, much less publicly come out. It was him that let us stop hiding and leave the shadows. This alone is worth more than these spirit materials!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone nodded inwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even now, without the eight god corpses in the sea, we would not have the ability to protect ourselves,” Mo Lingye said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Jun and Hong Bowen all had thoughtful expressions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The reason we gave three islands to Qin Lie was for him to have a land of his own, a place he can call his “home.” With that I hope to keep him nearby.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Mu of Heavenly Sword Mountain or Forefather Terminator should be able to give him better conditions. Soon, he will go to Terminator Sect. If he sees the strength of Terminator Sect and its wealth, and he is persuaded by Forefather Terminator, it is very likely that he will become a disciple of Terminator Sect, a direct disciple of Nan Zhengtian.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If that’s the case, then what can Blood Fiend Sect use to keep him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Lingye asked the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Jun and the others gradually realized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We gave him a place that he will think about, something he cannot give up, this is how he will be able to resist the temptation of Terminator Sect. Flaming Sun Island belongs to him, those people from Armament Sect, Blood Spear, Lang Xie, his female friends, they will feel they belong to Flaming Sun Island. They won’t leave, and so won’t he.” Mo Lingye’s eyes flashed with intelligence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sister-in-law is extraordinarily intelligent.” Mo Jun was convinced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hong Bowen and the others couldn’t help but feel respect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is something you have to understand.” Mo Lingye sighed softly and said, “Today’s Blood Fiend Sect is not the Blood Fiend Sect of a thousand years ago. At this moment, today, if Qin Lie left Blood Fiend Sect, his future would be even better. We, however, can’t go on without him. I hope that you can understand it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We all understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sister-in-law, your foresight is amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group praised sincerely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qin Lie has come!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Blood Spear martial practitioner saw Qin Lie appear on the crystalline war chariot and called out to notify Lang Xie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In a remote cultivation room, Lang Xie was half-naked as he soaked himself in viscous bloodwater. The pores on his body looked as though they were breathing regularly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The room was shrouded in bloody energy. The stench of blood was nauseating. Two bloody red snakes of tangible blood energy came out of Lang Xie’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that Qin Lie had arrived, Lang Xie stood up, stabilized blood energy of his body and retracted his bloody aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Walking out of the blood pool, he put on a rough hemp robe, opened the door and allowed Qin Lie to enter</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hm?” Lang Xie exclaimed softly and looked strangely at Qin Lie. His bloody eyes flashed with intimidating light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s hairs rose on end as he was being stared at. He asked in puzzlement, “What? Is something wrong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boy, soak in the blood pool!” Lang Xie suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This blood pool? The one you use to cultivate?” Qin Lie was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!” Lang Xie said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s expression changed slightly. He thought for a moment and then said, “Alright! I’ll try!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lang Xie was already in the late stage of the Fulfillment Realm and was preparing to ascend to the Fragmentation Realm. After he came to the Setting Sun Islands, he had followed Blood Fiend Sect in their campaigns. All of the Blood Fiend Ten Elders had nothing but praises for him and thought that Lang Xie’s talent surpassed Xue Li’s and reached the height of the first sect master of Blood Fiend Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lang Xie definitely had outstanding traits to be recognized by all of the Blood Fiend Ten Elders. His personality, intelligence, and talent were all outstanding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only natural that the blood pool he used for cultivation was similarly extraordinary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Slowly, sink in bit by bit. Do not absorb the bloodwater from the pool too quickly. If you feel uncomfortable, immediately stop and block your pores. Get a feel for it.” Lang Xie reminded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taking off his top, he slowly moved towards the enormous blood pool.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His feet entered first from the stairs to the blood pool and the water washed over his feet. A strong burning feeling immediately spread through his feet as though there were hundreds of insects stabbing into the pores of his feet and trying to burrow into his feet. That burning and piercing pain caused his body to shudder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it?” Lang Xie’s expression was serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without answering, Qin Lie focused for a while with a frozen expression to carefully feel the changes in his feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bloody bubbles of the boiling water continued to pop. There was clearly a fire source like the Fiery Solar Jade under the blood pool that boiled and activated the bloodwater.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The boiling bloodwater was so hot that the great majority of Fulfillment Realm martial practitioners would immediately jump out after touching the water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Other than the high temperature, the bloodwater was also mixed with many different kinds of corrosive medicinal fluids that were not tolerable to normal people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lang Xie thought that even genuine members of Blood Fiend Sect would most likely have a difficult time withstanding the refinement of the bloody water in the blood pool if they were in the Fulfillment Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, after the initial shudder, Qin Lie seemed to quickly adjust and started to walk along the stairs into the blood pool.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shock appeared on Lang Xie’s face.</span></p>
