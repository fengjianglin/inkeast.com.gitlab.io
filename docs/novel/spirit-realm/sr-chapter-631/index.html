 <p><strong>Chapter 631: Go Back?</strong></p>
 <p>Tang Siqi, Lian Rou, Mo Hai, Song Tingyu, and Xie Jingxuan were staying at the island where the ancient elite remains were put. When Qin Lie, Xue Li, and everyone else had arrived, they noticed that Xing Yuyuan and Xiang Xi had come over as well.</p>
 <p>At the southwest corner of the island, there was a patch of ground that was burning with fire and sparkling with electricity.</p>
 <p>When the fire burned, clumps of colorful poison were also spreading towards all direction following the fire’s spread.</p>
 <p>“It worked!” Tang Siqi clenched her little fist and waved it repeatedly. She wore a look of excitement and wild joy on her fiery face.</p>
 <p>Lian Rou was carrying many porcelain bottles of colorful poisons in her waist pockets. She also looked spirited as she smiled at the thick, poisonous smoke that rose from the flames.</p>
 <p>Beside her, Yi Yuan was sweating all over while looking slightly pale.</p>
 <p>“Move further away away from here!” Mo Hai yelled loudly.</p>
 <p>After the crowd came over, they subconsciously looked to the places where the colorful poison had spread to. They noticed that the all the plants that the poisonous smoke passed through were swiftly wilting.</p>
 <p>Some of the small bugs they purposely tossed into the range of the poisonous smoke had all died as well.</p>
 <p>“Be careful, everyone!” Mo Hai hurriedly exclaimed when he saw their approach, “The dark rain corrosive poison can seep into the blood and enter the bones. It will gradually corrode a person’s bones and blood and cause their internal organs to melt into a pool of blood.”</p>
 <p>Those people who wanted to move closer for a better look all shuddered at once when they heard Mo Hai’s explanation.</p>
 <p>Xing Yuyuan, Xiang Xi and other Gold Sun Island martial practitioners had backed away almost immediately at first notice. The Blood Fiend Ten Elders had also retreated in silence after the initial surprise.</p>
 <p>For a time, the people couldn’t help but look at Tang Siqi and Lian Rou with a bit more fear than they used to.</p>
 <p>“This Dark Rain Corrosive Poison is a little too vicious.” Feng Rong sighed.</p>
 <p>“We’ve only created three of these Blazing Profound Bombs with dark rain corrosive poison in order to deal with those savage people.” Mo Hai pondered and explained softly, “Most Blazing Profound Bombs only contain a rainbow miasma that will cause a martial practitioner to become delirious and hallucinate things. This will keep them from fighting effectively.”</p>
 <p>“Mm. That’s better.” Feng Rong nodded.</p>
 <p>It was at this moment Qin Lie and Xue Li had walked up to Mo Hai. Qin Lie asked, “Is the idea to add the Dark Rain Corrosive Poison and rainbow miasma to the Blazing Profound Bomb Senior Sister Tang and Senior Sister Lian Rou’s idea?”</p>
 <p>“Mm.” Mo Hai’s expression was calm, “Siqi is well-versed in artifact forging, while little Rou has a unique understanding towards poisonous substances. They worked together to put toxin into the Blazing Profound Bomb.”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie looked at his surroundings.</p>
 <p>He noticed that the window sills of the stone buildings nearby were all stacked with a large amount of resources.</p>
 <p>These resources included all kinds of spirit materials. Some of them were Gold Sun Island’s old stash, and some of them had been recently looted from Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sword Mountain.</p>
 <p>After Gold Sun Island and Blood Fiend Sect recognized the value in Tang Siqi and Mo Hai’s artifact forging, they immediately arranged for the two of them to receive all the resources they might need, if possible.</p>
 <p>One could say that the resources Mo Hai and Tang Siqi were enjoying on Gold Sun Island far exceeded what they had back at Armament Sect.</p>
 <p>After all, Armament Sect was just a Black Iron rank force on Scarlet Tide Continent. They were lacking in a lot of precious spirit materials, and there was no guarantee that the spirit materials would always be available.</p>
 <p>Gold Sun Island, as a Copper rank force, and Blood Fiend Sect both had some accumulated resources. Adding that to the humongous amount of resources they’d just recently robbed from Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion, Mo Hai, Tang Siqi, and Lian Rou were guaranteed to have their hands full with all kinds of resources.</p>
 <p>That was why some of the ideas they used to entertain themselves only in their imagination were naturally brought to existence under their hard work.</p>
 <p>The Blazing Profound Bombs and that rare spirit armor was just a natural product of success.</p>
 <p>“Elder Mo, how many… Blazing Profound Bombs have you created as of now?” Xue Li also asked with a respectful tone.</p>
 <p>“As of now, we’ve created over fifty Blazing Profound Bombs. Among them, there are twenty or so that contain the rainbow miasma, while the rest are normal Blazing Profound Bombs.” Mo Hai explained calmly, “We haven’t started on that type of spirit armor yet. If Setting Sun Islands can survive this trial, then we will be able to refine them in great numbers. However, we are still lacking… manpower.”</p>
 <p>“Scarlet Tide Continent’s Armament Sect exists only in name, and now the teleportation formation connecting to the ultimate blood ground has already been constructed.” Qin Lie rubbed his chin and pondered for a moment. Then, he said, “Once we’ve survived Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families’ invasion, I believe we can return directly to Scarlet Tide Continent through the ultimate blood ground. When that time comes, we will do our best to call those inner sect disciples of the former Armament Sect over… we may think of this as an extension of Armament Sect’s legacy!”</p>
 <p>Xue Li’s eyes lit up.</p>
 <p>It was a good thing for any force to possess a group of useful artificers to themselves.</p>
 <p>If these artificers were very skilled in artifact forging, then the sect’s combat power would be greatly increased.</p>
 <p>By absorbing the inner sect disciples of the former Armament Sect and creating an extraordinary artifact forging force in Setting Sun Islands, they would be a great boon to Blood Fiend Sect’s future.</p>
 <p>“Those inner sect disciples are probably not doing so well in Scarlet Tide Continent right now. It would be best if we could take them in.” Mo Hai agreed wholeheartedly.</p>
 <p>“For now, please forge more Blazing Profound Bombs. Those spirit armors… can wait for now.” Xue Li said.</p>
 <p>Mo Hai nodded in understanding.</p>
 <p>“Elder Xue, please save up three ancient elite remains for Gao Yu. You may take the rest of them and find those suitable to receive their inheritances.” Qin Lie said.</p>
 <p>“Alright!” Xue Li looked moved.</p>
 <p>After bidding farewell to Mo Hai and Xue Li, Qin Lie went to the stone building Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan were in.</p>
 <p>During this period of time, the two women had been staying inside and putting all their energy into learning the power of inheritance inside the ancient elite remains.</p>
 <p>When Qin Lie stepped into the stone building and saw Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan, his eyes immediately lit up.</p>
 <p>Both Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan had stopped cultivating and waited for him inside the building after sensing his arrival.</p>
 <p>The light in their eyes had been withdrawn, and every movement they made gave off the wonderful feeling that they were one with the world and had complete control.</p>
 <p>It was the most natural expression of a Fulfillment Realm martial practitioner.</p>
 <p>“Have you both stepped into the Fulfillment Realm?” Qin Lie smiled.</p>
 <p>“The ancient elite remains’ energy and inheritances are urging us higher. We wouldn’t have been able to stop ourselves from ascending even if we wanted to.” Song Tingyu’s beautiful face was filled with joy, “Moreover, I have not accommodated all of the ancient beast’s energy into my bones. Perhaps this energy and power of the inheritance can push me further into the middle stage of the Fulfillment Realm in a short period of time.”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie shook in surprise and turned to look at Xie Jingxuan.</p>
 <p>Xie Jingxuan’s eyes were indifferent, “I’m about the same as her.”</p>
 <p>“Compared to you girls, my realm… seems to be advancing rather slowly.” Qin Lie laughed in embarrassment.</p>
 <p>The second he said this, the girls’ eyes immediately turned strange. The way they looked at him made him feel a little chilly.</p>
 <p>“When I first met you, you were just a Natal Opening Realm martial practitioner. At the time… I was already at the late stage of the Netherpassage Realm.” Song Tingyu said.</p>
 <p>“When I first met you, you were just a little worker in Li’s Shop. At the time…” Xie Jingxuan shook her head. “Your realm was literally not worthy of even a mention.”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie was startled.</p>
 <p>When he thought about it carefully, it was true that his realm wasn’t worth mentioning back when he first met Xie Jingxuan at Icestone City, and compared to Xie Jingxuan… the status quo between them was like heaven and earth.</p>
 <p>But in just less than ten years, he had already stepped into the late stage of the Netherpassage Realm. He wasn’t far away from attaining the Fulfillment Realm either.</p>
 <p>In terms of true strength, he believed that he wasn’t in any way weaker than Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan. Even his identity and status had experienced a complete turnaround.</p>
 <p>When he thought up to this point, he understood why Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan were wearing such odd looks on their faces.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie, you know… it is exactly because we are together with you that the pressure we have to endure grows heavier and heavier.” Song Tingyu suddenly sighed quietly.</p>
 <p>Xie Jingxuan also looked to be in agreement with Song Tingyu.</p>
 <p>“I think it won’t take long before you exceed us in terms of realm, and after that… we’ll be left far, far behind you.” Song Tingyu looked helpless.</p>
 <p>“I heard that the teleportation formation connecting to the ultimate blood ground had already been constructed on the Flaming Sun Island?” Xie Jingxuan suddenly asked.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie nodded.</p>
 <p>“When this battle is over, Sister Tingyu and I are going back to Scarlet Tide Continent.” Xie Jingxuan said softly.</p>
 <p>“G-go back, you say…” Qin Lie looked stunned by this sudden proclamation.</p>
 <p>“We hail from the Scarlet Tide Continent, so of course we’re going back. The reason we came to the Land of Chaos was to participate in the Graveyard of Gods’ Trial, and now that the trial is over, now that we have obtained a power that we didn’t even dare to dream of, now that even our realms had attained a breakthrough…” Xie Jingxuan said softly, “It is only natural that we would go back.”</p>
 <p>Song Tingyu was silent.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie was also silent.</p>
 <p>A long while later, he suddenly said, “If you wish to leave, leave sooner.”</p>
 <p>Song Tingyu’s eyes trembled, and she couldn’t stop herself from asking, “Do you want me to leave?”</p>
 <p>Xie Jingxuan also felt a clog in her heart. She couldn’t describe what the feeling was; she only knew that she was a little disappointed with Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>“Blood Fiend Sect may not be able to stop Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families’ invasion. This matter has absolutely nothing to do with you, so there’s no need for you girls to stay behind and risk your life.” Qin Lie said seriously, “I can arrange for you girls to be immediately teleported to the ultimate blood ground. Above the ultimate blood ground is the Nether Battlefield, and now that we share an excellent relationship with the Nether Realm you can return to the Scarlet Tide Continent safe and sound. You don’t need to stay behind and endure the risk of death alongside Blood Fiend Sect.”</p>
 <p>The two girls said nothing. They simply stared at him deeply with a cold look in their eyes.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie was startled by this before he said with a pained look, “I… I don’t want you girls to be in danger.”</p>
 <p>It was only after he said this that the chilliness on their faces finally faded bit by bit. Song Tingyu regained her smile, and she suddenly urged him, “Why don’t you leave first? We’ll tell you when we want to go back!”</p>
 <p>Once she said this, she forcefully pushed Qin Lie out of the building.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie complained a little on the outside as he couldn’t figure out what the girls were trying to do. In the end, he could only leave grudgingly.</p>
 <p>It was only after he walked away that Song Tingyu broke into soft laughter. She complained, “That idiot!”</p>
 <p>“Why didn’t you tell him that you would be returning here after you go back to the Scarlet Tide Continent?” Xie Jingxuan asked.</p>
 <p>“Why should I tell him that?” Song Tingyu smiled and countered with a question of her own, “What about you? Once you’re done clearing things up with Profound Heaven Alliance, are you going to stay there or return to the Setting Sun Islands?”</p>
 <p>“I’m not sure yet.” Xie Jingxuan shook her head and answered softly.</p>
