 <p><b>Chapter 760: The Enormous Bloody Spear</b></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time Qin Lie was using spirit diagrams in battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Above his head, eight enormous pillars floated in the sky like ancient gods that looked down at the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countless bolts of electricity formed into an enormous ball of lightning in the shape of a heart and gave off terrifying rumbles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boom! Boom boom! Boom boom boom!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ball of electricity swelled. With each beat, thunderous divine light that couldn’t be seen with the naked eye formed into ripples that spread outwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With each explosion, hearts of the clansmen of the three ghoul races exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their figures, having lost their life and covered in blood, fell towards the ocean.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were only a few members of the three great ghoul races left near Qin Lie. Those who remained…</span></p>
 <p><span style>...were in Fragmentation and Nirvana Realms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyone below the Fragmentation Realm had died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boom!” The ball of lightning continued.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The remaining Fragmentation Realm outsiders endured the attack of Profound Thunder Heart, but having suffered internal injuries, they were forced to retreat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They quickly found that the further away they were from Qin Lie, the smaller the damage they received.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Retreat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ghouls reacted. Someone shouted, and the others immediately followed suit. The ghouls that had been charging at Qin Lie were like a reverse tide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were aware of the danger Qin Lie and the Blaze Family imprint posed to them, but they had no other choice. They had to retreat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Had they chosen not to leave, they would have exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>—That was an outcome they didn’t want to see.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hm, weren’t they just shouting to kill Qin Lie at any cost?” Tian Yu of Ten Thousand Beast Mountain grumbled with a shocked expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s stronger than before.” Yu Men had a complicated expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Kexin from Celestial Artifact Sect looked at Qin Lie with gleaming eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First, she looked deeply at him, then at the Thunderblitz wood formation and lightning ball inside. She probed it with her soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gradually, Luo Kexin’s eyes grew brighter, and her body started to tremble minutely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She detected the channels of spirit diagrams from inside the lightning ball.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh whoosh whoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Six blazing flame tongues slithered around Du Xiangyang like six fire spirit snakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The six nimble fire snakes charged at three Earth Ghouls in the Fulfillment Realm. The ghouls were immediately pierced by the sword energy as bloody holes appeared on their bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Du Xiangyang clearly held the upper hand and occasionally gave howls of excitement and pride.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His performance attracted Luo Kexin’s attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Kexin looked over and immediately saw the Five Flames Flowing Light Sword in Du Xiangyang’s hand. She watched as the flying sword she had judged to be unrepairable scrap displayed astounding power in Du Xiangyang’s hands and released many wondrous fire snakes. There was a bitter grimace on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The light and nimbleness of that flying sword was like a heavy slap to her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her face burned, not in pain, but shame.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking back to the conversation and scene a few days ago, her beautiful eyes changed expression and landed on Qin Lie again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie had taken the “Five Fire Flowing Light Sword” from Du Xiangyang at the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking about the dazzling spirit diagram inside the eight Thunderblitz wood slabs, Luo Kexin understood everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Five Flames Flowing Light Sword she had thought no one in the vast Land of Chaos could repair had been successfully repaired by Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She knew what was inside the Five Flames Flowing Light Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ancient diagram…” Luo Kexin murmured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone, please move aside!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Qin Lie shouted loudly. The eight slabs of Thunderblitz wood above his head slowly moved forward as though supported by enormous hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can only injure and kill the outsiders if I get close to them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thousands of human martial practitioners from the five Silver rank forces instinctively retreated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They made way for Qin Lie, creating a path leading to a gathering spot of three great ghoul races.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie could move forward directly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Protect Qin Lie! His value is at least equal to a Soul Altar expert!” Celestial Artifact Sect’s Bi You waved his arms and shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He once had a deep conflict with Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three years ago, when Qin Lie first came to the Land of Chaos, Qin Lie had stolen the Demon Sealing Tombstone from Bi You near Sea Moon Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to find Qin Lie and Song Tingyu, he had sent out dozens of martial practitioners from Celestial Artifact Sect and searched the area around Sea Moon Island for multiple months.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To achieve his goal, he had even found the Blue Star Association and had all their members cooperate with him to find the culprit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But in the end, he had come out empty-handed</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the Graveyard of Gods’ Trial ended, Qin Lie’s fame spread through the world. Capturing the remains of the ancient elites, stealing from Jiang Zhuzhe and destroying his agreement with Celestial Artifact Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did he learn that Qin Lie had been the one who had stolen the Demon Sealing Tombstone back at Sea Moon Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This had caused him to feel hatred towards Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt that if Qin Lie hadn’t stolen the Demon Sealing Tombstone, Celestial Artifact Sect would have reaped more rewards in the Graveyard of Gods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet today, facing the savagery of the three great ghoul races, in front of the enemy of all humans in the Land of Chaos, when he realized Qin Lie’s importance in the battle against the ghouls, he decided to support him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Li! Old Wu! Come with me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bi You called over two of his close friends in the Fragmentation realm. He charged first towards Qin Lie to protect him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His two friends trusted him deeply. They followed without a word to reach Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Send three Fragmentation Realm and one Nirvana Realm experts to protect Qin Lie!” Yu Men of Ten Thousand Beast Mountain hesitated and then ordered gravely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The experts of Ten Thousand Beast Mountain protecting him and Tian Yu looked in shock at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t like him! I dislike him greatly!” Yu Men snorted. “But his use in this battle is indescribable. At least right now, he is much more important than I am!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you dawdling for? Go!” Tian Yu urged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The four experts of Ten Thousand Beast Mountain that were supposed to guard the pair had complicated expressions. They nodded and then flew away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Men had fought Qin Lie a few times in the Graveyard of Gods. Due to this, they had become enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tian Yu had been wounded a few days ago by Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But at this time, they chose to temporarily forget their grudges with Qin Lie, and had their retinue protect Qin Lie instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you dazing there for?” Chu Li glared at the old members of Terminator Sect around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those people nodded silently and landed next to Qin Lie to protect him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go over there!” Luo Chen commanded coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And so, Heavenly Sword Mountain also sent a group of experts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Four Silver rank forces, Ten Thousand Beast Mountain, Celestial Artifact Sect, Terminator Sect, and Heavenly Sword Mountain sent a portion of their elites to Qin Lie and proactively protected him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only Illusory Demon Sect’s martial practitioners didn’t move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Xiuling, Ju Ruijie, and the martial practitioners from Illusory Demon Sect were silent from beginning to end. They did not give any orders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one came over of their own accord.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This scene was awkward and eerie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought that Illusory Demon Sect would be his strongest ally,” Luo Kexin said disdainfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Setting Sun Islands are within Illusory Demon Sect’s borders. The great majority of Blazing Profound Bombs that Gray Island produced used are sold to Illusory Demon Sect. Shouldn’t Blood Fiend Sect and Illusory Demon Sect be the closest?” Tian Yu looked in shock at Yu Men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Men also had an astounded expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All this time, Celestial Artifact Sect and Ten Thousand Beast Mountain had no interactions with Blood Fiend Sect. Naturally, they shared no relationship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when they realized Qin Lie’s existence itself could explode the bodies of the outsiders, they didn’t hesitate and chose to protect Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They thought it would be natural for anyone with the slightest bit of intellect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What puzzled them was that they, who had conflicts with Qin Lie, could see the situation and make the correct choice. Why didn’t Illusory Demon Sect do the same?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an outcome they found strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, with the protection of Heavenly Sword Mountain, Celestial Artifact Sect, Ten Thousand Beast Mountain, and Terminator Sect, Qin Lie’s safety was almost guaranteed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie continued to move towards the gathering place of the three great ghoul races.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The strongest of the four Silver rank forces came and formed a circle around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boom boom boom!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blinding lightning ball at the center of the eight Thunderblitz wood slabs continued to explode.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pfft!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The members of the three great ghoul races coughed up blood as they screamed, clenching their chests.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These were all in the Fragmentation Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Large groups of Fulfillment and Netherpassage Realm martial practitioners had died as the lightning ball pulsed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At least half of the hundreds of outsiders that had ridden the floating rocks from Prism Continent had died due to Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Among them, there were six Nirvana Realm experts that had been turned to ash by the blaze imprint before the fight even began.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dozens of Fragmentation Realm ghouls had their hearts wounded by the Profound Thunder Heart. They lost their balance, and the great part of their strength. Their opponents successfully killed them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s effect was astounding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ghouls that followed saw the strange, mysterious deaths of their clansmen and slowed their charge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Retreat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surviving ghouls recognized the state of the situation and retreated towards Prism Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The battle that should have been evenly matched became completely tilted due to Qin Lie’s appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The humans had the upper hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The outsiders are retreating!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They are fleeing back to Prism Continent!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How should we attack?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The martial practitioners of the five Silver rank forces started a heated discussion when they saw the situation change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many people had excited expressions and bright eyes. They seemed as though they couldn’t control themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many of the Nirvana Realm martial practitioners from Terminator Sect, Heavenly Sword Mountain, Ten Thousand Beast Mountain, and Celestial Artifact Sect heard the discussion and looked instinctively towards Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The damage Qin Lie could cause along could match a hundred, or even a thousand people!</span></p>
 <p><span style>They thought of Qin Lie as the sharpest and deadliest spear in the hands of humans!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strength determined the right to speak, and status!</span></p>
 <p><span style>By this criterion, it was Qin Lie’s words that held the most weight, so everyone instinctively looked at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite their stares, Qin Lie’s expression was steady and his eyes cold as he said, “To the core of Prism Continent!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright! Fight to the core of Prism Continent!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Protect Qin Lie to the core of Prism Continent!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We do not know the state of the battle in the firmament, and have no power to participate! But we have to win the battle of Prism Continent! We need to destroy the future foundations of the foreign races, and cut off their future!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go! Follow Qin Lie into Prism Continent!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd was excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
