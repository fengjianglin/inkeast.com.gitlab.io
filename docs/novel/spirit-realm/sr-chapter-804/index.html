 <p><strong>Chapter 804: Thunder with a Thought!</strong></p>
 <p>"Stay further away from him! Protect your heart!"</p>
 <p>Shi Xiuling reminded her disciples and subordinates as she retreated. She was always at ease and composed. When she suddenly showed panic now, many people paled in fright.</p>
 <p>The Illusory Demon Sect martial practitioners who had gone with her to Prism Continent and had "fought together" with Qin Lie didn't need her and Ju Ruijie's warnings. They had distanced themselves from Qin Lie immediately.</p>
 <p>The remaining martial practitioners who knew Shi Xiuling well hurriedly reacted and retreated after the initial shock.</p>
 <p>Wen Family faction’s martial practitioners stayed where they were.</p>
 <p>They didn't think a mere mid-stage Fulfillment Realm martial practitioner could produce any great power, even if he learned the "Profound Thunder Heart" from Forefather Terminator.</p>
 <p>They looked down on Blood Fiend Sect and Flaming Sun Island from the bottom of their hearts. Of course, that included Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>"Thump!"</p>
 <p>A deep heart-throbbing sound came out of the lightning ball between Qin Lie's hands. The sound wasn't especially loud and astounding.</p>
 <p>"It's very normal."</p>
 <p>Miao Wenfan shook his head, his expression slightly strange. He felt Shi Xiuling, Ju Ruijie, and the Illusory Demon Sect martial practitioners were exaggerating.</p>
 <p>He didn't see a strong threat in Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>The Wen Family martial practitioners around Wen He had relaxed expressions. They felt that Shi Xiuling was alarmist.</p>
 <p>"Elder Shi, this Qin Lie is young, and his cultivation is low. Even if he has comprehended the mysteries of the "Profound Thunder Heart," would he be able to even use one-tenth of its power? What is there to be afraid of?" Wen He laughed. "He can only fly about with his eight god corpses. WIthout these eight god corpses, he is just a Fulfillment Realm martial practitioner. If I move my hand, I can make him... ooh!"</p>
 <p>Wen He's boasting suddenly stopped.</p>
 <p>"Thump! Thump thump!"</p>
 <p>The three earth-shaking sounds were like thunder exploding in the sky, and came from the enormous thunder sphere above Qin Lie's head.</p>
 <p>The three Wen Family Nirvana Realm martial practitioners didn't even get within a hundred meters of Qin when their bodies suddenly shook. An unnatural red appeared in their eyes</p>
 <p>The martial practitioner who was the weakest, and had only early Nirvana Realm cultivation felt the copper mirror protecting his heart shatter.</p>
 <p>Wen He's expression changed.</p>
 <p>"Thump thump thump!"</p>
 <p>More than thirty Netherpassage Realm Wen Family martial practitioners who were close to Qin Lie seemed to receive heavy blows. Their chests sank down, and blood seeped out of the corners of their mouths.</p>
 <p>Seven other Fragmentation Realm martial practitioners shook violently. Their floating bodies dropped towards the ocean.</p>
 <p>"Thump! Thump thump thump! Thump thump thump!"</p>
 <p>Even faster heartbeats sounds came from the enormous lightning ball. The spread of each sound came with invisible thunder and wild lightning.</p>
 <p>The martial practitioners who wore the robes of Illusory Demon Sect and were surnamed "Wen" fell from the crystalline war chariots, the spirit birds, and the large flying spirit artifacts.</p>
 <p>Martial practitioners below the Fulfillment Realm even had gory holes in their chests.</p>
 <p>A bomb seemed to have gone off in their chests.</p>
 <p>"Thump! Thump..."</p>
 <p>The beating continued.</p>
 <p>The figures close to Qin Lie who had weak cultivations died from exploding hearts. Those with higher cultivation spat out fresh blood. Their hands covered their chests as spirit power leaked from between their fingers.</p>
 <p>They were doing their best to defend their hearts.</p>
 <p>"Retreat! Retreat over here!"</p>
 <p>Wen He shouted loudly as he waved his hand. He wanted those Wen Family disciples who were about to come into contact with the Blood Fiend Sect martial practitioners to return to the island behind him.</p>
 <p>At this moment. The unknown people who were watching and the five valley masters of the Miao Family were silent.</p>
 <p>Their brows were deeply locked as they stared at Qin Lie at the center of the eight slabs of Thunderblitz wood. Their expressions gradually turned grave.</p>
 <p>Many people slowly thought of the rumors about the "Profound Thunder Heart."</p>
 <p>The rumors said that the Profound Thunder Heart was the secret of the strongest of the Land of Chaos, Forefather Terminator, who never taught it to anyone. It could manipulate thunder and lightning. It could attack enemies’ hearts invisibly, swiftly killing them.</p>
 <p>For many years, many people from the Silver rank factions challenged Forefather Terminator.</p>
 <p>Using his deep understanding of thunder energy, and the savage and strange Profound Thunder Heart, Forefather Terminator killed each one of his opponents. He gradually climbed to become the strongest of the Land of Chaos.</p>
 <p>The Profound Thunder Heart could be said to be the symbol of Forefather Terminator. Even his direct disciples couldn't understand this terrifying and secret spirit technique.</p>
 <p>In the past, no one had ever seen anyone except Forefather Terminator conjure the Profound Thunder Heart.</p>
 <p>—Then Qin Lie appeared.</p>
 <p>"Heavenly Thunder Eradication! Thunder of the Ninth Heaven!"</p>
 <p>Underneath the eight slabs of Thunderblitz wood, Qin Lie's hands grabbed a blinding ball of lightning, lightning flashing through his meridians and thunder roared.</p>
 <p>A river of electricity suddenly flowed through his tendons.</p>
 <p>"Zzzt zzt zzzt!"</p>
 <p>Two bolts of electricity half a meter long came out of his eyes. When the lightning appeared, it then suddenly disappeared.</p>
 <p>Soon, the roar of thunder came from the clouds above the Thunderblitz wood formation.</p>
 <p>The thunder deep in the sky suddenly seemed to flood!</p>
 <p>"Boom boom boom! Snap snap snap snap! Zzzt zzzt zzt!"</p>
 <p>The savage thunder, the lightning, and the clouds moved at the same time in the sky.</p>
 <p>Blue bolts of lightning dozens of meters long struck down from the clouds like whips of the lightning god.</p>
 <p>Among the electricity, many gray thunder pearls exploded into the air.</p>
 <p>Hundreds of electrical snakes poured into the eight Thunderblitz wood slabs and caused them to become pillars of electricity that seemed to be made of hundreds of thousands of bolts wound together.</p>
 <p>There was a Profound Thunder Heart between the slabs of Thunderblitz wood made from threads of electricity and it was constantly being nourished by the lightning in the clouds.</p>
 <p>The thunder egg started chaotically expanding.</p>
 <p>The unmoving Soul Lake of Qin Lie was full of light as countless threads of electricity flew through his sea of consciousness.</p>
 <p>The True Soul in his Soul Lake was also motionless. However, the light of lightning rippled off the True Soul like the halo of gods, and became one with the electricity in the Soul Lake.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qin Lie seemed to be in a wondrous state like he had manifested into the true god of thunder that controlled the world.</p>
 <p>In this land of thunder, he seemed to be the ruler of all. He could use the thunder to destroy all people and things.</p>
 <p>"Boom boom boom! "Boom boom boom!"</p>
 <p>With his every thought, thunder seemed to explode. Inside his Soul lake, an explosive thunder pool formed around his True Soul.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;A thought turned into exploding thunder. Upon exploding and dispersing, it reformed back into just a thought.</p>
 <p>It was an endless and wondrous process.</p>
 <p>The fourth level of the "Heavenly Thunder Eradication," Thunder Conception. This was the first time he touched its boundaries and yet he seemed to unconsciously comprehend it.</p>
 <p>The surface of Qin Lie's sitting body rippled as though his skin was being pressed and squeezed by invisible power.</p>
 <p>Shattered specks of lightning appeared on his neck, shoulders, and the corners of his eyes.</p>
 <p>Each thunder speck contained wild thunder power. They seemed to be performing a new round of refinement in a manner that could not be comprehended.</p>
 <p>They were refining Qin Lie’s Heavenly Thunder Sacred Body.</p>
 <p>Meng Feng and Hong Bowen approached Qin Lie, wanting to do their best to protect Qin Lie from injury.</p>
 <p>At this time, when the two of them saw the thunder and lightning that fell down from the clouds, they couldn’t help but feel shocked.</p>
 <p>When Qin Lie slowly closed his eyes, his body roared with thunder, and lightning exploded off his body, they were even more at a loss.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie? Qin Lie?" Hong Bowen called softly.</p>
 <p>But Qin Lie did not respond.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the three Wen Family Nirvana Realm martial practitioners from Illusory Demon Sect who were charging towards them slowly came to a stop.</p>
 <p>"Protect Qin Lie!" Feng Rong shouted.</p>
 <p>"Move aside! With your present cultivation, you cannot match the Nirvana Realm, you are seeking your death staying here!" Meng Feng shouted.</p>
 <p>The Blood Spear soldiers looked towards Lang Xie.</p>
 <p>"Listen to him." Lang Xie nodded and drove a crystalline war chariot to fly away.</p>
 <p>"Then kill Illusory Demon Sect's people!" Feng Rong ordered.</p>
 <p>All of the Blood Spear martial practitioners met up with Blood Fiend Sect's martial practitioners. They drove the crystalline war chariots towards Pan Family’s island.</p>
 <p>A bloody and bitter battle immediately started.</p>
