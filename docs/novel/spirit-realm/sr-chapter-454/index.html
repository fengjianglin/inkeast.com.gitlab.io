 <p><b>Chapter 454: I Won’t Give!</b></p>
 <p>Qin Lie’s refusal caused everyone to look in bewilderment.</p>
 <p>Xue Moyan’s delicate face was filled with astonishment. She looked at him with question marks in her eyes.</p>
 <p>She thought that her demand was not a high one.</p>
 <p>Compared to Heavenly Artifact Sect and Ten Thousand Beast Mountain, she was already very friendly. Her Illusory Demon Sect was so strong in combat. She was just asking for a drop of blood, was it still too much to ask for?</p>
 <p>A drop of blood in exchange for the six of them from Illusory Demon Sect to leave. Having such a strong opponent leave, why did he not agree?</p>
 <p>She could not understanding Qin Lie’s reasoning.</p>
 <p>Chu Li, Luo Chen, Du Xiangyang and the others also could not understand and had astonishment written all over their faces.</p>
 <p>Xue Moyan and Illusory Demon Sect were who they were all most wary of.</p>
 <p>In their eyes, Heavenly Artifact Sect and Ten Thousand Beats Mountain were not as great a threat as Illusory Demon Sect.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie!” Chu Li shouted.</p>
 <p>His expression was one of strong urging.</p>
 <p>“One drop of blood to have one less opponent like Illusory Demon Sect, it is worth it.” Du Xiangyang rubbed his chin and said.</p>
 <p>Niu Shaojun, Situ Tong, and the martial practitioners of Heavenly Artifact Sect and Ten Thousand Beast Mountain, including those poisoned, also wore serious expressions.</p>
 <p>They hadn’t expected that Xue Moyan of Illusory Demon Sect was not greedy for more of the voodoo insect blood and just wanted one drop.</p>
 <p>This came as a surprise to them.</p>
 <p>Yet even more unexpected was Qin Lie’s response; Qin Lie had directly refused such a beneficial transaction!</p>
 <p>It puzzled them, and also had them sighing in relief.</p>
 <p>If Qin Lie agreed, Xue Moyan would get the drop of voodoo insect blood and leave with the young females of Illusory Demon Sect. With the people they had, they should be able to kill Luo Chen, Chu Li, Du Xianyang, Qin Lie and the others, but it would not be easy.</p>
 <p>They would definitely have to pay a price!</p>
 <p>—That was not an outcome they wanted to see.</p>
 <p>The best outcome was that they would ally with the strongest group, Illusory Demon Sect, and divide the ten drops of blood. They would have the absolute advantage and achieve their goal without any cost; that was what they wanted!</p>
 <p>“I will ask one more time! The last time!” Xue Moyan’s expression turned icy. Her clear eyes showed a hint of undisguised anger. “Just one drop of voodoo insect blood, and all of Illusory Demon Sect will leave. Will you give it or not?”</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie!” Chu Li shouted.</p>
 <p>“Kid, be a bit tactful, will ya?” Du Xiangyang put away his playful attitude and called out with a stern face.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie suddenly became silent.</p>
 <p>He had put away the other jade bottle and said there were only ten drops of blood. This was to cause the illusion that the resource was rare. He was going to use this to bargain with the others, to force Luo Chen to put down his pride, kneel and beg him. It was to get enough spirit materials and benefits from Ten Thousand Beast Mountain and Heavenly Artifact Sect.</p>
 <p>Of course, because of Xue Li’s connection, he had planned from the start to give a free drop to Xue Moyan.</p>
 <p>But he would not be so polite to other people, and had the plan to take them for all they were worth.</p>
 <p>These ten drops of voodoo insect blood had been obtained by him and Chu Li risking their lives.</p>
 <p>There was no reason to give them to others for free!</p>
 <p>He hadn’t expected that when he said there were only ten drops, Niu Shaojun and Situ Tong’s expressions would change and so did their auras.</p>
 <p>In that moment, he realized that the two had intention of killing him.</p>
 <p>After that, the words the two had said angered him!</p>
 <p>Originally, he had planned on scalping Ten Thousand Beast Mountain and Heavenly Artifact Mountain for spirit materials, force Luo Chen to kneel down and apologize before giving the ten drops of blood.</p>
 <p>Now he did not plan on doing that.</p>
 <p>He was very angered by the attitude of Ten Thousand Beast Mountain and Heaven Artifact Sect. It ignited the mad fire inside of him.</p>
 <p>“I will not!” Qin Lie refused Xue Moyan again.</p>
 <p>Just like before.</p>
 <p>“Alright.” Xue Moyan took a deep breath and nodded slightly. She said, “Our Illusory Demon Sect, Ten Thousand Beast Mountain, and Heavenly Artifact Sect has reached an agreement.”</p>
 <p>“Good!”</p>
 <p>Niu Shaoyun and Situ Tong laughed at the same time. The martial practitioners of Ten Thousand Beast Mountain and Heavenly Artifact &nbsp;Sect also had excited expressions.</p>
 <p>These people took out spirit artifacts, their bodies rippling with spirit energy that unconsciously spread. They were about to surround Qin Lie and the others.</p>
 <p>“Du Xiangyang! What do you say?” Situ Tong shouted coldly.</p>
 <p>Du Xiangyang grimaced. He first looked at Luo Chen and then at Qin Lie. He felt extremely vexed and cursed, “Are you f*cking insane?”</p>
 <p>“Aren’t I poisoned?” Qin Lie pretended to be dumb.</p>
 <p>“Prepare to fight. I hope that you don’t die too quickly and embarrass Heavenly Sword Mountain!” Du Xiangyang cursed but he still took out his sword.</p>
 <p>He would still fight for the glory of Heavenly Sword Mountain!</p>
 <p>Now Qin Lie understood everyone’s attitudes.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!”</p>
 <p>A flame shaped like a Fire Qilin suddenly appeared above the hand that was holding the jade bottle. His fingers that were holding the bottle loosened.</p>
 <p>The jade bottle holding the ten drops of voodoo insect blood was exposed like this under the Fire Qilin shaped flame. If the flame came down, the ten drops of blood inside the jade bottle would immediately evaporate.</p>
 <p>“Xue Moyan, you and your sisters from Illusory Demon Sect will help us kill the martial practitioners from Heavenly Artifact Sect and Ten Thousand Beast Mountain.” Qin Lie’s voice was unusually calm. “Otherwise, I will immediately boil the voodoo insect blood in this jade bottle.”</p>
 <p>Xue Moyan was stunned.</p>
 <p>The young females of Illusory Demon Sect also stilled. They bit their lips and looked in surprise at the jade bottle.</p>
 <p>The martial practitioners of Ten Thousand Beast Mountain and Heavenly Artifact Sect also had expressions of alarm. They were intimidated by this sudden change.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie! Don’t mess around, Song Tingyu and He Wei are both poisoned!” Chu Li shouted.</p>
 <p>“Are you crazy?” Du Xiangyang shouted.</p>
 <p>“I don’t believe that you will burn all of the voodoo insect blood.” Three seconds later, Xue Moyan recovered her calm. “For that woman, you charged into the area covered in voodoo toxin without a care. You wanted to kill the voodoo insect at the cost of being poisoned yourself to get the blood antidote. If you burn this bottle of blood, she will also die. I don’t believe you can bear to abandon her.”</p>
 <p>“Hm! I also don’t believe the boy will dare to do that!” Niu Shaojun snorted and said.</p>
 <p>“He’s just pretending!” Situ Tong’s expression was impatient. “He isn’t even afraid of death for that woman. Would he waste the woman’s last hope for life? He definitely doesn’t dare!”</p>
 <p>Everyone thought that Qin Lie was just threatening them.</p>
 <p>“Oh? You really think that I don’t dare?” Qin Lie looked around and his gaze swept across the expressions of the people. Then, he screwed open the cap and poured out a drop of blood.</p>
 <p>“Poof!”</p>
 <p>The drop of voodoo insect blood flew into the Fire Qilin fire with a flick of his finger and evaporated immediately.</p>
 <p>“That was the first drop, next will be the second!”</p>
 <p>Before everyone could react, Qin Lie poured out another drop to burn it. Then he said coolly, “If Illusory Demon Sect does not act, then I will continue to burn them until you start to attack.”</p>
 <p>As he said this, he went to pour out the third drop.</p>
 <p>Xue Moyan finally crumbled and screamed, “Kill the people of Ten Thousand Demon Mountain and Heavenly Artifact Sect!”</p>
 <p>The mental defenses of the Illusory Demon Sect females had been destroyed by Qin Lie burning the two drops of blood.</p>
 <p>They screamed and shouted. All of them moved their spirit artifacts. They vented their displeasure, depression, discontent, and anger onto the people from Ten Thousand Beast Mountain and Heavenly Artifact Sect!”</p>
 <p>“Luo Chen, if you can kill two people from Ten Thousand Beast Mountain and Heavenly Artifact Sect, I will give you two drops of blood for Zhao Yuan and Zhang Chendong!” Qin Lie shouted.</p>
 <p>Luo Chen met his gaze again.</p>
 <p>From Qin Lie’s eyes, he saw true viciousness and savagery. For the first time, he felt that this little martial practitioner from Scarlet Tide Continent had traits that made people fear and respect him.</p>
 <p>“Alright!” Luo Chen agreed.</p>
 <p>“Du Xiangyang!” Qin Lie smiled viciously. “You kill as well! For everyone person you kill, I will give you ten pieces of Heavenly Flame Crystals!”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, the spatial ring on his hand lit up. Piece after piece of Heavenly Flame Crystal appeared in front of him.</p>
 <p>When Du Xiangyang saw the enormous number of Heavenly Flame Crystals, he put them away again.</p>
 <p>“Alright!” Du Xiangyang’s eyes were already burning as he started to howl with laugher.</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Chu, you can tolerate those people who were humiliating you just now?” Qin Lie grinned and stood up first. He raised the Astral Thunder Hammer and said with a snarl, “If it was me, I definitely would not stand for it!”</p>
 <p>“I won’t tolerate it!” Chu Li immediately howled.</p>
