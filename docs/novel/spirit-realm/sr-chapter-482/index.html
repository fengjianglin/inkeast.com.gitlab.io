 <p><strong>Chapter 482: Lightning Controller!</strong></p>
 <p>Without any overly obvious foreshadowing, Qin Lie became hostile the moment he said he was going to in a decisive and determined manner.</p>
 <p>As if he were embracing the world, Qin Lie raised his hands up high and bellowed. Streams of lightning, long and thick, poured from his body, and every part of him rumbled with the sound of thunder.</p>
 <p>Vast swathes of lightning resembling enormous dragons emerged from the depths of the clouds and, as though they’d escaped from a divine river, plunged straight downward amidst the explosive sound of heavenly thunder.</p>
 <p>Beside all of the martial practitioners present in the Forbidden Land of Thunder, the lightning hidden by the thunder barrier erupted outward like a myriad of wild horses breaking free from their reins.</p>
 <p>The thunderous changes triggered by Qin Lie instantly led to a ferocious frenzy of lightning in the area, gripping hearts and souls in a catastrophic way.</p>
 <p>The lightning that filled the sky headed straight for Qin Lie!</p>
 <p>Amidst the crowd of martial practitioners, Qin Lie stood in an area between Feng Yiyou and Yu Men.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Qin Lie’s dark, ruthless, ulterior motives were obvious to everyone.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie had moved to the path between Celestial Artifact Sect and Ten Thousand Beast Mountain and stopped right between Feng Yiyou and Yu Men in order to guide thunder toward himself, using the thunder and lightning of the Forbidden Land of Thunder to destroy all of his enemies!</p>
 <p>From the very beginning, Qin Lie never thought of staying out of this. The thought of leaving had never actually crossed his mind!</p>
 <p>He was clearly preparing to take care of Celestial Artifact Sect and Ten Thousand Beast Mountain at the same time!</p>
 <p>“This bastard!” Song Tingyu’s beautiful eyes shone.</p>
 <p>“He actually fooled us as well!” Xie Jingxuan gnashed her teeth.</p>
 <p>“Craack craack! Boom boom boom!”</p>
 <p>The violent thunder and chaotic lightning resembled a flood from the lightning pool of the Ninth Heaven, bolts of heavenly lightning gushing downward like waterfalls.</p>
 <p>The faces of Yu Men and Feng Yiyou turned incomparably ashen, as both of them barked at the same time, “Everyone, dodge!”</p>
 <p>Amidst the descending streams of blinding lightning dragons and their resulting explosions, the martial practitioners of both forces screamed, roared, and howled as they fled in every direction.</p>
 <p>In but an instant, Qin Lie’s immediate area was turned into a forbidden zone, a playground filled with vicious thunder and lightning.</p>
 <p>One of the Celestial Artifact Sect martial practitioners who had agreed with Zhang Sheng’s proposal to capture Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan for a bit of fun was struck by two intertwined flashes of lightning, instantly soaking his body with a concentrated flow of electricity.</p>
 <p>At the same time, another, more explosive lightning bolt directly struck his shoulders.</p>
 <p>Like a meatball exploding, his body was blasted apart. The violent flashes of lightning spread to his organs, charring them black.</p>
 <p>The light of hatred in that person’s eyes was snuffed out like the flame of a candle.</p>
 <p>Then, attracted by the bone ash urns inside of the thunder barrier, a gloomy soul instantly flew away.</p>
 <p>On the other side of the electric rampage, the head of a person behind Niu Shaojun of Ten Thousand Beast Mountain was struck by the heavenly lightning, the color in his eyes quickly dispersing.</p>
 <p>“Cousin!” Niu Shaojun howled sharply.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, that person could no longer hear him. As if attracted by a magnet, a gray colored ghost flew towards the Thunder Barrier as well.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie! I, Niu Shaojun, swear that I’ll tear your corpse into a thousand pieces!”</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie! I, Zhang Sheng, will definitely peel your skin off and break your bones apart! I will ruthlessly toy with your women right before your eyes as well!”</p>
 <p>“Take Qin Lie down first!”</p>
 <p>“Kill him!”</p>
 <p>Amidst the blasts of lightning that filled the sky, the martial practitioners of Ten Thousand Beast Mountain and Celestial Artifact Sect suddenly came to a tacit agreement.</p>
 <p>“I already told you. In this Forbidden Land of Thunder, I’m in charge.” Qin Lie’s tone was calm, and he wore a laid-back expression.</p>
 <p>His line of sight swept over one Celestial Artifact Sect martial practitioner after another, then landed on Zhang Sheng. Stretching out his hand, he pointed and said, “You’re next.”</p>
 <p>Lightning bolts shot downward, and the violent storm followed after.</p>
 <p>Within the crisscrossing of lightning and rain, Qin Lie’s body was enveloped by thunder and lightning. An electric glow sparked from his eyes as he confidently walked toward Zhang Sheng.</p>
 <p>The thunder barrier beside him was extremely terrifying as it constantly threw down lightning bolt after lightning bolt, each impact creating deep, enormous craters in the earth one after another.</p>
 <p>It was as if Terminator Profound Bombs were constantly exploding.</p>
 <p>Three people from Celestial Artifact Sect and Ten Thousand Beast Mountain charged forward. The moment they drew near, however, they were engulfed in lightning and thunder before they could utter a single word.</p>
 <p>The three people released piercing screams. The spirit energy barriers on their bodies promptly shattered to pieces like egg shells struck by a gigantic hammer.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Qin Lie pulled out the Astral Thunder Hammer, a huge grin on his face. The hammer resembled a gigantic mountain that gods resided on as it hurtled toward Zhang Sheng.</p>
 <p>The lightning that coiled around the Astral Thunder Hammer attracted lightning dragons and rumbling thunder to it. Thunder and lightning filled the sky and earth, mysteriously pouring toward the hammer as it swung through the air.</p>
 <p>A closer look would reveal that even the violent lightning in the depths of the clouds seemed to have found a target of their own—Zhang Sheng!</p>
 <p>The moment Zhang Sheng, who had just uttered such ruthless words, discovered that he had become Qin Lie’s target, the depths of his heart turned cold. In a shrill voice, he hastily shrieked, “Kill him! Everyone, let’s combine our strength and kill him!”</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, the three people who had charged Qin Lie the moment they got the chance had already been submerged in dozens of lightning bolts.</p>
 <p>As though they were ancient trees that had been struck by lightning, their bodies had already been charred black.</p>
 <p>Three gray souls floated out of the bodies of those martial practitioners as well, seeping into the thunder barrier against their will.</p>
 <p>Since he was nearby, Niu Shaojun was just about to attack Qin Lie. Yet, the moment he saw three people die trying to do so, their souls leaving their bodies, he came to a sudden halt.</p>
 <p>The martial practitioners of Celestial Artifact Sect and Ten Thousand Beast Mountain who were a little further away wore cold expressions. Immense fear flowed out of their eyes.</p>
 <p>They had also stopped moving.</p>
 <p>Even Yu Men and Feng Yiyou, both of whom had been constantly shouting out, realized that the electrical activity in Qin Lie’s location was more than a dozen times stronger than the surrounding area!</p>
 <p>Even these two geniuses were deeply frightened of the savage lightning that could annihilate all living things.</p>
 <p>They didn’t dare to act rashly.</p>
 <p>This led to Zhang Sheng shouting even more loudly, only to realize that nobody dared to approach Qin Lie at the center of the shocking tempest. Furthermore, Zhang Sheng even noticed that Niu Shaojun actually started to gradually retreat.</p>
 <p>He was consciously moving away from Qin Lie!</p>
 <p>The fear of a lone soldier being captured by a ferocious prehistoric beast and gradually swallowed suddenly sprouted within Zhang Sheng.</p>
 <p>At this moment, all of the people that could help him were quickly distancing themselves.</p>
 <p>“Among the many people here, you’re the one with the nastiest mouth, Zhang Sheng. In fact, the moment you brought us here… you were already dead.” Qin Lie smiled softly.</p>
 <p>The Astral Thunder Hammer descended.</p>
 <p>Lightning and thunder that threatened to shroud the sky and the earth accompanied the Astral Thunder Hammer, instantly enveloping the area where Zhang Sheng was standing.</p>
 <p>“Prak prak prak!”</p>
 <p>Dozens of lightning bolts as thick as pails shone dazzlingly bright, making everyone in the vicinity temporarily blind.</p>
 <p>Amidst the dazzling lightning sheen, Zhang Sheng was screaming harshly. Streaks of lightning surged into his body, wracking his flesh with unbearably intense pain.</p>
 <p>Lightning pierced his eyes to the point where he was no longer able to see his surroundings.</p>
 <p>Yet he could still hear Qin Lie’s approaching voice.</p>
 <p>“Thank you for bringing me here,” Qin Lie said with a smile.</p>
 <p>When this voice rang out, the dense lightning that enveloped Zhang Sheng dispersed.</p>
 <p>The violent, booming thunder mysteriously stopped as well.</p>
 <p>This allowed everyone to clearly see the situation in that area.</p>
 <p>The crowd instinctively focused their sight only to see Qin Lie standing amidst the streams of twisting lightning, placing his hand on Zhang Sheng’s head.</p>
 <p>Zhang Sheng, on the other hand, was crouching on the ground. His arms wildly flailed around as if he were struggling to straighten his own body.</p>
 <p>“You’re worthless now,” Qin Lie said softly.</p>
 <p>“Craack!”</p>
 <p>The sound of bone breaking echoed from Zhang Sheng’s head. At the same time, a dull thunderous roar resonated from it.</p>
 <p>Zhang Sheng’s seven orifices emitted lightning as he went limp and fell onto the ground like a pile of mud.</p>
 <p>However, a gray gloomy soul didn’t emerge.</p>
 <p>Anyone could tell what that meant in just one look.</p>
 <p>—Qin Lie had even obliterated Zhang Sheng’s soul.</p>
 <p>In this world, only practitioners who cultivated thunder spirit arts could obliterate the souls of their enemies, not even leaving behind a single spark of hope for them.</p>
 <p>The flames of Zhang Sheng’s soul were extinguished just like that.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go!” Feng Yiyou’s expression went cold, and with a heavy voice he said, “This isn’t a good location for a fight!”</p>
 <p>The pattern of a large, golden-winged roc emerged from the spirit armor on his body, and golden feathers began to appear on it, instantly causing it to shine with a golden light.</p>
 <p>Amidst the dazzling light, Feng Yiyou spread his wings and flew high into the air. As if he were riding a golden roc, he took the lead in charging away.</p>
 <p>“Hmph! Retreat!” Yu Men roared like a beast.</p>
 <p>His bones cracked explosively, his figure grew bulky, and he even seemed to have grown taller to a certain extent.</p>
 <p>Thin, fine fur even appeared on his neck as though he were transforming into a beast.</p>
 <p>Amidst the lightning and thunder, Yu Men occasionally roared like a ferocious animal. With every step he took, loudly charging away like a steel chariot, a deep footprint was left on the ground.</p>
 <p>“We can’t stay here too long!” Situ Tong and Niu Shaojun also shouted.</p>
 <p>In an instant, the two sides that had been facing each other, ready to slaughter, scattered one after another.</p>
 <p>“You want to leave?” In the middle of the electric storm, Qin Lie released a stream of strange, raucous laughter. “Leave a few more lives behind first.”</p>
 <p>As if moving the lightning in the sky with his own body, Qin Lie laughed loudly as he chased after the fleeing martial practitioners.</p>
 <p>In doing this, he left the dazed Du Xiangyang, Song Tingyu, and Xie Jingxuan behind.</p>
 <p>“This…” Du Xiangyang was dumbfounded.</p>
 <p>He was completely stupefied by this chain of events.</p>
 <p>A ray of bright light bloomed in Xie Jingxuan’s clear, cold eyes. Nodding her head, she remained considerably calm as she said, “Back when Qin Lie had a lowly status, I invited him to hunt down a Soul Devouring Beast. Similar to what just happened, he used a method where he moved the lightning in the sky with his own body to help me annihilate it.”</p>
 <p>This place was the Forbidden Land of Thunder. After these past few years of growth and transformation, Qin Lie had cultivated his thunder spirit arts to a deep, profound level.</p>
 <p>“He said that he was the master of the Forbidden Land of Thunder. From my perspective… that might not be just a boast,” Song Tingyu said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Her beautiful eyes shone with brilliance, and her heart was filled with joy. Deep down, she was secretly happy.</p>
 <p>She believed that Qin Lie’s crazy behavior was caused by Zhang Sheng’s cheap mouth, and because he had looked at her with eyes full of lust.</p>
 <p>Once again Qin Lie caused such a violent, tyrannical scene because of her. With the aid of the Forbidden Land of Thunder, he killed people from both Celestial Artifact Sect and Ten Thousand Beast Mountain with his power alone, and even obliterated Zhang Sheng’s soul for her...</p>
 <p>Song Tingyu’s heart was filled with happiness, a feeling more enjoyable than drinking ambrosia itself. Sweet smiles of joy filled her charming face.</p>
 <p>“Is there anything we can do?” Du Xiangyang shrugged, a strange expression on his face.</p>
 <p>“It seems we won’t be necessary.” Xie Jingxuan pouted.</p>
 <p>“Isn’t this fine?” Song Tingyu smiled as she comforted the two of them. “Look, aren’t there a few dead people over there? We can inspect them and gather a few trophies. What do you guys think?”</p>
 <p>Du Xiangyang’s and Xie Jingxuan’s eyes instantly glistened.</p>
