 <p><b>Chapter 739: Eye of Imprint</b></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie could sense with his soul consciousness that wisps of thoughts appeared from time to time from the blaze divine characters leaping out of his boiling blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>—It was the ancient knowledge contained inside the blaze imprint.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie concentrated his mind and absorbed himself in the task. He carefully extracted the various profound secrets of the blaze imprint and organized them in his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The secrets of the blaze imprint and the subtle connection that existed within the Blaze Family bloodline slowly became clearer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thoughts inside the blaze divine characters were like orderless pages of scriptures, and after he organized them many records of the Blaze imprint became known to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The blaze imprint... the family bloodline… execute this secret art and visualize through the Demon Sealing Tombstone…” Qin Lie muttered while his eyes glittered with divine light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A long time later, he slowly closed his eyes and worked hard to integrate all the information he obtained from his bloodline.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With his blood essence as the trigger, and the Demon Sealing Tombstone as the medium, he searched for the blaze imprint. The ancient art used the imprints to observe the punished appeared in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s test it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie took out the Demon Sealing Tombstone excitedly. He casually left it standing before him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A drop of blood essence that looked like carnelian stone flew out out his fingertip. With his blood essence as the ink, he began drawing on the blank tombstone just like how he inscribed spirit diagrams on a spirit board.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His fingertip moved according to his consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A fist-sized blaze imprint drawn with his blood quickly appeared on the Demon Sealing Tombstone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blaze imprint looked like a ball of burning flame on the surface of the Demon Sealing Tombstone. Tiny blaze divine characters wiggled inside it and gave it a most unusual appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“With my blood as the trigger, and my soul as the eyes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wisp of refined soul consciousness that looked like a ray of fire abruptly hit the blaze imprint on the tombstone’s surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blaze imprint was instantly ignited by it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dazzling flame with the blaze imprint at its core appeared on the Demon Sealing Tombstone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Sealing Tombstone that normally displayed no other oddities except for the seven divine lights abruptly glowed in red color.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blank tombstone gradually took the form of a translucent mirror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the mirror, one could see many dots of blaze flashing on and off mysteriously like the stars of night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie looked invigorated by the success.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew now that the flashing dots of blaze on the tombstone’s surface were all blaze imprints.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These blaze imprints belonged to the Heaven Ghoul clansmen such as Matthew!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Through the Demon Sealing Tombstone and his blood essence, he should be able to lock onto all living beings imprinted with the blaze imprint within a range of several tens of thousands of kilometers!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I should still be able to see them!” He tapped his finger on the blaze imprint drawn with his blood essence and increased the amount of soul consciousness he was using.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh!” The Demon Sealing Tombstone’s surface changed once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A clear image immediately appeared on the mirror like tombstone. The location displayed was none other than the center of Prism Continent and the gathering spot of the Heaven Ghoul clansmen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, countless Heaven Ghoul clansmen were gathered beneath the spatial rift and welcoming more of their clansmen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Matthew, the three-level Soul Altar expert who was burned within an inch of his life was raspily speaking in a low tone and urging his clansmen to kill Qin Lie before he brought great trouble upon them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could see the unlit blaze imprints on Matthew’s scorched body. They looked like ugly scars.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of the Heaven Ghoul clansmen who just arrived beside him were mostly at Nirvana Realm. They too were more or less marked with the blaze imprint.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie looked carefully at the Demon Sealing Tombstone and the blaze dots on the tombstone’s surface. He totaled up a number in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nine. Right now there are nine people with the blaze imprint on them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The nine Heaven Ghoul clansmen were the most eye catching targets on the Demon Sealing Tombstone. He could see through the tombstone what was going on there and what they were talking about. It seemed like the work of the blaze imprints too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After figuring out that the nine blaze dots represented nine blaze imprints, Qin Lie quieted and listened closely to their conversation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Five to six minutes later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The image on the Demon Sealing Tombstone gradually turned blurry before it faded away completely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He seemed to have exhausted all of the energy inside the blood essence he used to draw the blaze imprint. That was why it was fading away slowly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Sealing Tombstone ultimately turned back into its original appearance, and no image could be seen from its surface any longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie fell silent. He was starting to gain an in depth understanding of the strange connection between his bloodline and the blaze imprints.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So I could use my bloodline and the Demon Sealing Tombstone to seek out all living beings that are imprinted with the blaze imprint within tens of thousands of kilometers of range. I could hear everything they say, and see everything they do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t try to use more blood essences to figure out the Heaven Ghoul Race’s movements. He withdrew the Demon Sealing Tombstone and frowned, speaking to himself, “Tong Zhenzhen is right. Even their greatest, slumbering great sage had a blaze imprint inside his body, and I have the power to ignite the remaining power inside them through my bloodline power!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He noticed that he would become a trump card against the Heaven Ghoul Race in future battles. As long as he was alive, the Heaven Ghoul Race couldn’t ignore the threat he represented.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I must do my best to protect my own life,” He thought quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The remaining two giant black iron ships no longer went closer to Prism Continent. In fact, they were slowly moving away from the continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie didn’t move out of his room for a very long time. He spent his time learning the secrets of his bloodline, and sometimes he would use a blood essence to investigate the Heaven Ghoul Race’s movements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Today, he learned something new through the Demon Sealing Tombstone—the Heaven Ghoul Race was sweeping through the continents around Prism Continent!</span></p>
 <p><span style>And so he walked out of the cultivation room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He went to Lei Yan directly and hesitated for a moment. Then, he said, “The Heaven Ghoul Race is attacking the martial practitioners gathering spots around Prism Continent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lei Yan looked at him in astonishment, “You’ve never left your room a step until today, so how on Spirit Realm did you know what happened there? Also, we’re quite far away from Prism Continent already. How did you know what’s going on there?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I learned it through a different channel,” Qin Lie said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lei Yan came to realization and looked at him deeply, “Bloodline?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are they headed to? Can you be a little more specific?” Lei Yan turned serious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie explained everything he learned clearly to Lei Yan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lei Yan’s face looked a little complicated when he was done hearing to Qin Lie. He nodded, “I got it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there something wrong?” Qin Lie was puzzled by his reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is something,” Lei Yan didn’t deny it and humphed coldly, “Those Heaven Ghoul Race bastards are heading down two directions. It should be the islands of the copper rank force that belonged to Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, now this is amusing!” Qin Lie let out an odd chuckle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not going to notify them about the attack!” Lei Yan grinned and said, “Terminator Sect does have some land in that area, and there are a few spots where Illusory Demon Sect martial practitioners often gathered in one place. I will send a message to those places and tell them to evacuate immediately!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie nodded and asked nothing else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go seek out Chu Li, will you? He has a message from the Setting Sun Islands for you,” Lei Yan said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After leaving Lei Yan’s side, Qin Lie immediately went to see Chu Li. He then brought up what Lei Yan had told him earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I do have a letter from the Setting Sun Islands,” Chu Li took out a letter from his spatial ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The letter came from Hong Bowen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie opened and read through the letter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he was done, he told Chu Li, “Blood Fiend Sect is no longer what they are, so they have to keep their guard up against the Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families. Therefore, they are unable to send any experts to assist in this invasion. That being said, they will send over a free batch of Blazing Profound Bombs some time later to help you fight the Heaven Ghoul Race’s invasion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We will receive Blood Fiend Sect’s assistance gladly,” Chu Li smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the past year, the Blazing Profound Bomb had gradually gotten famous. It was looking to stand toe to toe with the infamous Terminator Profound Bombs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Nan Zhengtian’s direct disciple, Chu Li naturally knew just how valuable the Blazing Profound Bombs were. So he was quite happy to hear that the Setting Sun Islands would be sending them a batch of Blazing Profound Bombs for free.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My master will be arriving in another four hours. He may ask to see you very soon, so prepare yourself,” Chu Li said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie looked apprehensive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A year ago, he had left the Setting Sun Islands to meet Nan Zhengtian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Later on, he was delayed at the Ruined Lands for an entire year. After that, he ran head first into the outsiders’ invasion at Prism Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought that it would be a long time before he could finally meet Nan Zhengtian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Forefather Terminator Nan Zhengtian was the number one cultivator in the Land of Chaos and the greatest power that existed in current times. He had dominated this world for hundreds of years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Qin Lie thought that this was the person he was going to meet very soon, he couldn’t help but feel a sudden wave of discomfort and anxiety.</span></p>
