 <p><b>Chapter 674: Profound Heaven Alliance’s Request</b></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie stayed in Dark Asura Hall for a few more days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had given out all the spirit materials and spirit artifacts he brought back from the Setting Sun Islands. To him, these companions he made during his teen years were the key figures of the most beautiful memories of his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, the reason for his return to the Scarlet Tide Continent was to see Tu Ze and his other friends, and to present them with new opportunities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was also because he hoped to take them away from the Scarlet Tide Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But after talking with Tu Shixiong, he realized that his plans might not have been as long-sighted as he believed them to be. In the end, he reached a conclusion that it would be better if they were to be left at the Scarlet Tide Continent for now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The spirit materials and spirit pills he left behind would aid Tu Ze and everyone else in their cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Given a bit of time, the Tu Family would be able to swiftly increase their strength and accumulate more power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps the best timing for their departure to the Setting Sun Islands would be the moment they thought that their growth would be limited on the Scarlet Tide Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Qin Lie waited until Tu Ze and the others had knocked themselves out with alcohol once more before he finally sneaked away on the crystalline war chariot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had just flown out of Hundred Palace City without a particular direction in mind when an identical-looking crystalline war chariot suddenly appeared before him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Siyuan and Xie Zhizhang stood atop the crystalline war chariot with smiling faces. They seemed to have waited for a very long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Had enough fun?” Song Siyuan asked Qin Lie while smiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The latter returned the smile and countered, “You two have been following me since Seven Fiends Valley all the way to Dark Asura Hall. What do you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Zhizhang let out a dry laugh and answered, “We were afraid that you’d start another slaughter and turn the entire Scarlet Tide Continent upside down. We’re also afraid that some clueless people will find an excuse to provoke or offend you, sparking you into action.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Am I really that bad in your eyes?” Qin Lie was speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Siyuan and Xie Zhizhang broke out in a sweat when they heard his question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From the moment I heard your name, you create trouble wherever you set your foot. I also heard that you’ve made enemies everywhere and fought nonstop ever since you entered the Land of Chaos.” Xie Zhizhang’s expression was strange. “How can we possibly let our guard down with so much of your... ‘interesting’ history to refer to? We had no choice but to follow you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How are they doing?” Qin Lie suddenly shot a question that seemed to come out of nowhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a brief moment of confusion, Xie Zhizhang understood and answered, “Both Tingyu and Jingxuan have broken through to the Fulfillment Realm, and they are currently cultivating their families’ secret arts. That is why they have secluded themselves for a time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see.” Qin Lie frowned. “How long do they need, exactly? If it lasts too long then… I may have to return to the Land of Chaos first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They should be finishing soon,” Song Siyuan hastily said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It won’t delay your schedule,” Xie Zhizhang also said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie nodded before he said suddenly, “Alright, talk. What else do you want from me? I refuse to believe that you’ve followed me for such a long time and waited at Dark Asura Hall for so many days for nothing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Zhizhang immediately looked embarrassed upon being exposed. He let out an awkward laugh and said, “Uh, I heard that you still have a dozen or so crystalline war chariots in your possession? It sounds like you have plenty of such flying spirit artifacts… don’t you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want, no, Profound Heaven Alliance would like to purchase them from you!” Song Siyuan said seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Purchase?” Qin Lie let out an odd laughter. “You can go the the Land of Chaos yourself and buy the crystalline war chariots there, can’t you? If you think it’s too far, you can still seek out Sea Moon Island’s Blue Star Association and acquire their aid, right? Why have you come to me instead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blue Star Association is overly arrogant, and they share a rather bad relationship with all surrounding forces. Also… their prices are a little expensive,” Xie Zhizhang said helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blue Star Association sat amidst the Scarlet Tide Continent, Flowing Cloud Continent, and the Land of Chaos. They controlled the teleportation formations and were responsible for selling spirit artifacts and spirit pills to forces like Profound Heaven Alliance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In general, everything Blue Star Association sold was at least forty percent more expensive than in the Land of Chaos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A difference of forty percent was too much for a force like Profound Heaven Alliance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since Profound Heaven Alliance learned that Qin Lie could teleport directly to the Setting Sun Islands through the teleportation formation in the ultimate blood ground, they had a plan in their mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They hoped to buy some spirit materials they urgently needed without going through Blue Star Association.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I still have plenty of crystalline war chariots, but… I don’t seem to be lacking in anything.” Qin Lie rubbed his chin and looked playfully at Xie Zhizhang and Song Siyuan. “What do you have to offer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you take spirit stones?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not lacking in spirit stones.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Scarlet Tide Continent produces a lot of special spirit materials such as the Fiery Solar Jade, Heavenly Cloud Crystal, Water Spirit Jade and so on. You are an artificer yourself; you should know about our local products.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To be frank, grade of Scarlet Tide Continent’s spirit materials is just too low. I may not have use for them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both men looked troubled when they heard this. They began to ponder for another offer with wrinkled eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s expression was arrogant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, Profound Heaven Alliance had targeted and schemed behind his back multiple times. They came very close to annihilating the Horned Demon Race and him. It was impossible for him not to feel at least a bit of grudge towards them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, he just had to make their lives difficult at least once since they were begging for his aid now. He wouldn’t feel at ease otherwise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not lacking in anything. I’m not trading the crystalline war chariots for anything other than some exceptionally rare spirit materials, or materials that I’m really lacking right now,” Qin Lie said indifferently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Siyuan felt a coming headache. After a moment of consideration, he clenched his teeth in secret, coughed twice and said, “When she came home during this trip, we noticed that Tingyu seemed to have lost her… virginity. I heard that she had been staying with you all the time while she was at the Land of Chaos. Cough cough, as you know, er, Tingyu is the pearl of our Song Family…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Siyuan stopped at what he thought was the appropriate timing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Zhizhang looked absolutely astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie couldn’t help but turn red in immeasurable embarrassment upon hearing this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh, just tell sister Tingyu to come find me about Profound Heaven Alliance’s purchase of the crystalline war chariots.” After leaving behind these words, Qin Lie escaped on the crystalline war chariot at top speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really was him!” Song Siyuan shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You didn’t know?” Xie Zhizhang looked surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I seriously did not.” Song Siyuan’s expression was odd, “We could see that Tingyu was no longer a virgin from both her appearance and movements. But well… it’s inconvenient to ask about such things, so we simply never voiced our thoughts, just guessed that it may have had something to do with Qin Lie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a pause, Song Siyuan’s eyes gradually lit up. “I wasn’t sure if it was Qin Lie either. I was just trying to see if I can trick him, and… it actually worked!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Siyuan snorted and exclaimed in anger, “Damn that little bastard Qin Lie! How dare he put such airs before me when he had that kind of relationship with Tingyu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see you’re pretty pleased, aren’t you?” Xie Zhizhang curled his lips and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pleased about what?” Song Siyuan frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pleased that Tingyu’s lover is Qin Lie, of course.” Xie Zhizhang said enviously. “Jingxuan… is so, so much more inferior to Tingyu in this aspect. Although she knew Qin Lie earlier than Tingyu, her skin was so thin that she just couldn’t force herself upon Qin Lie knowing that he shared a love relationship with that Ling Family girl…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you taking a dig at me?” Song Siyuan snorted. “Why do I sense a bit of jealousy from your tone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because I am envious alright!” Xie Zhizhang rolled his eyes at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>After departing from Dark Asura Hall and a moment of hesitation, Qin Lie suddenly flew towards Herb Mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He rarely got to come back, so he wished to walk around Herb Mountain, stay in Ling Town for a day or two, and recall the olden days for a bit before returning to the Land of Chaos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Herb Mountain and Ling Town belonged to Nebula Pavilion’s domain, so naturally they weren’t too far away from Dark Asura Hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It only took him two hours of flight on crystalline war chariot to reach the night sky above Herb Mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie looked down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Herb Mountain had long since turned into a pile of rubble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two years ago, the Ling Family and Horned Demon Race clansmen had teleported to the Nether Continent through the teleportation formation inside Herb Mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the teleportation process had ended, the formation had exploded immediately, causing the entire Herb Mountain to collapse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Herb Mountain had disappeared, and Ling Town was the only site that was left intact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie watched a little while longer under the dim moon before he flew towards Ling Town on the crystalline war chariot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a moment of observation, he actually discovered a weak light pouring out of the small buildings of Ling Town.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie was surprised internally as he withdrew the crystalline war chariot and sneaked his way into Ling Town. he wanted to see who it was that had visited Ling Town after such a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carefully hiding himself, Qin Lie arrived at the small buildings with weak lighting, moved near a window and looked inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only a single glance, but his body shook slightly as an immeasurably conflicted look sprung up his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He saw Liu Ting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
