 <p><b>Chapter 721: Snatching Food</b></p>
 <p><span style>“Boom boom boom!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dull explosions accompanied by shocking noise and energy erupted from inside the colorful clouds. Flames, rocks, icicles and metal were constantly flying out of the clouds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were a lot of flying spirit artifacts, flying carriages, war chariots, and spirit birds that were flying about seemingly in search of something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the mountains’ surface, there were places constantly exploding. Some of the mountains straight up exploded after a falling foreign object from the sky crushed them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s the flag of Heaven Martial Association and Jewel Flame Manor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they got closer to the groups, Qin Lie concentrated and discovered that the flags on the big flying spirit artifacts hovering in midair obviously belonged to the Heaven Martial Association and Jewel Flame Manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What surprised him even more was the fact that Heaven Martial Association and Jewel Flame Manor were arguing so heatedly that they looked like they would break out in war at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Swoosh swoosh swoosh! Swoosh swoosh swoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The six Spirits of Void and Chaos interrupted the scene at this precise moment and charged towards the mountain ranges on the ground abruptly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Heaven Martial Association and Jewel Flame Manor martial practitioners were still yelling angrily and threatening each other loudly in a stalemate when this happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they saw the six unusual lights flying towards them, the martial practitioners on both sides changed their expressions slightly and began roaring at each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Qin Lie’s crystalline war chariot could enter this land for real, the Martial Heaven Association and Jewel Flame Manor martial practitioners suddenly couldn’t restrain themselves any longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A fierce battle was instantly drawn between the two parties.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?” Lin Liang’er opened her eyes and stared at the battle zone far away while standing. “What are those people fighting for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie was also confused by this, so he shook his head and said, “I don’t know.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While they were chatting with each other, the crystalline war chariot continued to streak swiftly across the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Behind the six Spirits of Void and Chaos, the crystalline war chariot also flew head first into the combat zone and arrived at a point beneath the dark red sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An incredibly oppressive aura was emanating from the dark red sky. When he paid attention to it, he noticed that spatial rifts were appearing and closing non stop inside those exploding clouds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Through the tiny spatial rifts, he could look into the space outside and see terrifying changes outside the realm. He could see giant rocks being hurled around and black dots of ink wriggling through them. A terrifying destructive presence capable of eradicating all life emanated from the them. On the other side he could see colorful wind currents wrapping around giant gray brown rocks, swiftly grinding each and every one of them to dust.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A giant, gray colored rock exploded, and a crystal about the size of a thumb appeared from the scattering pieces of rock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tiny crystal was bright red and translucent. It looked like a blood red cornelian that was sparkling with bewitching luster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crystal shot out of the spatial rift abruptly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Starfire Crystal! A Heaven Grade six spirit material!” A Heaven Martial Association elder riding on top of a Fire Crow King exclaimed involuntarily with shiny eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Snatch it!” a big man of Jewel Flame Manor with dark red flame patterns tattooed above his neck shouted from above a flying carriage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both the fighting martial practitioners of Heaven Martial Association and Jewel Flame Manor responded to the call and got close to that falling crystal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tiny blood red crystals dragged tiny tails of fire behind them when they fell from the sky, dazzling like fiery red silk or sparks of a falling meteor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie was attracted by it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though he took no action, his blood gave off a strong reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He immediately understood that the tiny crystal would have an effect on his bloodline power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was drawn to the crystal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But before he could do anything about it, a familiar beam of fiery light took on solid form and popped into existence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tiny fire attribute Spirit of Void and Chaos in the shape of a pocket-sized Fire Qilin abruptly pounced onto the crystal, clutched it tightly and swallowed it into its stomach.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second the crystal entered its stomach, the Fire Qilin’s flames swiftly transformed into vague virtual form before it continued to fall towards the mountain range below as a beam of fiery light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the hell is that thing?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The martial practitioners of both Heaven Martial Association and Jewel Flame Manor shouted in irritation when they saw that the Starfire Crystal was snatched away by a foreign entity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those people on their bizarre array of small flying spirit artifacts locked onto the fire spirit of Void and Chaos and charged towards the mountain range. The wanted to reclaim the Starfire Crystal that had been taken away by the little qilin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s attention was also focused onto the fire attribute spirit of Void and Chaos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He noticed that the palm-sized Fire Qilin had vanished into one of the many giant holes on the mountain ranges after it had taken on a spirit form.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The martial practitioners on the sky kept chasing after it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other side, he noticed that the rest of the Spirits of Void and Chaos were scattered at different locations of the mountain ranges. Some of them were waiting in front of the spatial rifts as if they were waiting for that one moment when a precious crystal would appear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boom!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A giant blue rock escaped a spatial rift and rammed into the tip of a mountain peak below.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The giant rock was a white, jade-like water crystal in the appearance of a teardrop suddenly flew out of the rock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The water Spirit of Void and Chaos flew over from a faraway distance and swallowed it in one gulp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Extreme joy rose from the depths of its soul, and it was so clear that Qin Lie could sense it even from so far away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie continued to observe them for a little while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He discovered that the spatial rifts would occasionally be torn open, followed by the bizarre explosions in the sky, and that all kinds of strange rocks would explode in the outer space, sending debris through the spatial rifts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Out of dozens of these rocks, one would contain a special crystal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason the six Spirits of Void and Chaos had travelled here from from hundreds of kilometers away was to obtain these crystals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heaven Martial Association and Jewel Flame Manor were also gathered here for the same reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, their perceptions were obviously worse when compared to the six Spirits of Void and Chaos. They didn’t know which giant rock would contain an extraordinary crystal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Spirits of Void and Chaos could detect them clearly though.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They would always lock onto a particular target and wait at the right position even before the giant rocks exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They knew which rock would contain the objects they wanted before they even exploded, so they were always able to get a headstart on Heaven Martial Association and Jewel Flame Manor and snatch the spirit crystals they greatly desired. Then, they immediately swallowed the crystals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The six Spirits of Void and Chaos grew more and more excited as their circulated their natural talents with practiced motions and alternated between real and virtual form swiftly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every time a bizarre crystal that contained one of the six attribute energies they desired had emerged from the spatial rifts, a spirit of Void and Chaos would appear in time to grab it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The martial practitioners of Heaven Martial Association and Jewel Flame Manor slowly figured out the truth after losing the crystals to the Spirits of Void and Chaos again and again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Follow those six things! They can lock onto a target ahead of us!” The Heaven Martial Association elder riding atop the Fire Crow King ordered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person in charge in Jewel Flame Manor also ordered loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The martial practitioners of both parties put down everything and flew around while keeping a tight watch on the six Spirits of Void and Chaos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another giant rock exploded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A light of excitement appeared in Lin Liang’er’s eyes. “What a pure ice attribute crystal!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A block of bone-chilling ice the size of a walnut appeared from the exploded rock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie cultivated the Frost Arts, so he could sense the aura of absolute frost inside that crystal even though he was hundreds of meters away from it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I may not know what that crystal is called, but I know that it’ll aid me greatly in my cultivation!” Lin Liang’er grew excited and actually charged towards the frost crystal before Qin Lie could say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The frost attribute crystal was obviously of no value to the six Spirits of Void and Chaos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>None of them were of the frost attribute after all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Another snatcher has shown up!” The Heaven Martial Association elder on top of the Fire Crow King tossed out a burning red flag with a darkened expression when he saw Lin Liang’er charging towards their direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The flag was engraved with a group of life-like fire crows, and it transformed into a sea of flames that barred Lin Liang’er’s path like a wall of fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fire crows on the flag squirmed as if they would fly out at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh whoosh whoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fire crows on the flag suddenly sprayed out fiery light that engulfed Lin Liang’er in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Foolish cur!” the elder above riding the Fire Crow King snortd coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie shook his head and revealed a calm smile. He knew that Lin Liang’er wouldn’t be taken out this easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That Heaven Martial Association elder was only at the later stage of the Fulfillment Realm, and that Rank Six Fire Crow King didn’t possess exceptional combat strength either. Even while in human form, there was no way in hell the Ice Phoenix would be burned to death by their flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Frost Wings!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cold icicles came into existence from behind Lin Liang’er as they transformed into ice wings that contained the power of frost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Liang’er in her human form flapped her ice, crystalline wings lithely and flew out of the flames without hurry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Absolute Frost Storm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a flap of her wings, cold icicles fired themselves at the Heaven Martial Association elder atop the Fire Crow King like arrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Fire Crow King instinctively sensed great danger and hastily dodged out of the way, howling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The flag with many fire crows sewn on it transformed into a single burning crow that protected the Fire Crow King’s back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fire and ice collided with each other, several icicles coming out on top and breaking through the seal, charging after the Fire Crow King relentlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Fire Crow King and the Heaven Martial Association elder screamed as they retreated to the main group of Heaven Martial Association martial practitioners quite tragically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Multiple spirit artifacts soared into the sky enveloped in prismatic spirit energies as they clashed against the frost icicles and aided the elder in escaping his predicament.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Liang’er twisted her figure once as new wings of ice condensed behind her back. She cast a disdainful glance at the Heaven Martial Association martial practitioners before she flapped her wings again and chased after the crystal of absolute frost falling towards the mountain range.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie rubbed his chin and looked on with the cool eye of a bystander. He had no intentions of interfering with this fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had already noticed that neither Heaven Martial Association nor Jewel Flame Manor had high level martial practitioners in this area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The strongest experts on both sides were only at the late stage of the Fulfillment Realm, and none of them were able to take flight with their own strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This meant that none of them were in the Fragmentation Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If they were not in the Fragmentation Realm, then they practically posed no threat to him.</span></p>
