 <p><b>Chapter 619: Unspoken Rules</b></p>
 <p>After being confirmed by Terminator Sect, Heavenly Sword Mountain, and Illusory Demon Sect, news of Blood Fiend Sect having been re-established in the Setting Sun Islands quickly spread through the Land of Chaos.</p>
 <p>Information spread through the nine great Silver rank forces as if it had wings, informing them that a disciple of Blood Fiend Sect called Qin Lie participated in the Trial of the Graveyard of Gods, stole dozens of ancient elite remains, got his hands on the Demon Sealing Tombstone, and could control the eight god corpses.</p>
 <p>Blood Fiend Sect, the Setting Sun Islands, and Qin Lie were topics of heated discussion.</p>
 <p>Past events about Blood Fiend Sect and their history with Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families were brought up once again.</p>
 <p>Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families quickly sent experts toward the Setting Sun Islands, declaring that they were going to defeat the survivors of Blood Fiend Sect. The matter of whether or not Blood Fiend Sect was evil once again came up in discussions of the nine great Silver rank forces.</p>
 <p>When Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families collectively stated that they were going to fight everyone in Blood Fiend Sect as though they were evil, Terminator Sect, Illusory Demon Sect, and Heavenly Sword Mountain proclaimed that they believed Blood Fiend Sect was not evil.</p>
 <p>Terminator Sect, Heavenly Sword Mountain, and Illusory Demon Sect warned all the forces that any attack on and slander about Blood Fiend Sect would result in severe consequences.</p>
 <p>Celestial Artifact Sect and Ten Thousand Beast Mountain were Silver rank forces that kept unusually silent about Blood Fiend Sect.</p>
 <p>Neither of them expressed any opinions.</p>
 <p>With this, the campaign of Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families suddenly wasn’t justified.</p>
 <p>A thousand years ago, the great Silver rank forces banded together to charge into the Blood Cloud Mountain Range and destroy Blood Fiend Sect. This wasn’t going to happen again.</p>
 <p>Forces of varying levels of strength originally wanted to invade the Setting Sun Islands and seize the bodies of ancient elites that had come from the Graveyard of Gods.</p>
 <p>Yet, due to the orders of Terminator Sect, Heavenly Sword Mountain, and Illusory Demon Sect, at least half of those forces did not act. A small portion of those forces also feared Blood Fiend Sect’s past reputation and also stayed calm.</p>
 <p>Only forces subordinate to Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families were restless. They had thoughts of getting a share of the spoils or currying favor with Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families, so they started traveling toward the Setting Sun Islands.</p>
 <p>These formerly unknown islands had suddenly attracted everyone’s attention. Qin Lie, Xue Li, Xue Moyan, and other names were constantly spoken of.</p>
 <p>Enormous ships made from black iron journeyed across the cast sea, advancing toward the Setting Sun Islands in a cone-shaped formation reminiscent of a vicious school of sharks.</p>
 <p>On the first ship, Guan Xian of Black Voodoo Cult stood with his hands behind his back. He wore a dark expression, and his eyes flashed with frightening cold light.</p>
 <p>A disciple of Black Voodoo Cult hurriedly came, speaking as they kneeled. “Instructor, we just received news of that floating island departing from the Setting Sun Islands.”</p>
 <p>Xiahou Qi, Su Zhi, and Lin Bin, all of whom represented the three great families in the Heavenly Fissure Continent, stood next to Guan Xian. They sighed in relief when they heard this.</p>
 <p>“The Sixth Heavenly Sword of Heavenly Sword Mountain is the most mysterious of them all. If he were at the Setting Sun Islands, things would be difficult.” Xiahou Qi’s expression relaxed.</p>
 <p>“Li Mu represents Heavenly Sword Mountain. Unless Heavenly Sword Mountain is willing to fight our four forces for Blood Fiend Sect, he has to leave.” Guan Xian snorted. “Li Mu was the one that gave that Qin Lie boy the Heavenly Sword Mountain token that allowed him to sneak into the Graveyard of Gods. Such an action has already broken the unspoken rules of the nine great Silver rank forces. If he continues to secretly interfere, he will be testing Black Voodoo Cult’s tolerance!”</p>
 <p>“Li Mu is...” Su Zhi frowned slightly.</p>
 <p>“He doesn’t usually meddle. It’s a bit suspicious that he interfered in our matter with Blood Fiend Sect for this Qin Lie.” Guan Xian was thoughtful. “Rumor has it that Heavenly Sword Mountain has connected with the Nether Realm. They recently traded for a lot of Profound Yin Nine Leaf Lotuses and Nether Hell Demonic Fruits.”</p>
 <p>“Is that connected to that Qin Lie, Brother Guan?” Su Zhi was surprised.</p>
 <p>“There seems to be some connection. I’m not sure about the specifics, so we need to continue investigating.” Guan Xian thought to himself and then said, “This time, we must completely destroy Blood Fiend Sect! All the forces in the Land of Chaos are currently paying attention to us through all sorts of ways. Failure will deal a great blow to the reputation of Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families.”</p>
 <p>“Understood.” The three people in charge of the three great families nodded.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Within Blue Moon Valley, the five valley masters of the Miao Family and numerous elders were gathered within a single hall.</p>
 <p>“We don’t need to send many people to the Pan family. Our superiors have sent messages informing us that control over the Pan Family will temporarily belong to Blue Moon Valley. Considering their current strength, they would not dare to disobey Illusory Demon Sect. They will obediently surrender.” Miao Yangxu wore a proud expression as he spoke. “I have summoned everyone because we will split up. We will attack Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion. Black Voodoo Cult does not place great importance on these two factions. Right now, they are focused on eliminating Blood Fiend Sect and do not have the attention to spare. They would not make enemies out of Illusory Demon Sect at this time.”</p>
 <p>All the Miao Family clansmen wore excited expressions.</p>
 <p>“Big Brother is right! This really is a one-in-a-thousand chance!” Miao Wenfan added. “The experts of Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion are all gone. They are now at their weakest. More importantly, Black Voodoo Cult is focused on attacking Blood Fiend Sect at the Setting Sun Islands and has no attention to spare for us!”</p>
 <p>“Silver rank forces do not interfere in fights between Copper rank forces! Even if Black Voodoo Cult comes, they will not dare to publicly break unspoken rules. Otherwise, if Illusory Demon Sect’s experts came out, they would be able to sweep through all the Copper rank vassal forces of Black Voodoo Cult!” Miao Kang laughed.</p>
 <p>“We lost Gold Sun Island, but we got the Pan Family, Heavenly Sea Pavilion, and Black Cloud Palace. I find this very profitable.” Miao Wenfan laughed loudly.</p>
 <p>“Maybe, after Black Voodoo Cult destroys Blood Fiend Sect and flattens Gold Sun Island along the way, we’ll also be able to get Gold Sun Island.” Miao Kang’s eyes lit up.</p>
 <p>The elders of the Miao Family had bright eyes when they heard the three valley masters speak.</p>
 <p>If Blue Moon Valley managed to conquer all the territory that belonged to Black Cloud Palace, Heavenly Sea Pavilion, the Pan Family, and Gold Sun Island, they would become the strongest Copper rank force under Illusory Demon Sect. They would make a great leap toward becoming a Silver rank force.</p>
 <p>“Tomorrow we will leave to attack Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion. We must conquer all the mines and spirit plant fields in a short time!” Miao Yangxu lectured.</p>
 <p>“Alright!” the members of the Miao Family promised.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Back on the Setting Sun Islands, Qin Lie spoke up with a smile on his face.</p>
 <p>“Is everyone alright?”</p>
 <p>“We’re pretty good.” Tang Siqi wore a long fiery dress. Her eyes flickered lightly. “We’ve been staying in a valley within Heavenly Sword Mountain. It’s very safe, but... a bit boring.”</p>
 <p>“It is pretty boring,” Lian Rou agreed.</p>
 <p>Both of them had decisively left the Scarlet Tide Continent and stepped into the Land of Chaos together. However, since their talent wasn’t good enough, they hadn’t been able to pass the tests and qualify to become Heavenly Sword Mountain’s disciples.</p>
 <p>Li Mu was originally going to arrange for someone to send them back to the Scarlet Tide Continent, but they didn’t want to go.</p>
 <p>They knew that, if they were with Qin Lie, they would face unpredictable danger, be tied to Blood Fiend Sect, and endure a storm of attacks. In spite of all that, they still chose to stay.</p>
 <p>“I am a member of Blood Spear. Blood Spear... is a part of Blood Fiend Sect, so I have come,” Feng Rong explained.</p>
 <p>“I came to the Land of Chaos and went to Celestial Artifact Sect to see if I can learn more about artifact forging from them.” Mo Hai wore an aloof expression. “However, since you showed us that ancient spirit diagram, I no longer feel the need to go to Celestial Artifact Sect.”</p>
 <p>“I want to explore the Land of Chaos. I came here because it’s obviously the most dangerous place,” Yi Yuan said with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Siqi is my only friend, so of course I’ll be with her,” Lian Rou said with a small smile.</p>
 <p>“And you?” Qin Lie looked at Tang Siqi.</p>
 <p>“Me?” Tang Siqi bit her lower lip and said, “I don’t know, I just came for no reason.”</p>
 <p>When she said this, a meaningful look appeared in the eyes of Mo Hai, Feng Rong, and the rest of the group.</p>
 <p>Lian Rou snorted softly. “I don’t know if she is pretending to be dumb or is really, truly dumb...”</p>
 <p>Tang Siqi bowed her head slightly, a downcast expression on her face.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie looked at Lian Rou, and then at Tang Siqi. He suddenly felt a headache coming on. He sighed inwardly and didn’t know what to do.</p>
 <p>Before Armament Sect had been destroyed, he felt that Tang Siqi had feelings for him. He was partially the reason for her leaving the Scarlet Tide Continent and coming here with Feng Rong and Mo Hai.</p>
 <p>He knew this.</p>
 <p>After a moment of thought, Qin Lie suddenly said, “Senior Sister Tang, I have recently been learning to inscribe a new spirit diagram. However, I keep on making mistakes. Why don’t you take a look at it for me later?”</p>
 <p>Tang Siqi suddenly raised her head, her eyes lighting up.</p>
