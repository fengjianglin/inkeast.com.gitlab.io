 <p><b>Chapter 728: Private Chat</b></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know, but that Tong Zhenzhen woman gives me a very dangerous feeling.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An ice crystal suddenly appeared in Lin Liang’er’s hand. She clutched the crystal tightly with her white hands and extracted the aura of absolute frost inside it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The room’s temperature fell sharply and turned icy cold in just dozens of seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie responded accordingly by circulating the Frost Arts. He quickly adapted to the frigid temperature of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Chu Li’s teeth chattered like he was back at the Forbidden Land of Ice. He had to summon his spirit energy and protect himself quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The damage to my soul has recovered by seventy percent. Just a little longer and I will have completely recovered.” Lin Liang’er held the ice crystal and thought to herself. “I suppose I can even leave now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s expression changed. “Are you afraid of her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Liang’er’s unusual reaction was entirely caused by Tong Zhenzhen. He didn’t understand why a normal-looking woman like Tong Zhenzhen could cause so much anxiety in Lin Liang’er.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I could improve further and step into rank eight, then maybe I wouldn’t be afraid of her.” Lin Liang’er looked very serious. “But now… I am a little afraid of her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Afraid of what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know, I’m just scared of her, that’s all. It’s like an instinct of sorts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Loud footsteps suddenly resounded at this exact moment, and Lin Liang’er immediately exclaimed in shock, “S-she’s coming!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie looked astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Li turned around and looked at the closely shut door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can I come in?” Tong Zhenzhen’s gentle and quiet voice rang from outside the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Liang’er subconsciously moved backwards as she shook her head repeatedly at Qin Lie. Her cold eyes was obviously filled with great fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie frowned deeply and thought for a moment. In the end, he nodded at Chu Li. “Open the door.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Li hesitated for a moment before he ignored the pale-looking Lin Liang’er and opened the door. He said respectfully, “Please come in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tong Zhenzhen walked through the door in a natural and easygoing manner. She was dressed in blue clothes with her hair tied into a bun. Her appearance was average, but her temperament was gentle. She wore a faint smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you don’t mind, may I talk privately with this little girl for a moment?” She looked at Qin Lie smilingly. She didn’t seem surprised in the least that Lin Liang’er had been “resurrected” from the “dead”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t exude any astonishing aura whatsoever. Neither Qin Lie nor Chu Li felt discomfited in the slightest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Lin Liang’er backed again and again until she pressed herself against the wall with nowhere else to retreat to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Tong, she is a very close companion of mine. I don’t want anything bad to happen to her!” Qin Lie said solemnly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An odd light flashed past Lin Liang’er’s panicking and fearful eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, I harbor no malice towards her. In fact, you may say that my arrival is… beneficial to her.” Tong Zhenzhen smiled softly and indicated Qin Lie to not worry with her eyes. “I know that Nan Zhengtian values you greatly, and I know how important you are to the Blood Fiend Sect. I wouldn’t act recklessly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie looked deeply at her and fell into ponderment. Then, he turned around and looked at Lin Liang’er. “I’ll be waiting outside.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, he nodded at Chu Li and went out of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After his initial surprise, Chu Li reacted and joined Qin Lie in leaving the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please close the door, Chu Li,” Tong Zhenzhen instructed softly with her back facing the duo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay.” Chu Li obediently did as she asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment they stepped out of the door, he carefully shut the door tight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that instant, both he and Qin Lie noticed at the same time that a thin film of something seemed to have enveloped the entire room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were no longer able to detect anything inside the room with their soul consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They exchanged a glance and saw the astonishment in each other’s eyes. They began to feel worried on the inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, it should be fine. Neither Senior Uncle Xu nor Senior Aunt Tong have ever done something detrimental to the sect.” Chu Li forced a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I hope it will stay that way.” Qin Lie’s face looked heavy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The duo stopped chatting and waited patiently outside the room for the conversation inside to end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They couldn’t hear nor sense anything inside the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The conversation lasted for an entire hour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Creak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door opened once more as Tong Zhenzhen walked with a small smile on her face. She nodded at Qin Lie and said, “We are done.” Then, she immediately walked away calmly with her back facing the duo, saying, “Chu Li, you should leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Li took a look inside and found Lin Liang’er sitting as still as an ice sculpture inside. Her expression looked calm at least.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay,” Relaxing, Chu Li obeyed her and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie entered the room and shut the door behind him. He looked doubtfully at Lin Liang’er and asked, “She didn’t do anything to you, did she?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” Lin Liang’er answered with a bowed head. She seemed to be in deep thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did she talk with you about?” Qin Lie asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing,” Lin Liang’er brushed off the question carelessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if noticing his displeasure, Lin Liang’er looked up at Qin Lie and said, “It’s all related to the Ice Phoenix Race, and has nothing to do with you. Please don’t ask anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How did she know about the Ice Phoenix Race?” Qin Lie looked astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Liang’er looked like she wanted to say something, but held herself back and answered after a pause, “I made a promise that I won’t tell on her, so please don’t ask. I won’t answer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie grew more and more baffled by the situation. He thought for a moment and asked another question, “Are you still ready to leave immediately?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not anymore, since she holds no malice towards me. I’ll leave only after my soul injuries have healed up completely.” After saying this, Lin Liang’er added, “I need a private cultivation room. I’m going to extract all of the frost energy inside this crystal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, I’ll be outside. I won’t enter this cultivation room,” Qin Lie said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Liang’er cast a deep glance at him and said softly, “Thank you.” Then, she stood up and entered the suite’s cultivation room. She had not came out ever since.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three giant black iron ships continued to sail towards Prism Continent. Lei Yan and the other Terminator Sect members had been busy sending messages everywhere all this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Six days later, the three giant ships slowly approached Prism Continent, and began to take in refugees who had escaped from Prism Continent onto the ship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the same day, one large-sized and six smaller crystalline war chariots jointly left Prism Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The girls on the war chariots were overjoyed when they saw the three giant ships flying Terminator Sect’s flag. They hastily screamed out and greeted them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie and Chu Li happened to be standing at the edges of the ship. They were drinking wine and discussing the latest news of the invasion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie shook a little when he heard the screams and said, “Welcome those people beneath us to the ship, will you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Li looked at those distant war chariots and asked, “You know them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mn. They’re the women who used to perform ceremonial rites at Moon Worshipping Palace. We got to know each other for a bit,” Qin Lie said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone you meet is a woman,” Chu Li muttered under his nose before instructing Tao Rui, “Old Tao, can you get those girls up the ship?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll do that right away,” Tao Rui hastily flew over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A while later, the bigger crystalline war chariot carrying Yue Ji, Ye Ji, and Shui Ji landed on the ship with Tao Rui’s assistance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, thank you,” Yue Ji and the others hastily thanked them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had been on edge ever since they left Prism Continent, afraid that they would run into the outsiders and be killed. It was only when they finally got onto Terminator Sect’s ship that they finally relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t hold high positions in Moon Worshipping Palace, and Moon Worshipping Palace was just a vassal force of Terminator Sect. That was why they appeared slightly reserved and fearful when facing the martial practitioners of Terminator Sect</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you girls know Qin Lie?” Tao Rui smiled and pointed at the other side of the ship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sitting there, Qin Lie gave them a bright smile and said, “I guess you listened to my advice after all, seeing that you’re still alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are?” Yue Ji looked confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am Yao Tian.” Qin Lie waved the wine jar in his hands and took a sip of wine while smiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Ji, Ye Ji, and Shui Ji’s eyes lit up at the revelation. They all looked incredibly astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Remember what you promised me?” Qin Lie asked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only now that Yue Ji and the others finally realized that Qin Lie had been using a fake name and a fake appearance when he was staying at Moonstone City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So they’re the reason you holed yourself up inside Moonstone City?” A look of realization passed Chu Li’s face as his smile took a turn for the dirty, “I had no idea that you like mature women, and so many… are you sure you can handle all of them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You just can’t say anything that doesn’t make you sound like a scoundrel, can you?” Qin Lie scolded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Li let out an odd chuckle and instructed Tao Rui, “Prepare them some good rooms to stay in!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood.” Tao Rui also revealed a meaningful smile on his face and bowed slightly towards Yue Ji and the others, “Young Master Qin Lie is the Forefather’s honored guest, so since you know him, I will ensure that your lives are comfortable. Come with me.” Tao Rui led the way at the front.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Forefather’s honored guest? Forefather Terminator?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yue Ji, Ye Ji, and Shui Ji stared at Qin Lie talking cheerfully and wittily with Chu Li and felt like they were dreaming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They never imagined that Qin Lie was valued so highly by Terminator Sect, and that he was an honored guest of Forefather Terminator himself!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, what had they promised you?” Chu Li grinned dubiously after Yue Ji and the others left. “You’re a lot better at this than me, I see!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s nothing between us.” Qin Lie’s expression remained calm and undaunted as he changed the topic, “Has your master left his seclusion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He has. He sent a message to all Silver rank forces and requested them to send their men over to Prism Continent and deal with this crisis together.” Chu Li’s expression turned heavy again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And? Have the eight Silver rank forces made a move yet?” Qin Lie asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Li frowned deeply before shaking his head. “There has been nothing so far.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh.” Qin Lie sighed. “Since this incident happened in Terminator Sect’s domain, there are many people who may view this as an excellent opportunity. They may not necessarily do their best to help you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he said this, Chu Li’s expression grew even gloomier.</span></p>
