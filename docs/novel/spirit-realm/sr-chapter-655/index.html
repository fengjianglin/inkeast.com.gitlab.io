 <p><strong>Chapter 655: Breaking the Shield!</strong></p>
 <p>“Junior Uncle Wen, you are a member of Illusory Demon Sect. For many years, Blood Fiend Sect had survived only because of Illusory Demon Sect’s protection. Now that you’ve appeared at Blue Moon Valley, how would the Blood Fiend Sect dare raise a hand against us?” Miao Tai yelled for a moment before regaining his cool, “If Blood Fiend Sect were to act against our Blue Moon Valley now, then they will be disrespecting the Illusory Demon Sect! Master and everyone would have the perfect excuse to attack Blood Fiend Sect!”</p>
 <p>Miao Tai wasn’t stupid.</p>
 <p>He knew that Wen He must have heard something to have rushed over at this moment. That was why he had appeared to stop Blood Fiend Sect from attacking Blue Moon Valley.</p>
 <p>He knew that his Master Wen Bin and Yu Lingwei were secretly in competition. Blue Moon Valley had shared a close connection with Wen Bin for many years, and could be considered as one of his subordinates. He knew that his master wouldn’t just sit by and watch Blue Moon Valley be eliminated by Blood Fiend Sect.</p>
 <p>When Miao Yangxu and the others heard this, their eyes lit up slightly as they let out a small sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>“With you in the valley, there’s no way Blood Fiend Sect would dare act recklessly!” Miao Wenfan echoed.</p>
 <p>“I hope so,” Wen He looked calm, “Prepare yourself. Blood Fiend Sect would probably show up in the next two days. Our men will be arriving soon to aid the Miao Family in stopping Blood Fiend Sect. If they really dare recklessly, then we shall not let them off easily!”</p>
 <p>The Miao Family clansmen look inspired by this.</p>
 <p>Wen He’s guarantee meant that Wen Bin was going to protect Blue Moon Valley. If Blood Fiend Sect dared to force an offense, then they would be offending Wen Bin entirely.</p>
 <p>On the surface, Blue Moon Valley was a subordinate to Illusory Demon Sect. If Blood Fiend Sect were to attack Blue Moon Valley, then they would have enough reason to interfere with this matter, demand for a justification from Blood Fiend Sect or even attack the Setting Sun Islands.</p>
 <p>“Alright!” Miao Yangxu regained his smile.</p>
 <p>“Boom!”</p>
 <p>It was at this moment a dull boom abruptly resounded from the “Shield of Cold Moon” enveloping the entire Blue Moon Valley.</p>
 <p>Ripples of the essence of blue moon appeared on the shield, drawing exquisite patterns and sending many cold moon light scattering.</p>
 <p>“This is bad! Blue Moon Valley is being attacked!”</p>
 <p>“The Shield of Cold Moon is being attacked by a strong force!”</p>
 <p>“All Blue Moon Valley martial practitioners are to get ready for battle!”</p>
 <p>The screams of panicking martial practitioners rang from every valley for a time.</p>
 <p>The five Miao Family valley masters who were about to discuss further into things paled upon hearing this. They immediately walked out of the great hall and stared at the sky with serious looks on their faces.</p>
 <p>It was early in the morning, and two Flowing Gold Fire Phoenixes were suspended high above the clouds under the warm sunlight.</p>
 <p>A plump martial practitioner dressed in blood red robes was full of smiles as he gathered blood balls in both hands and threw them down continuously at the valley.</p>
 <p>The balls of bloody light contained a tremendous amount of blood spirit energy. They immediately caused intense explosions the moment the hit the Shield of Cold Moon protecting the valley.</p>
 <p>The Shield of Cold Moon was like a flipped bowl that enveloped the entire Blue Moon Valley. Its surface was circulating with countless blue moonlight as it canceled out the blood ball’s blood energy again and again.</p>
 <p>“Hong Bowen!”</p>
 <p>“One of Blood Fiend Sect’s Ten Blood Fiend Elders!”</p>
 <p>Many elderly Miao Family martial practitioners inside the valley were all panicking and crying out uncontrollably the moment they saw the smiling fat man.</p>
 <p>Miao Yangxu, Miao Wenfan and the others wore dark looks on their faces.</p>
 <p>They didn’t think that Blood Fiend Sect’s vengeance would arrive so quickly.</p>
 <p>“This Great Sect Protecting Formation isn’t bad. It hasn’t shattered immediately even though Elder Hong was attacking it nonstop,” Qin Lie exclaimed in slight astonishment as he observed the scene from above the fire phoenix.</p>
 <p>“Blue Moon Valley’s Shield of Cold Moon could defend against a Nirvana Realm expert’s wild attacks. It was able to keep even a second stage Nirvana Realm expert like Elder Hong from breaking it immediately,” Xing Yuyuan looked envious, “We should construct a similar shield on the Setting Sun Islands too. This way, we should have some time to prepare ourselves as long as we’re not facing a martial practitioner that is far beyond our level.”</p>
 <p>“Old Meng!” Hong Bowen exclaimed.</p>
 <p>Meng Feng of the Ten Blood Fiend Elders also appeared from another Flowing Gold Fire Phoenix after he heard Hong Bowen’s summons for him. He dropped down from above and stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Hong Bowen.</p>
 <p>Without much hesitation, Meng Feng attacked the shield immediately with balls of bloody light himself.</p>
 <p>Balls of bloody light that looked like little suns that were soaked in blood were tossed down in succession by Hong Bowen and Meng Feng on the Shield of Cold Moon.</p>
 <p>The Miao Family had spent many years and spirit materials to create the Shield of Cold Moon. The energy and light of the shield’s surface were distorted again and again under the continuous attack.</p>
 <p>After Hong Bowen and Meng Feng had joined hands with each other, the explosive power and impact of the balls of bloody light instantly skyrocketed. This caused the Shield of Cold Moon to shrink quickly to a third of its original size.</p>
 <p>This was a sign that the Shield of Cold Moon was swiftly depleting its energy resources.</p>
 <p>“Elder Wen!” Miao Yangxu’s expression looked heavy, “The Shield of Cold Moon wouldn’t be able to hold out much longer. Please act now and help the Miao Family avert this disaster!”</p>
 <p>“There is no need for haste. Let Hong Bowen and Meng Feng deplete their strength by attacking the Shield of Cold Moon,” Wen He still hadn’t walked out of the valley’s secret hall as he watched the situation outside through the window. He sent a message to Miao Yangxu and said, “I am only at the second stage of Nirvana Realm too. My strength is at most equal to theirs. It will be difficult for me to beat them one on two if they are at perfect condition.”</p>
 <p>“They…” Miao Yangxu looked like he wanted to say something.</p>
 <p>Although they were quite far apart, Miao Yangxu still noticed at a single glance with his eyesight that Hong Bowen and Meng Feng were carrying dried blood on their bodies.</p>
 <p>When he connected this with the big battle Hong Bowen and Meng Feng had experienced earlier, he knew that neither of them were at their peak strength right now.</p>
 <p>There was no way a Nirvana Realm expert could recover in a short time after going through an intense battle, even with the help of pills.</p>
 <p>Hong Bowen and Meng Feng must have exhausted a tremendous amount of spirit energy when they fought with all their might against Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families. The blood trace on their body also meant that they were injured.</p>
 <p>In this situation, neither Hong Bowen nor Meng Feng were necessarily a match for Wen He. However, Wen he still wasn’t willing to show up.</p>
 <p>He still wanted Blue Moon Valley to exhaust their cold moon energy.</p>
 <p>Blue Moon Valley’s Shield of Cold Moon relied on absorbing the essence of moonlight to restore its strength. It had taken them over several hundred years of accumulation to store up this much moon energy. If Hong Bowen and Meng Feng were to deplete all of their moon energy, then the Shield of Cold Moon wouldn’t be able to function for a short time and protect Blue Moon Valley.</p>
 <p>That was why Miao Yangxu had hoped that Wen He could act sooner.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, that wasn’t Wen He’s wish.</p>
 <p>All Miao Family clansmen were looking up from the valley and watching Hong Bowen and Meng Feng throwing blood balls at the Shield of Cold Moon again and again. They watched as the shield shrink gradually and eat into its resources of cold moon energy.</p>
 <p>They were all feeling anxious inside.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie drove a crystalline war chariot over and dropped down from the Flowing Gold Fire Phoenix. He approached Blue Moon Valley and frowned as he watched the scene inside the valley. He also paid close attention to the changes in the Shield of Cold Moon as the blood balls landed on them.</p>
 <p>After observing for a moment, Qin Lie said, “Elder Hong, Elder Meng, please rest for a moment.”</p>
 <p>Hong Bowen and Meng Feng looked surprised by this.</p>
 <p>“Let me try,” Qin Lie offered on his own accord.</p>
 <p>“You?” Meng Feng frowned slightly, “A Great Sect Protecting Formation like this must be taken down through a series of continuous, powerful attacks. There are no ways to circumvent it. Your… realm is a little too weak, so you may not be able to deplete their moon energy reserves even if you were to attack at full force.”</p>
 <p>While they did doubt his capabilities, Meng Feng and Hong Bowen ultimately chose to stop their attacks.</p>
 <p>Sitting on the crystalline war chariot, Qin Lie cast a glance at the Shield of Cold Moon beneath them and summoned the eight slabs of Thunderblitz wood suddenly after a brief moment of hesitation.</p>
 <p>Back at the thunder lagoon, the eight slabs of Thunderblitz woods he snatched from the eastern barbarians all looked like stone pillars that supported the sky itself. They were not only as tough as steel and stone, but they had also absorbed a tremendous amount of thunder energy form the thunder lagoon.</p>
 <p>These eight slabs of Thunderblitz woods suddenly boomed continuously with thunder as Qin Lie’s soul consciousness brought them to life.</p>
 <p>The eight slabs of Thunderblitz woods abruptly crashed into the Shield of Cold Moon and fired billions of thunder and lightning from their bodies at once. The enveloped and attacked all the scattered moon energy on the shield’s surface.</p>
 <p>“Zzzt zzt zzzt!”</p>
 <p>The Shield of Cold Moon was overrun with blue lightning, and the Shield of Cold Moon actually began shrinking at a visible rate!</p>
 <p>A large amount of moon energy were being swiftly depleted under the assault of the Thunderblitz wood!</p>
 <p>Every Miao Family clansmen wore ugly looks on their faces when they saw this.</p>
 <p>“Elder Wen!” Miao Yangxu couldn’t help but cry out once more.</p>
 <p>“Eight slabs of Thunderblitz woods all around a thousand years old of age! These eight slabs of Thunderblitz wood could absorb thunder and lightning by nature, and the amount of thunderous energy they contained are extremely terrifying!” Hong Bowen was shocked as he exclaimed, “Even we wouldn’t be able to endure the attacks of these eight slabs of Thunderblitz woods at once if we were to stand at one place!”</p>
 <p>Meng Feng was filled with astonishment. “This kid sure has a lot of hidden methods!”</p>
