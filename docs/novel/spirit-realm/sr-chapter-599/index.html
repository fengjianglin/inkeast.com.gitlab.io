 <p><b>Chapter 599: New Direction</b></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie wasn’t surprised that both Xing Yumiao and Xiang Xi decided to join Blood Fiend Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the two of them agreed on the general direction, Qin Lie left all of the logistics for them to discuss and figure out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He believed that Xing Yumiao would treat Xiang Xi fairly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiang Xi, Xu Changsheng, and Xu Jiadong represented the old guard of Gold Sun Island. Although their power wasn’t too impressive with only Xiang Xi in the Fragmentation Realm, this faction definitely couldn’t be dismissed. Without them, Gold Sun Island’s overall strength would drop tremendously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Xiang Xi and his men ended up leaving, Gold Sun Island could very well drop in rank from Copper to Black Iron.</span></p>
 <p><span style>—The Xing brothers definitely wanted to avoid such a result.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Yumiao was determined to take revenge. He and the rest of the Xing Family wanted to fight their way into the Heavenly Calamity Continent and wipe every trace of the three great families from existence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gold Sun Island had far from enough strength to accomplish that, and it certainly couldn’t afford to lose any more than it currently had.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In light of this, Qin Lie believed that Xing Yumiao would mend his relationship with Xiang Xi, which would, of course, require Xiang Xi to do the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The island envoys under Xiang Xi’s command oversaw the Setting Sun Islands. Qin Lie requested an island for his group to have to themselves, and the island they were given had a dozen stone towers for the six of them to live in for the time being. Each of them took up residence in a tower of their own.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since they no longer needed to hide their identities, Qin Lie could work on refining blood essences within a room of his stone tower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After focusing on using the Blood Refinement Art for five days, Qin Le completely refined the nine essences of the metal, earth, and water spirits and fused them with his own blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh…!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as he did, the Soul Suppressing Orb in the space between Qin Lie’s eyebrows roared to life with a powerful sucking force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Soul Suppressing Orb sucked the nine freshly refined blood essences and large amounts of his soul energy and blood inside of it, storing it within the restricted area that Qin Lie’s soul consciousness couldn’t enter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie withered as the sensation of his soul energy and blood being sucked away utterly terrified him once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since she was nearby, Xue Moyan could sense the abnormal movement of his blood energy and immediately rushed over. Xie Jingxuan detected the strange activity in his life force as well and arrived with Song Tingyu in tow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three women hurried into Qin Lie’s tower and quickly gathered within his room. His ashen face and lethargic eyes greeted them, a clear indicator that he had lost a great deal of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All three of them had fought by his side in the Graveyard of Gods, and an odd realization set in when they saw his condition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this situation similar to your previous one?” Song Tingyu asked. She seemed more surprised than shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Moyan and Xie Jingxuan weren’t worried either. Instead, they displayed curiosity and palpable excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The blood essences of the three spirits were absorbed,” Qin Lie said. “They mixed with my soul energy, my blood, and flowed… here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie pointed at the space between his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is good.” Xie Jingxuan spoke with a calm, yet serious voice. “Three more miraculous entities will be born soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This probably isn’t bad news,” Xue Moyan said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Before they’re born, however, you will need to provide soul energy and blood to nurture them. Doing so will leave you weak for a while.” Song Tingyu thought to herself then silently took out the soul crystals she had in her spatial ring. “Here. These are all the soul crystals I have left.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone aside from Qin Lie had gathered large amounts of soul crystals from the bottom of the Thunder Lagoon. Yet Qin Lie’s refinement of the blood essences, as well as the drain on his soul energy and blood, forced all of them to give him soul crystals to help him recover as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of the three women, Song Tingyu had naturally been the most generous with her soul crystals and provided him with the largest amount each time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that Qin Lie found himself in the same situation as before, she knew that he would need an obscene amount of soul crystals. Only this would help Qin Lie bring the three new beings to life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After taking out all of her soul crystals and piling them before Qin Lie, Song Tingyu looked at Xue Moyan and Xie Jingxuan with her alluring eyes, a soft smile playing at her lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A long moment passed before Xue Moyan and Xie Jingxuan took out half of the soul crystals they had in their spatial rings, letting them pour to the floor in front of Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, that should be enough,” Song Tingyu exclaimed, a smile blooming on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie casually stored the soul crystals into his own spatial ring without a word, leaving only two of them in each hand. As he absorbed soul energy from the two crystals, he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We won’t be going to the destination we agreed on earlier.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-what did you just say?” Xue Moyan sputtered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We will not be going to Blood Fiend Sect yet!” Qin Lie growled. “We will first head to Gold Sun Island and use it as a base of operations!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three women stared at him in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our identities will be exposed soon, and the fact that we are with Gold Sun Island probably won’t be a secret much longer.” Qin Lie paused in contemplation, then continued, “Blood Fiend Sect’s current location is an extremely well kept secret. I believe that even Illusory Demon Sect has no clue where it is. We should only go there if we have no other option and keep it as a last resort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Though you should travel there soon, Senior Sister. Take the body of the Blood Progenitor so that Senior Xue Li can merge with it,” he said. “You should also tell your master about your true identity as a member of Blood Fiend Sect. Try and persuade her to…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no need for persuasion,” Xue Moyan said, casually interrupting Qin Lie. “My master is already aware of my origins.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She is?” Qin Lie asked in astonishment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t need to worry about Illusory Demon Sect,” Xue Moyan declared confidently. “Gold Sun Island serving Blood Fiend Sect won’t be a problem. My master and the sect will not cause any trouble.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie gave her a profound look and nodded softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like our situation isn’t as bad as I thought.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Moyan’s attitude told Qin Lie that Illusory Demon Sect’s sect master wasn’t hostile toward Blood Fiend Sect. In fact, she actually seemed protective of it. As this occurred to him, his mind started racing. He realized that, when Blood Fiend Sect faced extermination a thousand years ago, Mo Lingye and the elders of Blood Fiend Sect fled toward the Heavenly Slaughter Continent—</span></p>
 <p><span style>—toward territories under Illusory Demon Sect’s control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie thought everything over carefully, a theory gradually forming in his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He became more and more certain that the sect master of Illusory Demon Sect had hidden ties to Blood Fiend Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Qin Lie thought this, Xue Moyan glanced at Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a bit of hesitation, she said, “My master and my mother… when they were traveling the world together, they became as close as sisters. Back then, my master wasn’t in charge of Illusory Demon Sect and Blood Fiend Sect wasn’t hated by all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s eyes lit up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Before Blood Fiend Sect had been surrounded and massacred, my mother received an urgent message from my master and left with elders of Blood Fiend Sect,” Xue Moyan explained in a soft voice. “With my master’s help, they escaped to the Heavenly Slaughter Continent…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu Lingwei was the reason Blood Fiend Sect managed to survive. She had even arranged Blood Fiend Sect’s current clandestine existence. That seemed to explain why Illusory Demon Sect wouldn’t have a problem with Gold Sun Island becoming Blood Fiend Sect’s vassal force once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gold Sun Island, Blue Moon Valley, and other smaller forces were able to establish themselves in the Heavenly Slaughter Continent because they received protection from Illusory Demon Sect. Protection that my master provided on behalf of Blood Fiend Sect,” Xue Moyan said. “My master promised that, if they wanted to serve Blood Fiend Sect once more, she would support me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have an excellent master!” Qin Lie exclaimed, his eyes trembling with approval.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Moyan smiled softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That means Illusory Demon Sect will help us instead of being a threat, and we’ll have more support!” Qin Lie said, rubbing his chin. “With Luo Chen and Du Xiangyang’s haul of six bodies of ancient elites, along with Uncle Li’s presence, Heavenly Sword Mountain won’t be an enemy either. Of the six great Silver rank forces, two will be on our side.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t you mean nine?” Xue Moyan asked reflexively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you’re talking about the three great families, they do not qualify!” Qin Lie replied with a shake of his head, his lips curling into a cruel smile. “Only Terminator Sect, Black Voodoo Cult, Illusory Demon Sect, Heavenly Sword Mountain, Celestial Artifact Sect, and Ten Thousand Beast Mountain are the real overlords of the Land of Chaos. The three great families together probably wouldn’t be even be able to contend with a single one!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Moyan considered this for a while, then nodded and said, “That’s true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everything is much simpler now.” Qin Lie could feel his thoughts become more and more lively. “Chu Li wouldn’t die so easily, and as long as he’s still alive, I have three bodies of ancient elites for him! He also said he’d get me an audience with Forefather Terminator. If I meet him, I believe that I can get him to support Blood Fiend Sect! Then it is much simpler.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone’s eyes lit up with excitement the second he said this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Zhuzhe conspired with Celestial Artifact Sect, and Ten Thousand Beast Mountain was also involved. Neither of the two are blameless, so how would they be able to blame us?” Qin Lie asked with a snort. “In my opinion, both forces are ignoring Blood Fiend Sect like a poisonous tumor that they just had removed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The way you’re putting it, it seems like only Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families will be trying to kill us.” Song Tingyu laughed softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After all these years, they still haven’t given up on hunting Blood Fiend Sect down,” Xue Moyan said. “They really are the only ones we need to worry about.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehehe…” The warmth of excitement spread throughout Qin Lie’s body as the situation became clear. “It seems like we’re in a better spot than we thought.”</span></p>
