 <p><strong>Chapter 614: Banquet</strong></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie returned to Setting Sun Island half a day later.</span></p>
 <p><span>Two days after that, Luo Nan and Yan Baiyi of Heavenly Sword Mountain finally arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span>Terminator Sect, Heavenly Sword Mountai, and Illusory Demon Sect all gathered on the island within Setting Sun Island where the bodies of ancient elites were displayed.</span></p>
 <p><span>“You are Qin Lie?” Shi Xiuling asked, a faint beautiful smile on her lips. She wore a long dress sewn with crystals that encased her seductive body. Upon seeing Qin Lie, she called out a greeting</span></p>
 <p><span>“Senior…Shi?” Qin Lie’s attitude was respectful.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It’s me.” Shi Xiuling laughed softly and said, “I came to retrieve one of the ancient elite bodies.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie looked at her questioningly.</span></p>
 <p><span>“According to how you’ve decided to split the spoils, Xue Moyan receives three. However, Blood Fiend Sect should need more, so we will only take one of the bodies of the ancient elites. The other two are Xue Moyan’s to begin with, so they belong to Blood Fiend Sect,” Shi Xiuling explained with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I understand.” Qin Lie was slightly surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span>He could tell just from Shi Xiuling’s words that Yu Lingwei of Illusory Demon Sect was very good to Blood Fiend Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span>“We will only take one of the bodies. But... right now, Blue Moon Valley is temporarily managing the Pan Family’s territories,” Shi Xiuling spoke again.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie paused.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The Pan Family wanted the bodies, tried to kill Xue Moyan, but were heavily wounded by you instead. Illusory Demon Sect will not pursue this matter. However, the Pan Family is a subordinate force of Illusory Demon Sect. Now that they suffer from great losses and cannot control their territories, it is naturally up to Illusory Demon Sect to make arrangements,” Shi Xiuling said slowly. “Gold Sun Island has left Illusory Demon Sect and returned to Blood Fiend Sect once again, so it is no longer ours. The Pan Family’s territories also cannot be kept by Gold Sun Island. Otherwise, it will cause conflict between Illusory Demon Sect and Blood Fiend Sect.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie thought it over before asking, “What about Black Cloud Palace and Heaven Sea Pavilion?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Ha!” Shi Xiuling laughed. “They belong to Black Voodoo Cult. We want people to fight. As long as you do not fear Black Voodoo Cult, we don’t care what you do.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“If… Blue Moon Valley moves against Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion, what should we do?” Qin Lie asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>Shi Xiuling’s smile did not fade. She thought for a moment, then said, “I suggest you temporarily not move and prioritize protecting Setting Sun Island and Gold Sun Island. I can tell you with great certainty that the three families and Black Voodoo Cult are preparing. Hm, let’s put it this way. When Terminator Sect, Heavenly Sword Sect, and our members leave Setting Sun Island, you will immediately be attacked by those people.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie’s mood immediately dropped.</span></p>
 <p><span>He did not speak again on the journey, riding the crystal chariot to the island.</span></p>
 <p><span>Looking down at the ground, he saw Chu Li, <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hester</span>, and Lei Yan, as well as the people from Heavenly Sword Mountain take the ancient elite bodies under Luo Chen’s and Du Xiangyang’s directions.</span></p>
 <p><span>After coming over, Shi Xiuling laughed, then flew away.</span></p>
 <p><span>The three Silver forces moved through the valley as they collected the bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span>Xing Yumiao, Xiang Xi, and the others carefully kept them company.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie moved the crystal chariot next to Song Tingyu and focused on her.</span></p>
 <p><span>A vicious ripple from below startled Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span>Floating behind Song Tingyu was the shadow of a ferocious beast hundreds of meters tall, seemingly roaring as it exuded an intimidating aura.</span></p>
 <p><span>That ancient beast’s bones gradually grayed, as if they were completely corroded by time.</span></p>
 <p><span>Releasing his soul consciousness, Qin Lie could feel that there wasn’t a wisp of power left inside the ancient beast’s bones.</span></p>
 <p><span>Song Tingyu silently sat below the beast’s bones, cracks forming on its surface as the sea wind blew.</span></p>
 <p><span>In the time it took her to absorb the energy from the skeleton, Song Tingyu had clearly mastered the mysteries within it.</span></p>
 <p><span>Song Tingyu’s lips curved into a smile the moment she detected Qin Lie’s arrival. She opened her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>Her body naturally exuded a vast, ancient, savage aura.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie suddenly felt as though he were facing a fierce ancient beast.</span></p>
 <p><span>“You seemed to have great gains?” Qin Lie said in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span>“This beast is called the Eight-eyed Lion. A wondrous inheritance within its bones records the method to refine them. I slowly extracted the power inside the bones, and absorbed it into my own. This way, I can form the shadow of the beast and possess its stored aura.” Song Tingyu’s beautiful eyes brightened as she happily continued, “This is similar to Gao Yu’s Evil God’s shadow. Through the energy of the beast, I can cast special spirit arts and use the beast’s power to strengthen my body.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“You haven’t reached the Fulfillment Realm due to this?” Qin Lie was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I’m deliberately suppressing it. I plan to break through after comprehending the mysteries behind the inheritance.” Song Tingyu had a proud expression. “I can break into the Fulfillment Realm anytime I want!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“So, you obtained great benefits from this beast’s remains?” Qin Lie also smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Of course!” Song Tingyu was clearly excited. She then asked, “Why didn’t you find a suitable ancient elite body and receive its power and inheritance?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie suddenly became silent.</span></p>
 <p><span>A long while later, he said, “The inheritances hidden within the bodies of the ancient elites aren’t suitable for me. Also…”</span></p>
 <p><span>“What?” Song Tingyu asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I can’t get anything from their bodies. Previously, I found the Demon Sealing Tombstone in the place where the bodies first landed and used it to open their defensive barriers. Then…” Qin Lie thought back to the scene and said, “The Demon Sealing Tombstone repelled them. It doesn’t want me to take the power and inheritance from those bodies.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Song Tingyu was shocked. “How can this be?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“I don’t know.” Qin Lie shook his head and said, “I’ve always felt that, rather than those ancient elite bodies, what truly belongs to me is within the Demon Sealing Tombstone!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Inside the Demon Sealing Tombstone?” Song Tingyu’s beautiful eyes were full of light.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It’s a strange feeling,” Qin Lie smiled. “Of course, I’m not a hundred percent sure since I have yet to fully understand all the mysteries behind the Demon Sealing Tombstone. In short, this Demon Sealing Tombstone prevents me from receiving the power and inheritance within these bodies.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“In its view, it may think that the left behind inheritances aren’t suited for you to cultivate. There must be some deeper meaning. It seems you need to spend more effort studying the Demon Sealing Tombstone,” Song Tingyu suggested.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie grimaced.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Soul Suppressing Orb hidden deep between his brows already contained too many mysteries he couldn’t wrap his head around.</span></p>
 <p><span>It had taken him a decade to finally reach the third level of the Soul Suppressing Orb and see the enormous, spider-like spirit diagram. He had yet to understand how the Spirits of Void and Chaos had formed.</span></p>
 <p><span>Now there was a Demon Sealing Tombstone, and he couldn’t even use his soul consciousness to explore deep within it. He could only use the blood fiend energy inside the Demon Sealing Tombstone to forge blood and increase his blood spirit power.</span></p>
 <p><span>“In comparison to what’s inside the ancient elites, the Demon Sealing Tombstone should have the true treasure!” Song Tingyu said confidently.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Qin Lie! Over here!” Chu Li shouted from a long distance. “We want the remains of an Asura race!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Go first. I will continue to comprehend the mysteries of the inheritance inside the bones of the Eight-eyed Lion,” Song Tingyu said.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Mn.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie directed the crystal chariot toward Chu Li.</span></p>
 <p><span>Terminator Sect, Heavenly Sword Mountain, and Illusory Demon Sect finalized their eight bodies after spending three entire days deciding.</span></p>
 <p><span>Terminator Sect took three, Heavenly Sword Mountain picked four, and Illusory Demon Sect chose one.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie broke the seals for them one after another.</span></p>
 <p><span>There were only eleven ancient elite bodies left on the island after that. Their bodies were sent to Terminator Sect, Heavenly Sword Mountain and Illusory Demon sect under Shi Xiuling’s arrangements.</span></p>
 <p><span>After the matter was wrapped up, the Xing brothers hosted a banquet for the three forces on an island chosen by Xiang Xi.</span></p>
 <p><span>When the banquet was over, Luo Nan of Heavenly Sword Mountain chuckled and said, “Starting from today, we, Heavenly Sword Mountain, recognize your orthodox Blood Fiend Sect’s identity!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Terminator Sect will not care what Black Voodoo Cult and the three families think!” Lei Yan expressed his attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Illusory Demon Sect will not ally with others to suppress you. However, we will not help you face the Black Voodoo Cult and the three families’ assault. You will have to rely on yourself,” Shi Xiuling said.</span></p>
