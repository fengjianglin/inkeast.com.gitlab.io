 <p><strong>Chapter 302: Fan Le’s Chrysanthemums</strong></p>
 <p>“Qin Lie, be careful. If this Fan Le dares to come to Armament Sect alone, he must be very confident in himself.” Song Tingyu’s voice came over quietly, “This person came for Armament Sect. Judging from his attitude, he was here to merge Armament Sect with Joyful Union Sect. He has a great scheme in mind, and your existence is probably in the way.”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie looked around but did not see Song Tingyu. He didn’t know where she was hiding either.</p>
 <p>This woman had obviously hidden herself, yet she could still casually talk into his ears. It looked like she had a lot little tricks up her sleeves.</p>
 <p>“Go! Let’s go outside of the poisonous bog!” Feng Rong exclaimed.</p>
 <p>The Blood Spear martial practitioners, the outer sect elders and disciples, Ying Xingran and the three great reverends, and the inner sect elders had all set out in unison.</p>
 <p>They all followed behind Qin Lie and headed out of the poisonous bog and all wanted to witness this battle with their own eyes.</p>
 <p>As one of the people under the spotlight, Fan Le chuckled and casually turned back to the Procedural Hall, arranging who knows what. It was only after a while did he walk back out from inside.</p>
 <p>Lang Xie was not in a hurry to leave either. He frowned and looked to the rear of the Procedural Hall as if considering something.</p>
 <p>After some time, he left after seeing that seemingly nothing was going on behind the Procedural Hall.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie, what happened?” Outside of the poisonous bog, Ling Yushi softly asked the moment she saw him came out.</p>
 <p>“It’s nothing.” Qin Lie forced a smile.</p>
 <p>“It was a little far, so I couldn’t hear too clearly, but I know that… you’re going to duel against someone.” Ling Yushi frowned and said softly, “Qin Lie, if the Ling Family is causing trouble for you, then you don’t need to…”</p>
 <p>“It has nothing to do with the Ling Family.” Qin Lie shook his head and reassured her, “It’s nothing. I just requested a duel with someone. There’s nothing to be worried about.”</p>
 <p>“Be careful.” Ling Yushi said nothing else, motioning the Ling Family clansmen to retreat way behind Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>Before long, Qin Lie arrived at the path that led from the poisonous bog to Armament Sect. He stood in a wetland above, eyes narrowed as he waited quietly.</p>
 <p>There were a lot of dry areas beside him where the numerous people of Armament Sect and Blood Spear martial practitioners stood after they arrived. All of them stared at him with complicated looks on their faces.</p>
 <p>“Where’s Fan Le?” Ying Xingran turned around and asked.</p>
 <p>“I’m here!” Fan Le’s cheerful voice rang from the back. He shook his paper fan, looking calm and collected.</p>
 <p>The white paper fan in his hand was covered with all kinds of erotic pictures of men and women engaging in sexual intercourse. These erotic pictures were enough to make anyone blush with but a single glance.</p>
 <p>He walked out of the crowd, and from time to time his nefarious eyes would glance at the young men and women beside him. The people he looked at immediately shivered and felt goosebumps underneath their clothes.</p>
 <p>A great number of people subconsciously opened up a path when they saw him coming over, not daring to match eyes with him.</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Qin is going to fight against this guy? This guy is so… disgusting. Look at him. Ugh, how can such a shameless and indecent fellow like him exist in this world?” Ling Yun’s crisp, young voice rang from amidst the Ling Family clansmen. She had taken a glance at Fan Le and immediately blushed in embarrassment, her inner thoughts spoken with a clear, sweet voice.</p>
 <p>—She had also spoken the words many people wanted to say but didn’t dare to.</p>
 <p>Fan Le’s eyes looked over, following the voice. His eyes were like cold snakes that had abruptly slipped into the group of Ling Family clansmen.</p>
 <p>Every man and woman who matched eyes with him felt their minds shake as their expressions grew incredibly unnatural.</p>
 <p>However, when he saw Ling Yushi, the purple light spots in her eyes were like endless stars that constantly twinkled.</p>
 <p>Fan Le suddenly shuddered.</p>
 <p>Ling Yushi stood prettily as the odd light in her purple pupils slowly brightened. An evil energy capable of penetrating the heart shot out of her eyes.</p>
 <p>Fan Le’s breathing grew heavy, and he quickly bit the tip of his tongue and forcefully closed his eyes.</p>
 <p>—He actually did not dare to gaze into Ling Yushi’s eyes for too long!</p>
 <p>“Huh!” Fan Le sucked in a deep breath. His eyes, which glowed with an evil light, did not dare to look at Ling Yushi’s. Instead, they fell upon her slender neck before he asked Ying Xingran beside him, “Who is this woman?”</p>
 <p>Ying Xingran shook his head in surprise. “I do not recognize her.”</p>
 <p>Half a year ago, when Ling Yushi and Ling Xuanxuan were protected by Qin Lie in the plaza, he had coincidentally been frozen in ice, so he did not recognize Ling Yushi.</p>
 <p>“She is called Ling Yushi. She is Qin Lie’s… former fiancée.” Luo Zhichang recognized her and answered.</p>
 <p>“This is an extraordinary woman who is well-versed in the secrets of the heart.” Fan Le praised with greed in his eyes. He said softly, “This woman… will be extremely useful to the spirit art I am cultivating!”</p>
 <p>Ying Xingran’s expression changed slightly.</p>
 <p>The three great reverends also felt worried hearing these words. They seemed to know that the women who were chosen by Fan Le would experience dire consequences.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie, Fan Le has some… ideas for Ling Yushi.” Song Tingyu’s voice rang out in Qin Lie’s ears once more, “Let me convey them to you. Fan Le said…” She told him everything Fan Le had said without leaving out a single word.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie, who stood at the center of the poisonous bog’s wetlands, suddenly let out a terrifying, bone-chilling frost concept. Thin wisps of white, frosty mist flowed uncontrollably out of every pore of his body, the frosty aura he emitted spreading out continuously.</p>
 <p>“Crack crack crack!”</p>
 <p>The dirty, muddy water around the poisonous bog was the first to freeze. As the frost aura spread, tree branches became crystalline and the ground was covered in white snow. A terrible, biting frost concept swept over the area like a freezing wind.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Qin Lie was at the center of this mist of frost. Within this frozen world, he was like a man of ice whose eyes blazed with the frost concept and coldly stared at the gradually approaching Fan Le.</p>
 <p>“A frost concept field. Pretty impressive. I heard that you comprehend the frost concept while still in the Natal Opening Realm. Your talents aren’t too bad.” Shaking his white paper fan under the crowd’s gaze, he strode over and walked right into the frost world Qin Lie had created.</p>
 <p>“Crack! Crack!”</p>
 <p>Step by step, he walked towards Qin Lie. The frozen ground beneath his feet shattered as bits of ice flew everywhere.</p>
 <p>“If I’m not mistaken, you should only be at the early stage of the Manifestation Realm. You… are unable to unleash a concept’s true power with this realm.” Fan Le let out a small smile and calmly said, “On the other hand, I am in the late stage of the Manifestation Realm. I can destroy you with pure strength alone!”</p>
 <p>Fan Le stomped a foot on the ground.</p>
 <p>An immense, powerful strength was sent deep underground by his stomp.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>With Fan Le at the center, large cracks suddenly appeared on this ice covered land like a shattered mirror.</p>
 <p>“Eh? This frost concept field hasn’t broken down yet?” Fan Le was surprised, and after shaking his head with a self-deprecating smile, he stomped the ground once more.</p>
 <p>“Prak prak prak prak!”</p>
 <p>As if the entire mirror had been thrown to the ground, this world filled with ice and crystal suddenly shattered all at once.</p>
 <p>The crystalline tree branches exploded, and the land covered in ice erupted. Furthermore the muddy water that had been frozen solid shattered into icy debris had turned back into liquid.</p>
 <p>After Fan Le had stomped his feet twice, the frost concept field created by Qin Lie... the entire world of ice and snow disappeared.</p>
 <p>Everything returned to its original appearance.</p>
 <p>“The entire middle stage of the Manifestation Realm separates us. This massive gap isn’t something that can be bridged with a concept.” Fan Le laughed softly before adding, “Furthermore... you are not the only one who has comprehended a concept.”</p>
 <p>“Whoosh whoosh whoosh!”</p>
 <p>Smiling and waving his white paper fan about, the images of copulating men and women drawn on it suddenly turned into numerous clear figures that flew out of the fan.</p>
 <p>At the same time, two pink chrysanthemums flew out of Fan Le’s sleeves. These chrysanthemums were incredibly huge, as big as a wheel. They spun loudly before rotating toward Qin Lie with an erotic, obscene aura.</p>
 <p>Brilliant pink light shot out from the flower buds of the chrysanthemums. A bizarre, seductive, and corrupt concept suddenly covered the entire area.</p>
 <p>The edge of Fan Le’s long, transparent sleeves were adorned with flower fragments. They began to shine one after another—all of them were actually chrysanthemums.</p>
 <p>“Zzzt zzt zzzt!”</p>
 <p>With a single thought, Qin Lie’s eyes filled with thunder and lightning, which crackled throughout all of the bones in his body.</p>
 <p>“Boom boom boom!”</p>
 <p>Thunderclaps followed one after another as they exploded in the space around him. Blue lightning flew out of his body like serpents, zapping the faint figures of copulating men and women, dispersing them entirely.</p>
 <p>Thunder and lightning were the nemeses of all things evil that had no solid form. These men and women were all formed from refined souls, so the moment they came in contact with the thunder and lightning, they instantly turned into dust.</p>
 <p>However, the two chrysanthemums that were like rotating wheels unleashed a brilliant light that seemed as if it could melt steel. They were completely unaffected by the thunder and lightning, continuing to rotate in Qin Lie’s direction.</p>
 <p>Even more tiny chrysanthemums flew out of Fan Le’s transparent long sleeves. They released wisps of golden threads that formed an erotic aura capable of seducing a person’s heart, creating a concept field that even Qin Lie felt was extremely bizarre.</p>
 <p>As if affected by the concept field, Qin Lie’s blood began to boil uncontrollably like being burned by fire.</p>
 <p>“Geocentric Magnetism!”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie changed his spirit art once more as the three earthen yellow Natal Palaces in his dantian’s spirit sea instantly linked with the heart of the earth.</p>
 <p>An immense earthen energy poured out from underground directly below his feet.</p>
 <p>The space and gravity around him instantly increased by ten times!</p>
 <p>“Whoosh whoosh whoosh!”</p>
 <p>The two rotating chrysanthemums were obviously not used to the sudden increase in gravity as they fell from the sky.</p>
 <p>The other smaller chrysanthemums were like drunk men, wobbling in midair before falling into the mud.</p>
 <p>“Thunder and lightning, gravity, and frost. Three spirit arts being cultivated at the same time!” Fan Le’s eyes shone with surprise. Ignoring the chrysanthemums scattered across the ground, his body was like an overlapping shadow that abruptly rushed towards Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>His figure in midair stretched into solid forms that did not fade away.</p>
 <p>“Jack of all trades!” Fan Le’s mocking voice suddenly rang out from all of the shadows that extended from him. The moment this voice rang out, it was as if all the shadows had come to life.</p>
 <p>Countless images of Fan Le rushed toward Qin Lie from every direction, as if trying to overwhelm Qin Lie like the sea.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, his true body had suddenly disappeared. No one knew where he hid himself.</p>
