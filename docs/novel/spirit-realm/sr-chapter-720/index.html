 <p><b>Chapter 720: Returning What Rightfully Belongs</b></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie chased after the Spirits of Void and Chaos on his crystalline war chariot, getting further and further away from Moon Worshipping Valley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Liang’er who was sitting at a corner of the crystalline war chariot had her eyes change into a silvery white color that permeated with icy, translucent light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wisps of white, icy mist slowly spread out from her body and enveloped the crystalline war chariot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A thin layer of ice covered the chariot’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie frowned a little. His eyes changed too as frost concept surrounded his body too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The frost concept slowly filled up his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will return what was rightfully yours!” Lin Liang’er’s face sparkled with icy light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A tiny clump of frost stream gradually grew clearer deep behind her silver white pupils.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, the icy light condensed into a ball of frost nebula and flew out of Lin Liang’er’s pupils. The transformed frost stream projected a Frost Concept Diagram that sparkled with countless crystalline runes, ice bits and frost light dots.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The frost nebula abruptly entered Qin Lie’s glabella.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason Qin Lie had quietly circulated the Frost Arts was only to acclimate himself to the frost concept the Ice Phoenix was unleashing from her body. He didn’t harbor any other intentions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, Lin Liang’er’s sudden action of extracting and returning the Frost Concept Diagram to him caught him off guard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he managed to react, the frost nebula had already entered his glabella and penetrated his sea of consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After his initial shock, Qin Lie hastily gathered his soul consciousness and probed that ball of frost nebula just in case Lin Liang’er had set up a devious trap that specifically targeted his soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His soul consciousness swept through the frost nebula swiftly like a lightning tentacle, but he detected no unusual ripples from the object at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He quickly relaxed after that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Withdraw!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two beams of lightning were unleashed from his eyes, and they abruptly grabbed onto the ball of frost nebula like a pair of big lightning hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lightning hands abruptly pulled the nebula into his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Swoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Frost Concept Diagram that had flown out of Lin Liang’er’s pupils entered the Soul Suppressing Orb in his head instantly as it sparkled with icy, crystalline light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ball of frost stream flew towards the second floor of the Soul Suppressing Orb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An instant later, the lightning in Qin Lie’s eyes vanished and returned to norm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After exhaling a breath of murky frosty air, he relaxed visibly and leaned against the walls of the crystalline war chariot, checking through the interior of the Soul Suppressing Orb in a leisurely manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the vast second floor of the Soul Suppressing Orb, the Frost Concept Diagram appeared once more at the center of the four basic ancient diagrams suspended high inside the space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Frost Concept Diagram now appeared even clearer than before it was stolen by Lin Liang’er. The world of absolute frost drawn on the diagram had also become more realistic than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if the Frost Concept Diagram from before wasn’t complete and was just part of the original diagram.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This diagram is still incomplete. There’s at least another piece of the Ice Emperor’s secret inheritance that remains lost somewhere in the world. I wasn’t able to gather all of them myself.” Lin Liang’er’s cool voice rang while Qin Lie was still surprised. “Once the Ice Emperor’s inheritance is fully completely, an ice sealed world will appear inside this Frost Concept Diagram. Once completed, the interior of the Frost Concept Diagram will display the true secrets of frost passed down by the Ice Emperor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How much of it is still missing?” Qin Lie asked with a bit of surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“At least half,” Lin Liang’er said regretfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie remained silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The “new” Frost Concept Diagram that hung once more inside the second floor of the Soul Suppressing Orb now had a lot more novel images than the one he created back when he was in the land of frost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From those images of concept, he was able to understand the logic of absolute frost and achieve an enlightenment just by capturing and examining the other secrets of the frost concept vaguely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Ice Emperor’s legacy imprinted into my blood and the inheritance left behind beneath the Frost Island, I’ve imprinted them both onto this Frost Concept Diagram.” Lin Liang’er said indifferently, “Other than my own latent talent, I’ve put in everything I learned about the power of frost into that concept diagram. Take it as my... thanks for your aid in recovering the soul injuries I’ve suffered.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, then I won’t take the absolute frost minerals hidden beneath the Frost Island.” Qin Lie nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crystalline war chariot beneath the duo hadn’t stopped just because they were talking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Moon Worshipping Valley was situated at one of the three corners of Prism Continent. But as the Spirits of Void and Chaos continued to fly forward and Qin Lie and Lin Liang’er followed, they slowly approached the center of Prism Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They passed by one mountain after another as they flew without rest for more than two hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a strange sound happening behind the crystalline war chariot, and when Qin Lie turned around to take a look at the source of the noise, he discovered that the Demon Sealing Tombstone was flying towards them like a glaring white flag.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh no!” Qin Lie’s expression changed slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had purposely put the Demon Sealing Tombstone at a faraway place and sealed it with a restriction when he awakened the Ice Phoenix. It was to prevent the Demon Sealing Tombstone from chasing after it relentlessly after it detected its aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had actually forgotten about the Demon Sealing Tombstone after the Spirits of Void and Chaos had suddenly went away and flown towards the center of Prism Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But although he had forgotten about the Demon Sealing Tombstone, it hadn’t forgotten about him. After he flew further and further away, the Demon Sealing Tombstone actually broke through his restriction and had been following him all along.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’d best hide your soul right away!” Qin Lie said anxiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Surprisingly, Lin Liang’er didn’t panic at the sight of the Demon Sealing Tombstone. In fact, she said casually, “It’s fine. I’ve recovered a lot and can almost conceal my aura completely now. That tombstone won’t be able to control me ever again in the future, so there’s no need for me to hide any longer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure?” Qin Lie frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Very!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crystalline war chariot came to an abrupt stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie turned around and watched with a solemn expression as the Demon Sealing Tombstone charged at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at this moment that Lin Liang’er’s aura suddenly turned into the frost concept’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It actually felt almost the same as the aura he was giving off himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Phoenix Race was born used to the land of absolute frost, and they could use power of their bloodline to gather frost energy to cultivate, transform, evolve and grow continuously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even without the Ice Emperor’s absolute frost inheritance, Lin Liang’er could still ascend to greater heights based on her racial talents alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The frost energy released by the Ice Phoenix Race was still different from the Ice Emperor’s absolute frost energy, however.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While this difference was almost indistinguishable to Qin Lie, the same couldn’t be said about the Demon Sealing Tombstone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was how the Demon Sealing Tombstone was able to lock onto Lin Liang’er’s bloodline aura and chase after her persistently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now, Lin Liang’er apparently could conceal her bloodline’s scent and discharge only the Ice Emperor’s absolute frost aura from her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was how Lin Liang’er completely shed the scent unique only to high rank spirit beasts like her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Sealing Tombstone stopped above Qin Lie and Lin Liang’er’s head, seemingly trying to identify something and hesitating a little during the process.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie frowned and raised his guard in preparation to stop the Demon Sealing Tombstone the second it showed any signs of suppressing Lin Liang’er.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Lin Liang’er appeared confident and collected, she too was brimming with frost energy and getting ready to retaliate against the Demon Sealing Tombstone at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thankfully, the Demon Sealing Tombstone ultimately failed to discover anything out of the ordinary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A moment later, the Demon Sealing Tombstone heeded Qin Lie’s summons, transformed into a ray of light and returned to the spatial ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess from now on, I am finally free from this persistent tombstone.” Lin Liang’er let out an obvious sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t have to act as cautiously as I did before too.” Qin Lie also relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The duo exchanged a glance with each other. Their relationship had improved massively because of these events.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie could finally put down the grudge he held when Lin Liang’er stole his Frost Concept Diagram for real.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The duo continued to chat with each other along the way with relaxed expressions. They were neither wary of each other nor afraid of a sudden, sneak attack any longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pursuit continued for a little while longer when Qin Lie saw a beautiful phenomenon at the sky several hundred kilometers away from where he was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The center of Prism Continent had many joined mountain ranges. Colorful clouds constantly erupted high above the sky of those mountain ranges, causing dull booms to resound from afar. Many beams of light that looked like flames, star streams, ice rivers or many other unusual permutations scattered from the center of those explosions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The strange energy ripples reached them even though they were still hundreds of kilometers away, making them feel very stifled and uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The six Spirits of Void and Chaos drew a tail of colorful light each as they sped hastily towards the exploding clouds. Each had a different color.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie could even sense the joy and excitement the Spirits of Void and Chaos were feeling.</span></p>
