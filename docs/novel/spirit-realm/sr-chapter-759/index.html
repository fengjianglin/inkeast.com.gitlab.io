 <p><b>Chapter 759: In the Limelight</b></p>
 <p><span style>Eight slabs of Thunderblitz wood hung high above Qin Lie’s head like eight heavenly pillars.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Reverse Gravity! Thread-like Electricity!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he circulated the spirit energy inside his meridians with specific purpose, gravity inside the magnetic field instantly decreased by dozens of times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eight slabs of Thunderblitz wood that were supposed to weigh at least a few tonnes suddenly grew dozens of times lighter as though they were timber in the seawater under force of buoyancy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wisps of dazzling electricity turned as thin as threads before shooting out of every part of Qin Lie’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thread-like electricity wrapped around the eight slabs of Thunderblitz wood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His thoughts changed again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under Qin Lie’s control, the eight flying Thunderblitz slabs changed positions as if someone was manipulating them with their own hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Very soon, the eight slabs of Thunderblitz wood aligned to form an octagonal shape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tendrils of electricity quickly knitted and formed a web of lightning amidst the eight slabs of Thunderblitz wood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eight slabs of Thunderblitz wood were positioned in the exact same way as the eight stone pillars that he used back when he was still cultivating inside Herb Mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the formation his grandfather had helped to arrange when he started cultivating the Heavenly Thunder Eradication.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he was trying to unleash the power of thunder in full, an idea had fleeted across his mind as a film of memories.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dazzling electricity streaked across the vast space inside the third layer of the Soul Suppressing Orb where the ancient diagrams were aligned to form a gigantic web.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The innumerable threads of electricity crisscrossing in between the eight slabs of Thunderblitz wood were just as dazzling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They looked a little similar to each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A spirit diagram is the world’s network made up of lines of laws. It is the most primal orbit of power!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a line his grandfather used to repeat to him many times in the past. Today, it suddenly entered and rattled his mind in a spur of enlightenment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if the chains on his intellect were suddenly torn apart, Qin Lie subconsciously looked at the intersecting threads of electricity between the eight slabs of Thunderblitz wood and manipulated them with his soul power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dense web of electricity moved swiftly under his mind and soul’s command, looking like millions of wriggling spirit snakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Brilliant divine light erupted from his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The third stage of Heavenly Thunder Eradication was called the Thunder Lightning Soul Refinement. Back at the Forbidden Land of Thunder, thunder and lightning had entered his consciousness, tempered his Soul Lake and struck his True Soul. It gave his Soul Lake, his soul tendrils, and his True Soul the power of thunder and lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every bolt of thunder and lightning he released contained his soul aura. Every one of them could be manipulated by his soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lightning was one of the fastest powers that existed in the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The electricity swimming in between the eight slabs of Thunderblitz wood transformed into a complex but rigidly structured compound spirit diagram.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The base of the spirit diagram was made up from Spirit Gathering, Spirit Storage, and Amplification spirit diagram. It was then embedded with two middle grade spirit diagrams of Materialization and Realization.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were all ancient diagrams he had learned inside the Soul Suppressing Orb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crackle!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Violent thunder and lightning began to emanate from the center of the eight slabs of Thunderblitz wood after the compound spirit diagram was completed. It was as if it was gathering strength to unleash a world destroying power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked up at the eight hovering Thunderblitz wood slabs and the compound spirit diagram at the middle. He trembled with emotion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With lightning as the network, and his soul as the guide, he had drawn a gigantic spirit diagram in just dozens or so seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The spirit diagram’s structure was clear and stable. It was obviously a successful creation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time he successfully used a spirit diagram in combat!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill! Kill! Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sky reaching killing intent permeated across the world as the martial practitioners of the five great Silver rank forces clashed against the three great ghoul races.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The curtains of a bloody battle were immediately lifted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dazzling spirit diagrams, colorful spirit energy lights, and different spirit arts flashed between the two parties at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Chen, Du Xiangyang, Chu Li, Tian Yu, Yu Men and many more Fragmentation Realm, Fulfillment Realm, and even Nirvana Realm martial practitioners attacked the three great ghoul races’ clansmen before them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many crushed bodies of flesh and blood fell powerlessly from the sky just like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many crystalline war chariots, carriages and spirit birds exploded into smithereens, becoming flaming fireballs falling from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That guy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A lot of clansmen of the three ghoul races stared at Qin Lie like he was the only enemy before them. They charged fearlessly towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is completely irrational for you to remain here!” Shen Yue shouted beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie utterly ignored her advice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t detonate the spirit diagram amidst the eight slabs of Thunderblitz wood. Instead, he carefully controlled the slabs to approach the three great ghoul races’ clansmen alongside the Heavenly Sword Mountain martial practitioners around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Yue was incredibly anxious, but could do nothing to change Qin Lie’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dozens of seconds later, Qin Lie arrived at an especially bloody war zone. Dozens of enemy martial practitioners immediately shook off their enemies and madly charged towards Qin Lie, hoping to wound him at any cost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t let any Fragmentation Realm martial practitioners approach us!” An odd gleam flashed across Shen Yue’s beautiful eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The nearby Terminator Sect martial practitioners charged unhesitatingly towards the enemies to stop them in their tracks even at the cost of their lives.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Six Fragmentation Realm outsiders who reached them first had no choice but to stop their charge when they were caught by the onslaught of Terminator Sect practitioners.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, although dozens of enemies still managed to reach Qin Lie, they were all just Netherpassage or Fulfillment Realm martial practitioners.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Yue let out a secret sigh of relief and prepared herself to kill all the outsiders who were charging at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at this moment she suddenly sensed something and looked up to the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A brilliant gleam abruptly blossomed in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A rainbow of thunder and lightning flew out from above Qin Lie’s head and slammed into the electrical web in between the eight slabs of Thunderblitz wood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first glance, it looked like a thunderous waterfall was pouring into the center of the Thunderblitz wood formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thump! Thump thump! Thump thump thump!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie made a strange hand gesture with both hands and held what looked like heart in between this two palms. Powerful heartbeats were emanating from inside the heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, a mysterious ripple abruptly spread out from amid the Thunderblitz wood slabs where the dense compound spirit diagram was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Spirit Gathering diagram began displaying its effect as it devoured the world’s spirit energy around it like a whirlpool. Worldly spirit energy surged fiercely into the center of the eight slabs of Thunderblitz wood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the world’s spirit energy within five kilometers of Qin Lie was sucked to the last!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The martial practitioners fighting nearby couldn’t sense even a trace of world’s spirit energy around them. Plenty of people stumbled and almost dropped from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the three great ghoul races’ clansmen were the same!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh whoosh whoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A lightning whirlpool gradually appeared at the center of the Thunderblitz wood formation. Whether it be ghoul or a human, the terrifying suction power emanating from inside the spirit diagram could scare them witless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Five kilometers away, even more spirit energy was being sucked into the spirit diagram. It transformed into milky white light that flew towards the whirlpool.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Amplification spirit diagram inside the whirlpool was activated as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The whirlpool spun at extreme speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tremendous spirit energy circulating inside the whirlpool gradually grew turbulent causing the whirlpool to expand, ready to explode at any moment!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The world’s spirit energy was being amplified again and again!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Spirit Storage spirit diagram came to life and absorbed the excess spirit energy. The whirlpool was like a bottomless abyss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Materialization and Realization spirit diagrams at the center of the compound spirit diagram were the last to activate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thump! Thump thump!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three earthshaking thunderclaps abruptly erupted from amidst the eight slabs of Thunderblitz wood. The thunderous rumble caused every Fragmentation Realm and Nirvana Realm martial practitioner to shudder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dozens of Fulfillment Realm and Netherpassage Realm martial practitioners who charged towards Qin Lie instantly clutched their hearts and spat blood the second the thunderous boom erupted from the Thunderblitz wood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, the hearts of a dozen or so Netherpassage Realm martial practitioners seemed to have exploded immediately after the rumble. Their bodies swiftly followed right after.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The whirlpool that absorbed the world’s spirit energy just now vanished and transformed into a gigantic thunder lightning ball.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thunder lightning ball was brilliant and dazzling, and even stranger was the fact that it was beating continuously like a human heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every time it beat with that terrifying tremor, ghouls of the three great races felt as if their hearts had been hit by a hammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thump!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An even more powerful rumble appeared from the thunder lightning ball, and the dozen or so three ghoul races’ clansmen near Qin Lie saw lightning bursting from their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bang bang bang! Bang bang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were all Fulfillment Realm enemies. The heavenly thunder detonated their hearts and caused their bodies to explode into bits of flesh and blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dozens of Fulfillment Realm and Netherpassage Realm martial practitioners who charged at Qin Lie first were all killed in action.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Profound Thunder Heart!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Forefather’s Profound Thunder Heart!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s finally a second person in the Land of Chaos who can conjure the Profound Thunder Heart besides the Forefather!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His spirit artifact has increased the Profound Thunder Heart’s strength! It caused the Profound Thunder Heart’s power to become dozens of times stronger!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The martial practitioners of the five great Silver rank forces turned back to look at the eight slabs of Thunderblitz wood floating above Qin Lie’s head and the gigantic beating thunder lightning ball inside it, even while they were battling the three ghoul races’ clansmen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thump!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another explosion appeared from inside the Thunderblitz wood and was materialized by the Materialization and Realization spirit diagrams.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indiscernible thunderous ripples spread out from the thunder lightning ball and reached even more three ghoul races’ clansmen’s hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The face of a Fragmentation Realm Earth Ghoul clansman looked completely flushed as he spat out a mouthful of blood of unknown color.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another dozen or so Fulfillment Realm and Netherpassage Realm martial practitioners who were further away from Qin Lie swelled and exploded like a ball.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood rained from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The martial practitioners of the five great forces felt stinking blood splatter across their faces, bodies and spirit artifacts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They stared blankly at Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie continued to urge the Profound Thunder Heart in between his palms, and then created an even bigger and more powerful Powerful Thunder Heart high above the clouds through an inexplicable amplification process, and caused it to erupt again and again like a heartbeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every time there was a “thump”, dozens of three ghoul races’ clansmen died horrible deaths. Corners of dozens of Fragmentation Realm outsiders’ mouths were stained with blood. Having lost the power to fight, forces of the Land of Chaos swiftly killed them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the sky, Qin Lie looked like a grim reaper who was sounding a gong, causing dozens of outsiders to die from their hearts exploding. .</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Open up a path for me! The closer I am to them, the faster I can detonate their hearts!” Qin Lie said solemnly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a moment of confusion, martial practitioners of the Heavenly Sword Mountain, Terminator Sect, Celestial Artifact Sect, Ten Thousand Beast Mountain gave him way.</span></p>
 <p><span style> Everyone’s eyes couldn’t hide the fear and respect hidden within..</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Qin Lie was no doubt the shining star of the battlefield...</span></p>
 <p><span style>…basking in the center of the limelight.</span></p>
