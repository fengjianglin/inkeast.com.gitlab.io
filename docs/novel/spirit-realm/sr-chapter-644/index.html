 <p><strong>Chapter 644: Blood Drinkers!</strong></p>
 <p>“Actually, this kid couldn’t have died whether you showed up or not. Forefather Terminator had already sent us word that this kid is his direct disciple. He obviously wants to protect his life.” Gongye Zhuo chuckled.</p>
 <p>“Oh?” Duan Qianjie frowned and cast a glance at Qin Lie, “He’s related to that old monster too?”</p>
 <p>“Not really,” Knowing that Duan Qianjie wasn’t here to aid Blood Fiend Sect, Gongye Zhuo appeared very relaxed as he explained, “I heard that that old monster found his talent in thunder and lightning wanting, and felt like taking him in and raising him as a direct disciple.”</p>
 <p>“Duan Qianjie, it is rumored outside that you’ll be challenging the old monster as of late. Is that true or not?” Gongye Qing asked seriously.</p>
 <p>The moment he said this, even Gongye Zhuo was looking at Duan Qianjie with an incredibly hopeful and serious expression.</p>
 <p>They both knew how scary Duan Qianjie was.</p>
 <p>Duan Qianjie hadn’t challenged many people in the past ten years. It wasn’t because his nature had changed and that he wasn’t as addicted to battles as before, but because there were fewer and fewer opponents who were worthy of a challenge.</p>
 <p>Many people knew that the last opponent Duan Qianjie challenged happened to be the Sixth Heavenly Sword of Heavenly Sword Mountain, Li Mu.</p>
 <p>No one except Li Mu and Duan Qianjie themselves knew who the result of that battle.</p>
 <p>What they only knew was that Li Mu and Duan Qianjie had became close friends afterwards, even though they had never met each other before the battle.</p>
 <p>Not long after that, Duan Qianjie went silent once more while Li Mu vanished from the Land of Chaos. He seemed to have gone to the Scarlet Tide Continent and lived in seclusion.</p>
 <p>When Duan Qianjie appeared once more, it was rumored constantly in the outside world that he had grown a lot stronger since his battle against Li Mu. They said that he had constructed a new layer on his Soul Altar and reached the late stage of Imperishable Realm. They also said that his next target might very well be the number one martial practitioner in the Land of Chaos, Forefather Terminator himself!</p>
 <p>Forefather Terminator Nan Zhengtian was a towering, gigantic mountain that was almost insurmountable for all peak experts in the Land of Chaos.</p>
 <p>For the past five hundred years, Nan Zhengtian had proven to the world his dominance through many bloody battles and bloody expansions of Terminator Sect. He proved that he was a terrible force that was unrivalled by anyone on the Land of Chaos.</p>
 <p>Whether they were willing or not, all the leaders of the nine great Silver forces publicly admitted that Nan Zhengtian was the Land of Chaos’ strongest expert.</p>
 <p>To this day, no one was able to threaten that status in the slightest.</p>
 <p>As a result, countless experts were excited when they heard that Duan Qianjie was going to challenge Nan Zhengtian. They all wanted to see with their own eyes just how powerful Nan Zhengtian was, and if Duan Qianjie truly possessed the power to fight him.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. The old monster is my next target.” Duan Qianjie said calmly.</p>
 <p>The Gongye brothers looked excited by the revelation.</p>
 <p>In their opinion, Forefather Terminator was a huge mountain that stood in front of Black Voodoo Cult’s path of progress. For the past years, Black Voodoo Cult had been been kept in check by the Terminator Sect, and that was a difficult reality to bear.</p>
 <p>It was exactly because Nan Zhengtian existed that the pope of Black Voodoo Cult had no choice but to endure silently. They didn’t dare to clash head on against Terminator Sect.</p>
 <p>His presence forced Black Voodoo Cult to concede many conflicts of interest.</p>
 <p>They even had to give up on a key person, Qin Lie in their attack against Blood Fiend Sect because of Nan Zhengtian’s words. The concession was admittedly a disgrace on their part.</p>
 <p>Duan Qianjie was a lone wolf on the Land of Chaos. He acted only for his own interest and obeyed no one.</p>
 <p>For many years, a large majority of the experts he challenged almost all came from the nine great Silver rank forces. Most of these people were killed in the battle, which was why the nine great Silver rank forces were rather annoyed by this.</p>
 <p>There were many times the friends and relatives of the experts he killed had attempted to surround and kill him.</p>
 <p>However, Duan Qianjie was always able to escape and survive through sheer tenacity, and after he went silent for a while, he would always emerge stronger than he was before.</p>
 <p>Duan Qianjie exceeded his limits and became stronger every time he fought.</p>
 <p>Now, Duan Qianjie had successfully constructed a three level Soul Altar. Not even the pope of Black Voodoo Cult, Jiang An was confident that he could beat him.</p>
 <p>That was why the nine great Silver forces had tacitly accepted his presence and given up on attacking him.</p>
 <p>If Duan Qianjie were to challenge Nan Zhengtian, and the battle ended up wounding both men or severely wounding Nan Zhengtian only, then it would be a great news for Black Voodoo Cult.</p>
 <p>That was why they were hoping that Duan Qianjie would challenge Nan Zhengtian as soon as possible.</p>
 <p>“Since the old monster had sent out his word, our Black Voodoo Cult naturally wouldn’t dare to kill him. It would’ve been fine even if you didn’t show up.” Gongye Qing rubbed his chin with a playful look in his eyes, “It looks like this kid is learning your unique secret art. It can’t be that… both you and the old monster had taken a liking for him? Heh, now this is interesting.”</p>
 <p>“He mainly cultivates the thunder spirit arts, and it is said that his attainment in that aspect is quite profound. It isn’t strange that the old monster would taking a liking for him,” Gongye Zhuo also interrupted, “Duan Qianjie, why exactly have you taken a liking for him?”</p>
 <p>The Gonye brothers were secretly hoping to sow dissention in Duan Qianjie. They couldn’t wait for Duan Qianjie to get so angry that he would go to Terminator Sect immediately and challenge Nan Zhengtian to a bloody battle right away.</p>
 <p>If they successfully enraged Duan Qianjie through Qin Lie and baited him into attacking Terminator Sect, then this outcome might even be more important than killing off Blood Fiend Sect.</p>
 <p>This was also why they hadn’t attacked Blood Fiend Sect immediately.</p>
 <p>“The reason I am challenging that old monster Terminator is only in hopes of greater breakthrough! There are no private grudges in my wish whatsoever!” Duan Qianjie’s face turned cold, “So save your breaths!”</p>
 <p>The Gongye brothers exchanged a glance with each other. They gave up after seeing that their attempts were futile.</p>
 <p>“Please don’t interfere in our disposal of Blood Fiend Sect.” Gongye Zhuo said seriously.</p>
 <p>Duan Qianjie frowned and said nothing in return.</p>
 <p>The two brothers nodded to each other after getting no reply from Duan Qianjie, and they turned around and made a gesture to the centipede battleship.</p>
 <p>The Black Voodoo Cult martial practitioners dressed in black robes rushed out of the ships like hungry wolves and tigers. They were all Fulfillment Realm, Fragmentation Realm, and Nirvana Realm experts. They numbered over several hundreds.</p>
 <p>The Gongye brothers weren’t in a hurry to act themselves, apparently.</p>
 <p>Their underlings alone had turned the tide in their favor instantly the moment they joined the battle.</p>
 <p>Blood Fiend Sect and Gold Sun Island’s martial practitioners retreated in defeat again and again as their casualties immediately began to worsen. Even without the two brothers’ interferences, this battle was going to end in a short time.</p>
 <p>This was because the Black Voodoo Cult disciples who came late were all experts capable of taking charge of an entire area with their astounding combat power.</p>
 <p>This was not mentioning that they had brought another swarm of voodoo insects with them too.</p>
 <p>Duan Qianjie ignored Black Voodoo Cult’s attack on Blood Fiend Sect and Gold Sun Island. He simply watched over Qin Lie beside him with dark pupils.</p>
 <p>Time passed slowly.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Duan Qianjie looked towards the opposite direction where the Black Voodoo Cult centipede battleship was floating. A hint of surprise appeared in his deep and dark eyes.</p>
 <p>A bloody war flag painted with the emblem of a blood pool abruptly entered everyone’s eyes. Then, a thick color of blood flooded towards them.</p>
 <p>Fierce, inhuman howls rang from within the bloody color. Many blood robed martial figures with eyes that were shining with bloody light attacked their enemies like the wraiths of hell.</p>
 <p>They pounded their chest and roared non-stop as hair began to grow out of their bodies. They looked like many bloodthirsty blood demons.</p>
 <p>They attacked the Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families’ clansmen in a frenzy. They opened their beast-like mouths and bit on their opponent's’ neck artery, sucking big gulps of blood into their stomach.</p>
 <p>The aura they were exuding were similar to those of Blood Fiend Sect. However, theirs was more cruel, mad and lacking in humanity. There was only the infinite color of blood.</p>
 <p>When these Blood Drinkers that looked like blood demons had joined the battle, the lopsided battle was turned around once more.</p>
 <p>The martial practitioners of Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families were howling fiercely and counterattacking like their lives were nothing after seeing their companions being sucked dry of blood.</p>
 <p>However, their counterattack was obviously lacking compared to these inhuman Blood Drinkers.</p>
 <p>“Jiang Zhuzhe! These are Jiang Zhuzhe’s Blood Drinkers!” Gongye Zhuo’s expression changed.</p>
 <p>He had just said this when Jiang Zhuzhe walked out of the vast expanse of blood. As usual, he looked as gentlemanly as a teaching scholar.</p>
 <p>Jiang Zhuzhe stepped on a carpet of bloody ribbons. His eyes were calm and void of bloody light. He was even wearing a small smile on his face, “Senior brother, junior sister, and my fellow juniors. I am very happy to be able to see you again.”</p>
 <p>He looked at Xue Li, Mo Lingye, the Blood Fiend Ten Elders and everyone else.</p>
 <p>“Jiang Zhuzhe! What are you here for?!” Xue Li roared.</p>
 <p>Mo Lingye and the Blood Fiend Ten Sects didn’t look happy either. None of them showed a trace of excitement for his aid.</p>
 <p>“Blood Fiend Sect and the three great families had incited all great Silver rank forces a thousand years ago to attack Blood Cloud Mountain Range, causing Blood Fiend Sect’s annihilation as a result. A thousand years ago, we were but powerless juniors who could do nothing even as the former generation of Blood Fiend Ten Elders lost their lives to fight our enemies. I was also powerless, and had no choice but to escape.” Jiang Zhuzhe looked regretful as he shook his head and sighed, “It is true that I was the cause of our destruction back then, and for the past thousand years I could hardly eat or sleep without thinking of rebuilding Blood Fiend Sect and regaining the Heavenly Calamity Continent.”</p>
 <p>Jiang Zhuzhe looked at the Gongye brothers and said again, “I do not think that Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families would attempt the same thing a thousand years later, wanting to eliminate the last of Blood Fiend Sect’s few disciples.”</p>
 <p>“Although my ideology and my cultivation methods are different from yours, I have always thought of myself as a Blood Fiend Sect disciple and a part of Blood Fiend Sect! Even if I am not considered genuine or admitted by you, it is my duty to arrive during my sect’s time of great danger and fight for it to my death!”</p>
 <p>“Jiang Zhuzhe! The reason Blood Fiend Sect had become the way they are is all because of you!” Mo Lingye looked up and said.</p>
 <p>“Blood Fiend Sect’s annihilation is my fault.” Surprisingly, Jiang Zhuzhe didn’t refute her accusation, “But I don’t believe that I was wrong in my ideology of cultivation! This world is made up by the law of the jungle. In my opinion, both evil or good are acceptable as long as they they can be used to strengthen Blood Fiend Sect and help it dominate the world! What I preserve in, sought for, and worked towards are in fact exactly the same as your ideals. It is just that we’ve chosen a different way to achieve it.”</p>
 <p>“I know that no one can change your mind.” Mo Lingye sighed softly and shook her head. She no longer said anything.</p>
 <p>“It is not actually important if you can understand or acknowledge me,” Jiang Zhuzhe smiled and said, “What’s important is that Blood Fiend Sect needs me today at the very least!”</p>
 <p>While saying this, Jiang Zhuzhe walked down from the bloody clouds in the sky until he was right in front of Gongye Zhuo and Gongye Qing.</p>
 <p>“Why don’t we negotiate with each other?” Jiang Zhuzhe smiled and looked at the duo before saying seriously, “Why don’t the three of us do nothing and let them fight until the battle is over? What do you say?”</p>
