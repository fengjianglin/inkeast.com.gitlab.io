 <p><b>Chapter 615: Preparation</b></p>
 <p><span style>In the mountainous region of the Heavenly Fissure Continent full of dormant volcanoes, Jiang Zhuzhe soaked inside of a blood pool, breathing evenly. Every time he breathed, the blood inside the pool would bubble and release a thick red vapor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Standing next to the pool, Jiang Tianxing reported everything he recently heard to Jiang Zhuzhe. “Celestial Artifact Sect sent news informing us that Qin Lie is currently at the Setting Sun Islands. All the bodies of ancient elites are there too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qin Lie summoned Terminator Sect, Heavenly Sword Mountain, and Illusory Demon Sect to have them select a few bodies for themselves and help Blood Fiend Sect clear its name?” Jiang Zhuzhe’s scarlet eyes glowed with intimidating bloody light. “Have they already informed the world of their identities?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. The fact that Xue Li is still alive and Xue Moyan is the true successor of Blood Fiend Sect has been spread by them.” Jiang Tianxing smiled coldly. “I can’t believe they would dare to reveal their identities as members of Blood Fiend Sect with Gold Sun Island’s pathetic level of strength. Father, should we attack them, destroy the Setting Sun Islands, and snatch the remaining bodies for ourselves?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhuzhe didn’t answer him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After pondering for a moment, he spoke up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families are about to attack the Setting Sun Islands, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Tianxing nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Summon all our disciples and tell them to get ready. We shall head to Setting Sun Islands in two days.” Jang Zhuzhe declared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood!” Jiang Tianxing grew excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is one thing you need to understand, by the way. No matter how old-fashioned senior brother is, he still belongs to Blood Fiend Sect. Qin Lie, Xue Moyan, and those people on the Setting Sun Islands are also a part of Blood Fiend Sect!” Jiang Zhuzhe said malevolently, his face turning cold. “We’re heading over there this time to deal with the three great families and Black Voodoo Cult. They are the true enemies of Blood Fiend Sect! Furthermore, Xue Li is your senior uncle, so you had better be more respectful when you speak of him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father…” Jiang Tianxing had been scolded to the point where his face turned blue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The only difference between us and senior brother is the way we cultivate. It does not mean that our relationship is completely irreconcilable.” Jiang Zhuzhe snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about the bodies of the ancient elites?” Jiang Tianxing asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Once we’ve crushed the invaders of Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families, we’ll snatch them for ourselves,” Jiang Zhuzhe said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>After choosing the ancient elite bodies they wanted, Illusory Demon Sect, Heavenly Sword Mountain, and Terminator Sect left the Setting Sun Islands one after another.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Chen and Du Xiangyang were Heavenly Sword Mountain cultivators in the first place, so they naturally left with Luo Nan and Yan Baiyi as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a result, Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan were the only ones left on the island. They continued to cultivate in silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Today, a floating island appeared above the Setting Sun Islands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The martial practitioners of Gold Sun Island were all shocked by the island and broke out into screams.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie looked up with joy in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uncle Li!” he exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Mu, garbed in green clothes, stood atop the floating island with the Icestone Snow Wolf King crouching beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Siqi, Mo Hai, Feng Rong, Yi Yuan and other people were on the floating island as well. All of them were looking down in curiosity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This will be Qin Lie’s base of operations from now on. Go head down and meet him.” Li Mu smiled, urging everyone downward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the floating island got closer and closer to the sea, Mo Hai, Feng Rong, and the others jumped off the island one after another.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Mu himself also descended from the floating island with a cool smile and said, “Qin Lie, take me to the bodies of the ancient elites, will you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright!” Qin Lie gladly accepted his request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Siqi, Mo Hai, and the others were curiously taking in the island scenery around them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Setting Sun Islands consisted of sixteen islands of varying sizes. Of these sixteen, ten had yet to be developed. There were no mines on these islands, and they didn’t have natural environments capable of nurturing spirit plants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only six islands had wooden structures and stone buildings on them. Those six were managed by six of Gold Sun Island’s island envoys.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bodies of the ancient elites were on a developed island next to Qin Lie’s nameless little island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qin Lie! You’re still alive?” Yi Yuan smiled, walked over, and heavily patted his shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, I’m doing pretty well,” Qin Lie said calmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t make your claims just yet, kid. I heard that Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families have just set out. They’re obviously headed here,” Li Mu said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let them come.” Qin Lie frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Mu was slightly surprised by his response. “How are your preparations?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m waiting for Blood Fiend Sect to arrive.” As they walked over to the bodies, Qin Lie told Li Mu everything about his situation. “I have eight god corpses and the Blood Progenitor’s body. Once Senior Xue Li’s soul has arrived and fused with it, we’ll have an expert guarding this place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What else do you have?” Li Mu inquired further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know. That depends on how much strength Blood Fiend Sect has accumulated all these years. I brought the bodies of the ancient elites back from the Graveyard of Gods to increase Blood Fiend Sect’s strength as quickly as possible.” Qin Lie smiled wryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That isn’t enough. It still isn’t enough to oppose both Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families. You still lack an expert who can be the deciding factor of the battle.” Li Mu sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is all we can do for now,” Qin Lie said helplessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“From what I’ve learned, Guan Xian will be leading Black Voodoo Cult. He’s in the late stage of the Nirvana Realm. I know this guy, and I can say that he is no ordinary person.” After hesitating for a moment, Li Mu added, “I don’t know much about the three great families, but I believe their strength isn’t far behind that of Black Voodoo Cult. Senior Xue Li has been imprisoned for a thousand years. If he were to fuse the remaining half of his soul with the Blood Progenitor’s body, considering how little time you have left, he would at best be able to contend with Guan Xian. But who among you can deal with the experts of the three great families?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blood Fiend Sect has to have some experts, right?” Qin Lie frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe they do. Maybe they don’t.” Li Mu shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s face turned heavy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To be honest, your chances don’t look too good in my opinion.” Li Mu sighed softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Siqi, Mo Hai, and the others had originally been glad to reunite with Qin Lie’s, but Li Mu’s words made them worry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your identities were exposed too soon inside the Graveyard of Gods. If they hadn’t been, you would have had more… time to prepare. The best time to reveal yourselves would’ve been after Senior Xue Li fused with the Blood Progenitor’s body and Blood Fiend Sect regained its strength. Now, however…” Li Mu also looked a little troubled by this dilemma.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A while later, the group arrived at the island where the bodies of the ancient elites were being kept. Upon hearing of their arrival, Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan took a break from their cultivation and came out to meet them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Very good, all three of you are doing well.” Li Mu looked at the two girls, smiling and nodding. “It appears that you’ve benefited from your experiences in the Graveyard of Gods quite a bit. Heh, I have to admit, I was slightly surprised when I heard that all of you came out alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he said this, a tremendous soul consciousness instantly enveloped the entire island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them could sense it split into eleven rivers of soul consciousness and stretch toward the eleven remaining ancient elite bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shock filled the faces of Xing Yumiao, Xiang Xi, and the others who were rushing toward them before they could even reach the island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They stood in their crystalline war chariots and looked at Li Mu from afar. A hint of fear was present in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The remaining bodies aren’t bad. If they’re used properly, they’ll improve your combat strength.” Li Mu pointed in a particular direction and fired a sword beam at the body of a golden bird. “That is the body of a Golden Luan King. Unlike a Rank Six Golden-winged Luan, this one is probably around Rank Eight or Nine. If Xing Yumiao refines this body, he will be able to break through the bottleneck in his cultivation and truly ascend to the Nirvana Realm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie looked shocked. He understood that Li Mu was giving him advice and immediately yelled to Xing Yumiao who was waiting some distance away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First island master! From today onward, this body is yours!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Yumiao’s eyes glittered with golden light. Intense shock covered his face as he exclaimed, “It’s mine?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes! It belongs to you!” Qin Lie said firmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Mu smiled and pointed at another body, an ancient giant. He looked everywhere before his eyes settled on Xing Shengnan and said, “This body is a humanoid member of the Giant Spirit Race. It holds a good inheritance within it and is very suitable for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Shengnan looked dumbfounded. She then waved her hands repeatedly and said, “That doesn’t belong to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Mu smiled and looked at Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big sister!” he exclaimed. “For our sake, please accept that ancient giant!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Little sister!” Xing Yuyuan said in a hasty manner, excitedly trying to persuade her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie didn’t say anything else. He looked deeply at Li Mu and awaited his next words of advice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No one else here is particularly suited for the remaining bodies of ancient elites. Maybe that will change once Senior Xue Li arrives with members of Blood Fiend Sect,” Li Mu said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second these words left his mouth, his eyebrows shot up. He suddenly looked off into the distance and smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, what a coincidence. They’re on their way right now.”</span></p>
