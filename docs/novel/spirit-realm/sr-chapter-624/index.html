 <p><b>Chapter 624: A Battle of Souls</b></p>
 <p><span style>Within the howling wind, Miao Tai’s body became even thinner, but his aura continued to rise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Purple moon symbols writhed toward Qin Lie from every direction like swimming fish, nearly drowning him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A cold, dark, eerie presence formed and became a kind of mental shock that could destroy people’s minds. It battered at Qin Lie’s mind and body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, scenes emerged from every purple symbol.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Shan, Ling Yushi, Ling Feng, Ling Ying, Ling Xuanxuan, and everyone else Qin Lie was familiar with or had deep memories of appeared in those marks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them were covered in blood. Shocking holes filled their bodies, blood flowed from them, all of them were in terrible condition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many of the people who had appeared in Qin Lie’s mind were close to him, and they seemed to be going through the cruelest of slaughters in this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a great terror that could stab into people’s minds, destroy their souls, and rob them of all hope.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even with Qin Lie’s mental fortitude, he was still affected for a moment, one of bewilderment. Intense sorrow and terror appeared in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that moment, threads of purple light shot into Qin Lie’s body like meteors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next, strange purple moon symbols appeared on Qin Lie’s face, neck, and every other section of exposed skin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miao Tai suddenly started to laugh darkly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two dots of purple light flashed in his eyes. Adding that to his the sudden desiccated appearance of his body, he looked unspeakably eerie and terrifying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You definitely won’t be able to imagine just how much the secret art of Illusory Demon Sect can affect your mind!” Miao Tai shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countless streams of light gathered and then shot toward Qin Lie’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Behind Qin Lie, the beauty with the sexy body couldn’t help but scream, “Watch out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she stood ten meters away, when that purple light shot over, she felt terrified. It was as though her own soul had been penetrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So she panicked for Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Snap, snap... krak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blue bolts of lightning suddenly sparked from Qin Lie’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s eyes instantly became as deep as the sea. Lightning suddenly shot out of them, crisscrossing back and forth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A river made of hundreds of lightning bolts appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zzt zzzt zzt zzt zzzt!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lightning and the flowing purple light shot at each other and furiously collided. Both powers cancelled each other out and exploded, giving off light as bright as stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countless bolts of lightning flew out of Qin Lie’s mind, quickly consuming the soul energy within his Soul Lake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That lightning contained the power of thunder and lightning, and it immediately erupted the second it emerged from his Soul Lake. It furiously attacked the purple energies infused with Miao Tai’s soul consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The battle between the Qin Lie and Miao Tai immediately changed from a battle of pure spirit energy to a battle of souls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every martial practitioner of Gold Sun Island and all the Miao Family clansmen of Blue Moon Valley held their breath, their expressions grave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A battle fought with soul consciousnesses was much more dangerous than a battle fought with spirit energy. If one side were defeated, their True Soul could be destroyed by the other side and completely shattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone became nervous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Up in the sky, Miao Wenfan’s expression was dark. His icy eyes looked at Xing Yuyuan occasionally, killing intent forming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miao Tai was a future pillar of the Miao Family. He had been sent to Illusory Demon Sect at a young age to cultivate, and the five valley masters of Blue Moon Valley had high hopes for him. Miao Tai possessed a high realm and powerful talent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This battle between Miao Tai and Qin Lie had escalated into a confrontation of soul consciousnesses, and was extremely dangerous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if Miao Tai won by using the Illusory Demon Reversal, this would significantly affect his progression to the Fulfillment Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miao Tai was extremely important to the Miao Family. Every advancement into a new realm was crucial for him. If Qin Lie influenced Miao Tai’s rate of progression, the Miao Family would lose more than they would gain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miao Wenfan grew worried. He believed that Miao Tai would win, but he was also afraid that Miao Tai would just barely win!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was afraid that Miao Tai would be heavily wounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On Gold Sun Island’s Flowing Gold Fire Phoenix, an elder dressed in long scarlet robes walked out of one of the wooden buildings and looked down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder Hong, you... should you interfere?” Xing Yuyuan transmitted his voice to him with an urgent expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elder in long scarlet robes was Hong Bowen. He was responsible for safeguarding the Flowing Gold Fire Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they departed from the Setting Sun Islands, Mo Jun told him to protect Qin Lie and prevent anything from happening to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie and Miao Tai suddenly entering a battle of souls had alarmed his as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hong Bowen possessed a heavy set figure. He narrowed his eyes and looked down for a while, then transmitted his voice back to Xing Yuyuan. “Interfering in a battle of souls can lead to unpredictable outcomes...even I do not dare to rashly stop them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what do we do?” Xing Yuyuan asked urgently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait! Wait for Qin Lie to win!” Hong Bowen said gravely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qin Lie… will definitely win, right?” Xing Yuyuan asked worriedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course!” Hong Bowen snorted. “The strength of Qin Lie’s soul is beyond what you could imagine! Do you think it was easy for him to put his soul into the body of the Blood Progenitor and use it to fight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Yuyuan was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Blood Progenitor has a seven-level Spirit Altar. For a Netherpassage Realm martial practitioner to sink their soul into it and move one of the Blood Progenitor’s fingers… that would be as hard as ascending to the heavens.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hong Bowen’s eyes flashed with red light. “To be able to control the Blood Progenitor and use it to fly and fight... do you know how strong a soul would have to be to do that? How strong one’s mental resolve would need to be?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Yuyuan was speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Below them, Qin Lie stood still, his eyes flashing as lightning bolts flew out of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miao Tai’s body became even more emaciated. He used soul energy to create moon symbols and form the purple flowing light that shot at the lightning sparking from Qin Lie’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon enough, Miao Tai began sweating profusely. He was so thin that he seemed to only be skin and bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At a glance, Miao Tai resembled an actual skeleton. His eyes had sunken deep into his face, making his situation look even more terrifying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And he was still furiously bringing forth his potential!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Opposite from him, Qin Lie’s expression was cold, and a cold smile played at the corner of his lips. A powerful vitality erupted from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone could see that, in this battle of souls, Qin Lie had the upper hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From Qin Lie’s confident expression alone, everyone gradually came to see that he had yet to use his full power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the very start, Miao Tai used the Illusory Demon Reversal of Illusory Demon Sect to tap into his potential. He wanted to wound Qin Lie even if he would be heavily wounded later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In spite of how he forced out his potential like this, his performance in this battle continued to worsen. This caused every Miao Family clansman’s face to darken and fill with doubt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Qin Lie laughed in a relaxed manner in spite of his soul being engaged in battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miao Tai. If you continue, you will use up every last bit of soul energy you have and cause your True Soul to explode and dissipate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he said this, the expressions of every member of the Miao Family changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shock filled Miao Wenfan’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miao Tai!” he shouted urgently. “Give up! Don’t use your soul consciousness!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Other members of the Miao Family tried to convince him as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyone that wasn’t dumb could see from Qin Lie’s performance that he still had more up his sleeve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miao Tai, who had used the Illusory Demon Reversal, had lost in every way. There didn’t seem to be any way for him to win.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, even though many Miao Family members urged him to stop, Miao Tai still refused to give up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Drops of blood appeared on his skin. This meant that he had even begun using his blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was obvious to everyone present that Miao Tai was almost at his limit. If he continued, he would soon use up all of his life force and die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miao Wenfan, who was in the late stage of the Fragmentation Realm, could no longer stand by and watch. He descended from the clouds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His dark eyes did not look at Miao Tai, but at Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miao Wenfan raised a hand. A tornado filled with terrifying energy locked onto Qin Lie and rushed at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How shameless!’ Xing Yuyuan shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How utterly shameless!” the beauty behind Qin Lie also shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miao Wenfan wanted to stop the soul battle between Qin Lie and Miao Tai, but instead of having Miao Tai retreat, he wanted to instantly kill Qin Lie and forcefully end the battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Such a course of action was completely shameless. It infuriated Hong Bowen, who had been watching all this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The descendants of Miao Fengtian have stooped to such a shameless level!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A ball of bloody light exploded from Hong Bowen’s hand. Blood energy shot from it, writhing like snakes and suddenly burrowing into the tornado that Miao Wenfan had summoned forth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh whoosh whoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Streaks of bloody light moved in and out of the energy tornado like knives cutting flesh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miao Wenfan, who had been in the middle of rushing downward, came to an abrupt stop in midair. He couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked at Hong Bowen in shock.</span></p>
