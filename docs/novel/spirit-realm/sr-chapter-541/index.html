 <p><strong>Chapter 541: The First Voodoo Creature!</strong></p>
 <p>“Whoosh...!”</p>
 <p>Within the Land of Buried Gods, the heads that belonged to the eight god corpses suddenly floated into the air, hovering around the Demon Sealing Tombstone like dazzling balls of light.</p>
 <p>The godly chains that spread from the surface of the tombstone grew even more formidable and shockingly powerful.</p>
 <p>“Prakprakprak!”</p>
 <p>The godly chains resembled meteoric whips as they struck the body of the Merfolk woman, causing the streams of light that she summoned to burst into motes of spirit energy.</p>
 <p>Images of the sun, the moon, and stars could be seen deep within the pupils of the eight god heads.</p>
 <p>Their eyes instantly locked on to the Merfolk woman possessed by the water spirit. The splendor of sunlight, luster of moonlight, and scattered starlight shone down on the woman at the same time.</p>
 <p>This long beam of light looked like a waterfall pouring directly onto the Merfolk woman’s body, causing this ancient elite to tremble uncontrollably.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie, who clearly didn’t have time to try and make sense of the Blood Progenitor’s secrets, had no choice but to turn his attention to the bottom of the frozen lake once more.</p>
 <p>He took in the latest turn of events.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>The godly chains of lights unleashed by the Demon Sealing Tombstone transformed into the magnificent shape of a pagoda, suddenly landing atop the Merfolk woman’s head.</p>
 <p>Numerous prismatic lights spread from the bottom of the pagoda and seeped into her head.</p>
 <p>“Oooo!”</p>
 <p>The water spirit whined incessantly, the sound of which emanated from the head of the Merfolk woman.</p>
 <p>Then, as if striking a vein of clear spring water, the Demon Sealing Tombstone forcefully extracted a flowing soul from woman’s body.</p>
 <p>The soul resembled a graceful water snake that had instantly fallen into the Demon Sealing Tombstone’s clutches.</p>
 <p>The Demon Sealing Tombstone extracted the soul of the water spirit, sealing it!</p>
 <p>Without the water spirit controlling it, along with the fact that it used up a large amount of energy, the Merfolk woman’s body dissolved into water and merged with streams nearby.</p>
 <p>Her aura had completely vanished.</p>
 <p>When the eight god heads floated into the air and assisted the Demon Sealing Tombstone in opposing the three spirits, they were like stars adding to the brilliance of the sun and the moon.</p>
 <p>The first of the three spirits to collapse under the combined pressure of the god heads and the Demon Sealing Tombstone… was the water spirit.</p>
 <p>The water spirit had been sealed. The divine lights inside of the Demon Sealing Tombstone grew even brighter, the eyes of the eight god heads also glowing with binding power capable of enveloping the world.</p>
 <p>The tombstone and the heads changed directions, turning their attention to the earth and metal spirits that possessed the ancient giant and ape. They began a brand new round of attacks, intent on sealing the spirits.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the demonified Jiang Tianxing, which had been waltzing all over the desolate plain from one body of an ancient elite to another, had been devoured by a frigid tornado. The power of absolute frost gradually seeped into both its bones and its soul, instantly transforming it into a translucent, fiendish sculpture made of bloody ice.</p>
 <p>The blood demon, which held Jiang Tianxing inside of it, seemed to have been frozen, temporarily rendered incapable of plundering the remains of the ancient elites.</p>
 <p>The ice spirit, the strongest and smartest of all seven spirits, had finally taken action. After sealing the blood demon in ice, it turned to face the threat of the Demon Sealing Tombstone.</p>
 <p>The ice spirit did not seek out and possess the body of an ancient elite that cultivated the power of frost. It simply hid inside of Jia Yue’s body, seemingly observing something from within the violent tornado of frigid air.</p>
 <p>Everyone’s gazes were fixed to the freezing tornado, paying close attention to its movements.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Yu Men cried out in surprise.</p>
 <p>“The Voodoo Progenitor!”</p>
 <p>He, Feng Yiyou, Qin Lie’s group, and the eastern barbarians saw the streams of frosty air that had sealed the blood demon start floating toward the Voodoo Progenitor’s body.</p>
 <p>This drew everyone’s attention to that single place.</p>
 <p>“Crack! Cr-crack!”</p>
 <p>A faint sound of something breaking resonated from the Voodoo Progenitor’s body. It seemed as though some creature were hiding in it and eating something.</p>
 <p>The Eight-winged Centipede Queen and the Black Crystal Sky Scorpion released shrill, panicked whistles from inside of the Voodoo Progenitor’s body. They seemed to be struggling madly, trying to escape.</p>
 <p>Both struggled enough to emerge from the body, but their efforts stopped there. The number of wings that the Eight-winged Centipede Queen possessed slowly decreased, and chunk after chunk of the Black Crystal Sky Scorpion’s tail vanished.</p>
 <p>“Something’s eating the voodoo insects!” Song Tingyu exclaimed, realization dawning on her face.</p>
 <p>“The Eight-winged Centipede Queen and the Black Crystal Sky Scorpion are extremely terrifying voodoo insects that Black Voodoo Cult raised,” Xue Moyan said nervously, her pretty face marred with confusion. “The fact that they’re unable to resist being eaten means that whatever’s doing the eating must be even more powerful than both of them.”</p>
 <p>“The Voodoo Progenitor’s eyes opened!” Du Xiangyang went pale with fright.</p>
 <p>Gaps suddenly appeared where the Voodoo Progenitor’s tightly shut eyes were. A toad could vaguely be seen wriggling in the depths of his dark green pupils, happily feasting.</p>
 <p>Xue Moyan’s eyes widened in shock.</p>
 <p>“The Viridian Blood Toad! Th-that’s the Voodoo Progenitor’s lifeblood creature! According to the records of Black Voodoo Cult, the Viridian Blood Toad is known as the very first voodoo creature! It was the very first voodoo creature that the Voodoo Progenitor tamed and refined!”</p>
 <p>“The Voodoo Progenitor perished long ago, but this Viridian Blood Toad doesn’t seem like it’s completely dead yet,” Du Xiangyang said. “It must have been surviving inside of the Voodoo Progenitor’s body all this time… and now it’s drawn the Eight-winged Centipede Queen and the Black Crystal Sky Scorpion to it so it could eat them. The Voodoo Progenitor didn’t summon the voodoo insects… it did!”</p>
 <p>“The Viridian Blood Toad is even more tenacious than the Voodoo Progenitor!” Luo Chen’s eyes became unfathomably serious.</p>
 <p>The Viridian Blood Toad was known to Black Voodoo Cult as the first voodoo creature. It was the first creature that the Voodoo Progenitor attempted to refine after figuring out the secrets of voodoo arts.</p>
 <p>This voodoo creature was connected to the Voodoo Progenitor, having been raised on his flesh and tamed with his soul.</p>
 <p>The records of Black Voodoo Cult hailed this voodoo creature as a special existence second only to the Voodoo Progenitor.</p>
 <p>To this day, many Black Voodoo Cult martial practitioners still prayed before its image upon refining a voodoo creature with their own body. They would pray for success in merging with their voodoo creatures.</p>
 <p>“Illusory Demon Sect and Black Voodoo Cult have battled each other for many years. I once heard my master say that Black Voodoo Cult cultists often hold sacrificial ceremonies for this voodoo creature. This means that there’s someone out there capable of detecting the existence of this voodoo creature… and that it has always been alive,” Xue Moyan said in astonishment. “So it’s all real... the first voodoo creature really is still alive!”</p>
 <p>“I can’t believe that this voodoo creature stayed alive within the Voodoo Progenitor’s body even though his soul perished,” Du Xiangyang said gravely. “However… it must be extremely weak right now. That would explain why it had to eat the Eight-winged Centipede Queen and the Black Crystal Sky Scorpion to recover its strength.”</p>
 <p>“Why in Spirit Realm did the ice spirit seek it out?” Qin Lie frowned.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie’s group suddenly fell silent.</p>
 <p>Without averting their eyes, they could only watch the Eight-winged Centipede Queen and the Black Crystal Heavenly Scorpion being slowly eaten inside the voodoo progenitor's body, until they completely disappeared.</p>
 <p>Although the eyes of the Voodoo Progenitor were initially just closed slits, they had slowly opened until they were wide open, completely exposing his lifeless pupils. The image of the Viridian Blood Toad inside of them grew clearer and clearer.</p>
 <p>Everyone could see that this Viridian Blood Toad, which was referred to as the first voodoo creature, had taken full control of the Voodoo Progenitor’s body after countless years.</p>
 <p>Two dense beams of pitch black light continuously writhed in and out of the Voodoo Progenitor’s pupils. They resembled two ebon snakes that constantly wriggled and squirmed, making the Voodoo Progenitor look unbelievably strange and terrifying.</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, the Progenitor sat up and looked at the Demon Sealing Tombstone floating above him. Its face twisted in extraordinary hatred.</p>
 <p>“Zzng zzng zzng!”</p>
 <p>A shrill ear-splitting whistle echoed from the Voodoo Progenitor’s body and spread in every direction.</p>
 <p>The resulting sound wave struck all of the observers standing at the edge of the frozen lake regardless of whether they were from the Land of Chaos or the territories east of it.</p>
 <p>Numerous people bled from every orifice in their heads. Although they tried to stop the bleeding with their hands, the sanguine liquid still flowed through the gaps between their fingers.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie suddenly started trembling uncontrollably, a dense bloody light erupting from his body. The light surrounded him, constantly fluctuating as it fended off the sharp impact of the sound.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie let out a dull snort, tenaciously standing firm.</p>
 <p>However, a line of blood still flowed down the corner of his mouth.</p>
 <p>“Pwack!”</p>
 <p>Blood burst from the mouth of Luo Chen who was still seated on the ground. His mind swiftly weakened as a result of the attack.</p>
 <p>Du Xiangyang, Song Tingyu, and Xie Jingxuan bled from their eyes, nose, ears, and mouths. They collapsed one after another, continuously bleeding from every orifice in their heads.</p>
 <p>The sound wave directly knocked Pan Qianqian out. Blood streamed from her face, and she collapsed to the floor, unmoving.</p>
 <p>Xue Moyan gritted her teeth as blood flowed out of her ears and the corner of her mouth. Like Qin Lie, she also managed to stay standing.</p>
 <p>Terrible screams rang out from the side of the frozen lake that the eastern barbarians were watching from. The shrill whistle of the first voodoo creature instantly killed three of them.</p>
 <p>The rest of the barbarians looked to be in even worse shape than Du Xiangyang and Xie Jingxuan. All of them wailed miserably and looked impossibly ugly as they attempted to stem the blood flowing from their eyes, noses, and mouths.</p>
 <p>Sen Ye and Yan Min were the only ones who managed to endure the attack. Although they were bleeding as well, they did not look much worse for the wear.</p>
 <p>Three of Feng Yiyou’s spatial rings exploded, but he succeeded in surviving yet another deadly attack. The only price he paid was the destruction of his spirit artifacts.</p>
 <p>Blood dripped from Yu Men’s nose and mouth as he panted heavily. The attack had obviously taken a huge toll on him as well.</p>
 <p>Everyone knew that the Viridian Blood Toad controlling the body of the Voodoo Progenitor wasn’t actually targeting at them.</p>
 <p>The people currently collapsing left and right, bleeding out of the seven orifices in their heads beside the frozen lake, were just unfortunate bystanders.</p>
 <p>—They were just collateral damage caused by the attack.</p>
 <p>The Viridian Blood Toad’s target was the Demon Sealing Tombstone!</p>
 <p>Hatred gushed from the Voodoo Progenitor’s eyes. It seemed as if the Demon Sealing Tombstone were the reason for the first voodoo creature’s current miserable state.</p>
 <p>Long ago, when it was helpless and weak, it hid within the Voodoo Progenitor’s body. It hadn’t been able to move that body for countless years.</p>
 <p>As the spirit responsible for watching over and guarding the Land of Buried Gods, the ice spirit had always been aware of the Viridian Blood Toad’s existence. The ice spirit even knew about its profound hatred for the Demon Sealing Tombstone, which was why it never did anything to the voodoo creature.</p>
 <p>Of course, the ice spirit never helped it either.</p>
 <p>The ice spirit knew that once it helped the first voodoo creature start recovering, it would return to peak condition by feeding on the remains of ancient elites, possibly even exceeding peak condition by doing so.</p>
 <p>That was not something the ice spirit wished to see.</p>
 <p>However, it also didn’t want the voodoo creature to die. That was why, until this moment, the ice spirit only watched the voodoo creature and preserved it. It had been waiting for an opportunity to arrive… like the one that came today.</p>
 <p>The ice spirit had suddenly disappeared earlier so that it could make a deal with this hidden voodoo creature.</p>
 <p>With the help of the ice spirit, the Viridian Blood Toad had been able to recover a sliver of its power and attract the Eight-winged Centipede Queen and the Black Crystal Sky Scorpion. That’s the only reason it was able to feed on both insects and quickly recover.</p>
 <p>Now that this first voodoo creature had recovered some of its strength by devouring the voodoo insects, it was naturally time for it to fulfill its side of the bargain.</p>
 <p>It would destroy the Demon Sealing Tombstone!</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie!” Du Xiangyang suddenly screamed. “Hurry and use the Blood Progenitor to attack it! We won’t hold out against its constant whistling attack for long!”</p>
 <p>“Qianqian… Qianqian is going to die!” Xue Moyan burned with anxiety. “Qin Lie! Do something!”</p>
 <p>“Alright!” Qin Lie said.</p>
