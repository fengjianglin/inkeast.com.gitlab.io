 <p><strong>Chapter 652: Qin Lie’s Contributions!</strong></p>
 <p>Xue Li’s departure caused everyone’s mood to become increasingly somber. Having faced the Black Voodoo Cult and three great families, and having seen the power displayed by Jiang Zhuzhe and his forces, the elders of Blood Fiend Sect all felt extremely powerless.</p>
 <p>They all subconsciously looked towards Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>If not for Duan Qianjie tearing through space and destroying Pu Ze’s Soul Altar because of Qin Lie, the Blood Fiend Ten Elders would have died.</p>
 <p>If not for Qin Lie controlling the eight god corpses to impede Jiang Zhuzhe, the Blood Progenitor’s body which Xue Li currently resided in and the Bloodthirsty Dragon would have both been taken.</p>
 <p>Although Qin Lie had the lowest cultivation amongst everyone present, the contributions he had made during the fight had surpassed Xue Li and the Blood Fiend Ten Elders.</p>
 <p>Thus, their gazes with which they looked at Qin Lie were quite complicated.</p>
 <p>“Alright, the reason why I gathered you all here is to talk about other matters,” Mo Lingye said, suddenly changing the topic. “The battle has temporarily come to a close, and our enemies shouldn’t be able to attack again in the near future. Thus, we must take advantage of this short timeframe in which we can recover our strength and use it to strengthen ourselves as quickly as possible!”</p>
 <p>Everyone’s eyes lit up.</p>
 <p>“Blue Moon Valley’s Miao Family should pay their debts!” Mo Jun suddenly yelled</p>
 <p>His words were like a stone thrown into a lake as the elders of Blood Fiend Sect, the Xing brothers, and Xiang Xi all fiercely raised their heads.</p>
 <p>Their suppressed anger emerged as their eyes became ice-cold.</p>
 <p>According to Guan Xian’s words, Blood Fiend Sect’s hidden location had been obtained by Blue Moon Valley from Jiang Yan.</p>
 <p>This meant that one of Blue Moon Valley’s people must have sold them out!</p>
 <p>Because of this information obtained from Blue Moon Valley, the hidden grounds of Blood Fiend Sect, which had lasted thousands of years, and Gold Sun Island’s main island have been completely soaked with blood, completely massacred.</p>
 <p>Although Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families were the main source of hatred in everyone’s hearts, no one could forgive Blue Moon Valley’s sin of providing that information!</p>
 <p>“It seems like everyone agrees with acting against the Miao Family.” Mo Lingye was not surprised at all as she continued, “However, the Miao Family is currently a vassal force of Illusory Demon Sect. If we were to move against the Miao Family, we may anger Illusory Demon Sect. What is everyone’s opinion on this?”</p>
 <p>Everyone suddenly quieted down.</p>
 <p>When Illusory Demon Sect was mentioned, the expression on everyone’s face suddenly became solemn.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie slightly furrowed his brows.</p>
 <p>After talking with Li Mu, he knew that the relationship between Illusory Demon Sect’s Sect Master Yu and Mo Lingye was stronger than Li Mu had believed.</p>
 <p>Mo Lingye definitely knew this as well. She definitely knew that Yu Lingwei placed her higher than the trivial Miao Family.</p>
 <p>Thus, if Blood Fiend Sect were to truly move against the Miao Family, Yu Lingwei would definitely side with Mo Lingye. As such, Mo Lingye should definitely not have been afraid of angering Yu Lingwei by attacking the Miao Family.</p>
 <p>However, if that was the case, why would she make the point that she had?</p>
 <p>Why did she act as if she were afraid of a possible retaliation by Illusory Demon Sect?</p>
 <p>Qin Lie silently thought about this puzzling scenario.</p>
 <p>“The Miao Family secretly gave away information to the Black Voodoo Cult. They stuck their noses into our matters first. Even if Illusory Demon Sect gets involved, we have every right to move against them as we are serving justice for crimes they are accountable for,” Mo Jun expressed.</p>
 <p>“The person who gave away the information must die!” Hong Bowen shouted.</p>
 <p>“I concur.” Meng Feng nodded his head in agreement.</p>
 <p>Mo Jun, Hong Bowen, and Meng Feng were the three most powerful members of the Blood Fiend Ten Elders and current Blood Fiend Sect. In the absence of the sect master, their decisions represented the entire Blood Fiend Sect.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie, what’s your opinion?” Mo Lingye suddenly looked in Qin Lie’s direction.</p>
 <p>Everyone’s gaze followed Mo Lingye and all gathered on Qin Lie’s figure.</p>
 <p>Following the battle, Qin Lie, who cultivated the same blood spirit arts but was not a part of Blood Fiend Sect, had risen to a critical role.</p>
 <p>Currently, the eight god corpses submerged in the depths of the sea were the most important backing for Blood Fiend Sect.</p>
 <p>In the world of practitioners, the right to speak was not determined by age, but by power.</p>
 <p>Without a doubt, Qin Lie, with his control over the eight god corpses, had a status even higher than the Blood Fiend Ten Elders atop the Setting Sun Islands!</p>
 <p>“Let’s ignore Illusory Demon Sect’s attitude for now. We should take over Blue Moon Valley and eradicate the Miao Family as quickly as possible,” Qin Lie said firmly. “Even if Illusory Demon Sect retaliates, we can wait to slowly talk it over after destroying Blue Moon Valley. I heard that Illusory Demon Sect doesn’t put much importance on Blue Moon Valley anyway...”</p>
 <p>Mo Lingye slightly smiled as she nodded.</p>
 <p>“Except for a few members of Illusory Demon Sect, no one else knows the location of our hidden ancestral grounds. Thus, the information must have been given away by someone from the Miao Family who has a connection with Illusory Demon Sect!” Mo Jun said.</p>
 <p>“It was probably Wen Bin’s disciple,” Mo Lingye said confidently.</p>
 <p>“Wen Bin! It’s Wen Bin again!” Mo Jun expression became enraged.</p>
 <p>“Who is Wen Bin?” Qin Lie looked at Xue Moyan.</p>
 <p>“Wen Bin is my master’s senior brother who lost in a competition against my master and thus failed to become the sect master of Illusory Demon Sect,” Xue Moyan quietly explained in a simple manner. “When Blood Fiend Sect first arrived from the sea and requested for a place to stay from my master, Wen Bin was the fiercest, most vocal person opposing it…” Xue Moyan continued.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie quickly noticed that the real reason for Mo Lingye’s misgivings was not Yu Lingwei but Wen Bin.</p>
 <p>It became clear that Illusory Demon Sect was not completely united within. There was seemingly a lot of secret infighting between Wen Bin and Yu Lingwei..</p>
 <p>It was likely that the real supporter of Blue Moon Valley was not Yu Lingwei, but Wen Bin.</p>
 <p>If they did move against Blue Moon Valley, the person who would be angered was not Yu Lingwei but Wen Bin.</p>
 <p>“Only if we are able to obstruct Wen Bin can we move against Blue Moon Valley without fear.” Mo Lingye looked Qin Lie deeply in the eye.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie suddenly realized the big picture.</p>
 <p>Mo Lingye’s true intention for asking was to determine Qin Lie’s stance because he could control the eight god corpses...</p>
 <p>Only if Qin Lie agreed and was willing to use the eight god corpses to obstruct Wen Bin’s movements would Mo Lingye be willing to move against Blue Moon Valley.</p>
 <p>As Wen Bin and Yu Lingwei were both members of Illusory Demon Sect, if Yu Lingwei were to move against Wen Bin just because of her connection to Mo Lingye, the members of Illusory Demon Sect would feel extremely disappointed.</p>
 <p>The only thing Yu Lingwei could do for them was preventing other Illusory Demon Sect members from going with Wen Bin to attack Setting Sun Islands.</p>
 <p>As long as eight god corpses could tie Wen Bin down just like they did Jiang Zhuzhe in the previous battle, Mo Lingye was willing to move against Blue Moon Valley.</p>
 <p>As Blue Moon Valley was one of Wen Bin’s wings, removing it would greatly support Yu Lingwei.</p>
 <p>“Which one is stronger? Wen Bin or Jiang Zhuzhe?” Qin Lie suddenly asked.</p>
 <p>“Jiang Zhuzhe should be the stronger one.” Mo Lingye faintly smiled.</p>
 <p>“Then I still support attacking Blue Moon Valley.” Qin Lie’s expression was respectful as he looked at Mo Lingye and responded.</p>
 <p>Upon receiving Qin Lie’s positive response, Mo Lingye came to a decision and didn’t ask for any more opinions. She nodded her head and said, “Let’s not waste any more time. It would be best for us to move before any news spread and before Blue Moon Valley is able to accurately determine our strength. Let us move right now.”</p>
 <p>“Understood!” the Blood Fiend Ten Elders replied in unison.</p>
 <p>Xing Yuyuan and the other members of Gold Sun Island also became excited as a blazing fighting spirit churned in their eyes.</p>
 <p>During the previous trip to Blue Moon Valley, the Xing brothers and Qin Lie had been repeatedly humiliated by the Miao Family. All this time, Xing Yumiao had been waiting for an opportunity to pay them back.</p>
 <p>Miao Hui breaking off the engagement had caused the Xing brothers to become even more enraged. They had nearly lost control on the spot.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, Gold Sun Island was much weaker than Miao Family, so they could only hold it in and try to endure.</p>
 <p>This time however, Miao Family caused Gold Sun Island to lose many practitioners, many of which were members of the Xing Family!</p>
 <p>This caused Xing Family brothers to no longer be able to contain themselves!</p>
 <p>“Brother, go make the arrangements, and temporarily imprison all of the people surnamed Miao on the island to prevent them from leaking information,” Xing Yumiao commanded.</p>
 <p>“I will go right now!” Xing Yuyuan left, his face cold.</p>
 <p>Several years ago, Gold Sun Island’s Xing Family had become linked to the Miao Family through marriage as the son of one of the Xing Family brothers had married a girl from the Miao Family.</p>
 <p>Xing Yumiao was worried that their current actions would be discovered by these Miao Family members and divulged back to the Miao Family in Blue Moon Valley. Thus, he ordered for them to be temporarily imprisoned.</p>
 <p>“Hong Bowen and Meng Feng, both of you will personally go to Blue Moon Valley,” Mo Lingye said.</p>
 <p>Blood Fiend Ten Elders’ Hong Bowen and Meng Feng immediately nodded in response.</p>
 <p>“What about you, Qin Lie?” Mo Lingye asked.</p>
 <p>“I will go with them.” Qin Lie responded.</p>
 <p>“You can’t leave!” Mo Jun’s expression suddenly changed as he anxiously said, ”If you leave, there will be no one to control the eight god corpses. If Jiang Zhuzhe comes back, who will stop him?”</p>
 <p>As these words were spoken, the expressions of all of Blood Fiend Sect and Gold Sun Island’s practitioners changed as they all began pleading for Qin Lie to stay.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie himself hesitated for a moment.</p>
 <p>Because the point brought up indeed had reason behind it.</p>
 <p>“It doesn’t matter. Qin Lie, if you want to go, just go. Nothing bad will happen.” Mo Lingye’s expression was calm as she continued, “Even if Jiang Zhuzhe comes back, it will be fine as long as I am on the island and Xue Li remains hidden.”</p>
 <p>Mo Lingye was completely in control of the situation.</p>
