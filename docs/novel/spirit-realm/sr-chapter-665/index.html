 <p><b>Chapter 665: An Extremely Deep Impression</b></p>
 <p><span style>After killing Yin Cheng in a single blow, Qin Lie turned his head and found the remaining Seven Fiends Valley martial practitioners had surrounded Pei Xiang. They were going to tear away Pei Xiang’s clothing and search her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Xiang continued to beg in hopes that they would stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, urged on by greed, these people would not listen to anything Pei Xiang said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, the Dark Fiend Valley’s decline caused Pei Xiang’s status to be extremely low. No one thought anything of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-I’ll take them off! Don’t come over!” Pei Xiang suddenly screamed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that she could not persuade them, she prepared to endure the humiliation to protect herself and not cause even more unpredicted consequences. She prepared to take off her robes, and empty all her pockets to show that she had not taken anything from Qin Lie’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good!” The martial practitioner from Gold Fiend Valley grinned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let her take them off!” someone laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the gazes of the group, Pei Xiang gritted her teeth. Her eyes were filled with grief as she reached to untie her belt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bolt of lightning suddenly charged through.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lightning condensed and turned into Qin Lie’s still burnt body. Pei Xiang’s gaze turned stunned and she couldn’t help but scream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next moment, like an ancient monster within a herd of sheep, Qin Lie started to kill the Seven Fiends Valley martial practitioners.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Xiang heard the wails and screams of the Seven Fiends Valley martial practitioners. Blood covered everything in her view!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crack crack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The horrifying sound of bones breaking came from those people. In a short ten seconds, those people fell to the ground as though their skeletons had shattered, and were covered with blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one was left alive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to the river to wash.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After casually throwing these words to the wind, Qin Lie disappeared from Pei Xiang’s side like lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Xiang looked dazedly at Qin Lie’s departing figure. Then, she looked at the gory corpses, and Yin Cheng’s horrific and bloody state. Her eyes became dumbstruck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How-how did it become like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Xiang murmured soullessly to herself. Terror and anxiousness appeared on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yin Cheng and these people had status in Seven Fiends Valley. Gold Fiend Valley and Fire Fiend Valley put great importance on them. One of them even came from Mystical Fiend Valley and had extraordinary status.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, all of them had died here. Seven Fiends Valley would not sit idly and watch. They would pursue this with all of their power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She, Pei Xiang, would be furiously pursued by Seven Fiends Valley due to Qin Lie’s actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Terrible, this is terrible. Dark Fiend Valley is weak, this time... no one will be able to save me.” Pei Xiang became more terrified the more she thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Splash!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other side, Qin Lie leapt into the stream and then immediately relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feeling with his mind, he quickly found that the pores in his body were furiously absorbing the water. This body that seriously lacked water quickly became filled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The skin that had been burned black by the flames had been as hard and dry as the bark of ancient trees. But soaking in the water, the cracked and burnt skin quickly fell off his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the blackened skin, the new skin was clear and transparent. It had the sheen of jade and gave people a feeling of flawlessness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, the burnt skin fell off his body like a snake shedding its skin. A body that was more refined, more balanced and stronger has been exposed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The “blaze” characters that had been imprinted onto his limbs and body had disappeared. He could not feel them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his spirit sea, the three natal palaces that had been created by the merging of the natal palaces of the same element were like lightning, ice, and earth balls that released surging power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Sealing Tombstone returned to his spatial ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything turned back to its normal appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He tried to channel spirit energy, and guide the lightning, ice, and earth powers to flow through his veins.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were no abnormalities. His spirit power flowed much faster than before!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Channeling blood spirit power did not cause his blood to burn like before. Not only did his blood not boil, it also did not produce the power of the bloodline, and did not show anything unusual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The appearance of the power of the bloodline seemed to have been an illusion. He seemed to not have changed at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is not right...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Frowning, he floated naked in the stream facing the sky as he thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Those divine characters that mean “blaze” clearly came out of my blood, and were imprinted onto my bones, tendons, and organs. How come I cannot feel them at all?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But that must have been the power of the bloodline! The power of the bloodline once awakened should not disappear!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It must be that I haven’t found the way to activate it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was not in a hurry to leave the stream. He floated on the water surface naked as he continued to ponder what he did not understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Fulfillment Realm, a breakthrough into a new realm, is there anything different?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he thought of this, he temporarily put aside his pursuit of the bloodline power. He started to examine the changes in his spirit sea and consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The changes in his spirit sea were very simple. The nine natal palaces turned into three after merging. After probing with his mind consciousness, he noticed that the three great natal palaces that had formed were much bigger compared to the original ones. The power of thunder and lightning in the thunder and lightning natal palace was more than five times that of the three previous natal palaces added together!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ice and earth natal palaces were the same!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This meant that after he finished refilling spirit energy in the natal palaces, the power in his spirit sea would have increased by five times!</span></p>
 <p><span style>And that was just after entering the Fulfillment Realm!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his sea of consciousness, the Soul Lake was clearly much vaster. The True Soul that was inside the Soul Lake wasn’t just much bigger than before, it was also much clearer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he looked at it, he found that the True Soul was packed with lightning that criss-crossed inside the True Soul like channels.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Exclaiming in shock in his mind, he examined the True Soul even more closely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like through a magnifying glass, the True Soul enlarged!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the True Soul had been magnified by a few factors of ten, he found that divine characters that meant “blaze” were deep within the True Soul. Those divine characters roamed inside the True Soul like tongues of fire and did not seem to rest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected, I had not looked closely enough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he arrived to that conclusion, he examined his body once again. He gathered his mind and peered deep into the bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He magnified one of his bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After reaching a certain magnification, he found to his shock that the divine characters which represented “blaze” were on the bones’ material, the bone membrane, the bone marrow. They slowly moved and released faint golden light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His mind shifting, he focused his attention on his heart. Yet again, he found to his shock that the chambers of his heart, the windpipe, and the arteries also had moving divine characters imprinted on them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So the divine characters have been imprinted on every part of my body.” Qin Lie realized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the beginning, the reason he did not see them was because the divine text was so small that he could not immediately see it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only when he was extremely focused and gathered his consciousness to go to the deepest part could he see the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew that the bloodline power was slowly changing his body in a way that he could not understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he still did not find the way to use the bloodline power and control those divine characters to use their power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted to continue searching. However, he knew that Pei Xiang probably would not be able to wait for long. After a moment of thought, he stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moving his body, he walked out of the stream. He didn’t just recover his appearance, he was even more alert and his eyes seemed to shoot lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he put on dark blue martial practitioner robes, he cracked his neck as he walked towards Pei Xiang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pei Xiang was anxious as she stood next to the gory corpses of the members of her sect. She was still sighing as she pondered how to avoid the calamity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going with you to Seven Fiends Valley.” Qin Lie walked over and said directly to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I do not dare to return to the valley. If I return there now, my fate would be even worse than Senior Sister Lu’s.” Pei Xiang turned her head. Her face was conflicted. Then, she shouted in shock as she pointed at Qin Lie, “Y-you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fifteen minutes ago, Qin Lie had been completely blackened like a burnt corpse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie who came back wasn’t just of a strong stature. His features were clearly defined, handsome, and he gave off a strong masculine charisma.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no similarities to his previous appearance. This stunned Pei Xiang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do not be nervous, this is my true appearance,” Qin Lie smiled and said politely, “Let me reintroduce myself, I am Qin Lie...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah!” Pei Xiang screamed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, just like you guessed.” Qin Lie said seriously with a smile, “I am the person who killed both your valley masters!”</span></p>
