 <p><strong>Chapter 600: Released!</strong></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie originally wanted Xue Moyan to bring the Blood Progenitor’s body to Xue Li, but when he took it out, he realized that Xue Moyan had nothing to carry it with.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Blood Progenitor’s body, which radiated bloody light and seemed like it was made of sanguine jewels, had been held within the Soul Suppressing Orb this entire time—</span></p>
 <p><span>—and not a spatial ring.</span></p>
 <p><span>Spatial rings could hold many things. They could hold wood, spirit stones, plants, pills, corpses, bones, you name it.</span></p>
 <p><span>It could hold everything except beings with souls—not even the tiniest fragment!</span></p>
 <p><span>A soul pagoda sat deep inside of the Blood Progenitor’s mind, and even some extremely small fragile soul remnants lingered throughout the body.</span></p>
 <p><span>These were proof of the Blood Progenitor’s imperishable soul.</span></p>
 <p><span>Although these slivers of the Blood Progenitor’s soul were so weak they could be disregarded, they still prevented his body from being stored within a spatial ring. Only the Soul Suppressing Orb could contain it.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Soul Suppressing Orb held three newborn entities, things undergoing refinement, and the Bloodthirsty Dragon. Like the body of the Blood Progenitor, all of these things possessed souls.</span></p>
 <p><span>Even the three tiny beings that were just born and had simple consciousnesses could be considered intelligent creatures with souls.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie had the Soul Suppressing Orb in which he could store the Blood Progenitor’s body and disguise the thick stench of iron that came from it. Xue Moyan didn’t have a such a treasure. Since it couldn’t be carried in a spatial ring and it weighed thousands of kilograms, she had no way to covertly transport it to Blood Fiend Sect without being discovered.</span></p>
 <p><span>Because of that, Xue Moyan left the others early on.</span></p>
 <p><span>She needed to see the sect master of Illusory Demon Sect and explain everything that had happened inside the Graveyard of Gods. She also needed to go see her father, Xue Li, and bring his soul along with other members of Blood Fiend Sect to Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span>With Gao Yu and Xue Moyan’s departures, only Luo Chen, Du Xiangyang, Xie Jingxuan, and Song Tingyu remained with Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span>In the days that followed, the Xing Family and Xiang Xi’s faction held secret meetings at the Setting Sun Islands to mend their relationship.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie neither asked about the proceedings nor paid any attention to them. Instead, he focused on using soul crystals to replenish his soul energy and absorbed fiendish bloody energy from the Demon Sealing Tombstone to generate blood.</span></p>
 <p><span>Ten days later, the Xing siblings, Xiang Xi, Xu Changsheng, and Xu Jiadong coexisted harmoniously once again. It appeared as though both sides had completely forgotten the conflict that had just occurred.</span></p>
 <p><span>The day after their relationship seemed to have miraculously mended, Qin Lie summoned the six of them to the island he resided on. Luo Chen and Du Xiangyang were present as well.</span></p>
 <p><span>Seeing that everyone had gathered, Qin Lie bluntly asked, “Has news of us commanding the god corpses been leaked yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“It’s quite strange, actually. We have yet to receive any information about that matter,” Xing Yuyuan answered. He still looked a bit pale, and his wounds hadn’t completely healed. “However, many will notice the strange details about this region eventually. For example, the patriarch of the Pan Family and their main force haven’t contacted the main family for a long time. The people of Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion have been missing as well. This has caused Black Voodoo Cult and Illusory Demon Sect to send people to investigate.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“We killed the Pan Family,” Qin Lie said nonchalantly.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Xing siblings and Xiang Xi’s trio exchanged knowing glances as if they had already guessed this.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Since it seems as though news hasn’t spread…” Qin Lie paused for a moment, then said, “That should be enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“What did you summon us for, little brother?” Xing Shengnan asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie smiled at everyone and said, “I summoned you here for a good matter.”</span></p>
 <p><span>As he finished speaking, the Demon Sealing Tombstone emerged from his spatial ring and flew up to hover above them.</span></p>
 <p><span>Soon enough, the splash of movement in the water could be heard near the island. Everyone turned to look at the sea and watched as the eight god corpses emerged from it. They took great, earthshaking strides ashore, the boom of their slow steps echoing throughout the island.</span></p>
 <p><span>An enormous basket woven from tree branches soaked with saltwater came into view. Gargantuan bodies of ancient elites from the Asura Race, the Giant Spirit Race, the Wood Race, and other ancient beasts lay within that basket.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The remains of ancient elites!” Everyone’s eyes shone with a burning light.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie continued to send commands to the god corpses, and they soon pulled the twenty three bodies of ancient elites onto the island.</span></p>
 <p><span>This unnamed island covered thousands of square meters, yet once the twenty three bodies had been spread out, they took up nearly all of its space.</span></p>
 <p><span>Some of the ancient elites were small, the size of normal humanoids like humans and the Wood Race. Some, on the other hand, were extremely large when laid out. Like ancient beasts and members of the Giant Spirit Race, many were hundreds of meters tall and resembled mountains.</span></p>
 <p><span>Twenty three bodies of ancient elites were spread throughout the island, radiating all kinds of ancient, wild auras. These auras pressured everyone present, making their very souls tremble.</span></p>
 <p><span>“These are our spoils from the Graveyard of Gods,” Qin Lie said. “Seven of us came out of there together. We don’t know if Chu Li is dead or alive, but… I’ll be keeping his share for him.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie summoned a crystalline war chariot with a wave of his hand and boarded it. He then waved for Luo Chen, Du Xiangyang, Song Tingyu, and Xie Jingxuan to join him.</span></p>
 <p><span>Surprise tinged Xing Yumiao’s face. He mirrored Qin Lie’s actions, getting into the chariot they had arrived on and directing it into the sky. Xiang Xi and the others did the same as well.</span></p>
 <p><span>Soon enough, all of their crystalline chariots hovered above the island, and everyone surveyed the bodies of the ancient elites.</span></p>
 <p><span>At this moment, the sun was at its highest. Under its brilliant light, the bodies of the ancient elites seemed to have a metallic shine to them and even released potent waves of power.</span></p>
 <p><span>—All of that was pure fleshly power!!</span></p>
 <p><span>In ancient times, every expert focused a great deal of their efforts on the refinement of the flesh and blood. They made it so vast power flowed through their blood, flesh, sinews, bones, and every fiber of their being. Even if their souls were destroyed, the bodies would persist.</span></p>
 <p><span>Everyone aboard the crystalline chariots closed their eyes and tried to sense the bodies with their soul consciousnesses.</span></p>
 <p><span>An instant later, all of them opened their eyes, expressions of shock covering their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span>Upon closing their eyes and examining the bodies on the island below, they discovered that all of them still possessed life force. The power contained in every single body was enough to make them boil over with madness.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Luo Chen. Du Xiangyang. The six below us belong to you. You can choose which ones you’d like now, or pick once your elders arrive,” Qin Lie said with a smile. “Once you’ve chosen, I will help you remove the seals on them and you will be able to absorb the power directly from each body. You can also take the bodies and use their flesh and bones to refine powerful spirit artifacts, of course. That is your decision to make.”</span></p>
 <p><span>His words made Luo Chen and Du Xiangyang tremble, their eyes shining with joy. Both of them looked at Qin Lie and spoke up at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span>“May I send word to Heavenly Sword Mountain?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie nodded. “I welcome the elders from Heavenly Sword Mountain and insist that they come and take the spoils that belong to you!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Are you sure?” Luo Chen asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Yes,” Qin Lie replied confidently. He paused for a moment to think, then said, “I only hope that Blood Fiend Sect will receive the friendship of Heavenly Sword Mountain in return.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“I don’t think there’ll be any problems.” Du Xiangyang smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Qin Lie!” Xie Jingxuan exclaimed, pointing to a particular body. “I only need that one!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The body she pointed out was that of an elderly Wood Race man. He was only around a hundred and eighty centimeters tall and had grayish brown skin that resembled the bark of a tree.</span></p>
 <p><span>From his wrinkle-ridden face alone, this Wood Race clansman seemed astonishingly old, but he radiated astonishing waves of wood and life energy.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Demon Sealing Tombstone had been hovering in the air beside Qin Lie, and when he moved, its seven godly lights suddenly shot out from within it.</span></p>
 <p><span>As they did, everyone instinctively turned to look.</span></p>
 <p><span>The seven dazzling, godly lights resembled a rainbow that silently descended upon the body of this Wood Race clansman.</span></p>
 <p><span>If one were to look closely, they would discover that some sort of liquid power seemed to float within each godly light. That power flowed within each light like divine flashing runes that seemed to jump around erratically.</span></p>
 <p><span>A pale emerald light rose from the Wood Race clansman and formed a thin shield of light. Leafy patterns spread across the surface of that shield, clearly defending the body of this Wood Race clansman.</span></p>
 <p><span>Yet when the rays of godly light made contact and the divine runes flowed forth, that shield of light slowly eroded. It soon dissolved into drops of verdant liquid, and a potent aura of life energy emanated from it.</span></p>
 <p><span>These drops of verdant liquid landed on the body of the Wood Race clansman and resembled early morning dew on leaves, but they didn’t soak into it.</span></p>
 <p><span>At that moment, Qin Lie looked at Xie Jingxuan. He spoke up hesitantly.</span></p>
 <p><span>“S… Sister Jingxuan. I want to discuss something with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>A thread of shock flashed through Xie Jingxuan’s clear eyes when he called out to her, but it only shone for a moment. She immediately calmed down and said, “I know what you want to talk about.”</span></p>
 <p><span>This time, it was Qin Lie’s turn to be shocked. “You do?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Xie Jingxuan hesitated and gritted her teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span>“That verdant liquid, the distillation of the power that protected the body of that Wood Race clansman, is pure life energy,” she reluctantly exclaimed. “It is essentially water from the Spring of Life. Xue Moyan must offer something of equal value to trade for it!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Her declaration made Qin Lie freeze, but soon his worries dissipated.</span></p>
 <p><span>He smiled and said, “Many thanks, Sister Jingxuan.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“And now?” Xie Jingxuan snorted softly.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The seals on him have been destroyed,” Qin Lie said. “He now belongs to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The seven mysteriously godly lights withdrew into the Demon Sealing Tombstone once again, and the tombstone fell silent.</span></p>
 <p><span>The pale emerald shield of light surrounding the Wood Race clansman had been distilled into potent drops of water from the Spring of Life.</span></p>
 <p><span>Just this realization registered and astonished everyone present, Xie Jingxuan’s eyes shone with emerald light. Right when the crystalline chariot was about to land, impatience got the better of her and she charged toward the body of the Wood Race clansman, carefully collecting the drops of springwater with a special container.</span></p>
 <p><span>The breathing of both Luo Chen and Du Xiangyang grew ragged.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Qin Lie!” both of them shouted at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Take your pick.” Qin Lie smiled calmly.</span></p>
 <p><span>And the two of them instantly went mad.</span></p>
