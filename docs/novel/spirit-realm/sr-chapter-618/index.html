 <p><strong>Chapter 618: Facing the Future Head On</strong></p>
 <p><span>At the urging of Blood Fiend Sect’s elders, and at Qin Lie’s request, Xue Li finally took the Blood Progenitor’s body with him.</span></p>
 <p><span>After obtaining the Spring of Life, Xue Li, Xue Moyan, and the other members of Blood Fiend Sect returned to the bone ship at the first available moment. They wanted to help Mo Lingye regain her life force as soon as possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>In the meantime, Qin Lie followed Li Mu’s instructions and broke the seals of two bodies of ancient elites.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>He gave them to Xing Yumiao and Xing Shengnan, who left to work on absorbing the energy and inheritance that remained in them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Tang Siqi, Mo Hai, and everyone else stayed to chat with Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan, whereas Qin Lie accompanied Li Mu on a trip around the island.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>They quickly arrived at a certain corner of the island.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Mu looked into the distance and suddenly said, “As I thought, Blood Fiend Sect does have some strength left in them. All of those elders are in the Nirvana Realm. Unfortunately, they are mostly in the middle or early stages of the Nirvana Realm. There are no late stage Nirvana Realm experts among them. Even if Xue Li successfully merges with the Blood Progenitor’s body, he might not be able to unleash the strength of an Imperishable Realm expert in such a short time…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie quietly listened to his words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“His soul suffered a grievous wound, and without a precious treasure to help heal it, Xue Li would need dozens of years before being able to try fusing with every level of the Soul Altar inside of the Blood Progenitor’s mind. He would only be able to use the first level of the Soul Altar during the early stage of the fusion and obtain the strength of an early stage Imperishable Realm martial practitioner.” Li Mu pondered for a moment before adding, “Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families probably won’t give him dozens of years to gather his strength. If you do not win this battle, then Blood Fiend Sect will be utterly annihilated. You will also…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Mu shook his head and sighed. “I sent you into the the Graveyard of Gods and had you participate in the Trial in hopes that you would be able to prove your potential and get Heavenly Sword Mountain to easily accept you.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“You wouldn’t face nearly as much pressure as this if you were a part of Heavenly Sword Mountain. You would be able to leisurely cultivate to the next stage. I can guarantee that your progression to the Fulfillment Realm or even the Fragmentation Realm would be smooth.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Yet I never imagined that you would become entangled with Blood Fiend Sect and expose your identity this early. As a result, you’ve been dragged deeper and deeper into this mess, and the path ahead of you has become a lot more difficult. You will be met with a storm of blood.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie smiled wryly and replied, “Some things just can’t be predicted.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Mu nodded. After thinking to himself for a moment, he said, “Considering Gold Sun Island’s current strength, it won’t be easy for them to survive the wrath of Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families. If any of those four forces send out even a single Imperishable Realm martial practitioner, they would be able to flatten the Setting Sun Islands and destroy the current Blood Fiend Sect.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie’s face turned grim.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>He believed in Li Mu’s judgment. The more he knew about Li Mu, the more unfathomable and mysterious the man seemed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“You are not a disciple of Heavenly Sword Mountain, so I can’t help you.” Li Mu rubbed his chin and pondered for a moment. Then he said, “I guess you’ll have to use Old Duan’s jade token.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Jade token?” Qin Lie looked spirited.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Remember, if there is an Imperishable Realm expert among the enemy, you must inform Old Duan immediately. As long as you manage to send a message in time, he will definitely come to your aid!” Li Mu exclaimed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“I won’t forget!” Qin Lie said seriously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Also, don’t forget to research the ancient diagrams you inscribed in the past. There are some… secrets in them,” Li Mu suggested. “With your current realm and knowledge, you might not be able to completely understand what they contain. However, as long as you spend some time inscribing them and learning about them whenever you’re free, you’ll gradually learn their secrets.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“The ancient diagrams?” Qin Lie’s eyes lit up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>The fact that Li Mu himself was talking to him about this so seriously meant that the ancient diagrams within the Soul Suppressing Orb had to be incredibly precious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“These ancient diagrams are a great boon to your understanding of the world’s energy and your future realms,” Li Mu added. “I kept you at Li’s Shop back then because I also saw something special in those ancient diagrams.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie nodded quietly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“If, one day, you figure out the true secrets of those ancient diagrams… maybe you’ll truly be able to help me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>When he said this, a tinge of hope appeared on Li Mu’s face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Uncle Li, do you know about the secrets of Spirits of Void and Chaos?” Qin Lie suddenly asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Spirits of Void and Chaos?” Li Mu looked startled for a moment before answering, “I don’t know much about them. A Spirit of Void and Chaos is a special, extremely rare kind of entity. They caused huge waves during ancient times, and it has been said that Spirits of Void and Chaos once extracted the energies of entire subworlds. Our Land of Chaos has barely any actually ancient aristocratic families, so it’s difficult to learn the secrets of Spirits of Void and Chaos.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“An Asura Race clansman named&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hester</span> came to Setting Sun Islands two days ago. He wanted them…” Qin Lie explained the things that happened earlier.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“You have three Spirits of Void and Chaos!?” Li Mu shook with astonishment.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I have six in total. I am nurturing three more, and they will probably be born in half a month,” Qin Lie added.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Mu looked dumbstruck.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>After talking a long time to recover his wits, he sighed. “Your luck is godly, Qin Lie!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>After pondering for a moment, he said, “I know of <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hester</span>. This person is extremely powerful and should be in the middle stage of the Imperishable Realm. He is an expert with a two-level Soul Altar. In the past, tens of thousands of human experts died at the hands of the Asura Race when they invaded the Land of Chaos. The Asura Race is an ancient, which is why they know the secrets of Spirits of Void and Chaos. It’s only natural. His conditions… were okay, I guess.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Li Mu then changed the subject and said, “But since you’ve turned him down, there’s no longer any point in dwelling on it. I’ll keep an eye out for you and ask around about the secrets of Spirits of Void and Chaos.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Thank you, Uncle Li.” Qin Lie bowed deeply toward Li Mu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“You don’t have to thank me. I help you because I like your temperament quite a bit. Another reason why I help you is because you can help me in the future. Also, thanks to you, I’ve helped Heavenly Sword Mountain build a connection with the Nether Realm.” Li Mu smiled. “Even if you’re not aware of it, I’ve profited quite a bit thanks to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Really?” Qin Lie exclaimed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Haha, there are plenty more things you don’t know about, Qin Lie. But there’s no rush. When your realm is high enough, you’ll naturally come to know more things and truly recognize just how interesting the Land of Chaos is.” Li Mu laughed for a long time before saying, “Alright, I’ve said everything I needed to say during this trip. I’ve also brought your friends over as well. Mn, it will be inconvenient for me to interfere in the battle between Blood Fiend Sect, Black Voodoo Cult, and the three great families, so I should leave sooner rather than later.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Allow me to send you off.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Hehe, don’t worry about it. Go busy yourself with your own things.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Once he said this, Li Mu stepped into the sky and quickly returned to his Floating Island.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>He waved goodbye to Qin Lie from the island and left. In the blink of an eye, the Floating Island vanished from the skies above the Setting Sun Islands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie watched the Floating Island closely, and he noticed that Li Mu’s Floating Island was a lot more luxurious than regular flying spirit artifacts that Gold Sun Island of Blue Moon Valley had.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Both had flying spirit artifacts, such as the crystalline war chariots or Flowing Gold Fire Phoenixes, but Li Mu’s Floating Island was bigger, faster, and surrounded by an almost invisible shield of energy.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie knew a bit about great sect-protecting formations, and he immediately noticed that Li Mu’s Floating Island probably had a strange formation like Blue Moon Valley’s Shield of Cold Moon protecting it.</span></p>
 <p><span>Blood Fiend Sect’s Mo Jun finally came to meet Qin Lie after seeing that the Floating Island had departed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Qin Lie!” he said. “We’re going to build a teleportation formation on the island you’re temporarily staying on.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“What kind of teleportation formation? For what?” Qin Lie asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Big Brother Xue said that there was a unique ultimate blood ground in the Nether Battlefield between the Scarlet Tide Continent and the Nether Realm,” Mo Jun explained. “He said that a lot of Blood Spear martial practitioners are they, and that they can be considered a part of Blood Fiend Sect.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie immediately reacted and answered, “No problem. Please work on whatever you need to.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Lang Xie of Blood Spear, as well as a lot of other young, powerful martial practitioners who cultivated the Blood Spirit Art were hiding in the ultimate blood ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>All of these people had received inheritances from Xue Li, so they naturally counted as disciples of Blood Fiend Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie respected Lang Xie greatly. He knew that this person would eventually become a central pillar of Blood Fiend Sect as long as he continued to walk the path of cultivation step by step.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>After interacting with Mo Jun, Qin Lie sought out Xing Yuyuan and Xiang Xi, saying, “We will attack Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion immediately sweep through the mines and spirit plant fields they tend, and take everything for ourselves!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Xing Yuyuan’s expression changed. “But the Miao Family already warned us not to interfere!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“The Miao Family?” Qin Lie sneered. “Even if Blood Fiend Sect has declined for the past thousand years, they still possess a dozen or so Nirvana Realm martial practitioners. How can they be bullied by the likes of the Miao Family?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Xing Yuyuan’s eyes lit up, and he asked, “Is it really okay to make new enemies when Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families are about to attack us?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Although he said this, the light in his eyes grew brighter and brighter. He was obviously eager to perform this task.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Black Voodoo Cult plans to attack us, so we’re attacking their vassal forces first. Is there a problem?” Qin Lie asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“No, I understand. I know what to do.” Xing Yuyuan nodded strongly.</span></p>
