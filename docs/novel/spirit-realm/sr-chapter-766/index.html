 <p><b>Chapter 766: Absolute Yin Graveyard</b></p>
 <p><span style>The six spirits of Void and Chaos ignored his objections and flew out of the Soul Suppressing Orb as six bright and colorful rays of light in succession.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s eyes lit up when they appeared. He noticed that they were many times more spirited than they looked before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even their shrunk bodies had been restored to the usual size.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are these things?” Tian Yu of Ten Thousand Beast Mountains asked in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surrounding martial practitioners of the four forces were also staring at the spirits of Void and Chaos in astonishment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t seem to recognize the wonder that was a spirit of Void and Chaos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s nothing. Just six infant beasts.” Qin Lie threw out a random excuse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He tried to communicate with the spirits of Void and Chaos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yiyayiya!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the six spirits of Void and Chaos sensed his inquiry, they let out strange voices as if they were explaining something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, Qin Lie couldn’t understand what they were saying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could detect excitement, astonishment, anxiety, and various other emotions from them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like tiny spirit birds, they flew away from Qin Lie and circled above the Absolute Yin Graveyard. They lingered around the holes that were spouting yin energy while looking very happy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they didn’t dare to enter into the holes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They seemed to be afraid of something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s wrong?” Shen Yue also asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe there really is something strange.” He frowned and took out the Demon Sealing Tombstone. He swiftly dripped a lifeblood essence on the tombstone and attempted to bring up the image of the earth ghoul race hiding underground once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beside him, He Yi and everyone else were staring at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A thick gray mist covered the space above the Demon Sealing Tombstone. It covered up everything like an insoluble cloud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He actually couldn’t detect the three great ghoul races’ movements.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait me for a moment.” His face darkened. His wariness piqued as he secretly channeled the power of his bloodline.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As his blood boiled, he closed his eyes and did his best to sense the marks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No branded evil races went mad because of the imprints or revealed themselves around the Absolute yin Graveyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie grew more and more astonished, “I’ve lost track of them. Now I can’t say for certain if the three ghoul races had people hiding inside the graveyard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he said this, everyone’s faces turned heavy. Their gazes now became tinted with a bit of wariness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Should we just… ignore this place?” Feng Yiyou of Celestial Artifact Sect expressed his opinion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We know too little about the Absolute Yin Graveyard, so it’s best if we don’t go too deep inside it. Also, you are the one who said that the Earth Ghoul Race is loved by the earth, are extremely proficient in underground warfare. We shouldn’t head inside.” Luo Kexin said carefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We can leave, sure.” Tu Muo nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then we shall abandon this place.” Qin Lie respected and complied to everyone’s wishes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gathered his soul consciousness and called out to the six spirits of Void and Chaos, telling them to return to the Soul Suppressing Orb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chipchipjaja! Yiya!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the six spirits of Void and Chaos continued to linger above the Absolute Yin Graveyard and communicate with each other through their unique method. They still weren’t willing to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, they made gestures at Qin Lie as if begging him to do something to the Absolute Yin Graveyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie grew more and more puzzled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Judging from the spirits of Void and Chaos’ reactions, there must be something beneath the Absolute Yin Graveyard that attracted their attention.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they were also afraid of something and didn’t dare to lead the way downward. They were hoping that someone could lead ahead of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qin Lie?” He Yi exclaimed softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait a moment.” Qin Lie frowned deeply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He sat down on the Golden Winged Luan and pondered for a moment. In the end, he decided to send his soul consciousness down underground and probe around the area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be reckless!” Shen Yue hastily stopped him, “Those evil races are just as proficient with soul power as us. With your level of cultivation, it is highly likely that your True Soul will be pulled in by them if they caught your soul consciousness. The succumbence of one’s soul is most troublesome, and we won’t be able to save you even if we want to! This may be a trap set up by the evil races!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cut the impulse, kid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your soul isn’t strong enough to probe the Absolute Yin Graveyard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was advising him against his choice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at this moment a peak Nirvana Realm expert of the Terminator Sect suddenly raised his eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Gao looked towards the ast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few martial practitioners who reached the late stage of Nirvana Realm also looked at that direction with slightly changed expressions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are evil race clansmen that are rushing their way towards us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group immediately prepared their arms in response while looking anxious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie circulated his bloodline power once more but found nothing out of the ordinary. This was how he knew that there were no branded ghouls in the incoming group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was also why he wasn’t able to predict their arrival ahead of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few minutes later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh whoosh whoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of floating stones streaking through the air reached them first. Before long, seven huge floating stones appeared before their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hundreds of three ghoul races’ clansmen were standing at the top of the bone towers erected above those floating stones. They looked anxious and worried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They looked obviously surprised when they saw the human group. It didn’t look like they expected to run into them above the Absolute Yin Graveyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was obvious that they weren’t after their group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Underground!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Heaven Ghoul Race elder glared at them once coldly before he did something no one expected: he pointed at the Absolute Yin Graveyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hundreds of outsiders standing above the bone tower let out shrill howls and charged towards the Absolute Yin Graveyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their targets weren’t the human races but the eerie looking holes that had suddenly appeared above the Absolute Yin Graveyard. They dove straight towards the underground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The human experts who had just prepared themselves for a fierce battle exchanged puzzled glances with each other, not knowing what on Spirit Realm was going on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A while later, Qin Lie rubbed his nose and said with an odd expression, “It doesn’t look like they’ve come for us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does that mean… that there is an enemy they hated even more than us beneath the Absolute Yin Graveyard?” Lu Gao looked just as confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Last time we saw a lot of evil races hiding beneath the Absolute Yin Graveyard on the Demon Sealing Tombstone,” Chu Li looked startled, “Could it be that those people were met with something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that he mentioned it, everyone thought quickly and gradually came to the same conclusion: the evil races beneath the Absolute Yin Graveyard most definitely had encountered some troubles!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Absolute Yin Graveyard used to be a place where Moon Worshipping Cult buried their dead, and Moon Worshipping Cult itself was the greatest evil cult to exist on the Land of Chaos several thousand years ago. No one can deny that the Moon Worshipping Cult once ruled this land, and we know little about this evil cult too. We don’t even know why they suddenly declined.” He Yi of Celestial Artifact Sect said with a serious look on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Swoosh swoosh swoosh! Swoosh swoosh swoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, the six spirits of Void and Chaos who refused to return to the Soul Suppressing Orb all this time noticed the outsiders slipping underground and trailed behind them. They slipped all the way to the bottom while they were still talking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment they vanished from Qin Lie’s sight, a most profound connection was built between Qin Lie and them. They transmitted the scenes they saw to him like videos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In an instant, it was as if Qin Lie had gained six new pairs of eyes. He could see everything the six spirits of Void and Chaos saw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His brain suddenly felt a little confused. All kinds of images were slipping past his head, keeping him from differentiating which were the images he was seeing and which were the images coming from the spirits of Void and Chaos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t help but close his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait! Wait a moment! I can look underground now!” He exclaimed while his eyes were closed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The martial practitioners gathered around him shuddered when they heard this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were all looking at him like he was a monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What else can you not do?” Luo Kexin of the Celestial Artifact Sect said quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a sentiment echoed by many other people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie could see what the evil races were doing, trigger the imprints inside their body, and even use the Thunderblitz wood to increase the power of the Profound Thunder Heart and kill the evil races en masse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, he was claiming that he could see into the underground of the Absolute Yin Graveyard from the ground surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was even doing it with his eyes closed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything he thing looked strange and unbelievable. The astonishment in their hearts kept growing bigger and bigger. wanting to know what else he could do.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, the better question was what couldn’t he do?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The six spirits of Void and Chaos continued to venture deep into the Absolute Yin Graveyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scene that greeted Qin Lie were gray and dark images. He could see some empty underground stone chambers in the brighter images, and in those chambers he saw dry bones, rotten corpses, bottles, jars, and unknown evil formations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piles of dry bones and rotten corpses could be found on some of those evil formations. There were also all kinds of strange materials everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of these materials were either bones with phosphoric poison inside them, the innards of evil creatures or spirit beasts, heads, and many more obviously highly toxic plants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was obvious that someone in Moon Worshipping Cult had performed all kinds of evil rituals in the underground palaces of the Absolute Yin Graveyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a style of ritual that was completely different from Yue Ji, Ye Ji, and Shui Ji’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The six spirits of Void and Chaos continued to travel down further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, an image transmitted by the Fire Qilin spirit of Void and Chaos drew all of his attention.</span></p>
