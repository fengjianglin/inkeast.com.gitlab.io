 <p><strong>Chapter 601: Absorb!</strong></p>
 <p>Xie Jingxuan landed next to the body of the Wood Race clansman and carefully gathered the drops of the Spring of Life. Her movements were precise and deliberate, almost as if she were afraid of disturbing the body.</p>
 <p>The crystalline chariots carrying the others hovered above the island. The Xing siblings, Xiang Xi, Xu Changsheng, and Xu Jiadong were extremely focused, the light in their eyes burning more and more clearly.</p>
 <p>Even Xing Yuyuan’s breathing gradually sped up.</p>
 <p>Luo Chen, Du Xiangyang, and Song Tingyu turned to look at Qin Lie, excitement gushing from their eyes. They hoped he would be able to help them take specific bodies of ancient elites by breaking the seals on them.</p>
 <p>The three had decided on their targets a long time ago.</p>
 <p>At this point in time, no more drops of liquid remained on the body of the Wood Race clansman. Xie Jingxuan, having collected all of them into her container, raised her head to look at Qin Lie. She hesitated for a moment, and then asked, “May I take this body?”</p>
 <p>“Of course,” Qin Lie said, a faint smile on his face.</p>
 <p>Xie Jingxuan’s eyes lit up. The body of this Wood Race clansman contained an ancient inheritance and was filled with potent life energy. She grabbed it and quickly flew to the stone tower she currently resided and cultivated in.</p>
 <p>“Boom!”</p>
 <p>A power fluctuation visible to the naked eye spread from that stone tower like a sea of verdant trees. It carried the sound of ancient trees shaking along with the rustling of falling leaves. The souls of everyone that heard this became calm and peaceful.</p>
 <p>Even someone as powerful as Xing Yumiao could feel the aura of the inheritance hidden within the Wood Race clansman’s body from that strong power fluctuation.</p>
 <p>If all of them were to enter that stone tower, they would discover that body radiating faint emerald light.</p>
 <p>Xie Jingxuan sat in front of the body of the Wood Race clansman and released her soul consciousness, her hands making strange motions. Tree seedlings appeared in the palm of her hand and grew. Each branch and leaf that formed seemed to be filled with remarkable life energy. Ancient runes that resembled leaves emerged from the rough, barklike skin of that Wood Race clansman, churning in his blood and cheering as though they’d found where they belonged. Those runes floated toward the verdant seedlings in her hand, quickly growing bigger and stronger as they did.</p>
 <p>A potent aura of life energy surged from the tower and spread in every direction.</p>
 <p>No vegetation could be seen anywhere on this island, but after this aura of life energy spread from the tower, small patches of grass began to stubbornly grow.</p>
 <p>It was a miracle!</p>
 <p>“She has already begun absorbing the energy from the body of the Wood Race clansman!” Xing Yumiao exclaimed, his voice trembling slightly. “She’s started receiving the inheritance it contains!”</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie!” Du Xiangyang shouted, turning his fiery gaze to him once again.</p>
 <p>Luo Chen and Song Tingyu gradually found it difficult to control themselves.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie nodded. “Go to the bodies you want, and I’ll help you break the seals on them. The amount of energy you absorb depends your good fortune.”</p>
 <p>Du Xiangyang, Song Tingyu, and Luo Chen immediately leaped from the crystalline chariot and shot toward their respective targets.</p>
 <p>Du Xiangyang landed beside to the body of a member of the Asura Race.</p>
 <p>Members of the Asura Race were tall. Male Asura Race clansmen were savage and vicious, like monsters or ghosts. Females possessed uncommon beauty, bountiful chests, and shapely behinds. The elite that Du Xiangyang had picked was clearly male. He wore scarlet armor that seemed to have been made from natural pieces of unique crystal. Upon closer examination, the armor seemed to burn like flames.</p>
 <p>The moment he approached the body, excitement overwhelmed Du Xiangyang. Wisps of scarlet flame erupted from his sleeves, his eyes, and even his ears.</p>
 <p>He suddenly looked as though he had been swallowed by flames.</p>
 <p>It only took Qin Lie a single glance to know that Du Xiangyang was already prepared. He nodded and said, “Wait until I have broken the seal!”</p>
 <p>Seven dazzling prismatic lights emerged from the Demon Sealing Tombstone and struck the body of the Asura Race elite.</p>
 <p>“Woosh woosh woosh!”</p>
 <p>The body of this elite suddenly erupted in blazing scarlet flames! Intense heat that seemed capable of setting the world on fire made even Du Xiangyang, a martial practitioner that cultivated the power of fire, instantly retreat.</p>
 <p>Terror filled the faces of everyone aboard the crystalline chariots. All of them felt as though they were about to be enveloped in flames.</p>
 <p>But that sensation only lasted for a moment.</p>
 <p>In the face of the seven godly lights, the scarlet flames quickly receded and vanished within the body of the Asura Race elite.</p>
 <p>The Asura Race elite’s body glowed like heated metal, but it did not show any hostility.</p>
 <p>“It’s safe now.” Qin Lie nodded.</p>
 <p>Du Xiangyang rubbed his hands together in anticipation, finally moving closer and sitting next to the Asura Race elite’s body. He channeled his spirit art and began absorbing the scarlet flames from it.</p>
 <p>After watching Du Xiangyang do this for a while, Qin Lie looked at Luo Chen.</p>
 <p>Luo Chen had decided upon a member of the Gray Wing Race.</p>
 <p>This Gray Wing Race clansman had been grievously wounded before dying, and its wings had no feathers. If all the feathers of a Gray Wing Race clansman fell off, they would usually grow them back over time. This clansman, however, had been dead for countless years. Since it wasn’t alive, the feathers hadn’t grown back. In spite of that, the bones of its wings were still incomparably sharp. The surface of those bones held natural patterns, radiating a stunningly ancient and destructive aura.</p>
 <p>“Him,” Luo Chen said.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie nodded and commanded the Demon Sealing Tombstone.</p>
 <p>When the seven prismatic lights descended, strange energy formed feathers on the body of the Gray Wing clansman. The grayish brown wings took on a light, nimble aura, but the radiance of the prismatic lights gradually made that aura disappear.</p>
 <p>Once the seal had been broken, Qin Lie didn’t linger for long. He eventually directed the crystalline chariot and searched for Song Tingyu’s trail.</p>
 <p>“Ah!” Xing Shengnan exclaimed softly.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie concentrated and found Song Tingyu’s position. The moment he did, he froze and stared at her in shock.</p>
 <p>Unlike Xie Jingxuan and the others, who had chosen bodies similar to humans in size, Song Tingyu had settled on an enormous skeleton. This skeleton belonged to some sort of beast that resembled a lion or a tiger and was almost a hundred meters long. Hundreds of bones of varying sizes made up this monstrous skeleton, all of them a grayish white. This skeleton didn’t glow, but it did possess an ancient, savage aura.</p>
 <p>The only part of this ancient beast’s skeleton that radiated light were its eyes. In spite of the ravages of time, they still looked like flawless crystals and housed unknown flowing lights.</p>
 <p>Song Tingyu’ eyes quivered as she stared at the ancient beast’s own strange pair of eyes.</p>
 <p>Song Tingyu smiled and said, “This one!”</p>
 <p>“Are you sure?”</p>
 <p>“I’m sure!”</p>
 <p>“Alright!” Qin Lie exclaimed, taking action.</p>
 <p>He communicated with the Demon Sealing Tombstone and had its prismatic lights shine down upon the beast skeleton.</p>
 <p>This enormous skeleton that hadn’t shone with any light suddenly became a crystalline purple. Now this hundred-meter-long skeleton gave off a beautiful light and seemed as if it had been carved from a single piece of purple crystal.</p>
 <p>At the same time that this transformation occurred, every bone of the skeleton unleashed relentless earsplitting howls.</p>
 <p>Off in the distance, Du Xiangyang and Luo Chen suddenly stopped what they were doing and looked over in shock.</p>
 <p>The seven godly lights flowed from the Demon Sealing Tombstone like a long, winding river. It grew larger and larger until, all of a sudden, it whipped the beast skeleton!</p>
 <p>And the overwhelming primal roars resounding from the beautiful crystal skeleton slowly died away.</p>
 <p>Song Tingyu’s beautiful eyes lit up with happiness. She looked to Qin Lie, and when he nodded, she immediately approached the head of the skeleton.</p>
 <p>Her eyes gazed into the beast’s, and tiny meteoric lights shot into the beast’s eyes like a flash of lightning.</p>
 <p>An ancient, primal aura emerged from the bones of the skeleton, but it did not feel savage. Instead, it seemed as if it were shouting in excitement as it experienced something.</p>
 <p>Everyone aboard the crystalline chariots focused on Song Tingyu and watched in amazement as she obtained a strange energy from the beast’s eyes.</p>
 <p>Xie Jingxuan, Du Xiangyang, Luo Chen, and Song Tingyu had each chosen a body of an ancient elite for themselves and begun to obtain the wonders that lay within.</p>
 <p>The Xing Siblings, Xiang Xi, Xu Changsheng, and Xu Jiadong, had followed them every step of the way. They had seen everything. The envy that shone on their faces couldn’t be hidden no matter how hard they tried.</p>
 <p>They suddenly began thinking about the benefits that Qin Lie had mentioned.</p>
