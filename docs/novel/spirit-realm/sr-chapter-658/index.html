 <p><b>Chapter 658: Recognize Reality!</b></p>
 <p>“Miao Yangxu is really something!”</p>
 <p>On the return, Meng Feng sighed and felt deep admiration for the Miao Family for decisively sacrificing Miao Tai.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie and Hong Bowen were also discussing this matter with each other. “The Miao Family has submitted, we can take over the mines of Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion again.” Hong Bowen’s face was full of smiles. “Blood Fiend Sect needs great amounts of spirit materials in order to recover, we must settle all the scores we can in the periphery.”</p>
 <p>“The Miao Family has a Nirvana Realm expert, but this time, we almost smashed the Shield of Cold Moon and that Nirvana realm expert still did not appear. This is strange,” Xing Yumiao’s expression was grave.</p>
 <p>“Do you know the situation of that Nirvana Realm expert?” Meng Feng asked.</p>
 <p>Shaking his head, Xing Yumiao replied. “I’m not too clear. However, in the past when the Miao Family fought against their enemies, the strongest and most difficult of the enemies would be ambushed and killed. Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion had three martial practitioners in the middle and late stages of Fragmentation Realm that were killed in that manner.”</p>
 <p>“It seems that there is a Nirvana Realm expert hiding in the Miao Family.” Hong Bowen nodded. “I wonder what his strength is. I do not think... it is very high.”</p>
 <p>“Mn.” The Xing Brothers nodded as well.</p>
 <p>No matter how they speculated, they would never think that the Nirvana Realm expert of the Miao Family was the previous patriarch of the Miao Family, Miao Fengtian. Moreso, they would never think that Miao Fengtian had reached the late stage of the Nirvana Realm and only lacked enough spirit materials to create a Soul Altar and enter the Imperishable Realm.</p>
 <p>They would never suspect that Miao Fengtian and Jiang Zhuzhe were in secret contact all this time.</p>
 <p>“Uncle Hong, I need to return to Illusory Demon Sect,” Xue Moyan suddenly said.</p>
 <p>“You want to find your master?” Hong Bowen was shocked.</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Xue Moyan nodded lightly.</p>
 <p>“Go.” Hong Bowen did not ask any more questions. He casually glanced at Qin Lie, suddenly smiling and saying, “Qin Lie, do you want to visit Illusory Demon Sect? Illusory Demon Sect is an old Silver rank force, and there are many unique things about it. Maybe you can gain some experience and knowledge along the way?”</p>
 <p>Xue Moyan’s long eyelashes softly flickered.</p>
 <p>Bowing her head to stare at the tips of her feet, she felt a thread of anticipation.</p>
 <p>“Not interested,” Qin Lie refused in a cold tone. “I’m in a hurry to go back to the Scarlet Tide Continent with Sister Tingyu and the others, I do not have the time to go visit Illusory Demon Sect.”</p>
 <p>Hearing him say this, Xue Moyan’s eyes became dim, dispirited expression appearing on her face.</p>
 <p>But because her head was bowed, no one saw or knew what she was thinking.</p>
 <p>“Then I’ll be going first.” After saying this, Xue Moyan did not look at anyone. All by herself, she turned and drove a crystal chariot to fly into the clouds.</p>
 <p>Seeing her figure fade into the clouds, Hong Bowen sighed inwardly. There was nothing he could say.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie, I think that you and Moyan are suited to each other. Haha, how about I play matchmaker?” Meng Feng picked up the topic. “Look, Big Brother Xue is like a master-father figure to you, Sister-in-law Lingye also thinks highly of you, and so does everyone in Blood Fiend Sect. If you are willing, no one will obstruct you and Moyan!”</p>
 <p>“Uncle Meng, I appreciate your good intentions.” Qin Lie smiled slightly and said, “But I have someone I’m interested in, just like Senior Sister Xue has someone that she likes. We do not have any feelings for each other, so we cannot be together. Also, the connection between me and Blood Fiend Sect would not change because of a marriage.”</p>
 <p>When he said this in front of Hong Bowen and Meng Feng, it was the same as refusing Blood Fiend Sect’s good intentions.</p>
 <p>Hong Bowen smiled bitterly.</p>
 <p>Meng Feng had a shocked expression.</p>
 <p>In his view, even though Blood Fiend Sect had declined, it was still an ancient and powerful force. Xue Moyan was the only daughter of Xue Li and Mo Lingye, and also the direct disciple of Yu Lingwei. In terms of status, beauty and power, she could match Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>As long as there was an engagement to between Qin Lie and Xue Moyan, Qin Lie was almost assured to be the leader of Blood Fiend Sect in the future. He would possess Blood Fiend Sect’s enormous resources and have a place in the Land of Chaos.</p>
 <p>Meng Feng believed that a great majority of young martial practitioners would not be able to refuse this proposal.</p>
 <p>“I’ve used a lot of spirit energy and soul power to control the eight slabs of Thunderblitz wood, I’m going back to rest.” Qin Lie stood up, bowed slightly to the group, and left.</p>
 <p>The Xing Brothers exchanged a look and perceptively stood up. They walked out after Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>“Moyan is the pearl of our Blood Fiend Sect, where is she not good enough for that boy? Also, if he married Moyan, wouldn’t the boy be in charge of Blood Fiend Sect in the future? Why would he refuse such a generous offer?” Meng Feng sat there with a frown that indicated his puzzlement.</p>
 <p>The fat Hong Bowen grimaced. “Old Meng, I thought the same as you in the past. I also thought that Qin Lie would not be able to refuse the marriage. I originally thought that facing such a great temptation, he will abandon Miss Song and his childhood love, that female surnamed Ling from the Scarlet Tide Continent. And that he would get together with Moyan.”</p>
 <p>“You do not think that now?” Meng Feng stilled.</p>
 <p>“I do not.” Hong Bowen sighed softly. “After the battle at the Setting Sun Islands, I suddenly found a problem. This makes me helpless, but I have to admit that this is reality.”</p>
 <p>“How so?”</p>
 <p>“Think carefully. If Qin Lie did not appear, what would Blood Fiend Sect be like now?” Hong Bowen asked.</p>
 <p>Meng Feng frowned.</p>
 <p>A long time later, Meng Feng said with a dark face, “Without Qin Lie, Big Brother Xue would not have broken free of Jiang Zhuzhe’s restraints. He would still be sealed on the Scarlet Tide Continent. Without Qin Lie entering the Graveyard of Gods, even if Moyan fortunately survived, she would not live long due to her depleted longevity. Without Qin Lie giving the body of the Blood Progenitor to Big Brother Xue, Big Brother Xue would have no hope of rising again, and Sister-in-law... may not have awoken.”</p>
 <p>“Without Qin Lie, Duan Qianjie would not have appeared at the battle on the Setting Sun Islands. If he did not show up, the ten of us would have needed to use our blood essence to form the blood demon to heavily injure Pu Ze. if not Qin Lie using the eight god corpses to fight Jiang Zhuzhe later, the body of the Blood Progenitor would be stolen by Jiang Zhuzhe.”</p>
 <p>Meng Feng’s head was bowed as he thought seriously about the events.</p>
 <p>As these words were being sad, Meng Feng’s face gradually darkened, while his voice was getting weaker.</p>
 <p>“Do you understand now?” Hong Bowen grimaced.</p>
 <p>Meng Feng nodded lightly and said dispiritedly. “So the reason why Blood Fiend Sect could see another day and was able to walk out of the shadows was all because of this boy...”</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Xue once said, Qin Lie... has many secrets. He is a crucial part of our Blood Fiend Sect’s rise. I didn’t believe it then, I thought that Big Brother Xue was exaggerating Qin Lie’s importance. But I accepted the reality, I have to admit the reason that Blood Fiend Sect lived to see today is completely due to Qin Lie’s appearance,” Hong Bowen said with a sigh.</p>
 <p>The pride on Meng Feng’s face faded.</p>
 <p>“Think back to the battle on the Setting Sun Islands.” Hong Bowen continued to speak. “I heard that Lei Yan came to the Setting Sun Islands in order to take Qin Lie to Thunder’s Roar to see Forefather Terminator. Before the battle, Guan Xian seemed to have received a message from Nan Zhengtian to not kill Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>“During the fight, Duan Qianjie came and helped Qin Lie smash Pu Ze’s Soul Altar, keeping Qin Lie safe.</p>
 <p>“Forefather Terminator, Duan Qianjie, and the sixth heavenly sword of Heavenly Sword Mountain, Li Mu. They are all people at the summit of the Land of Chaos! If Qin Lie leaves Blood Fiend Sect, he can pick any of the three, and his future will not be any worse than if he stayed at Blood Fiend Sect. He might have an even brighter and more peaceful future.</p>
 <p>“At Blood Fiend Sect, he will be restrained in certain aspects, and will be forced to face many dangers.</p>
 <p>“Due to this, Qin Lie can leave at any time, and nothing will change for him. His life may become even smoother. As for us, once Qin Lie leaves, the Setting Sun Islands will no longer have protection of the eight god corpses. If Jiang Zhuzhe, Wen Bin, or any other Imperishable Realm expect came, Blood Fiend Sect would be exterminated!</p>
 <p>“The Blood Fiend Sect of today doesn’t have anything to offer, and we are extremely reliant on his existence. It’s not that he relies on us.</p>
 <p>“You need to be clear about this. When you face him in the future, remember to not feel as though you are above him.</p>
 <p>“Because it’s us that survive by relying on him!”</p>
 <p>After Hong Bowen said this, Meng Feng was silent for a long time. He was finally forced to accept that reality.</p>
 <p>Noon on the next day.</p>
 <p>After Qin Lie and the group returned to the Setting Sun Islands, Meng Feng and Hong Bowen went to find Mo Lingye immediately to tell what had happened on this trip.</p>
 <p>The Xing brothers were also busy, gathering people to go to Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion’s territories. They were going to take back the mines that Blue Moon Valley were controlling.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie returned to Flaming Sun Island.</p>
 <p>He expressed his intentions of returning to the Scarlet Tide Continent, and had those who wanted to return to prepare as quickly as possible.</p>
 <p>Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan came out. The two females found Qin Lie and began talking.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie, you once said that Jingxuan and I have a share of the remains of the ancient elites. According to the number of people, all of us that came out of the Graveyard of Gods can get three. Jingxuan and I only absorbed one. May we choose again?” Song Tingyu said.</p>
 <p>“Of course!” Qin Lie nodded.</p>
 <p>“Then Jingxuan and I want one more!” Song Tingyu’s eyes lit up. “Because the remains of the ancient elites are too large, we know it is not realistic to transport them to the Scarlet Tide Continent. It is not convenient to use the spatial teleportation formation either. So, so...”</p>
 <p>Song Tingyu was slightly embarrassed.</p>
 <p>“Just say it,” Qin Lie urged.</p>
 <p>“I hope that my father, and Sister Tingyu’s father can borrow Blood Fiend Sect’s teleportation formation after we return and come to the Setting Sun Islands to pick an ancient elite body,” Xie Jingxuan interjected.</p>
 <p>She looked at Qin Lie with clear eyes and said, “I know that when we, Profound Heaven Alliance, made an agreement with the Horned Demon Race, what we did behind your back was not... honest. I hope that you can forgive us for the sake of me and Sister Tingyu and allow our fathers to come and use the ancient elite remains to increase their strength and cultivate”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie was silent.</p>
 <p>In the past, when the Horned Demon Race used the Profound Yin Nine Leaf Lotus to trade for Ku Lu, Profound Heaven Alliance immediately attacked after the transaction. They wanted to kill the Horned Demon Race and the members of the Ling Family.</p>
 <p>If Qin Lie hadn’t had the Eye of Frost and moved everyone into the Land of Frost, they would have all been killed.</p>
 <p>After the matter, Profound Heaven Alliance and the Eight Extreme Temple spread a message throughout the entire Scarlet Tide Continent to kill him, the Horned Demon Race, and the members of the Ling Family.</p>
 <p>Many of the actions that Profound Heaven Alliance had done then had angered Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>In the end, he had awakened the ancient beasts and retaliated when Profound Heaven Alliance, Eight Extreme Temple and Joyful Union Sect attacked Herb Mountain. He almost destroyed all of Profound Heaven Alliance’s Nie Family, while also making Eight Extreme Temple and Joyful Union Sect suffer heavy losses.</p>
 <p>Only when Li Mu showed himself did the fight between him and the three forces finally calm down.</p>
 <p>Profound Heaven Alliance and Eight Extreme Temple had paid a great price. Under Li Mu’s protection, he had left the Scarlet Tide Continent without ever looking back.</p>
 <p>Many years had passed.</p>
 <p>He still did not have a good opinion of Profound Heaven Alliance but due to Song Tingyu, Xie Jingxuan, increase in his status and his recently broadened perspective, he no longer felt so strongly about them.</p>
 <p>Besides, the Scarlet Tide Continent was under control of the Profound Heaven Alliance. Many of his friends were in Profound Heaven Alliance’s subordinate forces.</p>
 <p>In the future, he might still need to interact with Profound Heaven Alliance. With Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan by his side, he couldn’t just slaughter Profound Heaven Alliance. He needed to overcome this mental obstacle.</p>
 <p>“For you two, I will... agree.” A long time later, Qin Lie barely managed to agree.</p>
 <p>Xie Jingxuan’s eyes lit up as she smiled.</p>
 <p>Song Tingyu also smiled brightly and wrapped around his arm to give him a kiss. “I just knew you would be broad-minded!” Her eyes were filled with comfort.</p>
 <p>Song Yu and Xie Yaoyang were both in the Fragmentation Realm. If they could receive a secret inheritance from the remains of ancient elites and break through the Fragmentation Realm into the Fulfillment Realm, it would be crucial for the future development of Profound Heaven Alliance.</p>
 <p>As daughters, they cared about their fathers’ future. After their trip to the Land of Chaos, they understood that strong cultivation and one’s own power could have the effect of determining everything in a conflict of forces.</p>
 <p>When the trio was speaking, Mo Hai, Feng Rong, Tang Siqi, Lian Rou, Yi Yuan, and the martial practitioners of the Scarlet Tide Continent gathered up from all over the island.</p>
 <p>When Tang Siqi arrived, she saw Song Tingyu arm in arm with Qin Lie. There was still also the moist mark of lips on the left side of Qin Lie’s face.</p>
 <p>After a glance, her face dimmed and her mood dropped.</p>
 <p>“We are also preparing to return to the Scarlet Tide Continent,” said Feng Rong said after walking up to them. “Other than Lang Xie who doesn’t have any relatives there, we are all prepared to return.”</p>
 <p>“Alright, no problem,” Qin Lie said.</p>
 <p>After he spoke, Qin Lie found someone from Blood Fiend Sect to communicate and then notified Hu Yun of Gold Sun Island. He also went to the spirit material stores of Gold Sun Island and picked some spirit artifacts they obtained from Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion. He also retrieved medicinal pills, many spirit materials, and herbs that were rare valuables on the Scarlet Tide Continent.</p>
 <p>Having prepared everything, he took everyone to the teleportation formation and stepped into it, accompanied by Meng Feng.</p>
 <p>A bloody light glowed. Everyone that came from the Scarlet Tide Continent and was inside the formation got wrapped with red light. After a wave of strong vibrations, everyone disappeared.</p>
