 <p><strong>Chapter 522: Arrival!</strong></p>
 <p>A dragon made of blood energy roared soundlessly as it bit into a barbarian wearing bright red clothing.</p>
 <p>This scarlet barbarian immediately felt his blood boil over, his spirit energy becoming chaotic.</p>
 <p>“Boom!”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie struck with the Astral Thunder Hammer, smashing that barbarian’s bones to bits.</p>
 <p>“Splurt!”</p>
 <p>Luo Chen stabbed his sword into the chest of another scarlet barbarian, piercing the man’s heart and ending his life.</p>
 <p>In another part of the area, Du Xiangyang and Xue Moyan killed three other scarlet barbarians.</p>
 <p>This battle took place halfway up a mountain with a glacier running down its length.</p>
 <p>For the past half month, Qin Lie’s group had been running into scarlet barbarians, and they had just exterminated their third wave of them.</p>
 <p>“How much further is the ice spirit?” Du Xiangyang crouched to the ground and searched through the remains of the scarlet barbarians, checking if any had spirit materials or spirit stones.</p>
 <p>“We’re close,” Qin Lie answered nonchalantly.</p>
 <p>“Scarlet barbarians are the only people we’ve encountered for the past two weeks,” Song Tingyu interjected. “It’s a good thing our tokens can’t transmit our location. Otherwise, Di Fei and the rest of his scarlet barbarians would be able to track us easily.”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie’s group was currently moving through a part of the Forbidden Land of Ice with many scarlet barbarians. Groups of fifteen were scattered throughout the area, searching everywhere for the ice spirit.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie’s group had run into three of these groups in a row. The boisterous mouths of every scarlet barbarian told them that their leader was Di Fei.</p>
 <p>They weren’t sure what kind of method Di Fei had at his disposal, but he had roughly identified where the ice spirit was and brought his tribesmen over.</p>
 <p>However, the scarlet barbarians only had a vague idea of where it was, so they split into smaller teams and spread out to search for it.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie’s group had killed three of those teams, adding up to a total of forty-five scarlet barbarians.</p>
 <p>“Let’s get out of here as soon as possible. This team sent a message before fighting us,” Du Xiangyang said as he stood up, having searched the bodies. “It’s likely that another team of those savages is rushing here as we speak.”</p>
 <p>“Mn,” Xue Moyan agreed. “If we’re unlucky enough to run into that Di Fei, we may get trapped here.”</p>
 <p>“Is Di Fei that strong?” Luo Chen asked, raising an eyebrow.</p>
 <p>“Di Fei is… extremely capable. Like Sen Ye, he is the leader of the Scarlet Barbarian Tribe’s younger generation,” Xue Moyan said, explaining what she knew about the eastern barbarians. “Di Fei cultivates the power of earth. The eastern barbarians refer to him as ‘the Son of Earth.’. He is rumored to be quite powerful, having possessed monstrous physical strength from birth.”</p>
 <p>“How does he compare to Sen Ye?” Du Xiangyang asked in a grim tone.</p>
 <p>“They’re equally matched. Jia Yue, the white barbarian girl we encountered earlier, is considered weaker than the two of them. However...” Xue Moyan took a moment to think. “This is the Forbidden Land of Ice. Jia Yue shouldn’t be any weaker than them here. At any rate, we need to be careful.”</p>
 <p>While they were speaking, Qin Lie took out the Demon Sealing Tombstone to once again confirm the direction they would move in.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!”</p>
 <p>It emerged from his spatial ring like a brilliant beacon, the dazzling divine lights inside of it resembling the luminescent tail feathers of a colorful peacock.</p>
 <p>Powerful energy radiated from the Demon Sealing Tombstone. Despite being restrained by Qin Lie, it shook and trembled, clearly having an intense reaction to something.</p>
 <p>Everyone’s eyes lit up at the same time.</p>
 <p>“We’re about to reach it!” Qin Lie shouted.</p>
 <p>He shoved the Demon Sealing Tombstone back into his spatial ring and took a deep breath. An immense aura of refined blood energy emanated from him.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go!”</p>
 <p>Like a ray of bloody light, Qin Lie shot toward the peak of the mountain. The rest of the group grew excited as they rushed to follow him.</p>
 <p>An hour after their departure, two groups of scarlet barbarians arrived in that same area.</p>
 <p>“This is the third team!” a young scarlet barbarian roared in a low, raspy voice. He was clearly a head shorter than everyone else, but he had a large physique.</p>
 <p>Although this barbarian was short, he gave off a shocking aura. He was incredibly conspicuous and only needed to stand there to seem valiant.</p>
 <p>The thirty scarlet barbarians that made up the two teams he commanded were tall and burly. Plenty had extraordinary auras as well. In spite of this, all of them looked at the young scarlet barbarian with reverence.</p>
 <p>“Young Master, the enemy has discarded their tokens. We are unable to track them properly,” a scarlet barbarian exclaimed in a heavy voice.</p>
 <p>“We’ll meet them soon enough!” The scarlet barbarian tribe leader, Di Fei, gave him a savage grin. “They have the Demon Sealing Tombstone, so they’re here for the ice spirit as well. We’ll definitely encounter them in this area!”</p>
 <p>“What should we do now?” one of his subordinates asked.</p>
 <p>“Contact everybody!” Di Fei ordered. “Tell them to join forces with other teams so they won’t be eliminated one after another, then head in this direction!”</p>
 <p>“Understood!”</p>
 <p>“Relax!” Di Fei exclaimed with a cold snort. “Someone is going to help us find them…”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Wow! Everyone, look!” Pan Qianqian cried, having reached the peak of the glacial mountain. “What a huge lake! It’s so beautiful!”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie and the others rushed up to join her, looking into the distance. The scenery brought expressions of amazement to all of their faces.</p>
 <p>In the center of numerous mountains, nestled by clouds, sat an enormous frozen lake. The ice that made up its surface resembled a gigantic, wondrous mirror. No one could tell just how thick it actually was.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie’s group stood at the top of a mountain, one of many that surrounded the frozen lake. Behind and around them were more snow-covered mountains and even glaciers.</p>
 <p>Hundreds of thousands of enormous icy masses could be seen in the distance, connected to one another to form a ring with the lake at its center.</p>
 <p>The air above the frozen lake was bone-chillingly cold. Frigid winds howled, weaving between the nearby mountains.</p>
 <p>“The winds that can instantly freeze people to death probably originated from this lake,” Du Xiangyang said, taking a deep breath. “This icy lake… must be the very center of the Forbidden Land of Ice. The ice spirit should be inside of it as well!”</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie, do you want use the Demon Sealing Tombstone to make sure?” Song Tingyu asked.</p>
 <p>“No need.” Qin Lie said confidently, shaking his head. “The ice spirit should be at the bottom of this lake!”</p>
 <p>“How about the Land of Buried Gods?” Xie Jingxuan asked, her eyes alight. “Could it be at the bottom of the lake as well? Maybe the Forbidden Land of Ice’s absolute power of frost completely froze it?”</p>
 <p>The moment she said this, everyone’s eyes burned with excitement. They all inwardly rejoiced, realizing they had finally reached their destination: the heart of the Graveyard of Gods.</p>
 <p>“So the ice spirit is hidden deep within this frozen lake, eh?” A voice suddenly echoed from a snowy mountain peak nearby. “I guess Di Fei wasted his efforts on the wrong area.”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie’s group looked in the direction the voice came from.</p>
 <p>A person could be seen atop a mountain peak to their left.</p>
 <p>Noticing their gazes, that person grinned and said, “How long has it been since we last saw each other, Senior Sister Xue?”</p>
 <p>“Jiang Tianxing!” Xue Moyan’s beautiful face suddenly went cold.</p>
 <p>“Hu!” Qin Lie exclaimed softly.</p>
 <p>“Oh, it’s that guy!” Song Tingyu burst into laughter.</p>
 <p>Jiang Tianxing’s gaze swept over Xue Moyan to land on Song Tingyu.</p>
 <p>“You bitch!” he yelled. “Where’s that kid that was with you back then?”</p>
 <p>“Are you talking about me?” Qin Lie said with a grin.</p>
 <p>“You?” Jiang Tianxing’s eyes abruptly became a frightening crimson.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie smiled, took out the fox skin mask, and put it on. He took a moment to adjust it and give himself a new face, then said, “Now do you recognize me?”</p>
 <p>“So it was you… Qin Lie!!” Jiang Tianxing cried.</p>
 <p>Half a year ago, Jiang Tianxing led a group of martial practitioners who cultivated the Blood Spirit Art to fight the god corpse in the sea near Sea Moon Island and obtain the Demon Sealing Tombstone inside of its navel.</p>
 <p>In the end, Qin Lie appeared out of nowhere and took the Demon Sealing Tombstone, ruining the plan that Jiang Tianxing had put so much effort into.</p>
 <p>He and Celestial Artifact Sect’s Elder Bi You then searched everywhere for Qin Lie and Song Tingyu, hoping to find them and seize the tombstone for themselves.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, they never did.</p>
 <p>No one knew more about the miracles of the Demon Sealing Tombstone than Jiang Tianxing.</p>
 <p>And no one needed it more than he did.</p>
 <p>As a matter of fact, everything the nine great Silver rank forces knew about the Graveyard of Gods, as well as the first headless god corpse that had appeared at the bottom of the sea, had been revealed by Jiang Tianxing and his father, Jiang Zhuzhe!</p>
 <p>Taking out a horn, his eyes overflowing with anger, Jiang Tianxing blew a long, low note that echoed through the mountains.</p>
 <p>“Bwooowooowooooooooo!”</p>
 <p>Jiang Tianxing then put the horn away.</p>
 <p>“I’ve signaled Di Fei. He and his scarlet barbarians will be here shortly.”</p>
 <p>He laughed coldly. “I wonder how you’ll escape this time.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
