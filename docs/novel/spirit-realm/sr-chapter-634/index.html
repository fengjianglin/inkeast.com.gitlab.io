 <p><b>Chapter 634: Hatred</b></p>
 <p><span style>Blue Moon Valley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A copper three-footed cauldron was filled with medicinal fluid made from thirty six kinds of herbs. Miao Tai’s emaciated body was soaking in the medicinal fluid. As the thick medicinal power permeated his blood and flesh, he slowly recovered from his wounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were six Miao Family clansmen around the enormous cauldron that occasionally added new herbs and served with all of their care.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You always do not listen.” Miao Meiyu watched for a while before sighing lightly. “That Qin Lie is a direct disciple of Blood Fiend Sect, and seems to have some connection to Forefather Terminator. You clearly were not a match for him, why be stubborn? Why fight against his soul?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the cauldron, Miao Tai’s expression was dark. “I don’t care who he is! Since he dares to oppose Blue Moon Valley, I will kill him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“With your talent, you definitely be a core member of Illusory Demon Sect in the future. There is no reason to argue with someone like Qin Lie. Black Voodoo Cult, the three families, there are many people that find him an eyesore. Naturally, there will be people that will deal with him, there is no need for you to waste effort,” Miao Meiyu urged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blood Fiend Sect! It’s all Blood Fiend Sect!” Miao Tai’s expression turned vicious. “In the past, it was Blood Fiend Sect that suppressed the Miao Family on Heavenly Calamity Continent so that the Miao Family did not successfully become a Silver force! A thousand years ago, the Miao Family finally has an opportunity to become a Silver force after generations of hard work, and Blood Fiend Sect comes out again! If Blood Fiend Sect does not die, the humiliation of our Miao Family will never be washed away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not for you to worry if Blood Fiend Sect will die or not. Stay and recover from your wounds.” Miao Meiyu looked deeply at him and then turned to leave with an inward sigh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the enormous cauldron, Miao Tai occasionally gave off howls as the flesh that was permeated by the medicinal fluid was in fiery piercing pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A long time later, when Miao Tai calmed down again, his eyes flashed with hate as he said, “Other people do not know where Blood Fiend Sect is, but I know where you have hidden for a thousand years!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a disciple of Illusory Demon Sect, he had eavesdropped on the elders and learned the hiding place of Blood Fiend Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get Jiang Yan, that slut, here!” Miao Tai suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three Miao Family members hesitated before reluctantly leaving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, the three manhandled a young matron with loose hair in front of the enormous cauldron.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young matron’s face was covered in dirt, her clothing in disarray, her eyes dim. She had clearly gone through inhuman torture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly refocusing and seeing Miao Tai soaking in the enormous cauldron, she immediately gave a pleased laugh. “Hahaha! Miao Tai, so even you have such a today! A demon like you should forever stay in the medicine cauldron and never be let out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Yan had been captured by Miao Tai who was returning from Illusory Demon Sect to Blue Moon Valley when fleeing after the Heavenly Sea Pavilion Master Jiang Hao, her father, had failed in invading Gold Sun Island and were killed by the Xing Brothers and the eight god corpses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miao Tai had easily capture Jiang Yan and repeated humiliated her for many days. He turned the past daughter of the Heavenly Sea Pavilion Master into his private toy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whore! Your Heavenly Sea Pavilion is completely gone, Xiang Xi and Blood Fiend Sect robbed Heavenly Sea Pavilion clean. Nothing was left for your Jiang Family. Your younger brother was captured by the Miao Family when he was fleeing. If you want your brother to survive, do something for me!” Miao Tai smiled coldly. “There is only one little seedling left of your Jiang Family males. If you want him to live, be obedient!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Demon! You demon!” Jiang Yan screamed. “Let my brother go! I beg you, let my brother go! You can anything to me! Please release him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Give the transmission stone we found from Heavenly Sea Pavilion to her. A transmission stone of such level is definitely what Heavenly Sea Pavilion used to communicate with the envoy of Black Voodoo Cult. This whore has been recording and passing on information for Jiang Hao before. She definitely knows how to get into contact with Guan Xian.” Miao Tai ordered and then looked at Jiang Yan. He snarled and said, “You definitely want Blood Fiend Sect to pay? Haha, then tell a few things for me to Guan Xiang. Tell him that Blood Fiend Sect is before the Land of Buried Gods, he definitely knows what to do! Remember, you said everything, it has nothing to do with me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You swear to release my brother!” Jiang Yan gritted out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I swear.” Miao Tai snorted coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, under Miao Tai’s gaze, Jiang Yan picked up the transmission stone and passed the message according to Miao Tai’s request.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she finished doing all this, Miao Tai started to roar with laughter and an expression of pleasure. He waved his hand and ordered, “Take her away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What to do?” a member of the Miao Family asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Send her down to see her brother!” Miao Tai snorted coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miao Tai! You lied to me! You will not have a good death! Even as a ghost, I will not release you!” Jiang Yan screamed as she was dragged out by three members of the Miao Family be her hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The enormous ship moved in the deep ocean.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guan Xian was talking to Xiahou Zhi and the two others. He ordered them to take a part of the group and detour to Gold Sun Island to kill all the martial practitioners left on Gold Sun Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, a martial practitioner under his service hurriedly came and said a few words by his ear in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guan Xiang listened silently. After savoring it, he said, “I just received news that the specific location that Blood Fiend Sect has been hiding these thousand years has been confirmed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The leaders of the three families became alert.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this thousand years, Black Voodoo Cult and the three families had never given up their pursuit of Blood Fiend Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had locked onto a mountain range ten thousand miles in diameter after searching for so many years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they had never found which mountain valley Blood Fiend Sect was hiding in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop the ship temporarily. After Xue Li and the Blood Fiend Ten Elders come out, there shouldn’t be anyone strong left at the hiding place of Blood Fiend Sect.” Guan Xiang caressed his beard and smiled darkly. “Black Voodoo Cult and you three groups will each send a Nirvana Realm martial practitioner and first take care of the rear before we step onto Setting Sun Islands.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When we enter Setting Sun Islands, we can give Blood Fiend Sect members something interesting to see for them to enjoy before death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiahou Zhi and the others laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, the invaders that had been able to reach Setting Sun Islands on time suddenly stopped. Several flight spirit artifacts secretly left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Setting Sun Islands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie and the martial practitioners of Blood Fiend Sect and Gold Sun Island gathered on the three closest islands, waiting for Black Voodoo Cult and the three families to arrive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Days passed, and the invaders of Black Voodoo Cult and the three families did not show themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is not right. From our information, Blood Voodoo Cult and the three families should have come yesterday.” Xing Yuyuan’s brow was furrowed deeply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone had dark expressions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two other days passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>None of the ships from Black Voodoo Cult and the three families that should have come long ago showed. Blood Fiend Sect and Gold Sun Island martial practitioners that had been waiting all this time did not relax and their hearts grew heavier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This feeling of knowing the enemy was going to come but not knowing when they would appear was depressing for many people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On this day, Mo Jun of the Blood Fiend Ten Elders suddenly said, “Three days, Little Bei has not sent a message. In the past, he would send a message from the valley every two days, this is slightly unusual.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His son Mo Bei had not come this time. He had stayed back at Blood Fiend Sect’s hiding place and would send a message every two days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that mountain valley that Blood Fiend Sect hid in, there were many women, and weak people that could not fight. The descendants of the Blood Fiend Ten Elders that did not have any martial talent were among them, and many of the disciples that had been pursued by Black Voodoo Cult and the three families who had lost their ability after being heavily injured and could only exist as mortals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason that those people had not come along was because they did not have any offensive power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That mountain valley is only known by the members of Blood Fiend Sect and some elders of Illusory Demon Sect, theoretically, it should not have leaked,” Hong Bowen said as he shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If there were no accidents, Little Bei would not have not passed any messages for three days. He is not a person like that.” Mo Jun’s expression grew worse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the martial practitioners of Blood Fiend Sect felt their hearts in the air when they heard this and had a feeling that something was majorly wrong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother, while we have moved here, Gold Sun Island… we still have some clansmen there.” Xing Yuyuan exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Yumia’s expression darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait, just wait two more days,” Xue Li forced out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie, Mo Hai, Song Tingyu and the others stood together, Their expressions were grave as they listened to the conversation between Blood Fiend Sect and Gold Sun Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As observers, through the words of Mo Ju and Xing Yuyuan, they guessed that the mountain valley that had lost contact and Gold Sun Island were most likely met with misfortune.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“At Heavenly Sword Mountain, I heard someone talk about how Black Voodoo Cult raised voodoo insects. I heard… infant voodoo insects feed on the organs of living people.” Mo Hai sighed. “Those people were from factions that were enemies of Black Voodoo Cult, they would be imprisoned in the Bog of Myriad Poisons after being captured alive. The terror and pain felt by these people before death is even more terrifying and horrific than the martial practitioners that Jiang Zhuzhe drank the blood off. If Jiang Zhuzhe of Blood Fiend Sect is said to be an unorthodox demon, than the method Black Voodoo Cult uses to raise voodoo insects is even more inhuman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When I had the voodoo poison, everyday, my soul and vitality slipped away. I could clearly feel the arrival of death. That kind of terror… even thinking of it now, I will tremble and feel unsafe,” Song Tingyu said softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re slightly better off. I once thought that I would be corroded by the voodoo poison to death,” Xie Jingxuan said calmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie looked deeply at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the Graveyard of Gods, the two had been afflicted with the voodoo poison, Xie Jingxuan getting it slightly earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even he had thought for a time that Xie Jingxuan had been dead from the poison and he would never see Xie Jingxuan again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Jingxuan had managed to survive with the corrupted Spring of Life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that time, under the torment of the voodoo insect, Qin Lie could not imagine the pain she experienced at her vitality and soul power being consumed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The reason that Sister Tingyu and I chose to stay behind is that we hope to kill more disciples of Black Voodoo Cult. With every person I kill, the pain that I once experienced will lessen by a thread,” Xie Jingxuan said coolly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From her calm tone, everyone could feel bone-deep hatred.</span></p>
