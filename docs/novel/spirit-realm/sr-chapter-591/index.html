 <p><b>Chapter 591: You Are My Big Sister</b></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if I die, I’ll come back and haunt you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Restrained by chains of lightning, Xing Yao gritted her teeth and stared at Qin Lie with unbridled hatred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sight of Qin Lie actually daring to capture Xing Yao made Guo Yanzheng and Qi Jing go blind with rage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, neither enforcer cared whether Blood Fiend Sect or Forefather Terminator stood behind Qin Lie. They were going to kill him then and there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zheng Yun laughed loudly. “You have a truly amazing temper, brother. I really am impressed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Following his earlier order to kill Guo Yanzheng and Qi Jing, the Black Cloud Palace martial practitioners behind Zheng Yun immediately rushed forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two martial practitioners instantly intercepted the two enforcers, both pairs possessing similar levels of strength. The rest of the Black Cloud Palace martial practitioners attacked the other Xing Family clansmen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Yao couldn’t move an inch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All she could do was watch the enemy overwhelm the clansmen and elders that cared for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It looked as if her eyes were about to spit fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You never thought you’d experience a day like this, did you, Miss Xing?” Qin Lie said in a mocking tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The battle had progressed to the point where the Xing Yumiao and Xing Yuyuan flew through the sky, drenched with blood. Countless crystalline war chariots bombarded the martial practitioners aboard their Flowing Gold Fire Phoenix. Black Cloud Palace martial practitioners had surrounded the Wavebreaker, and Heavenly Sea Pavilion martial practitioners had surrounded the other ship that the Xing Family still controlled. Aboard those ships, every person on the Xing Family’s side died one after another.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Explosions and screams continuously echoed throughout this territory that belonged to Gold Sun Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Truth be told, Gold Sun Island wasn’t weaker than Black Cloud Palace or Heavenly Sea Pavilion. Xing Yumiao was just as powerful as Zheng Zhihe or Jiang Hao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, Xiang Xi’s rebellion weakened Gold Sun Island considerably. Both Xing Yumiao and Xing Yuyuan were forced to face an encirclement of Fragmentation Realm experts, including Zheng Zhihe and Jiang Hao who were both at the peak of the Fragmentation Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In addition to that, Xiahou Sheng hovered off to the side of that encirclement, watching the Xing brothers like a hawk. He was ready to join the fray at any moment to prevent them from escaping.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nearly thirty other Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion martial practitioners in the Fulfillment Realm were positioned nearby. They wielded conch-shaped spirit artifacts that disturbed the spirit energy in the area each time they blew them. The chaotic spatial fluctuations they caused prevented the Xing brothers from using an escape art.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gold Sun Island had suffered an internal schism. Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion had sent out all of their experts, and Xiahou Family martial practitioners had blended into their ranks as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regardless of how anyone looked at this situation… this time, the Xing Family had no way to escape death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zheng Yun, having nothing else to do, couldn’t help but speak to Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother!” he said with a smile. “About that girl… could you pass her to me once you’ve finished playing with her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll haunt you after I die!” Xing Yao shrieked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why don’t you commit suicide then?” Qin Lie asked, an indifferent expression on his face. “I’ve restrained your body and paralyzed your meridians to keep your from gathering spirit energy, but you can still talk. This means that you can still move your mouth. You can bite off your tongue and kill yourself whenever you want.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“B-brother!” Zheng Yun hastily exclaimed, his voice filled with anxiety. “Quickly! Paralyze her tongue! It’ll be boring if she actually kills herself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How I want to toy with her is my choice. You don’t have the right to tell me what to do!” Qin Lie’s face darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zheng Yun laughed awkwardly in response. “Haha… my mistake. Me and my big mouth…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Qin Lie openly scolded him, Zheng Yun didn’t dare to lose his calm. He was wary of Qin Lie’s identity, so he simply fell silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can bite your tongue off and kill yourself!” Qin Lie continued coldly, turning his attention back to Xing Yao. “I guarantee that I won’t stop you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, the harsh look in Xing Yao’s eyes slowly faded. She seemed as if she had lost every ounce of strength within her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In spite of how she kept yelling about haunting Qin Lie after dying, a strange expression leaped to her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… I can’t believe I don’t even have the courage to commit suicide…” she mumbled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only then that she realized how terrified of death she was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t want to die. She didn’t have the courage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment she realized this, she even lost the courage to taunt her enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dazed expression came over her as she muttered to herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m afraid,” she said. “I’m so afraid of losing everything…””</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re just a pretty flower that’s always been under your father’s protection.” Qin Lie shook his head disdainfully as he coldly ridiculed her. “You’ve never experienced true hardship. Of course you wouldn’t have the resolve to face death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Yao didn’t say anything in response. She knew he was right. She didn’t have the courage to do anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Splash!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that exact moment, a figure as large as a bear burst out of the sea and flew into the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It instantly crashed onto the deck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hope shone in Xing Yao’s eyes once more when she realized who it was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aunt!” she screamed at the top of her lungs. “Help me! Kill this imposter! This spy! Kill him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gaze of everyone on the ship fell upon Xing Shengnan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eyes of the three Fulfillment Realm elders standing behind Zheng Yun widened, and they immediately took out their spirit artifacts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe… don’t worry.” Zheng Yun smiled calmly. “She can’t do anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three elders examined Xing Shengnan closely. They soon relaxed and chuckled as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Shengnan held two giant axes, one in each hand. Blood streamed from the wounds covering her arms and flowed down to her axes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bleeding wounds also marred the rest of her large body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The vigor in her small eyes had already faded. Her eyes now looked dim and lifeless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Splash!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another figure emerged from the sea and arrived on the deck of the ship as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This person wore clothing unique to the Xiahou Family. He appeared to be about fifty years old and wore a savage expression on his face. He held a cold, glittering sword that was drenched with blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>—All of that blood belonged to Xing Shengnan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This person was Xiahou Chang, Xiahou Sheng’s younger brother and a martial practitioner in the early stage of the Fragmentation Realm like Xing Shengnan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Xiahou Sheng injured Xing Shengnan and forced her into the sea, Xiahou Chang ambushed her and succeeded in wounding her too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Shengnan first emerged from the sea because this man had relentlessly pursued her underwater. She had no choice but to return to the surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when she did, she encountered the combined assault of Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion, forcing her to dive back into the sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After being forced back underwater, she suffered yet another grievous blow from Xiahou Chang. This blow worsened her condition even further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only now did she find an opportunity to rush out of the sea and back onto the deck of the Wavebreaker. She was covered in blood, having spent most of her spirit energy as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet Xiahou Chang had caught up to her once more. His cold, dark gaze had never left Xing Shengnan. He had been searching for the perfect opportunity to kill her all this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Shengnan was bleeding all over, and the giant axes that she normally thought of as light now seemed as heavy as mountains. Her large body trembled continuously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyone could see that she was in extremely terrible condition. Since she could hardly survive Xiahou Chang’s relentless pursuit, helping Xing Yao overcome her current situation and killing every enemy here was obviously impossible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every enemy present simply found Xing Yao’s hope-filled eyes and shouts amusing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big sister…” Qin Lie suddenly exclaimed softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hint of bewilderment flashed through Xing Shengnan’s eyes. She immediately shook out of her stupor and locked eyes with Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am not your big sister!” she shouted, her voice filled with pain and sorrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aunt!” Xing Yao cried, beginning to sob. She lost her composure once more when she realized how much Xing Shengnan had been hurt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s true that I am not a member of the Xing Family. It is also true that I came to Gold Sun Island with ulterior motives,” Qin Lie said with utmost sincerity. “However, I really do consider you my big sister!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A short distance away, Guo Yanzheng was about to be forced into a corner, but he still couldn’t help but look at Qin Lie in confusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s declaration also puzzled Black Cloud Palace’s Zheng Yun, who frowned and watched him closely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not unlucky enough to have a little brother like you!” Xing Shengnan exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How dare you pretend to be kind at this moment!” Xing Yao screamed. “There’s no way someone like you will die a good death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Zheng Yun, I have something I need to tell you privately.” Qin Lie smiled and gestured for Zheng Yun to move closer to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a moment of hesitation, Zheng Yun walked toward Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” he asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this point in time, Black Cloud Palace had rounded up every Xing Family clansman and martial practitioner loyal to the Xing Family on the ship and forced them into retreat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only person still standing nearby was Xing Shengnan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiahou Chang watched her closely. If she made any strange movements, he’d immediately unleash a storm of attacks at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zheng Yun calmly approached Qin Lie until he was two meters away from him. He wasn’t afraid of anything happening to him because he was at the peak of the Netherpassage Realm. After a moment of hesitation, he came to a halt and chuckled. “So, what do you want to say to me, brother?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take Xing Yao with you,” Qin Lie said with a smile. “I’ve lost interest in her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His words startled Zheng Yun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A twinkle suddenly appeared in his eyes, but after staring at Qin Lie for a few seconds, he shook his head and laughed dryly. He laughed as he began backing away from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Forget it,” he said. “A gentleman doesn’t take what isn’t theirs. I told you I would give her to you, and I won’t break that promise.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zheng Yun couldn’t help but feel that something was off. He didn’t dare to accept Qin Lie’s offer and risk upsetting him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He believed that Qin Lie was a direct disciple of Forefather Terminator. After all, he had Terminator Profound Bombs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In addition to that, even under these circumstances, Qin Lie actually claimed that Xing Shengnan was his big sister. This worried Zheng Yun, and he instinctively avoided taking any risks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was well aware of how exceedingly arrogant Terminator Sect martial practitioners were. He knew that they wouldn’t give something up without good reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he was just the young palace master of a Copper rank force, he was especially aware of this. He knew that he didn’t merit such modesty from someone of Qin Lie’s status.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see that Brother Zheng is quite a cautious man.” Qin Lie broke out into involuntary laughter. Then he shook his head and said, “Unfortunately for you... you’re still standing too close to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Qin Lie said this, Zheng Yun’s face twisted in alarm. He instantly began to openly retreat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet three metallic lightning balls spun through the air, brimming with thunder and lightning energy as the moved even faster. They instantly appeared five meters in front of Zheng Yun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Multiple thunderous violent explosions erupted at the same time. Electricity sparked through the air and mingled with the pungent stench of sulfur.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zheng Yun had been dozens of meters away from Qin Lie. The power of thunder enveloped him like a tidal wave and sent him flying backward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Roaring thunder overwhelmed the sound his Zheng Yun’s cracking bones. Only he could hear them shatter. He felt an uncontrollable stream of blood gush from his mouth like a long bloody snake. It continued to grow longer and longer as he flew backward, making the entire spectacle seem strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young palace master!” “Young palace master!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three Fulfillment Realm elders of Black Cloud Palace went ghastly pale as they rushed to catch Zheng Yun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This turn of events absolutely confounded Xiahou Chang, but he didn’t take his eyes off of Xing Shengnan or do anything to help Zheng Yun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He assumed that Qin Lie held a grudge against Zheng Yun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiahou Sheng had told Xiahou Chang that Forefather Terminator was Qin Lie’s backer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zheng Yun, on the other hand, was just the young palace master of a small Copper rank force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After comparing the two, Xiahou Chang chose to ignore Zheng Yun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
