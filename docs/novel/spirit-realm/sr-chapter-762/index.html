 <p><b>Chapter 762: Ambushed &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie ignored all external distractions and completely focused on recovering himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The effects of the Soul Cloud Saint Spirit Pill was extremely strong. After the pill had melted in his stomach, a stream of rich, refined soul energy scattered into millions of tiny tendrils that entered his mind through his blood vessels.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soul energy gathered in his Soul Lake upon entering his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Soul Lake that had shrunk one third of its original size were regrowing at a visible rate thanks to the injection of millions of soul tendrils.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The feeling where his soul energy was so full it was about to overflow slowly surfaced to his mind. It soothed his True Soul, and the process felt like his soul and mind were being washed by a fountain of ambrosia. Even his Soul Lake felt incredibly cleaned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It felt as if his True Soul was being sublimed to a higher level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was another rich stream of spirit energy that spread down to his stomach and surged into his dantian’s spirit sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The wisps of milky white spirit clouds condensed inside his dantian’s spirit sea and replenished his depleted spirit energy swiftly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only could the Soul Cloud Saint Spirit Pill recover one’s soul energy swiftly, it could fill up one’s spirit sea with spirit energy too. It was a pill that regenerated both soul energy and spirit energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“At his current realm, it would appear that a Soul Cloud Saint Spirit Pill is more than enough to restore him to full.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not far away, Celestial Artifact Sect’s Bi You narrowed his eyes slightly with an odd expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was the one who gifted the Soul Cloud Saint Spirit Pill to Qin Lie, so he knew better than anyone just how precious the pill was. It was also how he knew with one hundred percent certainty that a single Soul Cloud Saint Spirit Pill was enough to restore Qin Lie’s soul energy and spirit energy to full.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This also meant that Qin Lie didn’t need more pills to restore his soul energy or spirit energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He refused to believe that Shen Yue wasn’t privy to the value of a Soul Cloud Saint Spirit Pill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his opinion, Shen Yue’s act to request pills from other martial practitioners was overstepping the line a little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is enough for now, of course,” Shen Yue smiled, “However… this war against the outsider race may last for a very long time. It may end in just ten days’ time, but it may also drag out for a whole year. Qin Lie is capable of dealing the outsiders a destructive blow, so the outsiders will suffer as long as he remains energetic and lively. That’s why there’s no harm in hoarding as many pills as possible ahead of time. They will all be used eventually.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bi You thought that Shen Yue’s words made sense after thinking for a moment. Therefore, he stopped questioning further into her actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The martial practitioners continued to advance towards the center of Prism Continent while protecting Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fifteen minutes later, while the group was passing by Moonstone City, Qin Lie abruptly cut his recovery short and opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dozens of fierce blazes and innumerable unknown divine characters sprung out from inside his pupils.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?” Shen Yue was the closest to Qin Lie, so she was the first one to notice his strange reaction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Over there!” Qin Lie pointed at a stone tower at the southeastern corner of Moonstone City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Follow me!” Bi You charged towards it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another Nirvana Realm martial practitioner who was followed closely by two Fragmentation Realm martial practitioners charged towards that direction as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Burn!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie pressed his tongue against the upper part of his mouth and verbalized an unknown divine character in a strange note.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blood inside his body boiled as the blaze divine character glowed with extraordinary strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The divine characters inside his blood swam in an unfathomable, worldly pattern as if they were planets orbiting within a sea of stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the wondrous interconnection that existed within the power of bloodlines.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uuah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The painful cry and the burning figure of an evil ghoul appeared from under the stone tower Bi You was charging to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an Earth Ghoul clansman who was currently engulfed in flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strangeness occurred in Moonstone City once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The grand stone palaces of the ruined Moonstone City instantly shattered into smithereens.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Giant rocks and stone pillars were turned into deadly projectiles and shot towards their direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ground fissured and revealed many dark cracks as the Earth Ghoul clansmen hiding deep underground burst into the open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gravity around the area abruptly increased by hundreds of times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crystalline war chariots, the Fragmentation Realm martial practitioners flying in the sky, the spirit birds and the giant carriages abruptly plummeted towards the ground because they were unable to adapt to the sudden increase of gravity immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The explosions of flying spirit artifacts illuminated the whole area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Plenty of Netherpassage Realm martial practitioners or martial practitioners who weren’t protected by spirit artifacts who were attacked by frenzied groups of Earth Ghoul clansmen the moment they plummeted to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dozens of unrecognizable human corpses instantly appeared on the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hundreds of Earth Ghoul clansmen swarmed these corpses in an instant, tearing and devouring them like wild animals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh whoosh whoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Brown yellow colored storms mixed with stone fragments, wood, the carcasses of spirit beasts and blood suddenly appeared from every part of Moonstone City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heaven Ghoul clansmen were unleashing their spatial power and drawing many spatial blades amidst the storm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blue Ghoul clansmen were clutching chain bracelets, necklaces, and bone staffs made of animal bones and dancing madly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gray colored evil energy gathered from every direction and tore at the humans like meat grinders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In an instant, dozens or so humans were enveloped by the terrible power of those storms, cut into pieces by the spatial blades, or penetrated by the evil energy again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even more Earth Ghoul clansmen burst out from underground and charged towards them suicidally while still chewing on human flesh and bones, looking like real ghouls that had emerged from the abyss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The human martial practitioners fell into panicked disorder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This place’s gravity field was altered by the enemy!” Qin Lie turned pale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t use the eight Thunderblitz Trees because the gravity of this place had been increased several hundred times than normal. This also meant that he couldn’t inscribe another spirit diagram and reactivate the destructive Profound Thunder Heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even worse was that the Golden Winged Luan he and Shen Yue was on was also falling heavily towards the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Innumerable amount of Heaven Ghoul, Earth Ghoul, and Blue Ghoul clansmen were waiting beneath them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countless pairs of dark, violent and evil eyes were staring at him closely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was obvious that the anomaly in Moonstone City was a devious trap specifically prepared by the foreign for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Earth Ghoul clansmen’s alterations to gravity so that it was hundreds of times stronger than normal made it impossible for him to use the eight Thunderblitz Trees.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Blue Ghoul clansmen who were good at hiding slipped deep underground with the Earth Ghoul clansmen aid and avoided the human martial practitioners’ soul scan through a secret art. After the human martial practitioners had come to them, they emerged without warning and ambushed their enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They instantly turned the situation on its head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In just a short time, almost a hundred human martial practitioners were caught off guard and killed. After their corpses had fallen to the ground, they were torn and devoured by the outsiders, leaving not a single corpse behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scene was incredibly bloody and violent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many of the young human martial practitioners had never experienced a fight like this. When they saw that the companions and senior brothers and sisters that they were just talking to a moment ago turning into fleshy bits inside the outsiders’ mouth, when they saw the way blood splattered from the outsiders’ mouth with every chewing motion, they almost broke down there and then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crumbling of their minds caused their combat strength to fall far below normal. Since they weren’t able to pay attention to the battle, they naturally weren’t able to unleash their full strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The human race’s morale was currently low.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eat this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the Golden Winged Luan was falling swiftly towards the ground, Qin Lie’s spatial ring sparkled as several Blaze Profound Bombs winked into existence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With him as the center, the scarlet metal balls flew towards the places where the outsiders were densely packed like fire beams.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Explode!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In an instant, terrific explosions appeared from the spots where the outsiders were entrenched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thunder erupted while lightning swam like living dragons. Wildfire instantly engulfed Moonstone City in a sea of flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blaze Profound Bombs might could be amplified. When two Blaze Profound Bombs were to clash against one another, their destructive strength could be multiplied by several folds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The impact caused by the simultaneous explosions of multiple Blaze Profound Bombs instantly caused a group of dozens or so Earth Ghoul clansmen to scatter into bloody rains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Terminator Profound Bombs!” Shen Yue reacted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The martial practitioners of Terminator Sect looked incredibly invigorated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They began throwing silver metallic balls too towards the outsiders and into the storms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a time, every corner of Moonstone City resounded with devastating booms of destruction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Blaze Profound Bombs and Terminator Profound Bombs were incredible weapons that could turn a battle on its head and deal unbelievable amounts of damage to the enemy in a short time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three great ghoul races’ clansmen had obviously failed to react in time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many of them were crushed and killed in the explosions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Using the opening created by the bombs, a dozen or so Nirvana Realm martial practitioners who were well versed in the power of gravity combined their strength and unleashed them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crack crack crack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The exterior of Moonstone City rippled like a tidal wave or a carpet flapping to the wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many palaces crumbled and was destroyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The powerful gravity fields deep beneath the fissured ground and the geocentric formations the Earth Ghoul clansmen had set up there became ineffective as the ground rippled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gravity field that made everything several hundred times heavier than normal was gradually fading.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Retreat for now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A tiny Earth Ghoul clansman howled eerily when they saw that the situation had taken a turn for the worse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many dark underground holes magically appeared under the effects of the Earth Ghoul Race’s energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many Blue Ghoul and Heaven Ghoul clansmen plunged head first into those dark holes and instantly disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many Earth Ghoul clansmen were able to merge into the ground like fish in water the second they set foot on the ground surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To them, the dark and lightless underground was almost like home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were capable of moving freely underground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was their unique racial talent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The human martial practitioners who just turned the tides a little and was about to counter attack the outsiders suddenly discovered that their figures and auras had all disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By now Moonstone City was riddled in holes and completely ruined. Pools of blood could be found everywhere, but not one of the deceased could be found at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both the humans and outsider races who had died in the battle were taken away by the Earth Ghoul clansmen into the underground. They would bury their clansmen, but the humans… they would eat them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gravity field of this place suddenly turned back to normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They already left,” a Celestial Artifact Sect martial practitioner who reached the late stage of Nirvana Realm sighed helplessly while staring at the ground with a dark expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Illusory Demon Sect’s Shi Xiuling was frowning deeply before she stared at Qin Lie, “That burning outsider was bait!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone came to realization when they heard this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie could detect some special outsiders and burn them to death through a secret art that they had no understanding of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The outsiders also knew this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was why they had set up a trap, altered the gravity and left behind a special outsider to bait them into this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, the group had noticed that outsider’s existence from the anomaly in his bloodline and exposed him while they were passing through this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This caused them to pause above Moonstone City, and Bi You charging out on his own accord to hunt down that outsider.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, they were ambushed by the enemy and forced to pay a terrible price. More than a hundred human martial practitioners died without a body to show.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is largely responsible for the damage we suffer!” Shi Xiuling accused Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fifty of the people who died horribly in this battle were her disciples and subordinates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was because the Illusory Demon Sect had a lot of female martial practitioners, and these foreign races found the flesh of young human females tastier than human males.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was why they spent more energy on taking down Illusory Demon Sect martial practitioners when they ambushed them earlier, causing them to suffer the heaviest casualties.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shi Xiuling didn’t know this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She assumed that Qin Lie harbored malicious intentions and purposely caused the deaths of many Illusory Demon Sect’s disciples.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she could offer no reason, evidence or method to support her theory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was what she thought all the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Otherwise, why on earth was the number of casualties they suffered half of the total number of people who died out of all five great Silver rank forces?</span></p>
