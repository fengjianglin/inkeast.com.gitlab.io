 <p><strong>Chapter 493: So What?</strong></p>
 <p>“Yes, that was me.”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie openly admitted it. Black Voodoo Cult’s Huang Zhuli had disguised herself as Xue Moyan with Illusory Demon Sect’s illusory arts and discovered that he cultivated the Blood Spirit Art.</p>
 <p>This meant that, in all likelihood, Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families were already aware of that very same fact.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie couldn’t hide it even if he wanted to. Since that was the case, there was no point in hiding it any longer.</p>
 <p>When Huang Zhuli arrived, she would definitely reveal the fact that he and Xue Moyan cultivated the Blood Spirit Art. She would use it to create an opportunity to attack them.</p>
 <p>There was no harm in revealing this beforehand.</p>
 <p>“H-how do you know the Blood Spirit Art?” Xue Moyan asked, pleasantly surprised.</p>
 <p>Xue Moyan was the daughter of Xue Li and Mo Lingye and the successor of Blood Fiend Sect’s pure bloodline. She had always been cultivating the Blood Spirit Art in secret.</p>
 <p>She felt close to anyone who cultivated the standard Blood Spirit Art, subconsciously thinking of them as one of her own.</p>
 <p>“Your father taught me!” Qin Lie exclaimed.</p>
 <p>As soon as he said this, the light of Xue Moyan’s eyes suddenly froze. It was almost like she had been struck by lightning.</p>
 <p>The revelation had her frozen for twelve full seconds. Then, she burst to life, excitedly grabbing Qin Lie by the shoulders. “My father taught you? H-he’s still alive?”</p>
 <p>“Barring any unforeseen circumstances, he should have arrived at the Heavenly Slaughter Continent and found your mother.” Qin Lie sighed softly, then explained, “Senior Xue Li isn’t in good condition. Jiang Zhuzhe sealed him into the spirit pattern pillars of Celestial Artifact Sect where he was imprisoned for more than a thousand years. After being freed, he was ambushed by Jiang Zhuzhe once more, resulting in his body and soul being refined. He managed to survive with half his soul, but…”</p>
 <p>Tears welled in Xue Moyan’s eyes.</p>
 <p>Her soul was withering, and her mother’s life force was nearing its end. She didn’t think that her father’s condition would be just as miserable.</p>
 <p>This realization flooded her heart with sadness.</p>
 <p>Pan Qianqian spoke to her in a soft voice, attempting to comfort her. “Sister Xue, your father is still alive. As long as that doesn’t change, there’s still hope.”</p>
 <p>“You cultivate the Blood Spirit Art?” Du Xiangyang asked in surprise.</p>
 <p>Luo Chen was frowning slightly.</p>
 <p>“So what?” Qin Lie asked with a composed expression. “Do you have a problem with that because the people who cultivate the Blood Spirit Art in the Land of Chaos are treated as public enemies and attacked en masse?”</p>
 <p>“It isn’t actually that serious.” Du Xiangyang shrugged. “The only ones who relentlessly hunt Blood Fiend Sect martial practitioners, refusing to let up, are people of the three great families. Black Voodoo Cult controls them from behind the scenes, rewarding their zealous behavior. We of Heavenly Sword Mountain, as well as people from Celestial Artifact Sect, Ten Thousand Beast Mountain, Terminator Sect, and Illusory Demon Sect aren’t really prejudiced against martial practitioners who cultivate the Blood Spirit Art. Those who consume human blood to cultivate are a different story, of course.”</p>
 <p>“The Land of Chaos entered a state of emergency back then because too many people cultivated by sucking the blood of others,” Luo Chen interrupted in an icy voice. “Black Voodoo Cult called upon the other forces to surround and eliminate Blood Fiend Sect. After everything was said and done, they worked with the three great families and continued to hunt Blood Fiend Sect down. The other forces did not pursue the matter any further.”</p>
 <p>“You don’t need to worry too much.” In spite of Luo Chen’s input, Du Xiangyang still looked relaxed. “Celestial Artifact Sect, Ten Thousand Beast Mountain, Terminator Sect, Illusory Demon Sect, and Heavenly Sword Mountain don’t actually harbor much animosity toward Blood Fiend Sect. They only cooperated with Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families to save face and eliminate those who went too far and sucked human blood to cultivate. If Blood Fiend Sect can properly purge such individuals, maybe they’ll one day be able to clear their name and no longer be forced to hide. They might be able to stand out in the open and face everyone proudly like they did a thousand years ago.”</p>
 <p>Xue Moyan’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p>
 <p>Du Xiangyang happened to describe what every Blood Fiend Sect martial practitioner of the Heavenly Slaughter Continent dreamed of, as well as Xue Moyan’s goal in life—clearing Blood Fiend Sect’s name!</p>
 <p>“As long as we reach the Land of Buried Gods, find the remains of the Blood Progenitor, and bring them out of the Graveyard of Gods for Senior Xue Li to possess, Senior Xue Li will become even stronger than before!” Qin Lie grinned coldly. Whether the change occurs to his realm or his strength, he will definitely be way more powerful than he is now! Once that happens, reviving Blood Fiend Sect in the Land of Chaos will no longer be a dream!”</p>
 <p>Emotions threatened to overwhelm Xue Moyan as she quietly clenched her fists, softly exclaiming, “The Blood Progenitor’s remains are in the Graveyard of Gods too?!”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie nodded. “One of my main reasons for coming to the Graveyard of Gods is to find the Blood Progenitor’s remains for Senior Xue Li.”</p>
 <p>“I-I truly don’t know how to thank you.” It suddenly occurred to Xue Moyan that Qin Lie was incredibly pleasing to the eye.</p>
 <p>“Senior Xue Li helped me quite a bit. He taught me the Blood Spirit Art I cultivate. Helping him is simply my responsibility,” Qin Lie said hastily.</p>
 <p>“I still have to thank you no matter what,” Xue Moyan declared.</p>
 <p>“I see. The two have a relationship that goes way back.” Du Xiangyang smiled. “Hah! And here I was, thinking that Qin Lie entertained certain thoughts and lusted after Miss Xue’s beauty.”</p>
 <p>“I also thought he fancied Sister Xue...” Pan Qianqian added.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie coughed in embarrassment.</p>
 <p>Du Xiangyang and Pan Qianqian’s words caught Xue Moyan off guard, making her blush. She wasn’t sure what to say.</p>
 <p>It was at this moment that Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families, the final group of people, arrived.</p>
 <p>Huang Zhuli walked in front of Ye Yihao, leading the way. Upon her abrupt arrival, she let out a soft stream of laughter. “Long time no see, Sister Xue.”</p>
 <p>Ye Yihao and the other Black Voodoo Cult martial practitioners were behind her. Even further back were the elites of the three great families.</p>
 <p>Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families seemed to have reconsolidated their forces. With more than twenty people, they were larger than any other force.</p>
 <p>They had arrived in a grandiose manner, arrogance plastered across every single one of their faces. When they looked at the thunder lagoon, they were completely confident that they would be victorious.</p>
 <p>The instant that Xue Moyan saw Huang Zhuli, her face became incomparably icy. She gritted her pearly-white teeth and coldly exclaimed, “Your demise won’t be pleasant!”</p>
 <p>“In the Graveyard of Gods, we’ll be the ones having the last laugh. No one can change that.” Huang Zhuli wore a grim, frosty expression as she calmly walked to the side of the thunder barrier nearer to Celestial Artifact Sect and Ten Thousand Beast Mountain.</p>
 <p>The moment the people of Celestial Artifact Sect and Ten Thousand Beast Mountain saw Black Voodoo Cult arrive, they looked as though they were facing a terrifying enemy.</p>
 <p>Similarly, the people of Chu Li’s group were frowning, their expressions grim.</p>
 <p>Black Voodoo Cult was like a thick black cloud floating above their heads. They forced everyone to secretly be wary of them.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie and Illusory Demon Sect’s Xue Moyan are evil remnants of Blood Fiend Sect. Both of them cultivate the Blood Spirit Art!”</p>
 <p>After a momentary pause, Huang Zhuli maneuvered as expected and immediately revealed their ties to Blood Fiend Sect. Using that detail as a foothold, she pointed their spearhead directly at Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>“They’re evil remnants of Blood Fiend Sect?” Feng Yiyou exclaimed in surprise.</p>
 <p>“Both of them cultivate the Blood Spirit Art?” Yu Men frowned.</p>
 <p>“N-no wonder Qin Lie asked us to give Xue Moyan the Spring of Life. They were working together in the first place!” Ren Peng yelled.</p>
 <p>Chu Li was just as surprised as everyone else.</p>
 <p>For a time, Huang Zhuli’s words focused everyone’s gazes onto Qin Lie and Xue Moyan.</p>
 <p>“What evidence do you have?” Xue Moyan asked calmly.</p>
 <p>“Evidence?” Huang Zhuli smiled softly. “Sister Xue, I’ve been by your side for a long time. Did you really think I wouldn’t notice the few times you secretly cultivated the Blood Spirit Art?”</p>
 <p>After a pause, she turned to Qin Lie and sweetly said, “You’re even worse! I only took on Xue Moyan’s appearance once, and you obediently told me everything. You two are evil remnants of Blood Fiend Sect. In the Graveyard of Gods, both of you are hidden dangers that should be exterminated as soon as possible!”</p>
 <p>“Everyone from Blood Fiend Sect should be exterminated as soon as possible!” Xiahou Yuan yelled.</p>
 <p>Su Yan, Lin Dongxing, and the people of the three great families were full of murderous intent. It was as if Qin Lie and Xue Moyan were their mortal enemies.</p>
 <p>All of them were well aware of how the three great families used to be vassal forces of Blood Fiend Sect. They knew that the three great families had only grown to its current state because they had stomped all over Blood Fiend Sect’s remains and sucked them dry of their blood, completely dominating the Heavenly Calamity Continent.</p>
 <p>If Blood Fiend Sect were to rise again, everything the three great families currently had would be seized from them.</p>
 <p>Blood Fiend Sect wouldn’t forgive the three great families for betraying them. Both sides would be at odds until one of them was dead!</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, Qin Lie stood up. “There’s no need to hide it. Yeah, I cultivate the Blood Spirit Art. So what?”</p>
 <p>Xue Moyan felt her blood run cold as she looked at Qin Lie in shock and confusion. His abrupt action worried her.</p>
 <p>She had spent so many years carefully concealing her identity, worried about being exposed and bringing a calamity down upon herself, her mother, and her uncles at Illusory Demon Sect.</p>
 <p>In reality, her life was incredibly exhausting. She had to hide and find a quiet place just to cultivate the Blood Spirit Art.</p>
 <p>Xue Moyan was Mo Lingye’s daughter, and her grandfather was the previous sect master of the famed Blood Fiend Sect of a thousand years ago. Her father was Xue Li, the newly-appointed sect master of Blood Fiend Sect, and the blood of the orthodox side of Blood Fiend Sect flowed inside of her body.</p>
 <p>However, she had no choice but to live behind a mask. She did not dare to openly cultivate the Blood Spirit Art, nor did she dare to reveal her identity as a member of Blood Fiend Sect.</p>
 <p>This had always upset her.</p>
 <p>She had silently been enduring this life, hoping to bring Blood Fiend Sect back to its former glory in the eyes of the world and finally be able to openly talk about her identity.</p>
 <p>At this moment, she didn’t dare to do so.</p>
 <p>—but Qin Lie did!</p>
