 <p><strong>Chapter 204: Blood Progenitor</strong></p>
 <p>Numerous blood snakes cruised through the air, heading for Ying Xingran and the three great reverends. Blood Shadow’s eyes glittered with a bloody light as he controlled the blood snakes remotely with his mind.</p>
 <p>“You dare, Yan Chi!”</p>
 <p>Feng Rong’s expression was cruel as she ignored her severe injuries and spat out a mouthful of blood essence.</p>
 <p>The blood essence exploded and formed innumerable crystalline blood droplets. They shone with a glamorous light and rammed towards the blood snakes.</p>
 <p>“Ungrateful fool!”</p>
 <p>Blood Shadow yelled before the bloody light in his eyes converged at a single point. A thick, bloody and fiendish aura was directly blasted at Feng Rong while carrying a tidal wave of mind energy.</p>
 <p>“Splat splat splat!”</p>
 <p>The blood droplets exploded, and whatever little color Feng Rong had just regained disappeared in an instant.</p>
 <p>Traces of blood flowed slowly out of her eyes, nose, mouth, and ears.</p>
 <p>Her soul was extremely weakened, and this time she had truly injured her heart and soul. She no longer had the ability to fight.</p>
 <p>“Rong’er!” Mo Hai’s expression changed greatly as he grabbed Feng Rong right after she was injured. He hurriedly slipped a blood colored pill into her mouth.</p>
 <p>“Sss sss! Sss sss!”</p>
 <p>The blood snakes that were stopped temporarily by the droplets began to move again. One of them charged at Ying Xingran’s neck with its jaws ready to clamp down.</p>
 <p>“Blood Change!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a voice as cold as ice yelled out from the crowd.</p>
 <p>That voice belonged to Qin Lie!</p>
 <p>A strange energy wave that caused the crowd to feel their blood was boiling emanated from Qin Lie’s body. Before they realized what had happened, they saw that the blood snakes Blood Shadow had formed with his lifeblood essence suddenly started melting.</p>
 <p>They dissolved and splashed everywhere!</p>
 <p>After the life-like blood snakes had all melted, they were now simply just tiny pools of blood and lost all the brutality they had only moments ago.</p>
 <p>Ying Xingran and the three great reverends stared at Qin Lie with great shock after escaping the maws of death. Each of the nearby inner sect elders and Tang Siqi was were shocked to the core as they turned to look at Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>It was at this moment that a fountain of blood flew out from the spirit pattern pillar beside him.</p>
 <p>Under the sun, the bloodwater shone with a terrifying crimson color. It poured down onto Qin Lie’s body in front of everyone’s eyes.</p>
 <p>In an instant, Qin Lie had turned into a bloody man, a bloody man boiling with a bloody, fiendish aura!</p>
 <p>A strange bloody light appeared in his eyes, and his body was even giving off an old and cruel aura. That aura mingled together with the bloody stench, giving rise to great fear within the depths of everyone’s hearts.</p>
 <p>“Blood Change! It’s actually Blood Change!” As soon as Feng Rong saw it, she screamed, “Qin Bing, h-how could you possibly know Blood Change?”</p>
 <p>Even Blood Shadow’s entire body spasmed. After a momentary shock, a light of understanding flashed across his crimson eyes.</p>
 <p>While everyone was still worried that Blood Shadow would renew his attacks, he suddenly bowed down before Qin Lie to everyone’s amazement. He raised his head with madness shining in his eyes as he rasped, “Blood Progenitor… You’re the Blood Progenitor, aren’t you? I am the first disciple of You Hongzhi. My master told me about you once. The reason I came today was to release you from the spirit pattern pillar and return your freedom!”</p>
 <p>Blood Progenitor?</p>
 <p>In their great confusion, Ying Xingran and Luo Zhichang froze for a moment as they stared at Blood Shadow.</p>
 <p>Even Feng Rong was a little befuddled. She did not understand why Blood Shadow had reacted so oddly to the current turn of events. Just slightly, she felt like laughing when she saw him bow before Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>Tang Siqi was the only person out of everyone there who had a faint idea of what was going on. Strange light brimmed in her eyes as she looked at Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie’s eyes shone with a bloody light as he indifferently looked at Blood Shadow and said, “I am not him.”</p>
 <p>He was still cracking open the remaining seals inside the spirit pattern pillar just now. When Blood Shadow arrived and was about to commit mass murder, he still had two seals that he hadn’t unlocked.</p>
 <p>Since the seals were not completely broken, Xue Li could not exit with his true body and thus could not leave the spirit pattern pillar.</p>
 <p>However, seeing that Blood Shadow had acted, out of helplessness, Qin Lie had no choice but to borrow Xue Li’s power.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Xue Li had summoned his lifeblood essence out of his body and poured it into Qin Lie’s. The lifeblood essence of Blood Fiend Sect was the fountain of power, and the lifeblood essence in Xue Li’s body was the essence of his whole life of cultivation!</p>
 <p>After his lifeblood essence had coated Qin Lie’s skin, he immediately gained the near infinite volume of blood energy. And since he had half of Xue Li’s soul sealed inside the Soul Suppressing Orb, he could even channel this power with that half.</p>
 <p>It was the equivalent of him turning into Xue Li, this thousand year old demon, for a short period of time!</p>
 <p>How could Blood Shadow possibly fight him?</p>
 <p>“The Blood Progenitor isn’t possessing you?” Blood Shadow frowned and immediately climbed back up from his kneeling position. “Then why could you use Blood Change?”</p>
 <p>While speaking, the bloody color on Blood Shadow’s body faded bit by bit. Under the sun, his shadow grew clearer as the stench of blood grew thicker!</p>
 <p>“Blood Arts: Materialization! Be careful Qin Bing!” Feng Rong exclaimed.</p>
 <p>The shadow of Blood Shadow formed from his blood shot out and attacked Qin Lie, carrying with it a mad, bloodthirsty aura.</p>
 <p>“If you aren’t the Blood Progenitor, then you can go to hell!” Blood Shadow laughed sharply, “Other than killing Ying Xingran and the three great reverends, the reason I came here today was to personally meet the Blood Progenitor. I wish to cultivate a higher rank of the Blood Fiend Secret Arts!”</p>
 <p>“Boom!”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie’s mind suddenly shuddered.</p>
 <p>The instant the blood colored shadow rushed towards him, an extremely terrifying soul attacking energy had invaded first.</p>
 <p>It reached deep into his soul!</p>
 <p>“Blood Arts: Cocoon!” Xue Li’s evil voice came out from inside the Soul Suppressing Orb as a wave of energy rippled out while he circulated blood essence and applied it around his body.</p>
 <p>Amazingly, Xue Li’s blood essence that was solidifying around Qin Lie’s body shrunk.</p>
 <p>Then, it turned into a blood cocoon that completely covered Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>The countless scarlet threads on the blood cocoon looked like human nerves. Fresh blood even gushed from it.</p>
 <p>At first glance, it was as if the blood cocoon was alive. It was an incredibly terrifying and impactful sight.</p>
 <p>The shadow formed by Blood Shadow’s lifeblood essence splashed onto the blood cocoon. Like a stream flowing into a river, it actually merged directly into the blood cocoon without even a splash.</p>
 <p>Blood Shadow’s soul connection with his blood essence was sliced away in an instant. At least seventy percent of his power was gone just like that.</p>
 <p>“Senior Blood Progenitor, I-I am here to save you!” The moment that Blood Shadow saw that something was wrong, he yelled at the spirit pattern pillar.</p>
 <p>He was the only person other than Qin Lie who knew the secret of the spirit pattern pillar. He knew that You Hongzhi’s bloody spirit art came from the old man inside the spirit pattern pillar.</p>
 <p>That old man who You Hongzhi had referred to as the Blood Progenitor was the source of all their blood arts.</p>
 <p>Blood Shadow had heard from You Hongzhi that the bloody spirit art he was cultivating was not complete. When he had reached the late stage of the Netherpassage Realm, he would have to acquire a higher ranking bloody spirit art.</p>
 <p>Otherwise, his fate would be the same as You Hongzhi’s that year. You Hongzhi’s spirit art had backfired at the late stage, and he had to consume fresh blood to be able to maintain his realm and avoid his entire body exploding and killing him.</p>
 <p>That was how Xue Li had restricted You Hongzhi in the past.</p>
 <p>Therefore, after reaching the late stage of the Netherpassage Realm, Blood Shadow had been thinking of a way all this time to meet Xue Li and ask for a higher ranking bloody spirit art.</p>
 <p>His so-called revenge for You Hongzhi was only an excuse, and killing Ying Xingran and the three great reverends was but a small matter to be carried out along the way.</p>
 <p>His true objective was to acquire a high rank bloody spirit art and break through his limits once more!</p>
 <p>“Senior Blood Progenitor, please return my lifeblood essence. I am willing to take you as my master!” Blood Shadow faced the spirit pattern pillar and begged.</p>
 <p>“Serve me as your master? You’re not qualified.” An eerie voice came out from the blood cocoon surrounding Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>The blood essence Blood Shadow had released just now was split out of the blood cocoon once more. There was a terrifying soul energy inside this split blood essence—it came from the other part of Xue Li’s soul!</p>
 <p>Once this bloody man reappeared, it no longer had any trace of Blood Shadow’s aura. It turned into a wisp of bloody light and abruptly flew forward.</p>
 <p>Amidst Blood Shadow’s terrified cries, the bloody man slipped directly into Blood Shadow’s body from the top of his head.</p>
 <p>An acutely wretched scream came out of Blood Shadow’s mouth. Droplets of blood began to surface on Blood Shadow’s skin and appeared exceedingly eerie.</p>
 <p>Blood Shadow’s eyes struggled, seemingly with all he could as he clutched his head and roared in extreme pain, “Get out! Get out of my body!”</p>
 <p>His voice grew weaker and weaker...</p>
 <p>After a while, Blood Shadow’s wretched cries had stopped, and even the struggle in his eyes had disappeared.</p>
 <p>An transformed aura which became cruel was slowly unleashed from his body. Blood Shadow’s crimson eyes shone with a light that would cause souls to shudder.</p>
 <p>When Ying Xingran, Luo Zhichang, Feng Rong, and Mo Hai looked at him now, they all felt their blood run cold.</p>
 <p>They knew very well that Blood Shadow was completely gone. This person who had taken over Blood Shadow’s corporeal body was the Blood Progenitor he was talking about!</p>
 <p>At this moment, it was as if Xue Li’s true body inside the spirit pattern pillar had turned into a real corpse. There was no life energy in it, nor was there even a trace of a soul.</p>
 <p>The seal had not been unlocked completely, and Xue Li’s true body still could not slip out of the spirit pattern pillar. But his lifeblood essence and soul were not restricted.</p>
 <p>Now, his lifeblood essence coated Qin Lie’s body, and half of his soul was sealed inside Qin Lie’s Soul Suppressing Orb. The other half of his soul had eliminated Blood Shadow and taken over his corporeal body.</p>
 <p>“A body at the middle stage of the Netherpassage Realm and a body of blood that isn’t pure enough. What garbage!” Xue Li took a gander at his new body with eyes filled with dissatisfaction. “Trash like this wants to serve me as his master, what a joke.”</p>
 <p>While saying that, the cocoon surrounding Qin Lie had melted into bloodwater. Qin Lie had appeared once more.</p>
 <p>Xue Li suddenly looked at Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie was also looking at Xue Li.</p>
 <p>Xue Li then started to walk to Qin Lie, one step at a time.</p>
 <p>Ying Xingran, the three great reverends, and the seven great inner sect elders all looked ashen and were shivering slightly.</p>
 <p>No one dared to move even a muscle!</p>
 <p>Even Feng Rong was frightened. She could only stare at Xue Li without looking away, without being able to come up with even the slightest thoughts of resistance.</p>
 <p>The aura flowing out of Xue Li’s body alone was enough to cause their souls to quiver. It made even the act of standing in front of Xue Li somewhat difficult...</p>
 <p>Amidst the crowd’s fearful gazes, Xue Li arrived beside Qin Lie and stared deeply at him. Then, he suddenly sat down beside Qin Lie and said reluctantly, “C’mon, say it. What do you want me to do?”</p>
 <p>“I want you to help me kill some people,” Qin Lie answered in a simple and straightforward manner.</p>
