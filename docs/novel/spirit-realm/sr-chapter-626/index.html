 <p><b>Chapter 626: Getting Rich Overnight!</b></p>
 <p><span style>The Miao Family martial practitioners who came over in such a hostile manner ultimately retreated in defeat. They weren’t able to take even a blade of grass away from Black Cloud Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Carry the spirit stones and crystals up the fire phoenixes. Quickly! We should leave this place as soon as possible!” Hong Bowen returned to the Flowing Gold Fire Phoenix and fell silent once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Gold Sun Island martial practitioners continued to busy themselves, continuously going in and out of all the mines. They began looting Black Cloud Palace’s many palaces en masse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw that the situation was safe once more, Qin Lie smiled and prepared to return to the fire phoenix.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that he was about to leave, the sexy Gold Sun island beauty couldn’t help but put on an inviting appearance and give him a bold hint. “My name is… Yi Man. Remember to come look for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure!” Qin Lie laughed loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looting Black Cloud Palace took Gold Sun Island a whole eight hours. It was only when morning came that the martial practitioners finally finished with their work after going back and forth on the crystalline war chariots.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fire phoenixes finally left Black Cloud Palace at sunrise and entered the clouds, returning to Setting Sun Islands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the way, most of the Gold Sun Island martial practitioners busied themselves with sorting out the goods they’d seized. Among them were three island envoys, Hu Yun, Liu Qin, and Fang He.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Out of the three, only Hu Yun had come into contact with Qin Lie while he was still known as “Xing Lie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the time, all three envoys thought that Qin Lie was young and inexperienced. They had treated him with indifference even though Xing Shengnan had instructed them to guide Qin Lie in the cultivation of his realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, Liu Qin and Fang He had immediately found excuses to push their responsibilities on Hu Yun and escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hu Yun, on the other hand, had earned some soul crystals from Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, Qin Lie was someone who could stand toe to toe with Xing Yumiao. This would be the source of great regret for Liu Qin and Fang He when they encountered Qin Lie once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why don’t you tell us about our spoils, Hu Yun,” Qin Lie asked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master… Qin.” Hu Yun was all smiles as he flipped through the ledger and excitedly declared, “We’ve obtained a total of six hundred thousand Earth Grade spirit stones from Black Cloud Palace! There are seventy eight Profound Grade spirit artifacts, nine Earth Grade spirit artifacts, and thirty five bottles of all kinds of spirit pills. We also got three thousand Fate Crystals, twenty six hundred Aurora Stones, and four hundred and fifty Thunder Sand Jades! Aside from that, we also got twelve spatial rings filled to the brim with all sorts of spirit materials and more than three hundred bundles of spirit plants!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s eyes were shining.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he first departed from the Scarlet Tide Continent and arrived in the Land of Chaos, he only had five Earth Grade spirit stones with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The amount of spirit stones he had to pay to ride a spirit eagle from Spirit Eagle Island to Sea Moon Island already cost him five Earth Grade spirit stones. Then he needed another eighteen of them to travel from Sea Moon Island to the Heavenly Wither Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earth Grade spirit stones were the standard currency in the Land of Chaos. A single Profound Grade Six or Profound Grade Seven spirit artifact could cost up to one or two thousand Earth Grade spirit stones, not to mention that using the intercontinental teleportation formation cost a thousand spirit stones per use. Qin Lie and his companions had used up a total of nine thousand Earth Grade spirit stones travelling from the Heavenly Calamity Continent to the Heavenly Fissure Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, their lack of spirit stones even forced them to stay at Black Jade City for a time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie never thought they would earn more than six hundred thousand Earth Grade spirit stones in one go just by robbing Black Cloud Palace. They also obtained a multitude of spirit artifacts, spirit pills, spirit materials, and crystals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This amount of profit made Qin Lie’s eyes blaze with emotion. He sighed on the inside, thinking, “Robbery really is the fastest way to accumulate wealth!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Yuyuan laughed loudly and yelled, “Black Cloud Palace deserves its name! They truly are a Copper rank force! Even if we’ve completely offended Blue Moon Valley and we end up fighting them in the future, this trip was worth it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The spirit stones, spirit artifacts, and spirit materials we obtained today is equivalent to what Gold Sun Island would get after thirty years of normal development, and this… is just what we got from Black Cloud Palace.” Hu Yun also smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiang Xi, Xu Changsheng, and Xu Jiadong had taken their forces to Heavenly Sea Pavilion with another Nirvana Realm expert as escort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Heavenly Sea Pavilion was also a Copper rank force like Black Cloud Palace. Logically speaking, the spoils over there shouldn’t be much less than Black Cloud Palace’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The total loot Gold Sun Island would obtain from this split operation was bound to be an extremely shocking amount</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qin Lie, I heard that you need spirit stones and spirit materials of the six great attributes, metal, wood, water, fire, earth, and thunder. Is that correct?” Xing Yuyuan suddenly asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When we return to Gold Sun Island have done our calculations, Xiang Xi and I will give you a portion of the loot that fit those attributes,” Xing Yuyuan promised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s eyes lit up. With a pleased smile on his face, he said, “That would be great!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Yanzheng sighed. A trace of regret could be heard in his voice as he said, “If the elders of Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion hadn’t hidden most of their respective force’s wealth after Zheng Zhihe and Jiang Hao died, our rewards might have been several times bigger than what we got today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s fine,” Xing Yuyuan said indifferently. “These spoils are already beyond our imagination!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“According to what you told me, Black Cloud Palace is ranked last among Black Voodoo Cult’s Copper rank forces. In spite of that, Black Cloud Palace still possessed such an amazing amount of wealth. Doesn’t that mean those higher ranking Copper forces literally ooze with wealth?” Qin Lie’s eyes burned with greed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course!” Xing Yuyuan exclaimed. “You could even say that Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion are among the weakest of all of Black Voodoo Cult Copper rank forces.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, if we keep attacking like this and robbing them blind, how many spirit stones can we get from those Copper rank forces?” Qin Lie slowly grew excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His Spirits of Void and Chaos required an unbelievable amount of spirit stones and spirit materials of the six attributes to grow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once he stepped into the Nirvana Realm and attempted to reach the Imperishable Realm in the future, the amount of spirit materials required to build his Soul Altar would be astronomical as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By now, Qin Lie gradually figured out that all conflicts between powerful forces were fueled by the desire to obtain spirit materials and resources.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Possessing a great wealth of spirit materials meant that a Nirvana Realm expert would be able to be advance to the Imperishable Realm. Such an achievement would greatly increase a force’s competitiveness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood Fiend Sect had fallen silent for many years. Although they possessed many Nirvana Realm experts, none of them were able to advance to the Imperishable Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Simply put, this had been caused by Blood Fiend Sect loss of income after going into hiding. This prevented them from accumulating enough spirit materials for their Nirvana Realm experts to assail the Imperishable Realm. This also caused Blood Fiend Sect’s gradual decline and prevented them from returning to their former glory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without a great wealth of spirit materials or spirit stones, a force would not be able to obtain high quality spirit artifacts or pills to increase a martial practitioner’s cultivation speed. That made it impossible to produce a powerful expert capable of taking control of a situation by themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without a powerful Imperishable Realm expert, a force couldn’t be considered a top Silver rank force in the Land of Chaos. They wouldn’t be able to strike fear into the hearts of other forces or truly have authority.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Hong Bowen’s voice rang out from inside of a wooden building.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If Blood Fiend Sect one day regains control of the Heavenly Calamity Continent, we will possess thousands of mines and hundreds of spirit plant fields. The annual income of all those mines and fields will be dozens of times larger than the amount you seized from Black Cloud Palace today!” he exclaimed. “The Xiahou, Su, and Lin Families were able to become three of the nine great Silver rank forces because they seized the opportunity and took Blood Fiend Sect’s mines and field for themselves after our collapse. They slowly accumulate profit for over a thousand years, building up their capital to what it is today.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the past, these three families were even weaker than the Miao Family. The only reason they have Imperishable Realm experts right now is because they utilized Blood Fiend Sect’s wealth! The Miao Family and the three great families are at completely different levels right now because Blue Moon Valley, in which the Miao Family is situated, doesn’t possess nearly as much resources or fertile lands as the Heavenly Calamity Continent!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The loot you got today is significantly inferior compared to the Miao Family’s current income, let alone that of the three great families!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When Blood Fiend Sect returns to the Heavenly Calamity Continent and regains everything it lost, all of you will truly understand what it means to be a top Silver rank force! You will gain tens of thousands of spirit stones everyday!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The excitement of Qin Lie, Xing Yuyuan and others wasn’t deflated by Hong Bowen’s words. Instead, their eyes lit up with anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie and the others returned to Setting Sun Islands two days later. When they arrived, they realized that Xiang Xi had returned before them. Every martial practitioner on the Setting Sun Island looked so excited and overjoyed that it was almost as if they were celebrating a new year.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Second Brother Xing! How did your looting go, huh?” Xiang Xi’s roar spread all of the Setting Sun Islands the second Qin Lie and his group emerged from their fire phoenixes. “Hahahaha! I got four hundred thousand Earth Grade spirit stones from Heavenly Sea Pavilion! Thirty six Profound Grade spirit artifacts! Three Earth Grade spirit artifacts! Twenty pill bottles! Nine spatial rings full of spirit materials and crystals! Even a hundred and twenty bundles of spirit plants!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiang Xi roared every time he reported a number. He was completely red with excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In recent years, he addressed Xing Yuyuan as second island master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He only addressed Xing Yuyuan as Second Brother Xing back when he was still the island master of Gold Sun Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was also the time he had been closest to the Xing brothers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Xiang, you haven’t called me Second Brother Xing in nearly twenty years. I am… very happy to hear you call me that again.” Xing Yuyuan was filled with emotion when he said this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cut the nonsense! Quickly, tell us what you got from Black Cloud Palace!” Xiang Xi yelled loudly. “Let’s compare and see who gathered more wealth for Gold Sun Island!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come on, second island master! Quickly! Tell us about your spoils!” Xu Changsheng also laughed loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hu Yun!” Xing Yuyuan yelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hu Yun grabbed a ledger and stepped out from behind Xing Yuyuan. Then he loudly declared, “We got more than six hundred thousand Earth Grade spirit stones! Seventy eight Profound Grade spirit artifacts and nine Earth Grade spirit artifacts! Thirty five bottles of all kinds of spirit pills, three thousand Fate Crystals, twenty six hundred Aurora Stone, and four hundred and fifty Thunder Sand Jades! Twelve spatial rings filled to the brim with all sorts of spirit materials, and more than three hundred bundles of spirit plants!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiang Xi, Xu Changsheng, and Xu Jiadong were stunned the second they heard the words “six hundred thousand Earth Grade spirit stones” from Hu Yun’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Hu Yun finished his declaration, Xiang Xi was stunned for a very, very long time. In the end, he pulled his hair in frustration and loudly yelled, “No way! How could I possibly lose to Second Brother Xing! Dammit, how could Black Cloud Palace be so rich? If I knew about this, I would’ve robbed Black Cloud Palace myself! Dammit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After hearing Hu Yun speak, the Gold Sun Island martial practitioners on the Setting Sun Islands went silent for a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then they abruptly broke out into an uproar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hell yeah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re rich! We’ve truly struck gold!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gold Sun Island had never been this rich!”</span></p>
