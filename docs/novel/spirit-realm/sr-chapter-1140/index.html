 <p><strong>Chapter 1140: Take You Somewhere!</strong></p>
 <p>“What are they doing at your place?”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie’s face look dark. He was angered by the six great forces’ arrival.</p>
 <p>The Blaze Family blood in his veins burned in reaction to his emotions, turning his eyes scarlet and his long hair as red as blood.</p>
 <p>The beautiful woman dressed in traditional clothes stared at him in surprise. She said, “Big brother was right. The God Race bloodline in your body has finally awakened after three hundred years!”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie smiled in self-derision. “It wouldn’t have if it wasn’t for them!”</p>
 <p>The woman nodded once before saying, “In that case, shouldn’t you be grateful to them?”</p>
 <p>“Oh, yes.” Qin Lie’s lips split open into a cold, terrible grin. “I’m very grateful for their help! I guarantee you that I’ll repay their ‘kindness’ in my own way one day!”</p>
 <p>“Even that is in the future. For now, you should stay here and do nothing.” The woman hesitated for a moment before adding, “Their coming has something to do with the Qin Family…”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie was caught off guard. “What do you mean?”</p>
 <p>“Didn’t your grandfather contact you about this? Didn’t you know what’s going on as of late?” the woman exclaimed.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie shook his head in response. “I wasn’t in Spirit Realm as of late.”</p>
 <p>“That is for the best… you really shouldn’t hang around Spirit Realm.”</p>
 <p>“Why’s that?”</p>
 <p>“The six great forces are attacking the Qin Family. The Qin Family possesses many domains, secret realms, and bases in certain asteroids, and they were all attacked by the six great forces. I heard that the Qin Family had decided to endure the beating for the moment and hide until an opportune time presents itself. The Qin Family has kept a very low profile, but that didn’t mean the six great forces aren’t aware of their true strength. Their anxiety had prompted them to take action.”</p>
 <p>A pause later, the woman continued, “The fact that the God Race is about to arrive only made things worse.”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie furrowed his eyebrows when he heard this.</p>
 <p>It was at this moment Ji Yao showed up hurriedly.</p>
 <p>The moment he came into the room, he immediately glared at Qin Lie and yelled, “Why have you come here at such a sensitive time?”</p>
 <p>“Am I not welcomed?” Qin Lie replied in a very provocative tone.</p>
 <p>Ji Yao looked a little embarrassed. He knew that he sounded less friendly he should be, but that was because he was high strung from all that was going on right now. He hastily explained himself, “Of course you’re welcomed, it’s just that you’ve shown up at the exact same time as the six great forces, so…”</p>
 <p>“If the Ji Family deems my presence inconvenient, I can turn around and leave right away!” Qin Lie snorted coldly.</p>
 <p>The arrival of the six great forces had already put him in a bad mood to begin with. He didn’t like that the Ji Family seemed to have dealings with the six great forces.</p>
 <p>His displeasure had only increased after Ji Yao showed up and questioned his arrival.</p>
 <p>It was to the point where he felt like throwing the crisis that was about to befall Spirit Realm to the back of his mind.</p>
 <p>“Your temper is still nearly as bad as it was before!” The woman sighed.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie said with a unhappy look on his face, “I thought the Ji Family isn’t on the six great forces’ side, but…”</p>
 <p>“We really are not on the same side.” Ji Yao hurriedly clarified his position. “Look, I’ll be honest with you. Do you remember the time I gave you the star map? The reason the six great forces are here is because they suspect that we’re involved with their failings at Boluo Realm. These people are here to interrogate us, not be friends with us. Also… we’ve leaked some intel to the Qin Family lately, which made them grow more and more unhappy with us.”</p>
 <p>After hearing Ji Yao’s explanation, Qin Lie forced his anger down slightly and calmed down over time.</p>
 <p>Ji Yao waited until he was sure Qin Lie had calmed down before asking, “I know that you’ve come for something. Tell me, why have you come to the Ji Family today?”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie looked at the duo quietly for a while before answering, “Can I trust you?”</p>
 <p>Ji Yao immediately declared his stance by swearing an ancient oath of the Ji Family.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie turned to look at the woman beside Ji Yao.</p>
 <p>She said indifferently, “Say it if you think that we’re trustworthy.”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie pondered for a moment before saying, “Let me take you somewhere.”</p>
 <p>“Where?” Ji Yao asked in astonishment.</p>
 <p>“You’ll know once you arrive there.” Qin Lie humphed.</p>
 <p>“Sure, why not.” Ji Yao nodded.</p>
 <p>“Activate your teleportation formation and set the target destination to the Land of Chaos. Once we’re there, I’ll take you to the new place I want to show you from there.” Qin Lie said.</p>
 <p>“Alright.” Ji Yao nodded at the woman dressed in traditional clothes.</p>
 <p>The woman quietly made a complex hand seal before pressing a palm at the secret ancient diagram at the center of the ancient hall.</p>
 <p>In an instant, the ancient hall was enveloped in rainbow light.</p>
 <p>Ji Yao and Qin Lie entered the teleportation formation first. The woman hesitated for a second before following behind them.</p>
 <p>The teleportation formation teleported them to a new location.</p>
 <p>A moment of vertigo later, the trio arrived at the super-large teleportation formation that had just been built at Evil Infant Island.</p>
 <p>“Come with me!”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie didn’t pause to chat with Evil Infant Boy or the martial practitioners around them. Instead, he led Ji Yao and the woman straight towards Soul Summoning Island.</p>
 <p>At the same time, he ordered Zhuang Jing to leave Boluo Realm and head to Soul Summoning Island right now.</p>
 <p>“What is he planning to do?”</p>
 <p>The woman thought to herself. She had a few complaints to offer about this little trip.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t like Qin Lie had left her a favorable impression three hundred years ago. Even today, his awakened bloodline was the only reason she was curious about him.</p>
 <p>Besides that, she didn’t know too much about Qin Lie. She didn’t know how different Qin Lie was now compared to three hundred years ago.</p>
 <p>Ji Yao did praise Qin Lie many times after he returned home. He claimed that Qin Lie wasn’t just a completely different person compared to three hundred years ago, he was even looking a little like Qin Hao in both appearance and ability.</p>
 <p>She had never fully trusted Ji Yao’s claims.</p>
 <p>It was with this doubt she arrived at Soul Summoning Island with Ji Yao. She planned to see what kind of plan Qin Lie had in store for them.</p>
 <p>“Let’s do it here.”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie stopped at Soul Summoning Island before activating the Eight-eyed Demon Spirit’s bloodline and opening a star door.</p>
 <p>Both Ji Yao and the woman were caught off guard when they saw the creation of the star door and its destination. It seemed to be leading towards an unfamiliar place that seemed to be covered in flames.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie made a “after you” gesture.</p>
 <p>Ji Yao and the woman exchanged a look of surprise with each other. A moment of hesitation later, Ji Yao took the initiative and went in first.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, I’m not stupid enough to hurt you two, not to mention that you aren’t my enemies.” Qin Lie told the woman.</p>
 <p>“You wouldn’t dare even if you could!” she replied with a soft snort before darting through the star door.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie was the final person to pass through the dimensional portal.</p>
 <p>“Master!”</p>
 <p>The six-level Soul Altar expert Curtis was currently guarding the Extreme Flame Abyss. The Asura clansman immediately saluted Qin Lie respectfully the moment he came out.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie waved him down before looking at the stunned Ji Yao and the woman, saying, “This is the Extreme Flame Abyss, a single level in the world that is the Abyss. Three rank ten Great Lords of the Abyss live in this place, and their strength are comparable to that of a rank ten God Race expert! Right now, the Blaze Family is fighting the Abyss Devils in different corners of the Extreme Flame Abyss!”</p>
 <p>“The Light Family, Darkness Family, Bloodthirst Family, and Profound Ice Family of the God Race are about done conquering their respective Abyss levels. They’ve almost accumulated enough refined flesh and blood energy.”</p>
 <p>“It won’t be long before all five great families invade Spirit Realm at the same time.”</p>
 <p>“It won’t be the same as thirty thousand years ago, where only two of the five families had invaded!”</p>
 <p>“What?!” Ji Yao turned pale as he exclaimed in shock. Both his eyes were filled with deep fear.</p>
 <p>Even the woman had turned pale with fright.</p>
