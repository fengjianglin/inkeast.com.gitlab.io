 <p><b>Chapter 690: Frost Island</b></p>
 <p><span style>Frost Island was a famous place in the Ruined Lands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rumors said that a long time ago, there had been a martial practitioner that cultivated frost spirit arts that used Frost Island as a home, and gathered a considerable faction on Frost Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet for some unknown reason, suddenly, all of the martial practitioners that cultivated the frost spirit arts on Frost Island completely disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, only their spirit beast steeds were left on the island to reproduce. A long time later, Frost Island became the paradise of frost-type spirit beasts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the Ruined Lands became the gathering place of the other races and evil spirits, many of the beings that lived in the Ruined Lands would frequently go to Frost Island to hunt spirit beasts. There was a portion of those that dug out ice caverns on Frost Island and cultivated the cold energy there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Frost Island was never rebuilt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most of the Rank Five or Six spirit beasts La Pu had killed recently were frost-type. The dragon python that Qin Lie had just consumed was similar to the Ice Soul Python. Its entire body gave off cold energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, he believed the old Sea Race clansman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Flying on the crystalline war chariot through the sky, he carefully avoided all the dangerous areas. After flying for an hour, he slowly reached the Frost Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white frosty mist entered his field of view like steam off boiling water. Despite it being thousands of meters away, Qin Lie still felt a terrifying cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This degree of cold was slightly similar to the cold he felt at the land of frost or in the &nbsp;Graveyard of Gods’ Forbidden Land of Ice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Another icy place, I really have karma with these...” Qin Lie thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Back under the Arctic Mountain Range, the land of frost had been bone-chilling. Later on, when he entered the Graveyard of Gods, he stumbled upon the Forbidden Land of Ice during his search for the Land of the Buried Gods .</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, he always seemed to find cold places.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After learning that La Pu was trapped in Frost Island, he had slightly more confidence because he cultivated a very profound frost art.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His crystalline war chariot turned into a thread of prismatic light that flew towards the Frost Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he got closer and closer to his destination, he could see through the white mist and make out the scene on Frost Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were many gargantuan transparent glaciers around the island that surrounded the island, looking like swords pointing at the heavens.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The island was covered in a thick layer of snow and looked as if it was encased in ice. It also flashed with cold light and was shrouded in intimidating cold energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hm?” He couldn’t help but exclaim.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he got closer to Frost Island and saw the scenery more clearly, he suddenly had a wondrous feeling—he seemed to have been here before!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He seemed to feel that many of the features on the island were familiar...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is...” after frowning and thinking hard, his eyes suddenly lit up and he shouted, “Frost Concept Diagram!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He immediately stopped the crystalline chariot. He was still hundreds of meters away from Frost Island as he channeled the Frost Arts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wave of cold energy came out of his spirit sea, spreading over his entire body rapidly and forming a thin layer of ice on his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He used his mind consciousness to peer into the second space inside the Soul Suppressing Orb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were the four basic spirit diagrams on that level. Other than that, there was also the Frost Concept Diagram!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Frost Concept Diagram had manifested miraculously in the Soul Suppressing Orb through the Ice Emperor’s frost concept back in the land of frost. What the Frost Concept Diagram depicted was a world made out of ice. After looking closely, he found that it was extremely similar to Frost Island!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every time he comprehended the frost concept, he would feel as though his soul was floating towards the Frost Concept Diagram.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was also why when he reached Frost Island, he felt a feeling of familiarity immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It really is very similar!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After closely examining it, Qin Lie’s mind shook slightly. He felt that the world of ice depicted in the Frost Concept Diagram was copied from Frost Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he channeled the Frost Arts, he noticed that while he had not stepped onto the island, the cold energy that shrouded it seemed to be attracted by him and was slowly gathering at his position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s eyes suddenly lit up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he was pleasantly surprised, the Demon Sealing Tombstone hidden in his spatial ring flew out on its own.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seven godly lights suddenly came out of the surface of the tombstone and shot with astounding power like a rainbow towards Frost Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie shook again as he came to a realization, “The ice spirit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Sealing Tombstone had a wondrous ability to sense the seven spirit bodies. He had experienced this back at the Graveyard of Gods. It was because of the Demon Sealing Tombstone that he was able to enter the Forbidden Land of Ice and then to find the Land of Buried Gods with the ancient elite remains that were hidden there!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the Graveyard of Gods collapsed, the ice spirit and the first voodoo insect had fled. There had been no news of them after.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason why Gao Yu left was so that he could search for the ice spirit and Jia Yue who was being possessed by it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now, when Qin Lie came to this land,, the Demon Sealing Tombstone was reacting so violently. This meant that the ice spirit that had disappeared was hiding on Frost Island!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Frost Island was extremely cold. The intensity of cold inside the cold mist was higher than in the Forbidden Land of Ice in the Graveyard of Gods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the ice spirit that liked cold, there was nothing more suitable and attractive than Frost Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Such a coincidence!” Qin Lie’s face brightened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he prepared to follow the Demon Sealing Tombstone and enter Frost Island to explore, he suddenly felt the ice energy of Frost Island slightly retreat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Demon Sealing Tombstone that was giving off rainbow light seemed to have lost track of ice spirit’s aura. The seven blinding rays of light moved about for a moment and ultimately receded back into the tombstone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Sealing Tombstone once again floated in front of Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do not worry, it is still on Frost Island, we will definitely find it.” Reaching out a hand to put away the Demon Sealing Tombstone, he did not hesitate this time. His body shrouded in frost energy, he flew towards Frost Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh whoosh whoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zing zing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he was flying closer to the island, he felt three considerably strong soul fluctuations at the perimeter of Frost Island heading in his direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He halted and looked in their direction, awaiting their arrival.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What just happened? There were seven bright lights that penetrated into the cold mist shrouding the Frost Island and rapidly scanned it! Did you see it?” an enormous lizard man shouted loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This person was completely red, and his body was in the shape of a lizard. However, his posture was that of a human. When he talked, his long tail whipped constantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I saw it! Seven lights that contained an unknown power fluctuation. It was mysterious. I didn’t even feel it.” a person with a dragon head but a human body called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These lights came from this direction!” a cool and pleasing voice came from the mouth of a white barbarian female. The female wore a silk dress, and had a veil over her face. She gave off cold energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gazes of the three met in the air and then gathered together on Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t look at me, I don’t know what happened. I hurried over from far away to see what this prismatic beam was.” Qin Lie said with an expression of innocence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, it doesn’t seem like it was you.” the lizard man licked his lips and laughed strangely. Then he rumbled, “Young Fulfillment Realm human, this is not a place that you should come to. Leave quickly, otherwise you do not want to know how you will die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leave, I do not want to eat human meat today!” the dragon-headed human also urged with impatience on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It will be best if you leave now.” The white barbarian female that came from the three large tribes of the eastern barbarians said coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they ascertained that Qin Lie had nothing to do with the seven rays of light, they did not want to pay attention to him and wanted him to go away, as though they were afraid that Qin Lie would delay their matters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My senior is trapped in Frost Island, I want to go in to find him,” Qin Lie said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you stupid?” the white barbarian female looked over coldly and lectured ruthlessly, “Your senior is trapped in Frost Island, what can you do here? Get buried with him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie wasn’t angered. He said with a smile, “That’s my business, no need for you to worry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke, the crystalline war chariot that had stopped once again let out a deep rumble. Under the shocked eyes of the three, Qin Lie passed between them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn it! Don’t let this boy ruin it!” the lizardman suddenly reacted and shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eyes of the other two turned cold. With cold snorts, they immediately chased after Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hm?” Qin Lie turned around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Behind him, the two foreign race clansmen and the white barbarian female were giving off ear-piercing howls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he was about to charge into the Frost Island territory, he felt a wave of terrifying power flood out of the island, creating enormous waves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s expression changed slightly.</span></p>
