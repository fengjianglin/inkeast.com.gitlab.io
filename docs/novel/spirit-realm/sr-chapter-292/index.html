 <p><strong>Chapter 292: Purple Blood!</strong></p>
 <p>“They’re right in front of us!”</p>
 <p>Song Tingyu stood up on the Flowing Rainbow Butterfly. Her hair danced wildly amidst the raging wind, giving her a wild and heroic look.</p>
 <p>“Relax. I asked Profound Heaven Alliance to tell Seven Fiends Valley not to act recklessly. Seven Fiends Valley is our vassal force. They would not normally dare to disobey Profound Heaven Alliance’s orders.”</p>
 <p>Looking at Qin Lie’s dark expression, Song Tingyu comforted him, “When we reach there, I will be the face while you be the heel with the Terminator Profound Bomb. We should be able to resolve this matter this way…”</p>
 <p>She already had the perfect plan in her heart.</p>
 <p>“If Seven Fiends Valley dares to harm them, then don’t blame me for repaying violence with violence!” Qin Lie snorted coldly.</p>
 <p>“It’s okay. It’s definitely going to be okay, don’t worry.” Song Tingyu continued to persuade him and guaranteed verbally, “I can solve this. Leave it to me!”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie kept quiet.</p>
 <p>The Flowing Cloud Rainbow Butterfly gradually soared lower, diving from the tall skies towards the top of the forest. Both Song Tingyu and Qin Lie could already clearly see the scenery beneath them. They could see the trees in the forest and the mottled sunlight beneath.</p>
 <p>“Faster!”</p>
 <p>Song Tingyu’s expression abruptly changed as she slapped the Flowing Cloud Rainbow Butterfly again, urging it to go faster.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie’s pupils abruptly shrank. “What did you sense?”</p>
 <p>“N-nothing…” Song Tingyu smiled unnaturally.</p>
 <p>She could see from the extraordinary changes of energy and airflow that they were right in front of them, and that combat was underway.</p>
 <p>Therefore, she had grown anxious. She urged the rainbow butterfly below her to rush to the battlefield as quickly as possible, wanting to prevent the matter from worsening any further.</p>
 <p>She saw that Qin Lie had already taken out three Terminator Profound Bombs beside her, and as a result, she felt some bitterness in her heart...</p>
 <p>“Zing zing zing!”</p>
 <p>Bright rays of rainbow light swam across the forest like shadows of dragons, blasting the numerous large trees to bits.</p>
 <p>The cold-faced Qiu Xudong, channeling his spirit art and holding a silvery whip in his hands, only needed to shake his hands once before a silver light shot out of his weapon.</p>
 <p>Qiu Xudong, in the late stage of the Manifestation Realm, wielded a Profound Grade Three spirit weapon, the Silver Dragon Whip. He was already powerful in the first place and, when he unleashed the high grade spirit artifact, was absolutely intimidating.</p>
 <p>Both Ling Xuanxuan and Ling Feng cultivated a fire spirit art. The duo had joined hands to unleash purple flames as their defensive line in an attempt to block Qiu Xudong’s attack. However, they were blasted by the silver light until their flesh and skin were ripped apart.</p>
 <p>These silver lights were just the shadows of the Silver Dragon Whip and not even the actual item approaching them.</p>
 <p>Ling Yushi stood at the side. She was not as weak pessimistic, or passive as she acted in the past when everyone in the Ling Family could not see any hope.</p>
 <p>Rather, she stared closely at Qiu Xudong, looking deeply into his eyes. Suddenly, she gathered the anger, hatred, and refusal to give up in her heart into a strange mind blast that shot straight into Qiu Xudong’s mind.</p>
 <p>The silver shadow of the whip that filled the sky went out of control all of a sudden while all the dragon-shaped shadows scattered uncontrollably in every direction.</p>
 <p>“Slap slap slap!”</p>
 <p>The trees cracked and the earth was scarred wherever the dragon-shaped shadows of the silver whip went.</p>
 <p>Tu Mo, his band of Dark Asura Hall martial practitioners, and the people from Fire Fiend valley and Dark Fiend Valley all paled at the sight of the whip’s shadows rushing towards them and retreated backwards.</p>
 <p>“Xudong, what’s going on with you?” Jia Songlin asked in surprise.</p>
 <p>Qiu Xudong’s capabilities were something he was very familiar with. He did not think that Qiu Xudong would lose control in combat and make such a low level mistake.</p>
 <p>Qiu Xudong shuddered and promptly looked at Ling Yushi in surprise. He said with a slightly changed expression, “She is just a Natal Opening Realm martial practitioner, yet she could actually channel a mind consciousness attack—and such a powerful one no less!”</p>
 <p>“You’re saying...?” Jia Songlin looked shocked.</p>
 <p>“This girl from the Ling Family can already use mind blasts skillfully. Forget the fact that she is still in the Natal Opening Realm—even some Netherpassage Realm martial practitioners probably do not have mind energy as powerful as hers!” Shen Meilan’s expression was ugly. She had been staring closely at Ling Yushi this entire time and realized that her purple eyes were flashing with a light that made her anxious. Furthermore, she detected an immense and pure energy coming from Ling Yushi’s eyes.</p>
 <p>It was the kind of power that could only be sensed and used by a Netherpassage Realm martial practitioner after forming their true soul—soul power!</p>
 <p>“Why did she suddenly become so terrifyingly powerful? Exactly what is this Ling Family hiding? Why are they able to ignite such terrifying potential in such a desperate situation?”</p>
 <p>It was now that Shen Meilan had started to feel fear.</p>
 <p>“Let’s see if you have truly cultivated your soul energy?” Shen Meilan’s eyes went cold.</p>
 <p>A wisp of light that was like a cold star shone from inside her pupils. The light grew brighter and brighter, colder and colder while carrying a cold and dark aura with it.</p>
 <p>When Ling Yushi locked eyes with her, her mind suddenly exploded as if she was stabbed with countless icy cold icicles. They stabbed into her mind and consciousness, her nerves and brain.</p>
 <p>“Pfft!”</p>
 <p>Ling Yushi’s realm was too far apart from Shen Meilan’s after all. It was only a glance, and she was already severely injured, resulting in her spitting out a mouthful of blood.</p>
 <p>“Purple blood!”</p>
 <p>She Meilan cried out.</p>
 <p>The faces of every Seven Fiends Valley martial practitioner changed at this moment as they looked completely shocked by the fresh blood Ling Yushi had spat out.</p>
 <p>“Look at Ling Xuanxuan’s and Ling Feng’s bodies!” someone reminded them.</p>
 <p>It was only when they paid attention to the duo that they realized that purple blood was seeping out of the wounds Ling Xuanxuan and Ling Feng suffered!</p>
 <p>“What kind of monsters are the people of the Ling Family?” Shock filled Qiu Xudong’s face.</p>
 <p>Everyone else thought this as well.</p>
 <p>Even Dark Asura Hall’s Tu Mo, Tu Ze, and Zhuo Qian were intimidated by this unbelievable turn of events.</p>
 <p>The Ling Family clansmen actually had purple blood inside them. Their blood was different from everyone else’s!</p>
 <p>“Demons! They are demons! They must be!”</p>
 <p>“The Ling Family are outsiders! They are demons!”</p>
 <p>“They are actually from a foreign race!”</p>
 <p>The Seven Fiends martial practitioners all cried out at once. They looked fearfully and anxiously at the Ling Family clansmen and retreated together.</p>
 <p>Humans would instinctively feel fear towards the unknown, and right now, in their eyes, the Ling Family clansmen who bled purple blood from their bodies were without a doubt unknown monsters.</p>
 <p>“Kill these outsiders! Kill them!”</p>
 <p>“Kill! Kill them all! They must be an evil race from the Nether Realm! They are monsters hiding among us!”</p>
 <p>“This must be the truth!”</p>
 <p>“Kill!”</p>
 <p>“Kill!”</p>
 <p>Every Seven Fiends martial practitioner suddenly became courageous after their initial hesitation.</p>
 <p>Without waiting for Gu Tong, Jia Songlin, or Shen Meilan’s orders, these people all rushed towards the Ling Family. As if to hide their fear from before, they all wore mad looks on their faces.</p>
 <p>“Boom!”</p>
 <p>It was at this moment that an earthshaking rumble exploded between them.</p>
 <p>The center spot between the Ling Family clansmen and Seven Fiends Valley martial practitioners was the collision point of those madly rushing practitioners. Wind blew and stone rained. Trees instantly turned into dust, bodies were torn apart, and heads rolled everywhere like balls.</p>
 <p>This was the might of the Terminator Profound Bomb’s explosion.</p>
 <p>The countless Seven Fiends Valley martial practitioners who were clamoring to exterminate the Ling Family had lost more than half of their number just as they rushed into the open.</p>
 <p>The rest of the men who were ready to follow behind those people looked at the huge pit between the Ling family clansmen and them. They looked at the corpses that had been blown up into a piled up gory mess inside the pit by the Terminator Profound Bomb and suddenly felt as if their feet had something weighing a million pounds attached to them. They could no longer take even a single step forward.</p>
 <p>Jia Songlin, Shen Meilan, and Gu Tong all wore ashen faces as they shuddered.</p>
 <p>The Ling Family clansmen looked at the great pit at the center with looks of fear, still unable recover from their shock.</p>
 <p>They had never seen the Terminator Profound Bomb themselves. Furthermore, they neither knew who the Terminator Profound Bomb belonged to nor what the appearance of the Terminator Profound Bomb meant.</p>
 <p>Yet Ling Yushi and Ling Xuanxuan knew. Dark Asura Hall’s Tu Mo, Tu Ze, and Zhuo Qian also knew, so they were all livid with joy as they searched in every direction for the person who was rumored to have perished in the Nether Realm...</p>
 <p>“Fwoosh fwoosh fwoosh!”</p>
 <p>The sound of the Flowing Cloud Rainbow Butterfly flapping its wings resounded from above their heads. A black shadow that was like a dark cloud beneath the sunlight landed on the ground beside them.</p>
 <p>They subconsciously looked towards the sky.</p>
 <p>Rainbow light wrapped around the Flowing Cloud Rainbow Butterfly as Qin Lie let out an angry howl before jumping down as lightning and thunder immediately started to surround his body.</p>
 <p>He landed like a bolt of lightning between the Ling Family clansmen.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie!”</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie!”</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie!”</p>
 <p>The Ling Family clansmen cried out joyfully, the people from Dark Asura Hall cried out strangely, and the people from Seven Fiends Valley cried out fearfully.</p>
 <p>“Didn’t I tell Seven Fiends Valley not to act recklessly?” It was only now that Song Tingyu’s yell rang out from the sky. Like a goddess formed from multiple rainbows themselves, she too gradually descended from the sky.</p>
 <p>She landed right between the Ling Family and Seven Fiend Valley’s martial practitioners.</p>
 <p>“Miss Song.”</p>
 <p>“Miss Song.”</p>
 <p>“Miss Song.”</p>
 <p>Jia Songlin, Shen Meilan, and Gu Tong’s expressions changed as they hurriedly came forward and saluted.</p>
 <p>“No need for pleasantries.” Song Tingyu waved her hand before looking at the giant pit at the center and the bodies inside it. She criticized the trio, “You asked for this. Do you know what kind of disaster Seven Fiends Valley would face if the Ling Family clansmen were really slaughtered by all of you?”</p>
 <p>“Miss Song, the Ling Family has killed too many of our people!” Gu Tong gritted his teeth and said.</p>
 <p>“Would such a thing have happened if you hadn’t cornered them so much?” Song Tingyu scoffed.</p>
 <p>“Miss Song, the Ling Family isn’t from our race. The blood in their bodies is purple!” Shen Meilan screamed.</p>
 <p>The moment she said this, even Song Tingyu went silent. She turned around to look at Ling Yushi, Ling Xuanxuan, and Ling Feng—at their purple hair, purple eyes, and the purple blood on their bodies.</p>
 <p>Song Tingyu’s eyes shone with a strange light with deeply locked eyebrows as she wracked her brain, attempting to think of a way out of this.</p>
 <p>If they did not have purple blood or the title “foreign race,” Song Tingyu would have had the confidence to deal with this matter. Now, even the higher-ups of Profound Heaven Alliance and Eight Extreme Temple would pay attention to the Ling Family and treat this matter seriously.</p>
 <p>…Foreign race. Anything would become complicated the moment this accusation was made.</p>
 <p>The situation was worsening in a direction which even Song Tingyu could not control. She was beginning to feel that the situation was getting tricky.</p>
 <p>“Profound Heaven Alliance and Eight Extreme Temple has been battling the evil races of Nether Realm all this time. We have lost many people in those battles. Everything we do is to stop the evil races from entering this land and preventing them from invading us.” Jia Songlin looked at her, “But who knew that an evil race… had actually hidden themselves right beside us. Miss Song, I think you should consult your father about this matter.”</p>
 <p>Song Tingyu turned around and glanced at Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie said nothing. He simply took out all the Terminator Profound Bombs from his spatial ring to make his intentions clear.</p>
 <p>Song Tingyu’s headache worsened.</p>
