 <p><b>Chapter 552: Following Him Like a Shadow</b></p>
 <p><span style>“Crack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another glowing soul crystal crumbled to powder in Qin Lie’s grasp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without even opening his eyes, Qin Lie’s spatial ring lit up as he willed two more soul crystals into his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He continued to focus on extracting soul energy from the soul crystals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After half a day of rest and the consumption of three soul crystals, the soul energy that Qin Lie previously used up was quickly replenished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The power of the soul was a mental one. It meant releasing one’s consciousness, connecting it to one’s spirit sea, predicting the actions of an opponent, and feeling the miniscule fluctuations of spirit energy. All of this required soul energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The souls of strong individuals, when concentrated to the very limit, had the terrifying power to destroy mountains and reduce metal to dust.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shapeless, colorless soul energy barely visible to the naked eye emerged from one of the soul crystals, slowly gathering at Qin Lie’s True Soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Qin Lie’s True Soul emerged from the body of the Blood Progenitor and returned to his Soul Lake, it had been blurry and indistinct.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Having used up most of his soul energy, Qin Lie’s True Soul resembled a transparent shadow even within his Soul Lake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A transparent True Soul signified that the soul energy within a person was nearly depleted. Such a soul wouldn’t be able to even control that person’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As threads of soul energy gathered at Qin Lie’s True Soul, it gradually grew more distinct like a ghost manifesting a physical body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As his True Soul became clearer and more defined, Qin Lie’s tired mind recovered. His withered, pale complexion returned to normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He regained control of his body, and his perception of the world around him slowly returned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoo...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie let out a long breath and finally opened his eyes. They had regained their usual liveliness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After spending an entire day and night turning four soul crystals to dust, he recovered eighty percent of his soul energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sun’s burning light shone through the bright blue sky hit the surface of the sea. Like the scales of a fish, the water shimmered with golden light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he had been sitting on the beach for a long time, Qin Lie stretched his neck and shoulders as he got to his feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sun had just began to rise, its bright rays shining down from above. Qin Lie took a deep breath of the humid air. He suddenly felt as though his True Soul and Soul Lake were clean and pure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It felt as if the bits of filth that had been hidden inside of his Soul Lake had been cleansed by some kind of power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re about to have a breakthrough,” Xie Jingxuan suddenly said, surprise on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had been secretly watching Qin Lie all this time. She felt the purity of his soul, how dense and concentrated his soul energy was. She could tell from his eyes that the changes in his True Soul had helped his mind consciousness grow considerably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since Xie Jingxuan had obtained the inheritance of the Wood Race and cultivated it, her perception of life force had improved profoundly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Changes in a martial practitioner’s True Soul would result in the growth of their mind consciousness, the evolution of their life force, and the increase of their lifespan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She could tell from the slight changes in Qin Lie’s life force that he would soon surpass his current level and break through to the late stage of the Netherpassage Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel that way as well.” Qin Lie flashed a bright smile, then turned to look at Xue Moyan who was nearby. “How long do we have before the Pan Family arrives, Senior Sister Xue?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a moment of mental calculation, Xue Moyan answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if they use their crystalline war chariots and move as fast as possible, it’ll take them at least seven to eight days. That’s the best case scenario for them. The crystalline war chariots will be travelling through the clouds, so if the Pan Family is unlucky and encounters cyclones on their way here, their speed will be greatly affected. If that happens, it’ll probably take them half a month or longer to reach us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie rubbed his chin. “It seems like we still have a decent amount of time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what if we have time?” Du Xiangyang grimaced. “We don’t have flying spirit artifacts, there aren’t any flying beasts in the area, and there clearly aren’t any ships. Even if we have time, we still won’t be able to leave this place. All we can do is wait here. A few days won’t change anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That may not be the case.” Qin Lie snickered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After saying this, he suddenly walked into the waves ahead of them. Water immediately swallowed him up until only his head remained above the surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qin Lie...” Song Tingyu called out to him softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to find the Demon Sealing Tombstone. Don’t worry about me,” Qin Lie shouted back. He didn’t turn around, and instead continued swimming forward. “Don’t do anything reckless while I’m gone. Even if you find any of the bodies of the ancient elites… try not to touch them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone watched as he slowly moved into the distance, becoming a tiny speck on the sea. Nobody followed him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them knew about Qin Lie’s connection to the Demon Sealing Tombstone. Even if they did follow him, they probably wouldn’t be any help. The tombstone could even mistake them as enemies and attack them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They would only be able to do something when Qin Lie found the Demon Sealing Tombstone, learned about its mysteries, and made sense of the seals on the bodies of the ancient elites.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So they just waited patiently as they watched Qin Lie leave. As they gradually recovered their strength, they started searching the island they were on for the bodies that had crash-landed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie swam amongst the desolate islands, sending out signals with his mind consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Sealing Tombstone had his blood energy. Channeling the Blood Spirit Art allowed him to sense his blood energy in a wondrous manner. If the Demon Sealing Tombstone were near him, he’d be able to sense it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hm?” Qin Lie suddenly turned his head, flinching with fright.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the water behind him, he could see a sanguine shadow. It was clearly following him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He immediately came to a stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, as the sanguine shadow drew closer to him, he discovered that it was actually the body of the Blood Progenitor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Blood Progenitor should have been at the beach with Xue Moyan. He never would have expected that, upon his departure, the body of the Blood Progenitor would follow the aura he exuded and follow him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This realization shocked Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The body of the Blood Progenitor, which resembled blood gemstones molded into a human shape, eventually caught up to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The body floated on the surface of the water facing upward. It didn’t exude any trace of an aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Were it not for the fact that the body appeared special, no one would have believed that it belonged to the progenitor of Blood Fiend Sect, the creator of the Blood Codex.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie originally needed to use spirit energy to move through the sea. Upon seeing the body of the Blood Progenitor approach, an idea occurred to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Blood Progenitor’s body silently floated on the surface of the water in a strange manner. It didn’t even sink by a hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So he sat on its stomach.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Having a thread of blood energy enter the Blood Progenitor’s body, Qin Lie tried manipulating it like it was a ship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Blood Progenitor's body was actually used like a bloody jade board as it traveled across the sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rise!” Qin Lie yelled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie tried to use his blood energy to stir the vast sea of blood energy within the Blood Progenitor’s sea of consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie thought back to the time that his soul sank into the sanguine seven-level pagoda in the Blood Progenitor’s sea of consciousness and controlled the Blood Progenitor’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He did the same as before, except this time he willed the body to fly through the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The body of the Blood Progenitor miraculously rose into the air and hovered ten meters above the sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Awesome!” Qin Lie cried happily, clapping his hands. He nodded in satisfaction, then said, “It seems that, even if the Pan Family does come, I won’t have to sit around and wait for death.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he manipulated the Blood Progenitor’s body, it became a flying spirit artifact that could be ridden... and it was fast!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not bad!” he exclaimed. “Now it’ll be much easier to find the Demon Sealing Tombstone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>So Qin Lie sat on the body of the Blood Progenitor, flashing through the air above the sea and the desolate islands like a bolt of bloody lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seven minutes later, he arrived at an island full of mountains and bare of any vegetation and immediately sensed the Demon Sealing Tombstone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Blood Progenitor’s body immediately shot toward it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the base of one of the island’s desolate mountains, in a valley that didn’t even have a single plant, numerous stones lay scattered around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Sealing Tombstone sat next to a grayish-brown rock. It looked dim, as if it had used up a lot of power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like the rocks scattered around the valley, the god heads, which were the size of enormous boulders, lay around the Demon Sealing Tombstone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The god heads also didn’t shine like they originally did. They were dim and pale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie flew off of the Blood Progenitor’s body and moved forward to pick up the Demon Sealing Tombstone with his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He tried sensing the Demon Sealing Tombstone and discovered that the strange power within it was still circulating. The seven godly lights that had disappeared from its surface were going through a complex transformation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is...” Qin Lie murmured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a moment of thought, his eyes lit up and an excited expression leaped to his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Sealing Tombstone was refining the earth, metal, and water spirits!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew that the Demon Sealing Tombstone would soon give him the essences of these three spirits, just like it had done with the fire, wood, and thunder spirits!</span></p>
