 <p><b>Chapter 533: The Remains of the Voodoo Progenitor, the Evil God, and the Arrow God</b></p>
 <p><span style>The auras of Di Fei, Ka Deng, and the woman Sen Ye called A’Yue had only been exposed because the power of frost had suddenly invaded their bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dense auras surrounded each of them. Powerful earth radiated from Di Fei, sharp metal from Ka Deng, and gentle water from A’Yue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Sealing Tombstone had been hanging high above Jia Yue’s head, searching for the ice spirit in order to seal it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the ice spirit had taken over Jia Yue’s body, hijacking her soul, the Demon Sealing Tombstone was confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, the aura of the earth, metal, and water spirits were clearly exposed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>—And the Demon Sealing Tombstone suddenly had targets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Sealing Tombstone that originally sought to seal the ice spirit immediately changed targets. It moved away from Jia Yue, turning its focus to the earth, metal, and water spirits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A terrifying change came over Di Fei, Ka Deng, and A’Yue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These three had been in different places, but at this time, they started moving.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These three barbarians in the Netherpassage Realm actually flew through the air, becoming gold, yellow, and white lights that shot toward the center of the frozen lake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Sealing Tombstone followed behind them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Above the lake, the bloody bone dragon continued to howl mournfully. The body of the Blood Progenitor still sat atop its skull, giving off an intimidating ruby light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, Qin Lie’s group was approaching the frozen lake from one side. Ye Yihao, Huang Zhuli, Feng Yiyou, Yu Men, and Su Yan were on the side opposite to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since half of them had died, the eastern barbarians had scattered and were now fleeing in every direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Krik… krak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Yue’s eyes were an icy blue. She twisted her neck, and her joints resounded with satisfyingly crisp sounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Yue, whose soul had been taken over by the ice spirit, didn’t so much as glance at the tribesmen around her. Once the Demon Sealing Tombstone departed, she turned into an icy light and left for the frozen lake as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Snap!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon after Jia Yue left, the ice around Gao Yu exploded, and he calmly emerged from the resulting frost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The white barbarians around him were not so fortunate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their souls had been frozen to death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gao Yu silently headed in the direction Jia Yue had gone, a frown on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look!” Du Xiangyang shouted. “Down at the bottom!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The bottom of the lake!” Feng Yiyou shouted as well. “Look at the bottom!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Having suppressed their earlier panic, the eastern barbarians gathered at another side of the lake. They had strange looks in their eyes as they peered into its depths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The surface of the frozen lake had completely shattered by this point. It seemed to have been the ceiling of another world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That ceiling had cracked, and now the Land of Buried Gods that lay within the frozen lake was exposed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Below the cold white mist within the frozen lake, a desolate, endless plain came into view. Numerous vast, ancient palaces were strewn across that desolate plain. Some had already collapsed into ruin, leaving behind traces of a bygone era.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bodies of enormous beings could be seen among the clusters of ancient, ruined palaces. There were giants hundreds of meters tall and skeletal remains of huge, vicious monsters of old. One could even see smaller bodies flashing with attention-grabbing lights, clearly belonging to beings that possessed high levels of intelligence when they were alive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long dried blood covered this desolate misty plain, forming a bizarre pattern that seemed to contain numerous mysteries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bodies belonging to warriors of varying races and ferocious beasts lay scattered throughout the plain, leaning against the crumbling walls of ruined palaces or half-buried in the ground. All of them looked strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piled at the top of a tower of a specific palace, high up in the air, were eight enormous heads. The eyes of these heads glared at the Demon Sealing Tombstone, shocking godly light emanating from them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The heads of the god corpses!” Feng Yiyou shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eight headless god corpses had broken through the wards in the depths of the Land of Chaos’s major oceans. Their missing heads sat at the top of that tower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The heads of the eight god corpses resembled blazing suns that radiated blinding hot light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dense power shot from the eyes of these heads, forming rays of light that shone on the Demon Sealing Tombstone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Illuminated by these rays, the Demon Sealing Tombstone gave off a terrifying, baleful presence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Ye Yihao saw the body of a man shrouded in pitch black light. It lay there silently as he examined it, and he couldn’t help but shout, “The progenitor! That’s the body of the progenitor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The voodoo insects of him and Huang Zhuli didn’t bother waiting for orders, immediately flying into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Eight-winged Centipede Queen and the Black Crystal Sky Scorpion howled as they shot down into the desolate plain and toward the man’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gao Yu, having followed Jia Yue to one edge of the lake, also yelled out in shock. “The Evil God!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deep within the desolate plain, the body of a man clearly from another race rested in a half-crouched position. His body was around a hundred meters tall, and his skin was bluish brown. He also had a gigantic pair of wings on his back and curved horns on his head, and his body exuded a seemingly endless evil aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Sun Killing Bow! That’s the Arrow God!” Sen Ye cried out, eyes shining with an intense light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was looking at an eastern barbarian with a relatively normal appearance. It was a man that, despite his mummified state, appeared to be about fifty years old. He silently sat in the middle of a ruined palace’s round altar, holding a bow covered in complex patterns.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected!” Luo Chen exclaimed, his eyes growing feverish. “This is the Land of Buried Gods!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The desolate plain at the bottom of the frozen lake stretched across a vast area, multiple run-down palaces protruding from its earth. The bodies of the Voodoo Progenitor, the Evil God, and the Arrow God, the ancestor of the eastern barbarians, could be seen. In addition to that, the heads of the eight god corpses were visible atop the tower, and the bodies of giants and skeletons of ancient beasts littered the area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sight made the martial practitioners gathered around the lake become excited. They wanted to charge down immediately and gather all of these remains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Remains of the strongest existences of bygone eras were the most precious spirit materials in the world. They could be used to forge the strongest spirit artifacts, or one could directly absorb the potent power left within them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the hands of certain people, particularly special remains in perfect condition could even be made into someone’s second body!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Blood Fiend Sect or Black Voodoo Sect could obtain the remains of their respective progenitors and refined them, they would immediately become terrifyingly powerful weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qin Lie!” Du Xiangyang screamed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The excitement welling up inside of him made it difficult for him to control himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Tingyu, Luo Chen, Pan Qianqian, Xie Jingxuan, and Xue Moyan were excited as well, their hearts beating wildly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the rumors claimed, the Land of Buried Gods held the remains of the strongest beings from ancient times. This realization brought intense gazes to everyone’s faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sen Ye and the scarlet barbarians, as well as Ye Yihao, Huang Zhuli, Feng Yiyou, Yu Men, and Su Yan, couldn’t restrain themselves any longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, they were already sliding down the sides of the frozen lake to the desolate plain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Chen and the others looked at Qin Lie. They desperately wanted to rush down there too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait!” Qin Lie shouted, shaking his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone stared at him in surprise. They had no idea what he was making them wait for.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Demon Sealing Tombstone is currently searching for the remainder of the seven spirits, and the ice spirit has yet to show itself,” Qin Lie said. “The Land of Buried Gods… it may have other strange elements we aren’t aware of.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s group looked down into the lake and realized that Di Fei, Ka Deng, and A’Yue, all of whom had reached the lake before everyone else, were nowhere to be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Jia Yue had disappeared without a trace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only the Demon Sealing Tombstone remained, floating high above the Land of Buried Gods and absorbing power from the eyes of the eight god heads. Visible waves of energy rippled between the eyes and the tombstone as it used all of its power to search for the four remaining spirits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Something in the Land of Buried Gods seemed to prevent the Demon Sealing Tombstone from sensing the spirits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Over there!” Luo Chen cried. “Look at Black Voodoo Cult’s two voodoo insects!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Eight-winged Centipede Queen and the Black Crystal Sky Scorpion had flown to the desolate plain and now arrived at the body of the man that Ye Yihao had called the Voodoo Progenitor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two voodoo insects bared their sharp mandibles and bit into the body of the Voodoo Progenitor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They sought to consume the power that remained inside of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone watched them attentively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, the two voodoo insects started to struggle furiously, flapping their wings in a desperate attempt to flee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A terrifying vacuum emanated from within the Voodoo Progenitor, aiming to suck them into it. The Eight-winged Centipede Queen had bitten into the chest of the progenitor, and the Black Crystal Sky Scorpion had bitten into its neck. Both insects were sucked into the Voodoo Progenitor from these parts of the body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Yihao and Huang Zhuli had been descending toward the desolate plain, mad with joy and anticipation as they waited for their voodoo insects to transmit information to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, the moment the voodoo insects were sucked into the progenitor’s body, extreme terror filled their eyes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The initially robust bodies of Ye Yihao and Huang Zhuli quickly began to wither, their soul energy and blood visibly being drained from them. In ten short seconds, their skin and flesh disappeared, reducing them to a pair of dried out skeletons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t even have the time to scream.</span></p>
