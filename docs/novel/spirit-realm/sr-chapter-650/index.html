 <p><b>Chapter 650: Li Mu’s Account</b></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Zhuzhe is this powerful?” Qin Lie interrupted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t know much about Xue Li’s junior brother. In the Graveyard of Gods, he had not only been able to escape from Jiang Zhuzhe’s grasp, but he also managed to obtain the remains of the ancient elites with assistance of the Demon Sealing Tombstone. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This caused Qin Lie to underestimate Jiang Zhuzhe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even after Jiang Zhuzhe’s display of might this time which had forced the Gongye brothers, Black Voodoo Cult, and the three great families to retreat, Qin Lie believed that Jiang Zhuzhe was still not as powerful as the Pope of Black Voodoo Cult.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The reason Jiang An is where he is today is all due to the hard work of the previous Pope, who prepared a prosperous path with barely any setbacks for Jiang An to walk on. However, the same cannot be said for Jiang Zhuzhe. During the years when Jiang Zhuzhe was at Blood Fiend Sect, he was not paid very much attention due to Xue Li’s presence, as well as the presence of other practitioners whose talents were better than his.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Mu’s face was solemn as he continued. “Everything Jiang Zhuzhe has today, including the terrifying power of his two-level Soul Altar, was all obtained through his own efforts. In the past, everyone believed that Xue Li would definitely win against Jiang Zhuzhe if the two fought. In the end, however, it was Xue Li who was imprisoned. Then, when the various forces invaded the Blood Cloud Mountain Range and claimed the lives of all of the old Blood Fiend Ten Elders in battle, Jiang Zhuzhe was able to escape and throw off his pursuers. And now the man who never held too much of the spotlight in Blood Fiend Sect was not only a commander of a group of extremely loyal Blood Drinkers, but had also constructed a two-level Soul Altar!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To be able to defeat the two Black Voodoo Cult vice popes who also possess two-level Soul Altars by himself, he indeed has some skills.” Duan Qianjie also acknowledged Jiang Zhuzhe’s power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Duan, although I already know that you aren’t planning to cause any trouble for Jiang An, I also request that you don’t challenge Forefather Terminator any time in the near future,” Li Mu stated in a serious manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you afraid that I will end up dragging him down?” Duan Qianjie furrowed his brows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s one of the reasons.” Li Mu honestly said, “However, I’m also worried about you. Perhaps you can wound him at your current level, but you may die in the process...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, Duan Qianjie didn’t refute Li Mu, but instead remained silent. He silently thought to himself for a while, and then asked, “Do I truly have no chance of winning?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No one in the Land of Chaos is a match for current Old Monster Nan.” There was not even a trace of a smile on Li Mu’s face as he spoke in a stern voice. “He’s on a different level compared to people you have challenged in the past. You might have been able to escape with your life even if you couldn’t win, but Forefather Terminator is different. In the most recent three hundred years, everyone who challenged the Forefather ended up dying by his hands. Even with your control of spatial energy, being able to escape through the void is but wishful thinking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Mu paused for a moment, then added, “It’s because Old Monster Nan has constantly been wandering throughout the Void Chaotic Currents all these years. Although he mainly cultivates the power of thunder and lightning, his understanding of spatial concepts are not shallow anymore.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Qianjie became silent yet again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Qin Lie quietly listened to their conversation, he gradually began to gain a clearer understanding of Jiang An, Jiang Zhuzhe, and Forefather Terminator. His understanding of Forefather Terminator Nan Zhengtian was especially deepened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s hasn’t been long since you constructed the third layer of your Soul Altar, and you have only just stabilized your cultivation at the late stage of the Imperishable Realm. In all honesty, you are still quite far away from Forefather Terminator’s level.” Li Mu leisurely stated, “Maybe in another fifty years, if the old monster still hasn’t stepped into the Void Realm, you will be his match. But for now… it truly is too early.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If there’s nothing else, I’m leaving,” Duan Qianjie snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s nothing else.” Li Mu smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“ BANGABNGABNGBANG!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the space in front of the floating islands, Duan Qianjie forcefully tore open a spatial passage and entered it with an unhappy face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moments later, the spatial passage quickly disappeared as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Afterwards, Li Mu’s gaze naturally fell onto Qin Lie as he chuckled and said, “The reason I had Old Duan bring you here was because there is something I wanted to tell you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uncle Li, if Senior Duan challenged Jiang An, what would his odds of victory and defeat be?” Qin Lie suddenly asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Mu carefully thought for a couple moments, then said, “About sixty to forty, in Old Duan’s favor. However, if Jiang An is provided with enough time to gain a thorough understanding of the inheritance that is being passed to him by the Voodoo Progenitor, his strength will become increasingly greater.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you are putting it this way, does it mean Jiang An is also no match for Forefather Terminator?” Qin Lie asked in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah, if Jiang An was confident enough to defeat Forefather Nan, then Guan Xian would have already ordered Pu Ze to kill you long before Old Duan arrived,” Li Mu said, chuckling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie became even more surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the conversation between Duan Qianjie and Li Mu, he had roughly understood that Forefather Terminator Nan Zhengtian was an invincible figure that stood at the summit of the Land of Chaos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, that’s right, what did you want to tell me, Uncle Li?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems like Old Monster Nan has his eyes on you. Moreover, I heard that you promised Chu Li that you would visit Terminator Sect once the matters on the Setting Sun Islands were settled?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That is true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Mu thought for a moment, then said, “Take this spatial ring. A seal which cannot be broken by ordinary people had been applied to the insides of the ring. For now, you also do not have the ability to break it open. When you arrive at Terminator Sect and meet Nan Zhengtian, give this ring to him and mention that I entrusted it to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke, he handed a very normal-looking spatial ring over to Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie didn’t even try to inspect it, carefully putting it into his pocket right after receiving it. He replied, “I will.” He didn’t ask why Li Mu couldn’t go and deliver it by himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After today’s battle, the Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families shouldn’t dare to organize another large-scale invasion in the near future. If Blood Fiend Sect wishes to continue developing, it must make the most of this rare opportunity. Also... the bond between Illusory Demon Sect’s Sect Master and Mo Lingye is stronger than I had thought.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Mu rubbed his chain as he calmly continued, “Don’t hold back even if you have to come into conflict with Blue Moon Valley. From my point of view, it seems like Sect Master Yu doesn’t acknowledge the existence of Blue Moon Valley’s Miao Family at all. Thus, even if others within Illusory Demon Sect do care about Blue Moon Valley, it’ll hard for Blue Moon Valley to threaten Xue Li and the others with Illusory Demon Sect as long as Sect Master Yu is there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Qin Lie carefully listened, he gradually realized Li Mu’s message. “So no one would stand in our way if we moved against Blue Moon Valley?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There shouldn’t be too many obstacles.” Li Mu grinned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see!” Qin Lie nodded his head in quick succession.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, there’s nothing else. You should return to the Setting Sun Islands.” Li Mu laughed as he reached out with his hand towards the depths of the island and made a grabbing motion. Suddenly, a crystal war chariot engraved with the Xiahou family’s symbol emerged and quickly made its way over. “This is something I obtained on the side earlier, it’s for you to ride back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I will be taking my leave first.” After respectfully bowing to Li Mu, Qin Lie hopped onto the crystal war chariot and began riding it towards the Setting Sun Islands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Mu turned around and walked back to the complex of gorgeous palaces atop the Floating Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Carved on the inner walls of a certain magnificent palace were images of various strange beasts, nameless ancient looking trees, and various constellations of stars and suns. An invisible sealing energy seemingly locked down all of the space within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the main hall of this palace stood a tall Horned Demon Race clansman. A long lizard-like tail with spikes protruding from it emerged from his backside and constantly struck the gold and iron ground below him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the tail quickly moved back and forth, phantom images of it appeared appeared and a harsh screeching sound began to echo around the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The demon seemed to have become incredibly bored while he was waiting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eight extremely evident and ferocious looking curved horns extended out from the rear side of his neck. Indeed, it was none other than Tate, who had previously appeared on Floating Island—it was the powerful eight horn Horned Demon Race warrior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“ Did you manage to catch a glimpse of your Venerable One’s grandson?” Li Mu asked with a slight smile after entering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I did” Tate replied in human tongue with an extremely nasal voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why won’t your Venerable One just meet Qin Lie?” Li Mu frowned. “Just to search for his grandfather, this kid was willing to travel a great distance over from the Scarlet Tide Continent and slaughter into the depths of the Graveyard of Gods. If your Venerable One is still alive, I believe that he should at least send a message out to the kid and help him settle down a bit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s none of your business!” Tate irately replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Anyway, was the sole purpose of your trip over here to have me hand Qin Lie that spatial ring and tell him to go meet Forefather Terminator?” Li Mu wrinkled his brows. “What’s inside the ring? Why does Qin Lie have to take it over there? And why does it have to be in my name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We will send the agreed payment to Heavenly Sword Mountain within half a month. As for your other questions, I won’t answer anything.” Tate said impatiently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright then.” Li Mu nodded, then pondered for a moment and asked, “If it’s convenient, could you perhaps arrange for a meeting between your Venerable One and I? I’ve been wanting to meet him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tate glared at Li Mu, then snorted and said, “I will be taking my leave now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Having finished speaking, he controlled his large White Bone Nether Spirit Altar and suddenly shot into the sea of clouds, not waiting for Li Mu’s reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the sky, clusters of clouds roiled and gathered together to form a dark passageway to an unknown location. Countless howling nether beasts could be seen within the passageway, as if they were forming into a giant army.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In an instant, Tate disappeared. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Following right after, the dark passageway also disappeared.</span></p>
