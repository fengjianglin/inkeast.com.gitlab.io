 <p><strong>Chapter 407: Together</strong></p>
 <p>Qin Lie hadn’t thought that Gao Yu would join Mo Hai’s group.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Gao Yu and the others were waiting in line with spirit stones in their hands, getting ready to step into the teleportation formation, Qin Lie quickly hurried forward.</p>
 <p>“Kid! This teleportation formation headed to the Heavenly Wither Continent has been closed for more than a month. It has only been recently unsealed, and everyone is in a hurry to leave. You are in a hurry, and others are in a hurry, but no matter how urgent your matters are, you still have to line up properly!”</p>
 <p>A Blue Star Association martial practitioner couldn’t help but loudly scold Qin Lie when he saw him heading toward Gao Yu.</p>
 <p>Many people’s gazes suddenly focused Qin Lie. Gao Yu and the others also turned around to look at him in confusion.</p>
 <p>A martial practitioner who had followed Qin Lie’s group from Profound Heaven Alliance’s stronghold quietly arrived beside the person from Blue Star Association who was in charge and lowered his voice, saying, “Brother Zheng Xiao, these four are the ones that the president is looking for. They… are not allowed to leave Sea Moon Island.”</p>
 <p>This person had recently been watching the Profound Heaven Alliance residence and paying attention to the activities around it.</p>
 <p>After Celestial Artifact Sect’s Bi You had led his men away, Luo Chen was about to find a suitable time to personally visit that residence. However, against their expectations, Qin Lie and the others had suddenly left in a hurry.</p>
 <p>This made that person rush to send a message to Blue Star Association. He then followed Qin Lie and the others, worried that they might leave his sight.</p>
 <p>“The president wants them?” Zheng Xiao, the Blue Star Association martial practitioner responsible for the teleportation formation, asked in a low voice. His expression changed. “Are you sure?”</p>
 <p>“The president will personally arrive soon.” The person’s expression was serious.</p>
 <p>Zheng Xiao knew what he needed to do.</p>
 <p>“You!” He pointed at Qin Lie, coldly snorting with a frown. “You will not need to line up today. The teleportation formation will shut down very soon. Come tomorrow!”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie’s expression became grim.</p>
 <p>“It isn’t even early afternoon yet, why would the teleportation formation shut down now? Blue Star Association is being utterly unreasonable!” Song Tingyu cried out.</p>
 <p>The moment she spoke up, everyone’s gaze was drawn to her. The eyes of the martial practitioners standing in a line beside the teleportation formation suddenly became hot. Even their breathing became heavier.</p>
 <p>“What a beautiful woman!”</p>
 <p>“Tsk tsk! That body and that face. How unbelievably seductive!”</p>
 <p>“The girl beside her also isn’t bad. She’s quiet, cool, and just as attractive!”</p>
 <p>“It’s rare to see such beautiful women. Where did they come from?”</p>
 <p>“She is Profound Heaven Alliance Chief Song Yu’s only daughter, Song Tingyu! The one in white is Xie Yaoyang’s daughter, Xie Jingxuan!”</p>
 <p>Someone recognized these two girls and exclaimed in a low voice. It made the crowd’s eyes blaze even hotter.</p>
 <p>Beauties with an excellent status and background were only more attractive.</p>
 <p>Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan were going to leave Sea Moon Island, so they did not hide their beauty with their masks. Standing shoulder to shoulder at the crowded teleportation formation, the two of them were like lovely, blossoming flowers that started a small commotion among the crowd.</p>
 <p>“Profound Heaven Alliance’s Miss Song!” Feng Rong softly exclaimed.</p>
 <p>Gao Yu and the others looked at Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan in surprise.</p>
 <p>All of them knew about the series of important events that recently occurred in the Scarlet Tide Continent.</p>
 <p>They heard that Qin Lie and Profound Heaven Alliance’s Song Tingyu shared a close relationship with each other. They had been active in the Nether Realm, fighting with their backs to each other. They had a deep friendship.</p>
 <p>Now that they saw both Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan appear, they could not help but connect their appearance to someone.</p>
 <p>“He’s Qin Lie!” Feng Rong suddenly exclaimed in a low voice.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Qin Lie unleashed his Blood Spirit Art and smiled at Feng Rong.</p>
 <p>Feng Rong had only identified Qin Lie because of the surging blood energy inside of his body, his smile, and the light in his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie!”</p>
 <p>Gao Yu, Tang Siqi, and the others cried out in low voices. Their eyes glowed with excitement as they subconsciously moved toward him.</p>
 <p>“If you leave the line, you’ll have to line up again!” Zheng Xiao snorted.</p>
 <p>He glanced at Song Tingyu again and arrogantly said, “This is Sea Moon Island. We of Blue Star Association shall decide when the teleportation formation here shall function or not. If we wish to shut it down, we will shut it down, and if we wish to activate it, we will do so whenever we want. Outsiders will not question our decisions!”</p>
 <p>In this region of the sea surrounded by the seven great continents, Blue Star Association had always been the leader.</p>
 <p>Heavenly Sword Mountain held Blue Star Association in high regard, and their dominance was unchallenged at Sea Moon Island. They were responsible for managing the teleportation formation that connected to the Land of Chaos, and thus had a monopoly over trade in this surrounding region. Their strength was obviously impressive.</p>
 <p>The people of Copper rank forces would feel inferior to a member of Blue Star Association.</p>
 <p>The Scarlet Tide Continent’s Profound Heaven Alliance did not deserve their attention, which was why he was cold and indifferent toward Song Tingyu’s questions.</p>
 <p>“We will not be leaving for now.”</p>
 <p>Feng Rong smiled faintly and became the first person to get out of line. Then Gao Yu, Tang Siqi, Mo Hai, Lian Rou, and Yi Yuan left the line, wearing smiles on their faces.</p>
 <p>They all walked toward Qin Lie one by one.</p>
 <p>“Long time no see!”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie smiled as Gao Yu gave him a powerful hug.</p>
 <p>“I didn’t think I’d see you here!” Qin Lie responded just as strongly.</p>
 <p>Then Feng Rong and Yi Yuan also came over to give Qin Lie a hug. They said in low voices, “It’s good that you’re safe.”</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Mo Hai, Tang Siqi, and Lian Rou just smiled faintly and watched him. Their reactions were not as passionate as Feng Rong’s, Gao Yu’s, or Yi Yuan’s.</p>
 <p>“We won’t be leaving today. I’d like to reminisce with my friends about old times,” Qin Lie announced, turning to Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan. Laughing loudly, he moved to leave with Gao Yu and the others.</p>
 <p>He was overjoyed to meet old friends in a strange land, which was why he did not pay attention to Blue Star Association’s unreasonable demands.</p>
 <p>“Brother Zheng Xiao, the president is coming right now. Do not let them leave!” The Blue Star Association martial practitioner who was watching Qin Lie said hurriedly. “This is the person who caused trouble at Sea Moon Trade Group and stole the Astral Thunder Hammer!”</p>
 <p>After a momentary pause, Zheng Xiang reacted and loudly yelled, “So it was you, brat! Surround them!”</p>
 <p>There were more than a dozen Blue Star Association martial practitioners stationed near the teleportation formation. Of their number, Zheng Xiao had reached the middle stage of the Fulfillment Realm. Everyone immediately began to act according to his command.</p>
 <p>In a short time, Qin Lie, Gao Yu, and the others were surrounded by the Blue Star Association martial practitioners.</p>
 <p>“You are truly an audacious person, kid. How dare you rob spirit artifacts from Sea Moon Trade Group on Sea Moon Island. What a blind, foolish person you are!” Zheng Xiao yelled angrily.</p>
 <p>The martial practitioners gathered near the teleportation formation knew all about the robbery that happened at Sea Moon Trade Group not long ago. They were all surprised as they stared at Qin Lie curiously.</p>
 <p>“So this is the guy who did it.”</p>
 <p>“He truly is an audacious person alright. How dare he rob a spirit artifact from Blue Star Association while in their domain. How immoral!”</p>
 <p>“No wonder Blue Star Association was so angry!”</p>
 <p>“He has no one to blame but himself!”</p>
 <p>No one gave Qin Lie any sympathy. They were all taking joy in his misfortune, and even the few people who were about to be teleported away turned back to watch the show. They were no longer in that much of a hurry to leave.</p>
 <p>Considerable doubt appeared in Xie Jingxuan’s calm, clear eyes. She looked at Qin Lie, then at Song Tingyu, before asking in confusion, “Was it really him?”</p>
 <p>Song Tingyu smiled bitterly.</p>
 <p>She did not know where Qin Lie had screwed up to actually be caught red-handed by Blue Star Association just as they were about to leave Sea Moon Island.</p>
 <p>She had visited Sea Moon Island many times and was well aware of Blue Star Association’s influence in the surrounding region. She also knew that Blue Star Association’s Han Xing would only act humble toward a member of Heavenly Sword Mountain.</p>
 <p>Han Xing was arrogant in the face of the mastermind behind Profound Heaven Alliance, Eight Extreme Temple, and Joyful Union Sect’s disaster.</p>
 <p>“Now we’re in trouble…”</p>
 <p>She shook her head and sighed, already preparing to suffer financial loss to get out of this predicament.</p>
 <p>“The president is here! The president has arrived!”</p>
 <p>“It actually is the president of Blue Star Association!”</p>
 <p>“It truly is Han Xing!”</p>
 <p>“Now this is strange!”</p>
 <p>Many people cried out.</p>
 <p>As the president of Blue Star Association and an elite at the peak of the Fragmentation Realm, it was said that Han Xing was one step away from the Nirvana Realm.</p>
 <p>This person enjoyed a magnificent status in this region, and he had absolute power over the island’s affairs. He was often busy with cultivation and seldom showed up on the island.</p>
 <p>Wouldn’t his personal arrival be overdoing it a little if Blue Star Association was simply pursuing the matter of one stolen spirit artifact?</p>
 <p>This confused a lot of people.</p>
 <p>“No!”</p>
 <p>The moment Song Tingyu heard that Han Xing had himself arrived, her face changed greatly as she immediately came to a realization.</p>
 <p>A mere thunder hammer wasn’t worth Han Xing’s personal arrival. The matter of the tombstone having been stolen from the god corpse must’ve been exposed!</p>
 <p>She turned to look at Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie’s expression had gone completely grim. He frowned and pressed a hand to his spatial ring, preparing to act at any moment.</p>
 <p>He had also figured out the situation.</p>
 <p>The crowd automatically parted as Han Xing arrived from the road behind them. He was smiling, wore blue clothing, and carried himself in a calm manner.</p>
 <p>Luo Chen stood shoulder to shoulder with him.</p>
 <p>“The teleportation formation has been temporarily shut down for the day. Please come tomorrow. I ask that anybody who is unrelated to this vacate the premises,” Han Xing raised his voice and exclaimed after arriving.</p>
 <p>“Alright, get out!” Zheng Xiao began to shoo the people away.</p>
 <p>When the miscellaneous martial practitioners that were gathered here heard Han Xing’s words, they immediately understood that something was about to happen.</p>
 <p>The smart ones quickly left the area around the teleportation formation, but some did not actually leave and simply stood at the entrances to the streets, staring at them from several hundred meters away.</p>
 <p>“You leave as well!” Qin Lie frowned and yelled at Gao Yu and the others in a low tone.</p>
 <p>Gao Yu’s handsome face was riddled with a venomous chill. His body radiated a terrifyingly evil aura that made him appear like an evil god.</p>
 <p>Despite Qin Lie’s insistence, he said nothing and simply shook his head.</p>
 <p>“You seriously can’t stop causing trouble no matter where you go!” Feng Rong harshly glared at him, and also did not leave.</p>
 <p>Lian Rou and Yi Yuan remained right where they were, expressions calm as they held each other hands.</p>
 <p>Tang Siqi and Mo Hai were equally unmoved.</p>
 <p>These people had gone through countless hardships for all sorts of reasons to reach the Land of Chaos from the Scarlet Tide Continent. Even though they knew that staying could get them into a lot of trouble, not a single one of them left.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie’s face got increasingly grim.</p>
 <p>“President Han, it is true that we acted irresponsibly and caused some trouble at Sea Moon Trade Group,” Song Tingyu said, picking her words carefully. “We admit our fault. We are willing to pay for all of your losses. Please forgive us this once on the basis that we are young and foolish.”</p>
 <p>She did not give up, still hopeful that Han Xing had come because of the Astral Thunder Hammer.</p>
 <p>If that were really the case, then the matter wasn’t serious and could still be easily resolved.</p>
 <p>“The Astral Thunder Hammer is but a small matter.” Han Xing shook his head and frowned. “I have come because of your mass slaughter of my Blue Star Association martial practitioners during the appearance of the god corpse in the region of the sea near Spirit Eagle Island.”</p>
 <p>The moment he said this, Song Tingyu’s face turned completely bitter. This time, she knew that they had gotten themselves into huge trouble.</p>
