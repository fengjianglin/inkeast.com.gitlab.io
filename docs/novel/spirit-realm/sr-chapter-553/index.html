 <p><span><strong>Chapter 553: The Search of the Nine Forces</strong></span></p>
 <p><span>A great many experts gathered on one island off the coast of the Heavenly Fissure Continent to discuss important matters.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Graveyard of Gods had undergone spatial collapse, and it was unknown whether or not the martial practitioners who participated in the Trial were alive. It came to light that the Graveyard of Gods was a divine altar that the Heaven Fighting Race use to train their descendants, and that Jiang Zhuzhe, an evil remnant of Blood Fiend Sect, gave that information to Celestial Artifact Sect...</span></p>
 <p><span>All kinds of reports spread across the Land of Chaos through different channels of communication. They alarmed the leaders of the nine great Silver forces, all of whom sent people to make sense of the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span>Black Voodoo Cult sent Guan Xian, their Nirvana Realm chief instructor responsible for teaching others how to raise voodoo creatures.</span></p>
 <p><span>The person leading Illusory Demon Sect’s forces was Shi Xiuling. She possessed a cultivation of the Nirvana Realm and was the sworn sister of Yu Lingwei, sect master of Illusory Demon Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span>Terminator Sect mobilized He Shangsheng, a senior of He Wei famed for his fiery temper.</span></p>
 <p><span>Representing Heavenly Sword Mountain was Luo Nan, Luo Chen’s grandmother and one of the five Heavenly Swords.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Xiahou Family sent Xiahou Qi, the Su Family sent Su Zhi, and the Lin Family sent Lin Bin, all three of which were greatly respected elders in their own right.</span></p>
 <p><span>Aside from Celestial Artifact Sect and Ten Thousand Beast Mountain, these seven great Silver rank forces paid close attention to the Graveyard of Gods. Everyone they sent to investigate were people that held power in their respective force and the trust of their sect leader.</span></p>
 <p><span>These seven forces sent several dozen elite martial practitioners to participate in the Trial that took place in the Graveyard of Gods. They also contributed great treasures as rewards for those that survived.</span></p>
 <p><span>No one could have expected Celestial Artifact Sect and Ten Thousand Beast Mountain to send word that the Graveyard of Gods had been destroyed and that the fate of the Trial-participants was unknown.</span></p>
 <p><span>This news rocked all seven forces to their very cores.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The eight god corpses, which were imprisoned under the sea, broke free of their restraints, and we don’t know where they’ve gone. Elder Luo tried to open the spatial passageway to the Graveyard of Gods early, but couldn’t lock onto its coordinates. In all likelihood… this means that it no longer exists,” Bi You of Celestial Artifact Sect said with a sigh, explaining the situation to the people of the seven other forces. “According to the information we’ve currently gathered, something outside of our expectations definitely occurred within the Graveyard of Gods. If that weren’t the case, we’d be able to lock on to its position.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“I heard that Jiang Zhuzhe, a remnant evil of Blood Fiend Sect, told Celestial Artifact Sect about the Graveyard of Gods!” Xiahou Qi said with a cold snort. “Every force worked together to destroy Blood Fiend Sect a thousand years ago. All martial practitioners that cultivated the Blood Spirit Art were hunted down. Jiang Zhuzhe is a madman that sucks human blood, yet you dare to communicate with him in secret. I think your carelessness has caused this entire incident! How dare you believe someone like Jiang Zhuzhe? You working with him has pushed all of us from the frying pan into the fire!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Su Zhi and Lin Bin voiced similar opinions. All of them accused Celestial Artifact Sect of doing things that endangered everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span>Guan Xian of Black Voodoo Cult nodded in agreement, his expression cold and grim.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Jiang Zhuzhe caused the greatest calamity to ever have fallen on the Land of Chaos. Your Celestial Artifact dared to collude with such a person, so you should have expected such upheaval to occur in the Graveyard of Gods!”</span></p>
 <p><span>A thousand years ago, Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families were the ones that led the other forces in eliminating Blood Fiend Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span>These four forces had always them as an eyesore. They never stopped hunting down survivors of Blood Fiend Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span>Jiang Zhuzhe caused the calamity of a thousand years ago. In their eyes, he was the most terrifying of them all.</span></p>
 <p><span>They had always been searching for Jiang Zhuzhe, having thought of all sorts of ways to kill him.</span></p>
 <p><span>Upon hearing that Celestial Artifact Sect had secretly been working with him, they were furious.They naturally didn’t give them face.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Only Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families consider Blood Fiend Sect public enemy number one.” Bi You smiled coldly. “Your forces were the ones that wanted to eliminate them. My Celestial Artifact Sect never expressed the same intentions. We only took action in the past because Jiang Zhuzhe and his followers committed atrocities, drinking human blood and eating disciples of our sect. Celestial Artifact Sect only joined you to… teach them a lesson.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Everyone who actually drank human blood and ate human flesh were just a small fraction of Blood Fiend Sect,” Shi Xiuling of Illusory Demon Sect said with a sigh. “The actions we took back then… they truly were excessive.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Illusory Demon Sect and Black Voodoo Cult resided in the Heavenly Slaughter Continent. As a result, they always fought with one another, both out in the open and in secret. Guan Xian represented Black Voodoo Cult, so she obviously had to oppose him.</span></p>
 <p><span>She was also aware of Xue Moyan’s status as Blood Fiend Sect’s true successor. When Sect Master Yu Lingwei accepted Xue Moyan as one of her personal disciples, she informed Shi Xiuling of this fact.</span></p>
 <p><span>As a result, she stood on Blood Fiend Sect’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Although what Blood Fiend Sect did was indeed terrible and did require everyone to band together and attack them, we of Terminator Sect have always disapproved of later actions. There was no need to hunt down and kill every survivor afterward,” He Shangsheng said calmly.</span></p>
 <p><span>“A majority of Blood Fiend Sect did not drink human blood to cultivate,” Luo Nan of Heavenly Sword Mountain said. “We should not have hunted them down.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“We of Ten Thousand Beast Mountain agree,” Tu Mou said. “Going that far definitely wasn’t necessary.”</span></p>
 <p><span>One by one, Celestial Artifact Sect, Illusory Demon Sect, Terminator Sect, Heavenly Sword Mountain, and Ten Thousand Beast Mountain voiced their opinions about the matter concerning Blood Fiend Sect. All of them agreed that eliminating Blood Fiend Sect so thoroughly had been the wrong choice.</span></p>
 <p><span>This development made Guan Xian and the elders of the three great families look at one another, grim expressions on their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span>When Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families targeted Blood Fiend Sect a thousand years ago and refused to back down, the other five forces forces tacitly accepted it without objection.</span></p>
 <p><span>Why had they suddenly changed stances?</span></p>
 <p><span>Guan Xian exchanged looks with the other three and felt a bit suspicious. They felt as though there were an invisible power at work, urging the other five forces to change their attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span>This entire situation made them feel threatened.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Let’s not discuss Blood Fiend Sect first,” Guan Xian said, changing the topic. “How shall we resolve the matter concerning the Graveyard of Gods? Celestial Artifact Sect and Ten Thousand Beast Mountain caused it, yet they now don’t have any clue what to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Feng Yi of Celestial Artifact Sect and Qi Yan of Ten Thousand Beast Mountain were both absent. In the eyes of other people, the two were clearly hiding something.</span></p>
 <p><span>The moment the Graveyard of Gods was mentioned, Terminator Sect, Heavenly Sword Mountain, and Illusory Demon Sect immediately held the same opinion as everyone else. All of them targeted Bi You and Tu Mou.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Alright, everyone, let’s not panic. It may not necessarily be the case that everyone in the Graveyard of Gods died in the collapse.” Bi You raised his hands, trying to calm the group of people present. “Even if everyone that participated in the Trial died, the corpses of the ancient elites in the Graveyard of Gods shouldn’t have been destroyed. According to the information that was given to my Celestial Artifact Sect, once the Graveyard of Gods breaks apart, the bodies within it should have appeared throughout the Land of Chaos. We have summoned everyone today in hopes that we can work together and search for clues in every territory.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“You summoned us here just to tell us this? You want us to go on an aimless search for the remains of ancient elites?” Guan Xian’s expression darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The search will not be aimless,” Bi You said. “According to how information, the bodies should appear in regions of the sea near continents where there aren’t many people.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“All of you should send your subordinates out to search these areas,” Tu Mou said. “You may find something.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The other seven factions saw that Celestial Artifact Sect and Ten Thousand Beast Mountain weren’t willing to say anything other than this. They had no choice but to do as they said.</span></p>
 <p><span>At the command of the nine great Silver forces of the Land of Chaos, numerous smaller forces, sects, and families mobilized in this fashion, searching empty regions of the sea for bodies of ancient elites.</span></p>
 <p><span>……</span></p>
 <p><span>The collective command of the nine great Silver rank forces, having thousands of smaller forces search the Land of Chaos for the remains of ancient elites, spread throughout the world.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Pan Family received orders from Illusory Demon Sect as well.</span></p>
 <p><span>Atop a crystalline war chariot, Pan Tong wore a stern expression.</span></p>
 <p><span>“We’ll take at least seven more days to get there!” he said.</span></p>
 <p><span>The brows of all the Pan Family clansmen were furrowed. They definitely weren’t as relaxed or happy as before.</span></p>
 <p><span>“We need to move quickly. Every significant force is currently searching for the remains of ancient elites. If someone gets to them before we do, our family will miss its biggest opportunity!” Pan Tong took a deep breath then gave the order. “Advance at full power! Even if we go against the wind and our chariots are damaged, we need to get there as fast as possible!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The three crystalline war chariots of the Pan Family burned tons of spirit stones to move even faster. Martial practitioners with stronger realms even used their spirit power to forcibly increase their speed.</span></p>
 <p><span>The chariots sped through the sea of clouds like three bolts of lightning, operating way beyond their capacity.</span></p>
 <p><span>The Pan Family even went as far as sacrificing their valuable crystalline war chariots to try and reach the location where the bodies of the ancient elites had fallen as fast as possible—</span></p>
 <p><span>—all just to seize them before the other forces found them.</span></p>
