 <p><b>Chapter 564: Three Wives</b></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you? What is your real name? What is your goal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Yao bombarded Qin Lie with questions as they moved through the hallway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie rolled his eyes at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his opinion, Xing Yao had a petite figure and could be considered attractive. She seemed like she could be the pretty daughter of a humble family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet… her beauty paled in comparison to Song Tingyu, Xie Jingxuan, and Xue Moyan. Since he was so accustomed to seeing beautiful women, Qin Lie could only see Xing Yao’s beauty as ordinary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he lied to the Xing Family and introduced himself as “Xing Lie,” he had only wanted to get a free ride from them. He wasn’t actually planning to deepen his relationship with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What goal could I possibly have? I told you earlier that my name is Xing Lie,” Qin Lie said calmly. “Is there something wrong with that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Yao had led him to the end of the hallway by this point. Both of them now stood before a door to the room that Xing Shengnan had indicated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door of the room next to it, Xing Yao’s room, was ajar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My sister-in-law trusts you because she can’t forget about the old Xing Family. That’s the only reason you’ve been able to take advantage of her,” Xing Yao said with a snort, her eyes narrowed. “I, however, am not so easily fooled! Forces in the area have been searching for the remains of ancient elites that flew out of the Graveyard of Gods recently. Plenty of spies have been lurking around and looking for information. In my opinion… hmph!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Islands dotted the ocean between the Heavenly Calamity Continent and the Heavenly Slaughter Continent like the stars in the sky. Quite a few forces were on the same level as Gold Sun Island, Blue Moon Valley, and the Pan Family. There were even more Black Iron rank forces in the area as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These forces, big or small, were associated with either Illusory Demon Sect or Black Voodoo Cult. Some were also connected to the Heavenly Calamity Continent’s three great families.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Celestial Artifact Sect had spread the news that the remains of ancient elites had emerged from the Graveyard of Gods and fallen throughout the seas between all of the continents, Illusory Demon Sect, Black Voodoo Cult, and the three great families ordered all of their vassal forces to search for them with everything they had. Anyone that found a clue would then be greatly rewarded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if rewards hadn’t been promised, the hundreds of thousands of forces would be able to grow significantly with just a tiny bit of the benefits that came from the remains of the ancient elites.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a result, every force in all of the Land of Chaos worked itself into a frenzy and scoured the regions of the sea around them. They used huge ships or flying spirit artifacts to conduct their searches, trying to find even the smallest clue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Pan Family, Gold Sun Island, and Blue Moon Valley were just three of the myriad forces doing the same exact thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During this period of searching, all forces would send out spies and operate in the regions that other forces were active in. They did this to gather the latest news and find out what other parties had discovered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Yao, herself, had personally captured three such messengers near Gold Sun Island. One belonged to the Pan Family. The other two came from Heavenly Sea Pavilion and Black Cloud Palace, vassal forces of Black Voodoo Cult that had always fought with Gold Sun Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Yao figured that Qin Lie’s group of seven had been sent by their enemies. She believed they were borrowing the surname Xing to get close to them, hide within Gold Sun Island, and acquire information right under their noses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie spread his arms, a wounded expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our ship really was destroyed,” he said. “We’ve been floating on the ocean for a long time and were just hoping to get a free ride. We just want to get to the Heavenly Slaughter Continent as soon as possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure. Keep making up as many stories as you want. I’ll figure out the truth eventually.” Xing Yao couldn’t be bothered to mince words any longer and pointed toward the door in front of them. “Go in there and wait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s the key?” Qin Lie asked with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There isn’t one!” Xing Yao snorted and returned to her room, slamming the door shut. She just left Qin Lie in the hallway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie paid no heed to her impolite actions and simply rubbed his nose, then attempted to push the door open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Surprisingly enough, the door swung open. A tidy space lay within, complete with a washroom, a small cultivation room, and two bedrooms. Clothes he could change into were fully prepared as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite the fact that all the facilities in this room matched the others, it wasn’t as lavishly decorated or as large as Xing Shengnan’s room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This isn’t bad.” Qin Lie smiled in satisfaction, then loudly yelled, “Hey, niece! My women are still down below. Why don’t you send word and have them brought up here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only one wall separated Xing Yao’s room from his. Only the cultivation room was specifically insulated to prevent sound from getting in, so as long as Qin Lie shouted loudly, Xing Yao would definitely be able to hear him as long as she wasn’t in that particular room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Th-them?” Xing Yao stammered. She had just sat down in her room when Qin Lie’s sudden yell made her freeze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mn, they’re probably at the bottom level,” Qin Lie said nonchalantly. “Please do me a favor and tell them to come here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s room was a guest room specifically meant for Xing Family clansmen. It provided two bedrooms, a decent-sized cultivation room, a washroom, and a small living room. There definitely wouldn’t be any problem accommodating Song Tingyu, Xie Jingxuan, and Xue Moyan in it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan were scions of Profound Heaven Alliance, and Xue Moyan was the disciple of Illusory Demon Sect’s sect master. All three had lived like princesses ever since they had been born. Qin Lie felt it would be inappropriate to have them stuck in the bottom of the ship surrounded by men of Gold Sun Island, so he created an excuse to get them up here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for Luo Chen, Du Xiangyang, and Gao Yu... they were men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course Qin Lie ruthlessly abandoned them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have three wives?” Xing Yao shouted through the wall, snorting coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mn. All three are my wives. Please summon them for me, niece,” Qin Lie said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shameless bastard!” Xing Yao swore through gritted teeth, then harshly said, “I’m busy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I can only seek out your sister-in-law, my big sister, to help me arrange things.” Qin Lie sighed, pretending to walk out and find Xing Shengnan to discuss this matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop!” Xing Shengnan felt a headache coming on. She had no choice but to give in. “I’ll help you send a word below.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, my niece.” Qin Lie smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be happy! I will definitely make you regret this once I figure out who you really are!” Xing Yao exclaimed icily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is this place really fit for humans?” Du Xiangyang asked, an ugly expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This place” was the bottom level of the Wavebreaker. The air was filthy, beds were missing, and all of it was one open space. There were no individual rooms, futons were everywhere, and only five public washrooms were available. Men and women weren’t separated either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nearly a hundred Gold Sun Island martial practitioners milled around the bottom level of the Wavebreaker, all of which were in the Netherpassage or the Manifestation Realms. They hung around noisily, making the entire deck sound like a market. There was never a moment of silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This bottom level had no ventilation. Qin Lie’s companions had been directed to a tiny corner of this level, several Gold Sun Island martial practitioners hanging around them. They exuded odors that could kill a person, talking loudly and arrogantly. The mainly talked about women in a vulgar manner, sweeping their wanton gazes across Qin Lie’s group from time to time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Tingyu, Xie Jingxuan, and Xue Moyan may have changed their faces so that they looked ordinary, but their figures were still shapely and attractive. This was especially noticeable since they were still soaked with seawater and had yet to find somewhere to change into a set of dry clothes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their wet clothing pressed against their slender, curvy bodies. The attractiveness of their well-developed bodies was basically a deadly poison to these Gold Sun Island martial practitioners that hadn’t tasted women in a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They may not look like much, but their figures… they’re top notch!” said one of them as he looked at Song Tingyu and swallowed his saliva. “Holy shit, how in Spirit Realm are we going to cultivate in peace when our superiors arranged them to be put here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These people came from the Heavenly Calamity Continent. They don’t possess high statuses or respectable identities, and they probably don’t have any spirit stones either.” One of them stared at Xie Jingxuan’s legs and licked his lips. Then he laughed wickedly and said, “Those three women are the only good things they have. Their bodies are unbelievable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rest of them echoed his opinion in agreement, allowing their eyes to wander across the bodies of Song Tingyu, Xue Moyan, and Xie Jingxuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you think I won’t gouge your eyes out if you take another look?” Song Tingyu suddenly said, flashing a beautiful smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment her enchanting eyes turned to the lustful men, a powerful soul aura surged from her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dozen or so Gold Sun Island martial practitioners were all in the early and middle stages of the Netherpassage Realm. Their strength could only be considered average, and their True Souls weren’t nearly as potent as hers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second her soul aura enveloped the men, their eyes burned so much that tears gushed from them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This bitch is actually in the late stage of the Netherpassage Realm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group of Gold Sun Island martial practitioners immediately went pale with realization. They suddenly lowered their voices, not daring to act as brazenly as before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>None of them dared to look at Song Tingyu any longer. However, after a moment of hesitation, they snuck glances at Xie Jingxuan and Xue Moyan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two had also been nursing stomachs full of anger. After seeing Song Tingyu’s approach at quelling the vulgar men succeed, they did the same thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their rigid glares promptly stabbed at the group of men, the power of their realms and soul energy making them break out in cold sweat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“God dammit, these two are also in the late stage of the Netherpassage Realm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>These low-ranking martial practitioners of Gold Sun Island instantly became obedient, bowing their heads and softly sighing in dejection. They no longer dared to say anything rash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Powerful martial practitioners of high realms could always intimidate petty peons no matter where they went.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This place was obviously no exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That bastard Qin Lie!” Du Xiangyang swore softly. “He’s up there enjoying himself while we’re down here enduring the putrid air of the bottom level. What a bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Song Tingyu, Xue Moyan, and Xie Jingxuan, who rarely sided against Qin Lie, nodded. All three felt somewhat resentful at the moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even when they were kids, they had never experienced such horrific treatment. Hanging around a bunch of foul-smelling men was bad enough, but there wasn’t even a private washroom on this level. Since this ship lacked proper ventilation, the odor of the Gold Sun Island martial practitioners would waft over them from time to time. Whenever the stench hit their noses, they would be pushed to the verge of vomiting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To make things worse, their clothes were still wet and they didn’t have a place the change. The public washrooms were overcrowded, and the smell of them repulsed the three women before they could even get close.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We should just reveal who we are, have Qin Lie summon the god corpses, slaughter everyone here, and seize these ships for ourselves,” Song Tingyu suddenly exclaimed. She covered her nose, fury filling her voice. “Now… where is that smell coming from again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Xing Wu calmly appeared at the entrance to the bottom level up the ship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Excuse me! Xing Lie said that his three wives are down here and would like them to join him above,” he exclaimed, looking at Song Tingyu, Xie Jingxuan, and Xue Moyan strangely. “Would that be you three?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An odd expression came over Song Tingyu’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Jingxuan and Xue Moyan went still, a trace of annoyance flashing through their bright eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, at any rate, I’m his wife.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Tingyu was the first to state her opinion and even chuckled after doing so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Jingxuan and Xue Moyan looked each other in the eye, and both saw helplessness. In order to escape this hell as soon as possible, they had no choice but to nod in agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mn. All of us are his wives.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
