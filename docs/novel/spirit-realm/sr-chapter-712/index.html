 <p><b>Chapter 712: Who The Hell Do You Think You Are? </b></p>
 <p><span style>Moonstone City. A certain business street filled with stores.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A slightly plump middle-aged early stage Fulfillment Realm martial practitioner crossed his arms and sneered at Qin Lie from the front of a store selling all kinds of crystals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two sides of the street not only had many proper stores that sold all kinds of spirit materials and spirit pills, there were also some one-man stalls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These stalls were selling all kinds of strange spirit materials, special crystals, and ancient spirit artifacts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were plenty of Moonstone City martial practitioners who were choosing their desired items and haggling with the traders before the stalls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the middle-aged martial practitioner’s sneer started, the noisy business street suddenly fell silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many looks of astonishment were directed at Qin Lie and the middle-aged martial practitioner who vocally taunted him. There were plenty of people growing excited, hoping to see the trouble brew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie was standing at the entrance of the street. He was carrying the Ice Phoenix’s true body on his big wide back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Liang’er’s human body had a bit of life and soul consciousness in it. Therefore, it couldn’t be stored inside a spatial ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had no choice but to carry it around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the past few days, he had been carrying Lin Liang’er’s cold body and showing his face all over the stores of Moonstone City in order to buy and store enough spirit materials of the six attributes for the Spirits of Void and Chaos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had attracted a lot of people’s attention since a while ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the past few days, he could hear plenty of whispers and criticisms behind his back while he was purchasing spirit materials.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first person to taunt and ridicule him openly though.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He turned around and faced the martial practitioner who taunted him directly. He said with a heavy tone, “Are you the person in charge of Moonstone City?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That person frowned. “No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s expression abruptly turned cold as he shouted unceremoniously at the man, “Then who the hell do you think you are to meddle with my business?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…” The man was stumped for words for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Beside him, there were two young women about thirty years old dressed in almost the same attire as him. They looked like they belonged to the same force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two women looked at Qin Lie’s with eyes full of disgust. They never stopped whispering about him along the way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they heard Qin Lie’s shout, one of the women bowed her head and spoke in a soft tone, “Senior Brother Zhang, you aren’t afraid of him, are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhang Tian! Do you have nothing to retort against a person like this?” the other woman said coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All three of them came from a Copper rank force called Water Shadow Sword Association.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like Moon Worshipping Palace, Water Shadow Sword Association was also a vassal force to Terminator Sect. However, Prism Continent wasn’t Water Shadow Sword Association’s territory. These three martial practitioners had only come to Prism Continent and Moonstone City because they wanted to buy some spirit materials exclusive to local shops on Water Shadow Sword Association’s behalf.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man named Zhang Tian was the women’s senior brother. He had taunted Qin Lie purely because his junior sisters were disgusted by him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He only did it because he wanted to win their favor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I, I’m not afraid of him.” Zhang Tian felt a conscious lack of confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s eyes after his shout had made Zhang Tian feel a little scared. He suddenly calmed down and realized that there was in fact no need for him to provoke Qin Lie at all. That was why he wanted to stop there and then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhang Tian! Prove it to us if you aren’t afraid of him!” The woman with an awl-shaped faced stared coldly at Qin Lie. “You said nothing wrong. A twisted person like him should stay in the Ruined Lands! He should’ve known that he would be scorned for showing his face in Moonstone City!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you really afraid of him, senior brother?” Another woman looked at him doubtfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Tian’s face was flushed. “Of course not! How could I possibly be afraid of him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he said this, he steeled his determination and circulated a layer of watery light around his body, yelling, “A person like you should have stayed in a dark place like the Ruined Lands and never came to Moonstone City!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A large majority of martial practitioners by the two sides of the streets also disliked Qin Lie, which was why they had echoed the middle-aged martial practitioner’s call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well said! A person like him shouldn’t be in Moonstone City!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the hell is Moon Worshipping Palace thinking? How could they let someone like him stay in Silent Moon? That’s the best lodging in the entire Moonstone City too!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Moon Worshipping Palace cares only about spirit stones and nothing else!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were a few beautiful girls among the people who echoed his calls. Their cries bolstered Zhang Tian’s confidence and momentum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I would advise you to take your… special item and get out of Moonstone City as soon as possible. Stop fouling our appetite already!” Zhang Tian pointed at Qin Lie from afar and waved him away with a sneer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who the hell do you think you are?” Qin Lie broke into an involuntary laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once he said this, he stared straight at Zhang Tian and strode towards him while carrying the Ice Phoenix’s true body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A fierce aura was naturally unleashed from his body. Every onlooker who detected his aura turned pale as they subconsciously opened up a path for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since he left Ling Town, every step he took was accompanied by harsh battles and tides of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Today, the number of martial practitioners who died directly or indirectly by his hands were literally innumerable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was why a violent and bloody aura would flow out of his body involuntarily the moment he, a martial practitioner who had fought many bloody battles, harbored killing intent in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a killing intent that only a person whose hands were completely covered in blood could possess.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were plenty of people with big mouths on the two sides of the street. The moment they detected the thick smell of death on Qin Lie’s body, they wordlessly pulled away from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This let him walk right up to Zhang Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you just tell me to get out of Moonstone City? I’m sorry, I couldn’t hear you properly. Do you mind repeating yourself once more?” Qin Lie suddenly shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…” Zhang Tian stuttered as a hint of fear appeared in his eyes. He actually couldn’t form words in his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Scarlet color appeared inside his pupils.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A new wave of blood stench surged towards the trio with him at the center.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhang Tian and the two Water Shadow Sword Association women turned pale the moment they were struck by the stench of blood. Even their lips were trembling uncontrollably.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be careful when you open your mouth next time, and make sure that your opponent is someone you can provoke before you decide to show off your abilities.” Qin Lie cast a glance at the two women that could only be called pretty at best and taunted, “In my opinion, it is very much not worth it to lose your life over two average women.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He waited for a while after throwing down this line. He finally passed by them after he saw that none of them dared to speak up to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second he went away, Zhang Tian shuddered and ran away from the street like he was escaping without waiting for the two women.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two Water Shadow Sword Association women gritted their teeth and shot a glare at Qin Lie’s back. Then, they too, left hastily with red faces under everyone’s odd gazes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie continued to stroll through the streets buying all kinds of spirit materials of the six attributes with a casual expression on his face. It was as if nothing had ever happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The innumerable number of martial practitioners on the streets couldn’t suppress the hint of fear in their eyes when they looked at Qin Lie again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The criticisms targeted at him had also lessened somewhat. It was as if many people had turned into mutes all of a sudden.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On that evening, he returned to “Silent Moon” after his spirit material shopping and discovered that the martial practitioners staying inside “Silent Moon” had tempered the looks that they were shooting at him by a lot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yao Tian, the spirit beast flesh you’ve asked me to process has been prepared.” Lu Kun appeared on his way back to his stone tower and smiled at him. He returned him his spatial ring and added, “Just give me another ten thousand Earth Grade spirit stones, and we’re done.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie accepted the spatial ring and probed it with his mind consciousness. He discovered that the spatial ring now contained all kinds of glass utensils specifically used to hold all kinds of meat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Spirit beast meat inside was categorized by rank at different locations in an orderly fashion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He casually took out a dried Rank Four Silver Armored Giant Alligator meat from the spatial ring and discovered that it had been smoked. It actually tasted quite good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He randomly took out a few more pieces of meat and discovered that they all tasted good. This quality of work far exceeded his expectations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it?” Lu Kun smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good, very good.” Qin Lie nodded and was about to pay Lu Kun the spirit stones he deserved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need for haste.” Lu Kun waved his hand once and pondered for a moment. Then, he said in a low voice, “Can we talk somewhere else?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie looked slightly surprised by this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While holding the spatial ring that was filled with cooked meat, he hesitated for a moment before he finally nodded. “Alright.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please, this way.” Lu Kun’s eyes lit up, and he actually led him personally towards the most secluded stone towers at the back of “Silent Moon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie quietly followed behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A while later, Lu Kun led him to a beautiful-looking hall inside a stone tower and said respectfully to a person sitting on a high seat, “This is the person you wished to meet, palace master.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Palace master?” A thought flashed across Qin Lie’s mind, and he looked up to that person and asked tentatively, “The palace master of Moon Worshipping Palace?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is I!” Dong Wanzhai said proudly and impressively from his seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dong Wanzhai was almost two meters tall, so he looked like an iron tower even when he was seated. He had thick eyebrows and big eyes, and he was dressed in a silvery white martial practitioner robe. His long robe was adorned with a picture of a cold moon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are you from?” Dong Wanzhai asked casually.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want from me?” Qin Lie countered with a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yao Tian, this man here is our palace master. Please be more respectful,” Lu Kun reminded him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It doesn’t matter what his attitude is. What’s important is that he can help us.” Dong Wanzhai waved down Lu Kun and asked suddenly with narrowed eyes, “Did you come from the Setting Sun Islands, kid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s heart tightened. He thought that his identity was exposed, “You know me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One of my subordinates noticed you. I hadn’t known your identity before, and it is only after you’d clashed against Water Shadow Sword Association that I noticed some signs,” Dong Wanzhai said solemnly. “Your presence is unusual. I believe that you are a disciple of Blood Fiend Sect, am I right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are correct,” Qin Lie admittedly openly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He supposed that he had thought too much. He thought that Blood Fiend Sect and Terminator Sect had gotten anxious and were searching for him after he went missing for a whole year. He had thought that he had slipped up and exposed his true identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But no, it was just the small matter of him accidentally exposing Blood Spirit Art’s aura when he used his aura to suppress Zhang Tian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll speak frankly.” Dong Wanzhai sat up straight. “From what I heard, Blood Fiend Sect is currently selling Blazing Profound Bombs to the outside world. Moon Worshipping Palace wishes to buy some of these artifacts from Blood Fiend Sect, and we will follow the market price that you have set. We hope that you can be the mediator of this trade.”</span></p>
