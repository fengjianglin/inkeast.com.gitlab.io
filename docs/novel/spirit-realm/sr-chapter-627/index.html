 <p><b>Chapter 627: Blood Fiend Ten Elders!</b></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother Xiang, when you were robbing Heavenly Sea Pavilion, did you get harassed by Blue Moon Valley?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Yuyuan and the five enforcers had gathered in a large hall on the island. He immediately asked such after the departure of non-related people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie narrowed his eyes and looked at Xiang Xi. He said, “Blue Moon Valley wouldn’t spare Heavenly Sea Pavilion, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course not!” Xiang Xi’s face turned dark. “Miao Kang, Third Valley Master of the Miao Family, led the members of the Miao Family to promptly appear after we conquered Heavenly Sea Pavilion. They wanted us to put down all of the spirit materials and then leave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a coincidence! It’s the same on our side!” Xing Yuyuan snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fortunately, there was Elder Meng Feng and two experts from Blood Fiend Sect. Otherwise, we would’ve been heavily wounded by Miao Kang!” Xiang Xi’s eyes were cold as he explained what had occurred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The situation was extremely similar to what Qin Lie and the others had experienced. When Xiang Xi and the others just took down Heavenly Sea Pavilion and were taking the spirit materials and stones, martial practitioners under the leadership of Miao Kang suddenly appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miao Kang’s orders were the same as Miao Wenfan’s. He wanted Xiang Xi and the others to give up everything they had and docilely leave. Only then would Miao Kang have mercy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Compared to Xing Yuyuan, Xiang Xi’s temper was more fiery. He didn’t even consider the consequences, and immediately ordered an attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Miao Kang, who was in the late stages of Fragmentation Realm, was about to kill Xiang Xi and Meng Feng, Blood Fiend Sect’s Nirvana expert appeared. He immediately wounded Miao Kang, forcing Miao Kang to retreat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The result was that Miao Kang and the martial practitioners of Blue Moon Valley left dispiritedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Before Miao Kang left, he threatened us that in three months’ time, the Miao Family will possess all of Gold Sun Island!” Xu Changsheng’s expression was grave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If we cannot persevere under the attacks of Black Voodoo Cult and the three families, Miao Kang’s threat... may become reality.” Xu Jiadong sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A shadow came onto everyone’s faces as their expressions gradually became grave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blue Moon Valley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miao Wenfan and Miao Kang had led the armies of the Miao Family only to return from Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion in defeat. Both of them had dispirited expressions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, the five great valley masters gathered together, each with downcast faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blood Fiend Sect actually sent their new generation of the ‘Blood Fiend Ten Elders’ Hong Bowen and Meng Feng!” Miao Yangxu shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Blood Fiend Ten Elders were the strongest ten people below the sect master of Blood Fiend Sect. Almost all of the old generation of the Blood Fiend Ten Elders had died in the battle a thousand years ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rumor was that at least five of the Blood Fiend Ten Elders from a thousand years ago were in the Imperishable Realm and the remaining were at the peak of the Nirvana Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that time, Blood Fiend Sect still dominated the Heavenly Calamity Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Up until now, Blood Fiend Sect might have chosen their new Blood Fiend Ten Elders but this new generation did not have a single person at the peak of the Nirvana Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The present Blood Fiend Ten Elders were far from the ones of the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, even though experts in the Nirvana Realm were unable to fight against powerful Silver forces, they still had a clear advantage against Copper rank forces like Blue Moon Valley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Black Voodoo Cult and the three families are clearly about to attack the Setting Sun Islands. Why isn’t Blood Fiend Sect resting, why are they helping Gold Sun Island clean out Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion?!” Miao Wenfan did not understand. “Also, we are affiliated with Illusory Demon Sect. Isn’t Blood Fiend Sect afraid of attracting the displeasure of Illusory Demon Sect by doing this?! At this time, if Blood Fiend Sect made an enemy of Illusory Demon Sect, how would they fight Black Voodoo Cult and the three families?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The five valley masters of the Miao Family had meticulously planned before &nbsp;they decided to move against Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because the five thought that Blood Fiend Sect did not have the ability to split themselves, &nbsp;would consider the existence of Illusory Demon Sect, and would not interfere in the actions of Blue Moon Valley. This was why they had dared to be so arrogant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had not expected Blood Fiend Sect to be so unaware of the larger picture and interfere in Blue Moon Valley’s invasion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think… we may have missed something,” Fifth Valley Master Miao Zunsheng said thoughtfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The others looked instinctively towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the past, Blood Fiend Sect was rich. They would not even think anything of the wealth of Copper forces like Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion,” Miao Zunsheng explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yet after being pursued by Black Voodoo Cult and the three families for a thousand years, after a silence of more than a thousand years, Blood Fiend Sect, after not having any income, has used up all of their savings.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They are too poor. This caused the wealth of Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion that they dismissed before to become riches in their eyes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s very normal to take risks for spirit materials!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the words were said, the five valley masters of Blue Moon Valley felt as though a veil had been lifted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miao Zunsheng’s speculation was close to the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, on the island that Qin Lie renamed “Flaming Sun,” Mo Jun and the other nine Blood Fiend Elders were constructing a teleportation formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Through cleaning out Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion, we have finally gathered the required materials to make the teleportation formation.” A smile from the heart appeared on Hong Bowen’s chubby face. “After a thousand years, Blood Fiend Sect has become poor. In these thousand years, all of the spirit materials, spirit stones, and crystal pieces that we took from the sect have been used up. If we didn’t steal from Heavenly Sea Pavilion and Black Cloud Palace to get some more wealth, we would not be able to even continue our cultivation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the old people had faces full of bitterness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In front of Mo Jun was a teleportation formation five meters wide, and formed in a circle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Spirit materials like the Phantasm Stone, Froststar Stone, Fate Crystal, Ethereal Jade, the fresh blood of a Scarlet Spirit Turtle, and more were the things that Qin Lie had gathered and given to Xue Li before heading to the Graveyard of Gods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Phantasm Stone, Froststar Stone, Fate Crystal, and Ethereal Jade formed a round platform after being forged, and the blood of the Scarlet Spirit Turtle was the ink that was needed to inscribe the teleportation formation diagram.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, the materials that Xue Li had Qin Lie had gathered were only the main ingredients for the teleportation formation. The other supporting materials were things that Blood Fiend Sect should have had plenty of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had originally thought that if he found the people from Blood Fiend Sect, they would have enough of the supporting materials. He hadn’t thought that after a thousand years, all of Blood Fiend Sect’s spirit materials would have been used up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This caused Mo Jun to stop in the middle of constructing the teleportation formation towards the ultimate blood ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only after Hong Bowen and Meng Feng came back from Heavenly Sea Pavilion and Black Cloud Palace did they finally gather all the materials they lacked from Xing Yuyuan and Xiang Xi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, it really is embarrassing now that you mention it. These main materials had been gathered by Qin Lie in the Scarlet Tide Continent before.” Mo Jun couldn’t help but lament when he was inscribing in following steps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The boy that Big Brother Xue chose... isn’t bad!” Hong Bowen suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This boy is extraordinary!” Mo Jun praised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other eight Blood Fiend Ten Elders also spoke up in praise. They respected Qin Lie for being able to stand against the temptation of the body of the Blood Progenitor and giving up on the seven-level Soul Altar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However... his cultivation is heterogenous, and Blood Spirit Art is only one of those.” Meng Feng’s body was thin, his expression dark. He said, “Also, he has not truly taken Big Brother Xue as his teacher. While he cultivates the Blood Spirit Art, he cannot be considered an orthodox member of Blood Fiend Sect. I’m worried, in the future... he will not work for Blood Fiend Sect with all of his mind and heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry.” Mo Jun snickered. He said, “I think that Big Brother Xue seems to want to match him to Moyan. If he and Moyan get together, no matter what, he will not be able to get away from Blood Fiend Sect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the words were said, the eyes of the other nine lit up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That boy is a playboy. He clearly has something with that Song girl, and that female artificer. I heard... he also has a fiancée.” Meng Feng became worried again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, with Moyan’s background, beauty, talent, and strength, she will definitely be his first choice!” Mo Jun was full of confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone thought and then nodded inwardly. They all felt that they were thinking too much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>At another corner of Flaming Sun Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie was secluded in a silent cultivation room as he continued to inscribe the Soul Sealing diagram on spirit tablets. He calmed his mind, cleansed his True Soul, and nurtured his soul power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Around his feet, there were ruined spirit tablets scattered around, many of them black and burnt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A layer of glowing white light suddenly came out of the spirit tablet in his hand. It illuminated the slightly dim room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s eyes widened, excited as he shouted happily, “Success!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After more than ten days of experimenting and repeated study, he finally constructed the first Soul Sealing diagram on the spirit tablet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Holding that spirit tablet in his hand and carefully examining it, Qin Lie relaxed slightly. Just as he was about to make another in order to reinforce his results, he heard the shout of Hu Yun from outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie walked out of the cultivation room and opened the stone door. He asked, “What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Qin, Second Island Master sent me to deliver this.” Hu Yun handed two spatial rings to Qin Lie with a chuckle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After taking it, Qin Lie immediately used his consciousness to see what was inside and his eyes lit up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the two rings were large amounts of thunder, metal, wood, fire, water, and earth spirit materials, wooden materials, and medicinal herbs. He made a rough estimate and knew that the spirit materials within the two spatial rings were about seventy or eighty thousand Earth Grade spirit stones in value.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Spirits of Void and Chaos were not picky. As long as it was spirit materials of the same type, they could absorb and digest stones, crystals, wood, or medicinal herbs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With these two spatial rings, he did not need to worry about the Spirits of Void and Chaos in the short term.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank Second Island Master for me,” Qin Lie said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hu Yun respectfully left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Returning to the room, Qin Lie tried to summon the three Spirits of Void and Chaos mentally. He quickly got a response from inside the Soul Suppressing Orb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon, the three Spirits of Void and Chaos flew out happily. Seeing the spirit stones, crystals, and wood piled in the room, they immediately gave squealing cheers and started eating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A long time later, the three little things were full and played in circles around Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Spirit of Void and Chaos shaped like the Fire Qilin found that spirit tablet carved with “Soul Sealing” when it was stepping around and entered it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A clear diagram of the Fire Qilin appeared on the surface of the spirit tablet. Wisps of fiery surging flames eerily rose from the spirit tablet and grew even stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s eyes showed joyful surprise after a moment of pause and intently stared at the spirit tablet.</span></p>
