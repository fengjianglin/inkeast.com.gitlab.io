 <p><b>Chapter 584: Inside Job</b></p>
 <p><span style>Within a freezing hidden room built out of ice jade crystals, a giant blood cocoon hung in midair. Numerous blood vessels and muscle tissue ran from the walls of that vast room to that cocoon, holding it aloft and making it resemble a heart. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wisps of spirit energy and blood energy constantly flowed through the blood vessels and into the blood cocoon, maintaining Mo Lingye’s life force. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Li’s soul quietly floated beside the blood cocoon like a ball of sanguine flame.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dozen or so martial practitioners in long, red robes also stood within the hidden room. All of them sighed softly as they watched Xue Li’s soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of them looked extremely similar to Mo Bei, the young man that Qin Lie and Xue Li had met at the Blood Cloud Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was none other than Mo Bei’s father, Mo Jun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sect master...” Mo Jun called out softly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I haven’t been Blood Fiend Sect’s sect master for a long, long time.” Xue Li shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Big Brother Xue,” Mo Jun said. “The madam is currently in a precarious position. If her life force can’t be replenished with the Spring of Life, she might not be able to hold out for more than three years.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He sighed deeply. “This is all our fault. We’ve been useless for the past thousand years, only living as if we were encumbered by chains, not bothering to try and revive Blood Fiend Sect. If we were the Blood Fiend Sect of a thousand years ago, we would’ve gotten something as cheap as the Spring of Life a long time ago. Look at how powerless we are now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rest of the Blood Fiend Sect elders within the room bowed their heads in shame.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been over a thousand years, but none of them, none of the members of Blood Fiend Sect that had escaped from the Blood Cloud Mountain Range, were able to rebuild the sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, they didn’t even dare to reveal themselves to the outside world because of Black Voodoo Cult’s and the three great families’ relentless ongoing hunt. They could only hide in the shadows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“None of you are at fault.” Xue Li’s bloody eyes shone with pain. “If anyone deserves blame… it would be me! I was the one who wasn’t careful enough. I gave Jiang Zhuzhe the opportunity to capture me and wound me greatly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone else hung their heads in sorrow. </span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Xue Li’s eyes burned with hope. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Has there been any news from the Graveyard of Gods?” he asked. “Qin Lie is in the Graveyard of Gods with… her. I heard that the Spring of Life could be in there. They may yet succeed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Li had placed all of his hopes on Qin Lie and his daughter. He hoped that they’d be able to obtain the Spring of Life from the Graveyard of Gods, enough of it to help both Xue Moyan and Mo Lingye escape their predicament.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We haven’t received any news,” Mo Jun forced himself to answer. “I’ve only heard… that the Graveyard of Gods completely collapsed and almost all of the Trial participants perished. Only the remains of ancient elites, which are unfathomably tough, were able to endure the shock waves of the spatial collapse and escape.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That can’t be,” Xue Li said and began to constantly reassure himself. “Qin Lie won’t die. He won’t! He’ll definitely escape the Graveyard of Gods with Xue Moyan! That kid is extraordinary. He can do it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Jun and the others looked at him, their eyes filled with sympathy, and sighed inwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them pitied Xue Li’s family. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Li had been imprisoned for a thousand years, but even after he managed to escape from his confinement, Jiang Zhuzhe refined his body and half of his soul. In addition to that, his daughter was born with an extremely short lifespan. His wife was in a coma and her soul consciousness was now so weak that she couldn’t communicate with the world outside of the blood cocoon. Her life was like a candle flame on the verge of being extinguished by the wind. It could go out at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tragedy that befell this family was as heartbreaking as one could imagine. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Jun and the others didn’t think that Qin Lie, a person they’d never heard of before, a person that Xue Li had high hopes for, could change this family’s fate. </span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them assumed that Xue Li simply didn’t wish to accept the fact that his daughter had died in the Graveyard of Gods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know you don’t believe it, but I do!” Xue Li exclaimed softly. “I’ve known Qin Lie for a long time. I understand him. He isn’t normal, and he holds many secrets I cannot begin to fathom. He’ll definitely exit the Graveyard of Gods with Moyan and bring new hope to Blood Fiend Sect!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Jun and the others shook their heads and exchanged bitter smiles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They simply couldn’t believe his words from the bottom of their hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They no longer thought that Blood Fiend Sect had a future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They believed that it was their destiny to hide in the shadows, living as if burdened by chains. </span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Day changed to evening, and the Flowing Gold Fire Phoenix of the Xing brothers hovered above the five ships of Gold Sun Island. Xing Yumiao and Xing Yuyuan descended to the deck of the Wavebreaker as Xing Shengnan, Xing Yao, several other Xing Family clansmen, and Gold Sun Island martial practitioners came out to greet them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big brother. Second brother. Where is Xing Lie?” Xing Shengnan asked the moment she saw them. “Why have we not seen the fire phoenix of the enforcers yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We will be arriving at the Setting Sun Islands in two days,” Xing Yao said, clearly more concerned about something else. “Xiang Xi, the three enforcers with him, and their islands envoys have always managed those islands. Shouldn’t we be more vigilant?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Yumiao and Xing Yuyuan glanced at each other, bitter expressions on their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since they confirmed that Qin Lie was Forefather Terminator’s direct disciple, both brothers had been wracked with headaches. They weren’t able to come up with a plan capable of dealing with Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s fine,” Xing Yuyuan said with a smile. “Today’s the day we’ll be speaking with them. They should be arriving soon enough.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to the spies he had planted in the midst of Xiang Xi’s men, Xing Yuyuan knew that Qin Lie’s group of seven was fine. He also knew that Xiang Xi and his men didn’t dare to act recklessly after discovering Qin Lie’s other identity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Yuyuan was even more aware of the fact that Xiang Xi and Qin Lie seemed to be getting along quite well. In fact, they now appeared to be rather close to one another.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This made the Xing brothers grow increasingly worried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Xiang Xi’s men successfully pulled Qin Lie to their side, how were they supposed to treat him, a Blood Fiend Sect disciple that had the support of Forefather Terminator? </span></p>
 <p><span style>This matter left the two brothers at a loss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They are here!” Guo Yanzheng exclaimed softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he did, a bright, beautiful Flowing Gold Fire Phoenix and the same type of flying spirit artifact that looked as though it had weathered a storm flew over at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then a small crystalline war chariot rumbled from a distance, descending through the air and approaching the ships.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The chariot carried Xiang Xi, Bo Boze, and Qin Lie, all of whom were standing shoulder to shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiang Xi and Qin Lie chatted with each other cheerfully. They looked incredibly close to each other, as if they’d been friends for countless years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The members of the Xing Family on the deck exchanged glances, their expressions becoming grim.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How utterly shameless!” Xing Yao yelled harshly. “He’s just as bad as the rest of them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Astonishment filled Xing Shengnan’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When did little brother become such good friends with chief enforcer?” she asked with a frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had no idea that Xiang Xi and the others had long since been planning a rebellion, but she did know that the relationship between them and her brothers wasn’t nearly as amicable as it seemed. She herself disliked Xiang Xi from the bottom of her heart, so when she saw that Qin Lie had become friendly with Xiang Xi, she immediately assumed that he had been fooled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She thought about finding an opportunity to warn Qin Lie so Xiang Xi couldn’t continue fooling him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Enforcers Guo Yanzhen and Qi Jing, as well as many other martial practitioners on the ship, were trusted servants of the Xing Family. All of them knew about the relationship between the Xing Family and Xiang Xi’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In light of this, their faces twisted into ugly expressions the moment they saw Qin Lie and Xiang Xi standing side by side and laughing loudly together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Words couldn’t even begin to describe the frowns on the faces of Xing Yumiao and Xing Yuyuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The brothers mistakenly thought that Qin Lie was a direct disciple of Forefather Terminator. When they saw Xiang Xi being so friendly with Qin Lie, they immediately assumed the worst—</span></p>
 <p><span style>—that Xiang Xi and Qin Lie were on the same side!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Xing brothers immediately believed that the situation had become several times more complicated than before. Dealing with Xiang Xi was no longer a simple matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the crystalline war chariot approached the ship, Xiang Xi immediately laughed loudly and struck the Xing brothers with a low blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha, I see! Someone of my temperament truly has many things in common with Xing Lie,” he shouted. “Many thanks, first and second island masters! Thank you for sending Xing Lie to my side. If you hadn’t, I wouldn’t have had the chance to get to know a young genius who understands me. Hahaha!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The faces of the Xing brothers became even uglier than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie inwardly sneered as he stood atop the crystalline war chariot and looked down on Xing Yumiao and Xing Yuyuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew exactly what the Xing brothers had been planning when they sent his group to Xiang Xi’s Flowing Gold Fire Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had hoped to use Xiang Xi as an instrument of murder to get rid of him. This way, Qin Lie wouldn’t be around to hurt Xing Shengnan, and they’d be able to easily justify their actions if Blood Fiend Sect came looking for answers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiang Xi took the initiative to ask, “Would you like to speak with your clansmen, Brother Xing Lie?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need for that. I wouldn’t have anything important to say to them anyway.” Qin Lie shook his head, then looked at Xing Shengnan from afar. As seriously and sincerely as he could, he said, “You don’t have to worry about me, big sister. I’m fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw Xing Shengnan open her mouth to speak, Qin Lie cut her off, saying, “We can talk once we return to Gold Sun Island. I’ll explain everything then.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Yumiao, on the other hand, spoke with a heavy voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come down here, little brother!” he called out. “There’s something we need to discuss!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the current situation required it, even though the title was false, this was the first time he referred to Qin Lie as little brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Yumiao finally gave Qin Lie the attention that he deserved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few days ago, he had simply stood outside of Qin Lie’s door and couldn’t be bothered to enter his room. He even went as far as threatening Qin Lie, warning him to disappear before they reached Gold Sun Island or be killed without question!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hadn’t given Qin Lie any chance to explain himself! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Yumiao did that because he believed that the current Blood Fiend Sect couldn’t get him to truly submit. He no longer held Blood Fiend Sect in high regard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In much the same way, he believed that Qin Lie didn’t deserve his respect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet… things were different now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie now had Forefather Terminator and Terminator Sect looming behind him like a terrifying shadow. Xing Yumiao had no choice but to reconsider his opinion of Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie stared at Xing Yumiao, an almost imperceptible sneer playing at the corner of his lips. He thought that having a powerful backer and a mighty force was more important than anything else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even now, he understood that Xing Yumiao didn’t care about him at all. What he cared about was the non-existent Forefather Terminator behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll talk once we return to Gold Sun Island. I’m just here to see big sister,” Qin Lie answered with a casual smile. He didn’t refer to Xing Yumiao as his big brother. Then he turned to Xiang Xi and said, “I’m tired. Let’s go back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First island master. Second island master. Third island master. Cultivating for the past two days has left Xing Lie tired, so… we’ll be leaving for now,” Xiang Xi said as if mediating the conversation and chuckled. He then quietly ordered his men to leave without bothering to have the crystalline war ship land on the deck of the ship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiang Xi had obviously grown bolder after becoming certain that Qin Lie was Forefather Terminator’s direct disciple. This was why he dared to openly defy Xing Yumiao even though they had yet to properly end the conversation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every Xing Family clansman wore an ashen expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone could clearly see that Qin Lie had gone against Xing Yumiao’s instructions. He obviously didn’t think of himself as a Xing Family clansman or consider Xing Yumiao his big brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Other than Xing Shengnan, whom he showed real concern for and actually deferred to her as her little brother, he treated everyone else with indifference that might as well have been arrogance! </span></p>
 <p><span style>None of the Xing Family clansmen could understand or tolerate his behavior.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Where in Spirit Realm did he get the nerve to behave in such a way?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This kid’s gone crazy, hasn’t he? His surname is Xing! Why is he at Xiang Xi’s side?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a blind fool. He has no idea where he belongs!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think he’s even more arrogant than Xiang Xi! How dare he not listen even to the first island master! How utterly shameless!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Xing Family clansmen and the other martial practitioners who cared about the Xing Family scolded Qin Lie with righteous indignation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them thought that Xing Yumiao would immediately punish him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, surprisingly enough, Xing Yumiao neither spoke up nor attacked Qin Lie in any way. He simply wore an ugly expression on his face and maintained his silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only Xing Yuyuan understood why his big brother didn’t act.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Yumiao had to tolerate Qin Lie’s insolence because he believed that Forefather Terminator loomed behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
