 <p><strong>Chapter 547: Shatter</strong></p>
 <p>Qin Lie’s True Soul entered the Blood Progenitor’s mind.</p>
 <p>While the Demon Sealing Tombstone worked to intimidate and suppress Jiang Zhuzhe, Qin Lie was examining the sanguine soul pagoda within the Blood Progenitor’s sea of consciousness.</p>
 <p>The seven-level soul pagoda quietly sat on the surface of the boundless sea of blood. It resembled a majestic mountain glowing with dazzling bloody light.</p>
 <p>“A soul pagoda?”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie’s soul materialized into an indistinct, floating silhouette that slowly made its way to the top of the pagoda.</p>
 <p>A bloody bone fragment could be seen floating atop the pagoda. The moment Qin Lie’s soul flew up to it, the bloody threads of light spread throughout all of the Blood Progenitor’s sea of consciousness lit up.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a powerful force of attraction erupted from the top of the soul pagoda, and Qin Lie’s soul miraculously entered it like a fish diving into the sea.</p>
 <p>A miraculous feeling instantly came over him, one in which he shared an unfathomable intimate connection with the Blood Progenitor’s body. However, his soul energy was also depleting at a ridiculously fast rate!</p>
 <p>It was as if he had put on a precious blood treasure—he could unleash its might, but he would rapidly exhaust his blood energy in order to do so.</p>
 <p>“Boom!”</p>
 <p>The Blood Progenitor’s eyes, which had been closed all this time, opened, glittering with bloody light.</p>
 <p>Within them… Qin Lie’s expression took shape.</p>
 <p>With his soul inside of the Blood Progenitor’s soul pagoda, Qin Lie took control of the Blood Progenitor’s body and appeared to the world as the Blood Progenitor himself.</p>
 <p>Just like how the Viridian Blood Toad, the first voodoo creature, controlled the Voodoo Progenitor’s body.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie could feel his soul energy swiftly depleting and see his own body sitting in front of him, lifeless..</p>
 <p>This made him feel incredibly strange.</p>
 <p>He attempted to channel the Blood Spirit Art.</p>
 <p>Seemingly endless wisps of blood energy, so refined and potent that they felt stifling, began surging out of the sea of blood within the Blood Progenitor’s dantian.</p>
 <p>“Fwoosh!”</p>
 <p>Like a viscous river of blood, a lengthy bloody light suddenly wrapped around Qin Lie’s actual body.</p>
 <p>The river of blood flowed toward Song Tingyu and the others like a bloody rainbow. As it did, Qin Lie yelled in a hoarse voice.</p>
 <p>“Watch over my body for me!”</p>
 <p>All of them were stunned.</p>
 <p>They stared at the Blood Progenitor with shock, anxiety, and confusion in their eyes.</p>
 <p>They had no idea what in Spirit Realm was going on.</p>
 <p>“The Blood Progenitor… he opened his eyes and spoke? H-he told us to watch over Qin Lie’s body?” Pan Qianqian exclaimed, covering her mouth in shock. “What’s wrong with Qin Lie?”</p>
 <p>“The Blood Progenitor woke up?” Du Xiangyang trembled.</p>
 <p>“No! That isn’t the Blood Progenitor!” Xue Moyan blurted out, shaking with realization. “That’s Qin Lie! His soul has taken control of the Blood Progenitor’s body!”</p>
 <p>“What!?” Song Tingyu cried. “Qin Lie… is currently the Blood Progenitor?”</p>
 <p>“It’s Qin Lie!” Xue Moyan said confidently. “Just like how the ice spirit took over Jia Yue and the Viridian Blood Toad controls the Voodoo Progenitor’s body, Qin Lie is inside of the Blood Progenitor’s body right now!”</p>
 <p>“That’s correct,” Qin Lie exclaimed through the Blood Progenitor’s body. “I’m Qin Lie. Watch over my body!”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, the bloody rainbow gently delivered Qin Lie’s actual body to them.</p>
 <p>Still in a sitting position, it landed in front of Song Tingyu. Aside from the fact that no soul fluctuations could be sensed from it, it looked perfectly normal.</p>
 <p>This astounded Song Tingyu, and she hurriedly pulled Qin Lie’s body into her embrace. She enveloped it with her shield of light and kept a close eye on it.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the bewildered gazes of the rest of the group were locked on to the Blood Progenitor’s body.</p>
 <p>“Swoosh swoosh swoosh!”</p>
 <p>Seven godly chains whipped through the air, repeatedly striking Jiang Zhuzhe like serpentine dragons or enormous pythons.</p>
 <p>Having transformed into a demon, Jiang Zhuzhe executed exquisite, earth-shakingly powerful secret arts of Blood Fiend Sect, constantly struggling and retaliating against the godly chains of light. Bloody lights shot from his body and rocketed into the sky.</p>
 <p>Countless runes poured down onto Jiang Zhuzhe’s body, continuously channeling the Demon Sealing Tombstone’s terrifying restrictive power onto him.</p>
 <p>However, it wasn’t enough to silence and bind him. He seemed a lot stronger than any of the seven spirits had been.</p>
 <p>“Boom boom boom! Bang bang bang!”</p>
 <p>The Graveyard of Gods continued to violently collapse as the Demon Sealing Tombstone went on its sealing rampage. Terrifying spatial rifts could be seen in the depths of the dark, gray clouds in the sky. Beautiful flowing lights of spatial energy shone from inside of them.</p>
 <p>Seven types of potent spirit energy surged out of the fissures that kept tearing open the earth. The icy mountains in the surroundings fell apart one after another.</p>
 <p>It was clear to everyone that since six of the seven spirits had been sealed and the six forbidden lands continued to explode, the Graveyard of Gods would soon cease to exist.</p>
 <p>“Bloodthirsty Dragon!”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie’s roar suddenly resounded from deep within the cold, desolate plain. The Bloodthirsty Dragon suddenly materialized in a burst of fiendish blood aura.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie, in the Blood Progenitor’s body, sat atop the bloody bone dragon’s head as it howled and charged at Jiang Zhuzhe, a turbulent sea of blood taking shape around it.</p>
 <p>“Blublublub!”</p>
 <p>Bloody lights quickly shot from that bubbling sea of blood, flying high up into the air. It seemed as if thousands of bloody dragons had charged out of a bloody abyss, biting and clawing toward Jiang Zhuzhe.</p>
 <p>Inhabiting the Blood Progenitor’s body, Qin Lie pulled at the air with both hands and conjured countless bloody lights, sending them flying downward like cutting blades.</p>
 <p>“Zzzt zzzt zzzt!”</p>
 <p>The surroundings grew more and more volatile as starlight gushed from bloody spatial tears that Qin Lie suddenly created.</p>
 <p>A terrifying, fiendish bloody claw as large as a mountain grasped at Jiang Zhuzhe..</p>
 <p>The Demon Sealing Tombstone seized the opportunity to shoot multiple dazzling godly lights down at almost the exact same time.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie and the tombstone seemed to have an unspoken mutual understanding, acting in tandem to kill Jiang Zhuzhe as soon as possible!</p>
 <p>“Aaooooooooo!”</p>
 <p>Jiang Zhuzhe released an inhuman howl, every bone in his body beginning to break with resounding cracks. A giant bloody shadow filled with insanity, bloodlust, and the desire to destroy and wreak havoc emerged from Jiang Zhuzhe’s body and roared toward the sky. It exuded an aura that made it seem capable of ravaging the world.</p>
 <p>This towering blood demon was the culmination of a thousand years of malevolent emotions, all of which belonged to the countless people whose blood Jiang Zhuzhe had devoured.</p>
 <p>This was the physical manifestation of Jiang Zhuzhe’s inner demon, the source of his recurring bouts of insanity. This was the evil blood spirit that could take over Jiang Zhuzhe.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie’s attack and the Demon Sealing Tombstone’s sealing power surged to heights reminiscent of gigantic mountains, striking this blood demon that gave off an evil aura that reached the sky.</p>
 <p>The towering figure of the blood demon ceaselessly struggled, letting out roars that threatened to tear the sky and the earth to pieces. It used its terrifying, destructive blood aura to resist the attacks. Despite the combined efforts of Qin Lie and the Demon Sealing Tombstone, the blood demon would not be easily subdued.</p>
 <p>“Jiang Zhuzhe truly is powerful,” Xue Moyan said with a grave expression. “His body hid that blood demon, the physical manifestation of the unyielding emotions of the countless victims that died by his hand. If Jiang Zhuzhe were to completely perfect that blood demon in the future, who knows how powerful he could become?”</p>
 <p>“Phweeeeeeeeee!”</p>
 <p>A sharp, earsplitting whistle resonated from the Viridian Blood Toad. In the next instant, the body of the Voodoo Progenitor, which had been hiding until now, charged toward the Demon Sealing Tombstone in the form of pitch black light surrounded by waves of toxic miasma.</p>
 <p>In this critical moment, the Viridian Blood Toad attacked the Demon Sealing Tombstone it so desperately hated.</p>
 <p>“Krik… kr-krak!”</p>
 <p>At nearly the same time, a power of absolute frost also appeared in the Land of Buried Gods. A series of strange cracking noises accompanied streams of frost that surged into the open, threatening to freeze space itself.</p>
 <p>The spatial rifts that Qin Lie had created using the body of the Blood Progenitor were instantly reduced to strange strips of ice, suspended in midair like thin, long icicles.</p>
 <p>Another icy power, both white and vast, suddenly gathered toward the body of the Blood Progenitor.</p>
 <p>Streams of frost invaded the sea of blood formed from the fiendish blood aura of the bloody bone dragon, forcing it to quickly freeze over.</p>
 <p>The ice spirit attacked from the shadows as well!</p>
 <p>Jiang Zhuzhe, the Viridian Blood Toad, and the ice spirit joined forces to resist Qin Lie and the Demon Sealing Tombstone. All three unleashed their power at the same time, intent on shattering the Demon Sealing Tombstone’s restrictive power and its control over the Graveyard of Gods.</p>
 <p>“Boom boom boom!”</p>
 <p>Thunderclaps reverberated through the air, and numerous ruined palaces in the Land of Buried Gods crumbled in succession.</p>
 <p>The Demon Sealing Tombstone was slowly losing its grasp on the Graveyard of Gods.</p>
 <p>The Viridian Blood Toad unleashed another sharp whistle, using the Voodoo Progenitor’s body to cover the Demon Sealing Tombstone’s godly light with its ink-black toxic miasma.</p>
 <p>The ice spirit’s power of frost made the sea of blood beneath the Blood Progenitor’s body freeze over and forced the Blood Spirit Art that Qin Lie executed to become extremely weak.</p>
 <p>“Zzzt zzzt zzzt!”</p>
 <p>Long and narrow spatial rifts appeared in the air one after another, visible cracks appearing all throughout the Graveyard of Gods like a breaking mirror.</p>
 <p>Everyone could see that with this shocking battle, the space that made up the Graveyard of Gods was on the verge of shattering.</p>
 <p>All of the martial practitioners who were still inside of the Graveyard of Gods feared for their lives. They looked to the sky, despair filling their eyes.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh whoosh whoosh!”</p>
 <p>The godly lights shooting from the Demon Sealing Tombstone suddenly changed their target, striking the bodies of the ancient elites that lay around it.</p>
 <p>All of the enormous corpses touched by the godly lights instantly turned into streams of energy that the tombstone extracted. The corpses then dissolved into dust.</p>
 <p>The Demon Sealing Tombstone was extracting the remaining energy inside all of the ancient corpses!</p>
 <p>“Boom!”</p>
 <p>A clap of sky-fracturing thunder rang resounded throughout the Graveyard of Gods.</p>
 <p>And the space that couldn’t take much more in its shattering state began to explode without end.</p>
