 <p><b>Chapter 583: Mutual Understanding</b></p>
 <p><span style>Xiang Xi’s enthusiasm somewhat surprised Qin Lie. He secretly suspected that the enforcer had an ulterior motive in feigning niceties.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie didn’t dare let his guard down. He was ready to become hostile and go on the offensive the moment things went awry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rumor has it that the forefather has already stepped into the late stage of the Imperishable Realm and is preparing to ascend to the Void Realm,” Xiang Xi said with a smile. “I wonder if that’s true?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Which forefather are you talking about?” Qin Lie asked, a gleam in his eyes. He slowly began to understand what was going on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahah! I’m talking about your respected teacher, Forefather Terminator, of course!” Xiang Xi exclaimed confidently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie rubbed his chin, a smile forming on his face. “How did you know?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not blind.” Xiang Xi flashed a toothy grin. He somehow managed to force the two sinister scars on his face to look like kindly lines. “Who else in all of the Land of Chaos could’ve taught a genius like you except Forefather Terminator? Considering how impressive your skill in that thunder spirit art is, anyone could’ve figured it out. We don’t need to waste time guessing at the obvious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing Xiang Xi’s explanation, the tension inside of Qin Lie completely dissipated. He subconsciously smiled calmly at Luo Chen and Gao Yu, gesturing with his eyes to indicate that they could relax as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Forefather Terminator was famous throughout the Land of Chaos. Since he was one of the most terrifying existences throughout the land, Terminator Sect’s might was publically acknowledged as well. Considering how big of a commotion Qin Lie caused by cultivating Heavenly Thunder Eradication during these past two days was, it made sense for Xiang Xi and his men to misidentify who he was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as he figured out the reason behind the significant change in Xiang Xi’s attitude, Qin Lie smiled softly and took a Terminator Profound Bomb out of his spatial ring, sending a spark electricity into it from his fingertip.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A shocking amount of violent thunder and lightning energy immediately radiated from the Terminator Profound Bomb like an aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Astonishment filled the faces of Xiang Xi and his men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie chuckled and put the Terminator Profound Bomb back into his spatial ring. Then he turned to Du Xiangyang and the others and said, “I guess our identities have been exposed.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is all your fault, you know,” Du Xiangyang answered carefully, taking the opportunity to glare at Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiang Xi, Bo Boze, and the other enforces exchanged glances. By that point, they were completely sure of who everyone in Qin Lie’s group was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them knew about the might of the Terminator Profound Bombs and how the core disciples of Terminator Sect would carry a few of them as a life-saving measures while adventuring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What else would the metallic sphere that Qin Lie showed them, the one that radiated a terrifying, thunderous aura, be if not a Terminator Profound Bomb?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon connecting the appearance of that Terminator Profound Bomb to the huge commotion that Qin Lie caused while cultivating Heavenly Thunder Eradication, Xiang Xi became certain that Qin Lie’s group belonged to Terminator Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A moment of hesitation later, Xiang Xi delicately revealed the doubt in his heart.</span><span style>“So… why have you come to Gold Sun Island?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group of Gold Sun Island martial practitioners became serious as they nervously watched Qin Lie’s group.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of these people were trying to rebel against the Xing Family and seize power and authority within Gold Sun Island for themselves. They were afraid that, upon learning this, Qin Lie would use this information to help the Xing brothers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If that were the case, they would have to readjust their plans to include Terminator Sect as a threat. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe you’ve already received the news,” Qin Lie said in a low voice. “The Graveyard of Gods has collapsed and some remains of ancient elites escaped destruction, scattering across the sea at the center of every continent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiang Xi’s men nodded in confirmation, solemn expressions on their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Illusory Demon Sect ordered us to search for the remains of ancient elites,” Xiang Xi said. “Are you…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Correct!” Qin Lie exclaimed. “That’s why we’re here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why here?” Xiang Xi asked, suddenly growing excited. “Could it be? Could the remains be somewhere in our Gold Sun Island’s region of the sea? Do you have some kind of information about this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We dare not say for sure, but.... the possibility is huge,” Qin Lie said, a mysterious look on his face. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiang Xi wasn’t the only person getting excited. Even Bo Boze and the others had secretly grown excited at the news, their eyes alight. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They assumed that Qin Lie and his group were here because they obtained trustworthy information about remains of ancient elites being somewhere in the region of the sea that Gold Sun Island controlled. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, judging by his skill in his thunder spirit art, Qin Lie was obviously Forefather Terminator’s most beloved disciple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the information they obtained wasn’t solid, these people definitely wouldn’t have come all the way to the Heavenly Calamity Continent searching for the remains of ancient elites… right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The remains of ancient elites were the main topic of recent discussions for every force in the Land of Chaos. Nobody knew how many forces were doing everything they could to find them, hoping to use them to vastly improve themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One such force that tried to use the remains of ancient elites to change their fortune, hoping to become a Silver rank force in the future, was the Pan Family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To that end, they were willing to kill even Xue Moyan, Luo Chen, and Du Xiangyang to prevent the information from being leaked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re not a member of the Xing Family, are you, my friend?” Xiang Xi’s smile widened with joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His demeanor indifferent, Qin Lie said, “Surnames don’t matter. I only care about achieving my goals.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiang Xi glanced at Bo Boze. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Bo Boze understood his meaning, walked over while smiling and said, “The wooden buildings on this fire phoenix are a bit too damaged to carry on this discussion. Shall we… move to a new location? We may be able to assist all of you in searching for the remains of ancient elites.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure.” Qin Lie nodded. He also wanted to know what in Spirit Realm these fellows were up to. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Tingyu and the others had relaxed by this time. They knew that Xiang Xi’s men wouldn’t dare to raise a hand against Qin Lie now that they had mistaken him for a direct disciple of Forefather Terminator. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let us leave senior brother to discuss things with them,” she suddenly said. “There is no need for us to... go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was currently at the peak of the Netherpassage Realm and could break through at any moment. She didn’t want to waste her energy on chatting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She also knew that Xie Jingxuan, Luo Chen, and Gao Yu weren’t interested in this kind of thing. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, Xie Jingxuan, Luo Chen, and Gao Yu all nodded in agreement. They didn’t wish to interact with Xiang Xi’s group more than necessary. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Moyan and Du Xiangyang wanted to participate in the discussion, but since Song Tingyu had already spoken for all of them, they had to give up on the idea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>—All of them agreed that they would obey senior brother’s decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was exactly what Bo Boze had hoped for, which was why he hadn’t tried to invite all of them out of courtesy. He exchanged looks with Xiang Xi, and the four enforcers brought Qin Lie to a five-story pagoda on Xu Changsheng’s Flowing Gold Fire Phoenix. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Considering how impressive Qin Lie’s skill in his thunder spirit art was, they saw him as Forefather Terminator’s direct disciple—the true treasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Judging by the auras of the rest of the group, they clearly didn’t cultivate thunder spirit arts. They believed that Luo Chen, Du Xiangyang, and Gao Yu were just Qin Lie’s subordinates. Insignificant people. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As for Song Tingyu, Xie Jingxuan, and Xue Moyan, they had already declared themselves as Qin Lie’s women when they arrived. Since Xiang Xi and the others had another arrangement in mind, having the three women participate in this meeting would’ve been a bit inconvenient. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They were naturally glad to see Qin Lie’s six companions depart. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside of a wide hall on the fifth floor of the wooden pagoda-shaped building, one laden with soft carpet, Xiang Xi directed Qin Lie to a seat. Once he did, he suddenly clapped his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Five women with wonderful figures draped in thin clothing, all of whom looked either innocent or seductive, rushed Qin Lie out of nowhere. They wore sultry smiles, carried trays of fruit in their uncovered arms, and shook their assets to try and appeal to Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please enjoy some tea, young master.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come and eat some fruit, young master.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about some dimsum, young master?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The five beautiful girls surrounded him from every direction and presented him with all kinds of drinks and delicacies. They also massaged his legs, shoulders, and head, instantly immersing Qin Lie in a sea of worldly pleasures. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The spectacle initially caught Qin Lie off guard. However, he quickly calmed down and relaxed, allowing these enchanting women to service him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All five women had different figures and dispositions, but all could be considered quite attractive. Their white legs and delicate breasts they hid beneath the thin fabric of their clothing were extremely tempting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie had recently learned about the true wonders of a woman from Song Tingyu. That meant that his self-control in the face of women was currently at its weakest. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As a result, when the five beautiful women flooded him, looking as if they would follow his every command, his did lose some control over himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, these women drastically paled in comparison to the likes of Song Tingyu, Xue Moyan and Xie Jingxuan. To be honest, they were a little beneath Qin Lie’s current standards. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell me what you wish to speak of,” Qin Lie said nonchalantly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The four enforcers glanced at each other, inwardly puzzled by how unclouded Qin Lie’s eyes were. He obviously didn’t feel any lust for the women around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Song Tingyu, Xie Jingxuan, and Xue Moyan faced outsiders, the always disguised themselves to look like ordinary women. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They figured that if Qin Lie would take such plain women as wives, he either had an unusually strong appetite or… he didn’t have many chances to venture out into the world—that Forefather Terminator restricted his movements so much that he could only seek out his junior sisters for companionship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ended up assuming that the five women they sent to service Qin Lie would definitely succeed in drawing out the pervert inside of him and force him to reveal his true character.</span></p>
 <p><span style>—But things didn’t go the way they planned. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After pondering for a moment, Xiang Xi suddenly spoke up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think of the Xing brothers, my young friend?” he asked tentatively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh. They’re okay,” Qin Lie answered ambiguously. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What… what is your relationship with the Xing brothers?” Xiang Xi asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Until ten days ago, I had nothing to do with the Xing Family,” Qin Lie said with a smile. “Now, however, I’m called Xing Lie…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiang Xi understood what he meant and chuckled. He nodded and said, “I understand, haha. Well, about the search for the remains of ancient elites. Actually, we can help you with that. The only thing that we request of you is…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Request?” Qin Lie narrowed his eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“We request that you ignore anything that may happen later on,” Xiang Xi said solemnly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our only goal here is to find the remains of ancient elites. We aren’t interested in anything else,” Qin Lie firmly declared his stance. “The internal affairs of Gold Sun Island is none of our concern.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, that’s good… that’s very good!” Xiang Xi sighed in relief and hurriedly said, “Don’t worry. As long as you are in Gold Sun Island, anything in our possession will be yours if you wish for it! We have absolutely no problem with helping you search for the remains of ancient elites. Even if you point us in a rough direction, I’ll immediately send my men to take a look. If we really do find anything, we can arrange for ships to help you transport them in secret. We… can even hide this information from Illusory Demon Sect!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re too considerate, Enforcer Xiang!” Qin Lie laughed loudly. “Hehe, I am quite fond of your behavior!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t seem to be satisfied with these five women, do you? That’s fine. Once we reach Gold Sun Island, I’ll definitely arrange for even better women to please you!” Xiang Xi began making promises.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm… then I’ll have to give my thanks to you in advance, Enforcer Xiang.” Qin Lie nodded in satisfaction. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed as though both parties had come to a mutual understanding.</span></p>
