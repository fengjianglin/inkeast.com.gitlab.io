 <p><strong>Chapter 1143: Fighting For Prey</strong></p>
 <p>In the dead volcano chain.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie did not continue to aimlessly search for Gan Xing and the others. He sat down and through his mental connection, he felt what was occuring in the underground cave a thousand meters under Boluo Realm.</p>
 <p>At this moment, his Soul Beast avatar was restraining Acarus and trying to enslave his soul.</p>
 <p>The high rank Acarus was pinned in the air. Soul threads came out like gray snakes from the eyes of the Soul Beast and disappeared into Acarus's eyes.</p>
 <p>Acarus shouted and screamed, begging and pleading for the Soul Beast to spare him.</p>
 <p>The Soul Beast did not have any hint of pity, only endless cold and darkness in its eyes as the soul threads continued to permeate Acarus’s mind.</p>
 <p>Gradually, Acarus stopped breathing, and the fire on him extinguished.</p>
 <p>His soul was covered in dense soul chains imprinted with the slave mark of the Soul Race, as they all merged with him.</p>
 <p>The Soul Race was a powerful race that the physical races in the universe feared the most.</p>
 <p>Each Soul Race member was born without a tangible body, only a pure soul.</p>
 <p>The members of the Soul Race took physical bodies through possession. They enslaved many powerful soul servants to grow their Soul Trees.</p>
 <p>The growth of the Soul Tree relied on the power of the soul slaves, and also many more powerful soul slaves.</p>
 <p>Making a powerful being into a soul slave took a lot of soul energy from the Soul Race member.</p>
 <p>Due to this, the Soul Race expert who had taken over the Soul Beast had frequently gone to the Frost Desolation Abyss but never acted against the Abyss Devils.</p>
 <p>Those Abyss Devils such as the Silver-eyed Snake Devil weren’t intelligent enough before becoming Lords of the Abyss.</p>
 <p>The use of those Abyss Devils was just as a fighting puppet and they did not hold much value to the soul residing in Soul Beast.</p>
 <p>Acarus was a high rank Abyss Devil, so he was born with great intelligence and a powerful soul.</p>
 <p>Only a soul slave like this, after being enslaved by the Soul Beast, would bring benefits to the Soul Tree.</p>
 <p>This was why Qin Lie was willing to expend the avatar's soul energy to enslave Acarus.</p>
 <p>There was another thing. Qin Lie needed to test the Soul Beast avatar's comprehension of the Soul Race's secret arts through Acarus and create a foundation for enslaving the first voodoo creature.</p>
 <p>As the Soul Beast used the Soul Race's secret arts to enslave Acarus, his true body was paying attention from the Extreme Flame Abyss.</p>
 <p>"Hm?"</p>
 <p>Qin Lie's brow shifted. He woke up from his connection to the soul of the Soul Beast avatar.</p>
 <p>He looked around darkly.</p>
 <p>That feeling of being observed resurfaced in his mind.</p>
 <p>He was sure that someone was secretly searching for him.</p>
 <p>"Who could it be?"</p>
 <p>Qin Lie stood up and floated into the air. Under the bright red clouds, he looked into the distance.</p>
 <p>In the burning Extreme Flame Abyss, a thread of cold intent came from very far away.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie's mind shifted. He seemed to suddenly catch something as his expression changed slightly.</p>
 <p>"Frost Desolation Abyss!"</p>
 <p>As expected, the cold coming from that direction was becoming more and more powerful.</p>
 <p>Soon after, the high rank Frost Desolation Abyss Devils, led by Enos, gradually appeared.</p>
 <p>Thos Abyss Devils clearly had a cold aura. They suddenly accelerated after confirming Qin Lie's location.</p>
 <p>In Qin Lie's eyes, there were ten waves of cold air rapidly coming towards him, extremely unusual in the Extreme Flame Abyss.</p>
 <p>He immediately understood.</p>
 <p>"Holy shit, they chased me from Frost Desolation Abyss all the way here!" he sneered.</p>
 <p>Through the Soul Beast avatar, he knew the rules of the Abyss. He knew that Lords of the Abyss would not wantonly wander into other Abyss levels. Otherwise, they could cause a war to break out.</p>
 <p>Therefore, the Abyss Devils that had come from the Frost Desolation Abyss should only have rank eight bloodlines. He had the ability to fight Abyss Devils of such a level.</p>
 <p>He sat and waited for the pursuers from the Frost Desolation Abyss.</p>
 <p>"Just up ahead!" Enos flapped her black wings as she pointed excitedly towards Qin Lie's location. She said, "If we capture him alive, my father will twist the fundamental laws, tear a hole in space, and immediately send him back to the Frost Desolation Abyss!"</p>
 <p>She led Klaus and the other Frost Desolation Abyss Devils for a long time in search of Qin Lie in the Extreme Flame Abyss.</p>
 <p>Along the way, she saw many experts of the Blaze Family fighting with the devils of the Extreme Flame Abyss.</p>
 <p>Many Extreme Flame Abyss Devils were ruthlessly killed in battle and cut up by the Blaze Family members to be stored away.</p>
 <p>There were also Blaze Family members that were torn apart and consumed by the devils of this level.</p>
 <p>Along the way, she had made many detours but still encountered some danger.</p>
 <p>Some intermediate sized teams of the Blaze Family thought of them as prey and chased them.</p>
 <p>Enos's excitement after entering another Abyss level gradually faded after encountering these hardships.</p>
 <p>She already realized that this was not the Frost Desolation Abyss that her father ruled. She realized that in the chaotic battlefield of the Extreme Flame Abyss, if they were trapped by a Blaze Family company or higher, they could very well die.</p>
 <p>Right now, Enos only wanted to capture Qin Lie alive, take him back to the Frost Desolation Abyss for her father to interrogate and get this trip over with.</p>
 <p>"It will finally be finished."</p>
 <p>The rank eight devil Klaus exhaled softly and sped up.</p>
 <p>The Frost Desolation Abyss Devils behind him followed closely.</p>
 <p>Fifteen minutes later, they finally came to the dead volcano chain where Qin Lie was and were greeted with a sight of Qin Lie quietly sitting on one of the dead volcanoes.</p>
 <p>"It's him!" Enos pointed from a distance at Qin Lie. She ordered the devils from the Frost Desolation Abyss, "Capture him alive, get him back to the Frost Desolation Abyss and our mission will be complete.."</p>
 <p>Klaus, who had long hair, ears covered in silver rings, and a pair of eyes flashing with purple light, stared at Qin Lie for a while and said, "Leave it to me."</p>
 <p>"You are the ones that have been searching for me?" Qin Lie grinned and smiled coldly. "From Frost Desolation Abyss to here, you are very stubborn."</p>
 <p>"Capture him!" Enos shouted impatiently.</p>
 <p>She did not want to stay longer in the Extreme Flame Abyss. She felt that this level was a nightmare.</p>
 <p>She, who had lived from birth in the Frost Desolation Abyss and was used to the cold, realized that other Abyss levels were not as good as she had imagined.</p>
 <p>She missed the cold and desolation of the Frost Desolation Abyss at every moment.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie's gaze moved around Enos, Klaus, and the other Frost Desolation Abyss Devils.</p>
 <p>"As expected, no rank nine..."</p>
 <p>He relaxed and prepared to open the star door and summon the soul slaves to help him and crush these people that dared to chase him to the Extreme Flame Abyss.</p>
 <p>However, suddenly…</p>
 <p>He and Klaus exclaimed at the same time, and looked behind another dead volcano.</p>
 <p>Six high rank Abyss Devils flowing with flame as though they just walked out of the lava pools floated in the air, laughing.</p>
 <p>These six high rank devils had natural crimson red armor, two horns on their heads, and hooked spikes on their backs. However, from the front, they looked similar to humans.</p>
 <p>They were clearly high rank Extreme Flame Abyss Devils.</p>
 <p>"We have observed you who came from Frost Desolation Abyss for a long time to see why you’ve come!"</p>
 <p>The leader looked coldly at Enos and Klaus, saying, "Our great leader has said that outsiders do not need to interfere with the battle with the Blaze Family! You have come uninvited into the Extreme Flame Abyss and charged all the way here to take away this Blaze Family boy. Why?"</p>
 <p>Enos and Klaus's actions in the Extreme Flame Abyss had clearly attracted the attention of the high rank devils of this level. These six high rank Abyss Devils had started following them a long time ago.</p>
 <p>However, these high rank Abyss Devils did not make any sound, secretly tailing them to see why they had come.</p>
 <p>When Enos and the others found Qin Lie and said they were taking Qin Lie back to the Frost Desolation Abyss, they came out and stopped it.</p>
 <p>They knew that Enos's actions would have a reason.</p>
 <p>Enos saw those six high rank devils appear, and knew that they had rank eight bloodlines.</p>
 <p>"We did not intend to offend you." She first apologized to the six with the etiquette of the Abyss. Then she explained, "This Blaze Family boy came from the Frost Desolation Abyss, we came to capture him. Please do not stop us."</p>
 <p>"The Blaze Family is fighting with us, why would he go to the Frost Desolation Abyss?" The leading Extreme Flame Abyss high rank devil snorted and said, "You do not even know how to lie!"</p>
 <p>"He really is from the Frost Desolation Abyss. Also, he is not a pure God Race member, he is a hybrid of the human race and God Race!" Enos said urgently.</p>
 <p>"Miss!" Klaus shouted in reminder.</p>
 <p>Enos stilled and immediately reacted. She realized she had said too much.</p>
 <p>"A mix between the human race and the God Race? Human race... what race is that?" The high rank Extreme Flame Abyss Devil stilled and then said, "You know that the Extreme Flame Abyss is at war, but still came to capture this person. He must be extraordinary."</p>
 <p>"This..." Enos felt a headache coming on.</p>
 <p>"Return, we will take care of him. He came to our Extreme Flame Abyss, and he has the Blaze Family bloodline, he is our prey!" the high rank Abyss Devil said brashly.</p>
