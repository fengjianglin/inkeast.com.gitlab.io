 <p><strong>Chapter 645: Appreciation</strong></p>
 <p>The Gongye brothers exchanged glances with each other.</p>
 <p>Jiang Zhuzhe’s suggestion surprised the both of them. For a time, they couldn’t quite understand his meaning.</p>
 <p>“You can’t be thinking that you can stop the both of us yourself, can you, Jiang Zhuzhe?” Gongye Qing snorted coldly.</p>
 <p>“That is exactly what I was thinking,” Jiang Zhuzhe said seriously and didn’t look like he was joking at all, “If Black Voodoo Cult isn’t sending more reinforcements, if the two of you are the last ones to come, then you really can’t do anything to our Blood Fiend Sect this battle. If that is the case, then you may as well evacuate now and leave the small fries that is the three great families to me. What do you think?”</p>
 <p>“Jiang Zhuzhe, do you seriously think that Blood Fiend Sect is still what they were a thousand years ago?” Gongye Zhuo frowned.</p>
 <p>“Aren’t we?” Jiang Zhuzhe countered naturally.</p>
 <p>“I’m asking you.” Gongye Zhuo’s face slowly turned cold.</p>
 <p>This was because Jiang Zhuzhe’s Blood Drinkers had caused massive casualties among Black Voodoo Cult’s disciples while they were speaking with Jiang Zhuzhe.</p>
 <p>These so-called Blood Drinkers could easily transform into blood demons and cause their physical strength to go up by folds. It was similar to the secret “Beast Manifestation” art from the Ten Thousand Beast Mountain. After they had transformed into a blood demon, a Blood Drinker’s combat strength swiftly increases. They were like killing machines who knew no fatigue.</p>
 <p>The scariest thing was that these Blood Drinkers could swiftly replenish their strength once they had killed their opponent and consumed their blood.</p>
 <p>This meant that they could keep replenishing their strength as long as they kept killing, and their spirit energy would never run dry.</p>
 <p>Moreover, these Blood Drinkers were somehow able to ignore the voodoo poison that was effective on the Blood Fiend Sect and Gold Sun island martial practitioners completely.</p>
 <p>The Blood Drinkers didn’t spend any spirit energy in creating a light shield and just exposed themselves to the thick voodoo poison just like that. However, they were as lively as ever and showed no signs of weakening at all.</p>
 <p>These abnormalities meant that the destructive power a Blood Drinker possessed was literally immeasurable. They were continuously killing and sucking the martial practitioners of Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families dry.</p>
 <p>Those martial practitioners who died a horrible death after they were bitten by the Blood Drinkers had their blood completely sucked dry. They looked absolutely horrifying, and their appearance dealt another psychological blow to their martial practitioners.</p>
 <p>It was only now the Gongye brothers understood why their pope Jiang An viewed Jiang Zhuzhe as an extremely dangerous enemy and thought that the threat he represented far exceeded Xue Li.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, they were thankful that the person who obtained the Blood Progenitor’s remains was Xue Li and not Jiang Zhuzhe.</p>
 <p>The pressure brought by the Blood Drinkers caused a heavy weight to appear in the brothers’ hearts. They made up their minds on the inside to participate in this battle!</p>
 <p>If they didn’t, then these Blood Drinkers would slaughter all of their cult’s experts and foil their operation. Moreover, their losses would only grow bigger and bigger.</p>
 <p>“We don’t believe that you can stop us with your strength alone!” Gongye Zhuo howled fiercely.</p>
 <p>The moment he howled, black mist poured out of every pore on his body. The shrill sound of a voodoo insect also emanated from inside his body. The sound was so sharp that it could break one’s eardrums.</p>
 <p>On the other side, Gongye Qing had backed away some distance in attempt to slip pass Jiang Zhuzhe and kill the Blood Fiend Ten Elders with the destructive power of a two-level Soul Altar in one go.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Duan Qianjie who had been watching all this time broke his silence and said, “If you want to fight then go find some place that isn’t here!”</p>
 <p>The moment he said this, the space of this entire area suddenly cracked like a broken mirror.</p>
 <p>The terrifying power of distorted space bloomed and slowly spread towards the outer edge.</p>
 <p>There was a blurry three-level Soul Altar above Duan Qianjie’s head that looked like it was sitting in some nameless space. Its figure was blurry, and it emanated with a mighty power that seemed capable of intimidating the world and expand infinitely to the horizon.</p>
 <p>Jiang Zhuzhe, Gongye Zhuo and Gongye Qing turned pale the moment they saw the three-level Soul Altar.</p>
 <p>Ten years ago, Duan Qianjie was still only a second-level Soul Altar expert when he challenged Li Mu.</p>
 <p>Although it was rumored heavily after the battle that Duan Qianjie had reached the late stage of Imperishable Realm and constructed a three-level Soul Altar, there were far and few people who had actually seen it.</p>
 <p>This made many people suspect that his three-level Soul Altar wasn’t yet fully constructed.</p>
 <p>But now, the trio could clearly see the blurry outline of his three-level Soul Altar. It looked like it was seated behind many layers of space. This caused them all two-level Soul Altar experts to pale greatly in shock.</p>
 <p>The second the power that could distort space itself appeared, the trio immediately ran away.</p>
 <p>They were all gone from Duan Qianjie’s side in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>Duan Qianjie snorted and withdrew his strength. The cracked space recovered as if a magical hand had sewn them back to normal.</p>
 <p>Duan Qianjie frowned and turned back to look at Qin Lie, “Have you woken up?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, I just did.” Qin Lie nodded and bent forwards slightly, thanking him, “Thank you for your teachings, senior.”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie had figured out that Duan Qianjie’s spirit art was related to space.</p>
 <p>It was said that the power of space was the world’s most mysterious and difficult to comprehend power. The fact that Duan Qianjie could traverse over tens of thousands of kilometers through a small jade token showed just how deep he had studied into the power of space.</p>
 <p>The power of space and the power of a three-level Soul Altar was so intimidating that even Jiang Zhuzhe and the Gongye brothers could only avoid him.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie finally understood why Li Mu said that Duan Qianjie could aid him in resolving all the troubles he might face one time when he passed the jade token to him.</p>
 <p>“You know Forefather Terminator?” Duan Qianjie suddenly looked deeply at him.</p>
 <p>“No, I don’t know him.” Qin Lie shook his head.</p>
 <p>Duan Qianjie thought for a moment before saying, “Even if Forefather Terminator is going to defend you, I’ll still assume that you’ve used up your chance. Once this matter is over, I no longer owe you any favors.”</p>
 <p>“I understand,” Qin Lie said.</p>
 <p>“How far have you gotten into the Limit Sublimation Art?” Duan Qianjie asked again.</p>
 <p>“I’ve learned some things, but that art couldn’t circulate anymore after my spirit energy and soul energy had recovered to half.” Qin Lie answered honestly.</p>
 <p>“That is natural,” Duan Qianjie nodded, “The Limit Sublimation Art only forces out all of your potential, and it can only be executed when your spirit energy and soul energy are depleted or about to be depleted. That is how it continuously squeezes out your potential to sublimate yourself. Once the period has passed and your body has recovered, the laziness of the human body will reappear once more. Naturally, the art would lose its effect.”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie listened seriously and respectfully to Duan Qianjie’s guidance. He was afraid to miss out on even a single word.</p>
 <p>“This Limit Sublimation Art may be useful to you, but it might also be useless to you. You probably won’t run into a situation where you’ve completed exhausted your strength like this too often,” Duan Qianjie said indifferently, “If that was the case, then the Limit Sublimation Art won’t be too useful.”</p>
 <p>“I will try and force myself into a dead end in the future,” Qin Lie said seriously.</p>
 <p>Duan Qianjie stared deeply at him before he revealed the hint of an appraising look and said, “That will be good.”</p>
 <p>“I’ve recovered some of my strength. Right now, this is the best timing to force out my potential,” Qin Lie gritted his teeth and charged to a spot where the three great families’ martial practitioners were gathered. He hadn’t even bothered to treat the various wounds on his body.</p>
 <p>Duan Qianjie’s eyes abruptly lit up in admiration. He nodded on the inside and praised him softly, “What a good kid!”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie abruptly gathered his spirit energy.</p>
 <p>With a single thought, the strength gathered inside his dantian’s spirit sea immediately poured into his limbs through his muscles and veins.</p>
 <p>They felt like sea water surging in many deep ditches towards all directions.</p>
 <p>He could clearly sense that his circulation of spirit energy had grown a bit quicker after a moment of cultivation using the Limit Sublimation Art.</p>
 <p>This revelation pleasantly surprised Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>He knew very well that the ability to instantly conjure spirit energy meant that he could create a light shield faster to protect himself from a fatal attack. It also meant that he could execute spirit techniques faster to damage his enemies and move faster!</p>
 <p>There were many occasions where greater speed meant greater strength!</p>
 <p>He noticed just how wonderful the Limit Sublimation Art was through these miniscule changes. He knew just how useful this unique secret art of Duan Qianjie’s was to the growth of a martial practitioner if it could continuously squeeze out his potential and evolve his entire being.</p>
 <p>It would’ve been more than worth it even if this jade token had exchanged for just one Limit Sublimation Art!</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie!” Lian Rou’s shouts came from afar.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie couldn’t help but look towards the direction of the voice.</p>
 <p>Song Tingyu, Xie Jingxuan and Tang Siqi and the others were all at a small island where the voodoo poison was no longer present. Mo Hai, Feng Rong, Lang Xie and Yi Yuan were also there fighting against the three great families’ ferocious attacks with other Scarlet Tide Continent martial practitioners. It was a difficult defense.</p>
 <p>There were plenty of Black Voodoo Cult voodoo insects that were howling in midair and cooperating with the three great families on the island.</p>
 <p>The Blood Spear martial practitioners had gathered as one group under Lang Xie’s command and were protecting Mo Hai, Lian Rou and Tang Siqi.</p>
 <p>There were also two god corpses who were waving their giant arms and fighting against two Nirvana Realm martial practitioners.</p>
 <p>The Blood Drinkers who had come along with Jiang Zhuzhe were helping the Blood Fiend Ten Elders and Gold Sun Island hunt down down Black Voodoo Cult’s men. They hadn’t split away a portion of their numbers to aid those who came from the Scarlet Tide Continent.</p>
 <p>“Those blood demon fellows haven’t came over to help us! Summon a few god corpses to help us, quickly!” Lian Rou hastily shouted after seeing that he was paying attention.</p>
 <p>“I’m coming!” Qin Lie answered.</p>
 <p>“Splash!”</p>
 <p>The god corpse that was attacking Blood Voodoo Cult rushed over while riding on waves. It caught Qin Lie with his shoulder when he jumped down from the ship.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie was sending messages to the god corpses non-stop.</p>
 <p>The god corpses scattered at every direction sensed his commands and gathered towards him.</p>
 <p>When Qin Lie had gotten up the island while standing on a god corpse, all eight god corpses had surrounded the entire island like eight heavenly pillars.</p>
 <p>Duan Qianjie took a few steps forwards and traversed several thousand meters of distance at once after seeing Qin Lie’s movements. He had also arrived on the island suddenly.</p>
 <p>“Let me find you a couple of suitable opponents,” Duan Qianjie said.</p>
 <p>A few early stage Fulfillment Realm martial practitioners scattered at different places suddenly felt their necks gripped by an invisible, giant hand and tossed right in front of Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>The Netherpassage Realm and Manifestation Realm martial practitioners next to Qin Lie were casually tossed to Song Tingyu, Xie Jingxuan and everyone else by Duan Qianjie.</p>
 <p>“Jiang Zhuzhe is strong enough to keep the Gongye brothers from splitting away, so you guys have the bigger chance of victory in this battle. You don’t have to worry,” Duan Qianjie added.</p>
 <p>The moment he said this, every Scarlet Tide Continent martial practitioner on the island suddenly gained a boost of confidence.</p>
 <p>Duan Qianjie motioned for Qin Lie to fight to his heart’s content, and he carelessly swept a glance across the Scarlet Tide Continent crowd. Suddenly, his gaze stopped at the bracelet Tang Siqi was wearing on her left wrist.</p>
 <p>The bracelet was forged of beautiful, emerald jade. There were seven tiny green star dots on the bracelet that looked like they were moving even though Tang Siqi was just standing there.</p>
 <p>“Who is Tang Beidou to you?” Duan Qianjie suddenly asked.</p>
