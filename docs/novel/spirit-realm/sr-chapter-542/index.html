 <p><strong>Chapter 542: Colossal Collapse</strong></p>
 <p>The Viridian Blood Toad released an earthshaking whistle, commanding the Voodoo Progenitor’s body to fly at the Demon Sealing Tombstone!</p>
 <p>“Zzng zzng zzng!”</p>
 <p>Amidst the constant whistling, all of the people at the edge of the frozen lake puked blood or immediately perished upon being struck by the sound wave.</p>
 <p>Even people as strong as Luo Chen and Yu Men nearly lost their True Souls during the first sound wave caused by the Viridian Blood Toad’s earsplitting whistle.</p>
 <p>Someone like Pan Qianqian possessed a weaker realm and even more limited endurance. At this point, she was already lying in a pool of blood, waiting to be killed by the next sound wave.</p>
 <p>The body of the Voodoo Progenitor flew at the Demon Sealing Tombstone, the image of the Viridian Blood Toad clearly visible in both its pupils. It continued its hatred-filled whistle, which was capable of shattering one’s soul and breaking one’s heart.</p>
 <p>Just as Qin Lie was about to rush down into the Land of Buried Gods, he came to a sudden stop.</p>
 <p>He saw that the Demon Sealing Tombstone, which was clashing against the ape and the ancient giant, suddenly started emitting an impressive, godly light as dazzling as a blazing flame. The eight god heads spun around the Demon Sealing Tombstone, mysterious ancient runes flowing from their eyes.</p>
 <p>These mysterious runes shone with fiery light as they shot down from the eyes of each god head.</p>
 <p>A terrifying power that seemed capable of sealing the world, freezing time, and intimidating the universe descended from the sky.</p>
 <p>It instantly enveloped the entire Land of Buried Gods.</p>
 <p>The Demon Sealing Tombstone’s display of godly might seemed to frighten the Viridian Blood Toad inside of the Voodoo Progenitor.</p>
 <p>It was so scared that it actually stopped whistling.</p>
 <p>The first voodoo creature appeared to be terrified of the Demon Sealing Tombstone, and it noticed that things were not going as it had expected. Just when it looked like it was going to jump into the sky, it suddenly descended—.</p>
 <p>—and landed beside the ice spirit.</p>
 <p>The ice spirit hidden within Jia Yue’s body used the freezing tornado to hide itself. The moment it saw that the Demon Sealing Tombstone grew even stronger after sealing the water spirit, it seemed to cower a bit as well.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh whoosh whoosh!”</p>
 <p>Without warning, the ice spirit actually flew away from the Land of Buried Gods and escaped toward the many snow-covered mountains and frosty glaciers outside of the frozen lake.</p>
 <p>“Swoosh swoosh swoosh!”</p>
 <p>Countless flowing lights emerged from the Demon Sealing Tombstone’s surface and shot toward the icy masses in every direction.</p>
 <p>“Boom boom boom!”</p>
 <p>There were many mountains and glaciers around the Land of Buried Gods. Deep, booming rumbles came from one mountain after another, countless enormous boulders hurtling down from them. Every time a boulder struck something, the force of the impact would shake the world.</p>
 <p>Fissures resembling meandering rivers constantly appeared throughout the desolate plain inside the Land of Buried Gods.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh whoosh whoosh!”</p>
 <p>Potent energies of metal, wood, water, fire, ice, and thunder flooded from the fissures in the ground. The gray sky of the Graveyard of Gods seemed like it was tearing apart as an immense aura of spirit energy surged into existence.</p>
 <p>“What rich, refined spirit energies!” Xie Jingxuan gasped, her eyes glittering despite her wretched condition.</p>
 <p>From the moment they first entered the Graveyard of Gods and traversed the forbidden lands, none of them had detected any worldly spirit energies.</p>
 <p>Whenever they did encounter any spirit energy, it was always energy that corresponded with the forbidden land they were in. For martial practitioners who cultivated certain spirit arts, spirit energy with just one attribute could not be absorbed in any way.</p>
 <p>However, after the Demon Sealing Tombstone and the eight god heads caused such a colossal change and made the Graveyard of Gods seem as if it would collapse, the streams of spirit energy that surged out of the ground were intoxicating.</p>
 <p>“Bang bang!”</p>
 <p>The eight god heads hurtled toward the giant ape like enormous boulders. They resembled dazzling suns, all eight crashing into either side of the ape in two groups of four.</p>
 <p>At the same time, numerous mysterious runes streamed from the Demon Sealing Tombstone, soaking up the worldly spirit energy that had suddenly appeared. The seven different types of energy swiftly consolidated within them, gathering into one.</p>
 <p>Soon enough, the giant runes swelled up and radiated impressive rays of light, having absorbed a considerable amount of energy.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, they shot toward the ape and the ancient giant as if they were being controlled by the Demon Sealing Tombstone.</p>
 <p>The ape and the ancient giant panted heavily, fear appearing in their eyes.</p>
 <p>When the enormous runes made of light landed on the bodies of the ancient Giant Spirit Race elites, which had been possessed by the metal and earth spirits, they looked as if they had immediately been sealed once more.</p>
 <p>The movements of both the ape and the giant slowed sharply as their hundred-meter-tall bodies came to a forceful stop, bound by the runes. They could no longer move.</p>
 <p>Seizing the opportunity, seven godly chains extended from the Demon Sealing Tombstone and wrapped around the bodies of both Giant Spirit Race clansmen.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the eight god heads turned to stare at the ape and the giant, wordlessly threatening them with sinister, intimidating expressions.</p>
 <p>Seconds later, the earth and metal spirits finally realized they couldn’t escape. Pure, earthy soul light and a ray of metallic, golden soul power emerged from the bodies of the ape and the giant of their own accord.</p>
 <p>No one even had the chance to get a clear look at the two spirits before the Demon Sealing Tombstone wrapped its godly chains around them and pulled them into itself, absorbing them.</p>
 <p>Shortly after sealing the water spirit, the Demon Sealing Tombstone sealed the metal spirit and the earth spirit after the water spirit.</p>
 <p>As of that moment, out of the seven spirits, the only one that still evaded being sealed… was the ice spirit!</p>
 <p>“Thump! Thump!”</p>
 <p>Di Fei, who was still alive, and Ka Deng, who had died long ago, fell from the bodies of the ape and the giant.</p>
 <p>The Demon Sealing Tombstone hovered high above the Land of Buried Gods, and the eight god heads floated around it. They overwhelmed the entire Graveyard of Gods with their infinite power.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh whoosh whoosh…!”</p>
 <p>A bright silver five-meter-long snake shot from the Forbidden Land of Water to the Land of Buried Gods as if attracted by some sort of energy.</p>
 <p>This was the water spirit’s true body. After the water spirit’s soul was sealed away, its body naturally couldn’t escape imprisonment. It flew into the Demon Sealing Tombstone and vanished.</p>
 <p>Before long, a dirt-brown anteater brimming with potent earth spirit energy came from the Forbidden Land of Earth, drawn by the Demon Sealing Tombstone’s power as well.</p>
 <p>As the earth spirit’s true body, it was also devoured by the Demon Sealing Tombstone.</p>
 <p>A while later, a shiny, metallic spirit beast in the shape of a porcupine flew over to the Land of Buried Gods from the Forbidden Land of Metal. It was ultimately sealed as well.</p>
 <p>At this point in time, the souls and bodies of the water spirit, earth spirit, and metal spirit had all been sealed by the Demon Sealing Tombstone, and were no longer able to cause trouble.</p>
 <p>“Boom boom boom!”</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, a series of intense rumblings resounded from the Forbidden Lands of Water, Earth, and Metal. The commotion was so loud that it could be heard throughout all of the Graveyard of Gods.</p>
 <p>The numerous icy mountains in the Forbidden Land of Ice began to collapse, the earth and the sky surged with rich spirit energy, and everyone present felt terrified.</p>
 <p>They had a horrible feeling that the Graveyard of Gods was about to explode!</p>
 <p>“What’s going on!?” Du Xiangyang exclaimed.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know,” Xue Moyan replied in a daze. “With the sealing of the water, earth, and metal spirits, as well as the disappearance of and trouble caused by the ice spirit, it seems like a certain ancient barrier around the Graveyard of Gods has fallen apart.”</p>
 <p>“Are… are you saying that the Graveyard of Gods is done for?” Qin Lie asked in shock. “Aside from the Forbidden Land of Ice, are the six other forbidden lands collapsing as well?”</p>
 <p>“That may be the case.” Xue Moyan couldn’t give a sure answer.</p>
 <p>As everyone muttered amongst each other, they didn’t realize that the aura of frost that surrounded the blood demon was swiftly fading.</p>
 <p>A tiny bloody light continuously floated around the blood demon’s body, growing stronger and stronger.</p>
 <p>If one were able to look deep inside of the blood demon, they would see Jiang Tianxing properly seated within its head, his bloody eyes staring closely at a bone fragment that glittered with bloody light.</p>
 <p>“Swoosh!”</p>
 <p>The Blood Progenitor’s body flew from Qin Lie’s side, uncontrollably shooting toward the blood demon.</p>
 <p>It seemed as if the body had detected a familiar presence.</p>
 <p>“Boom!”</p>
 <p>A shocking, fiendish aura of blood exploded from the blood demon’s body once more, and the blood demon instantly regained its freedom.</p>
 <p>Jiang Tianxing’s supposedly crazed, bloodthirsty eyes actually held a trace of awareness. He seemed to have actually regained his rationality in a short time.</p>
 <p>Holding the bone fragment before him, he roared in a deep voice.</p>
 <p>“With blood as the trigger and god as the path, let the blood bridge come into being!”</p>
 <p>“Whoosh whoosh whoosh!”</p>
 <p>The blood demon howled at the sky, a hole abruptly appearing in the middle of its bloody abdomen.</p>
 <p>Everyone could feel a terrifying sensation, one where that enormous hole fractured time and threw space into chaos.</p>
 <p>Countless dazzling lights that resembled rivers of stars or sparks caused by clashing energies streamed from the gaping hole.</p>
 <p>As the chaotic energy inside of it began the stabilize, the hole swelled to become larger and larger.</p>
 <p>“Why did you only connect the blood bridge now?” a deep, grim voice resounded from the hole in the blood demon. “How worthless!”</p>
 <p>A bloody light flashed, and a handsome middle-aged man draped in a scarlet cape appeared below the blood demon. His bloody eyes glowed with demonic light.</p>
 <p>He had traversed the blood bridge and appeared in the Land of Buried Gods.</p>
 <p>“Jiang Zhuzhe!” Xue Moyan yelled in unfathomable hatred. She bit her lips hard enough to draw blood.</p>
 <p>“Many unforeseen events occurred up to this point, father.” Jiang Tianxing’s voice echoed from within the blood demon’s head. “I nearly failed to construct the blood bridge, but thank the heavens… I succeeded at following your instructions in the end.</p>
 <p>“You useless fool!” Jiang Zhuzhe berated his son. “You made me wait outside for an entire seven months and nine days!”</p>
 <p>……</p>
