 <p><strong>Chapter 769: Gilbert</strong></p>
 <p><span>The dragon soul gathering above the altar was still blurry and wobbly. It would appear that it needed some time before it could regain its full form.</span></p>
 <p><span>The six spirits of Void and Chaos continued to wait anxiously beside the altar.</span></p>
 <p><span>Their strength wasn’t enough to shatter the altar. Therefore, they couldn’t devour the precious spirit materials that made up the altar into their stomachs.</span></p>
 <p><span>That was why they could do nothing but wait.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What’s going on down there, Qin Lie?” Du Xiangyang asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>The martial practitioners of the four great Silver rank forces were all staring passionately at him. They all wanted to know what was going on down there.</span></p>
 <p><span>“I see a gigantic altar that seems to be circulating yet. It seems to be remaking an evil dragon that possesses a true name.” Qin Lie said solemnly with closed eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>“An evil dragon with a true name? That has to be a rank eight spirit beast at minimum! It’s the equivalent of our Imperishable Realm martial practitioners!” The knowledgeable He Yi exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The battle situation underground would shift greatly the moment he awakens!” Shen Yue said excitedly.</span></p>
 <p><span>They all noticed that the three ghoul races’ clansmen hadn’t sent any Soul Altar experts over there.</span></p>
 <p><span>In fact, every human and three ghoul race Soul Altar experts were currently involved in the battle above the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span>That battle was the true battle that shifted the tides of war. The victor of the sky battle could easily dictate the battle situation on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span>Therefore, the underground conflict and the war of Prism Continent was a lot less important to the battle going on above their heads.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It will be great if this evil dragon awakens.” He Yi also felt hopeful.</span></p>
 <p><span>“It looks like he needs a powerful soul thought in order to awaken. Right now, he’s drawing in soul thoughts using the altar from other areas.” Qin Lie observed quietly and added, “He will awaken. It is only a matter of when.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Everyone’s eyes lit up.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Guard this place well and ensure that none of the outsiders enter underground through the Absolute Yin Graveyard!” He Yi ordered.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Understood!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Let me see if I can see what the three ghoul races are doing.”</span></p>
 <p><span>He pondered for a moment and opened his eyes. Then, he withdrew his soul consciousness from the underground and took out the Demon Sealing Tombstone.</span></p>
 <p><span>He gathered a drop of lifeblood essence and dripped it onto the Demon Sealing Tombstone. He was going to inscribe the Blaze Family’s imprint.</span></p>
 <p><span>However, something unusual happened when his lifeblood essence touched the tombstone this time.</span></p>
 <p><span>The seven godly lights abruptly flew of the tombstone and entered the holes of the Absolute Yin Graveyard like rainbows.</span></p>
 <p><span>On one end, the seven godly lights were connected to the Demon Sealing Tombstone. On the other, they were swiftly extending towards the Absolute Yin Graveyard.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie was shocked by this.</span></p>
 <p><span>In just a dozen or so seconds, he suddenly noticed that the seven divine lights had reached the deepest part of the Absolute Yin Graveyard and were converging at the altar where the slumbering evil dragon was.</span></p>
 <p><span>The seven godly lights landed on the altar like great rivers as innumerable brilliant and sparkling divine characters were injected into the altar from the Demon Sealing Tombstone.</span></p>
 <p><span>The altar abruptly brightened like a lamp.</span></p>
 <p><span>The converging pieces of dragon soul looked like they had gained a tremendous amount of divine power in an instant. Innumerable nameless divine characters became imprinted into the evil dragon’s soul in an instant too.</span></p>
 <p><span>The form of the dragon soul that should’ve taken a long time to fully converge and appear suddenly became clear as the beast skulls, beast cores, spirit artifact fragments and other offerings suddenly vanished into the altar.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Crack!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The altar broke like a mirror as cracks appeared all over its surface. The cracks grew longer and more obvious as they swam like slithering snakes.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Bang!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The altar exploded in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span>A loud and heroic dragon roar rang from beneath the altar while the six spirits of Void and Chaos were busy snatching the pieces of the altar like crazed monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span>At the same time, the dragon soul hanging above the altar abruptly sank to the bottom.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Roar!”</span></p>
 <p><span>An evil dragon with sinister horns that was more than a hundred meters long spread its wings and flew out of the giant stone palace in terrific commotion.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Lord Gilbert has awakened!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Our lord has awakened!”</span></p>
 <p><span>“He finally woke up!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Every evil dragon scattered in separate underground palaces roared and cheered in the language of dragons excitedly when they heard their lord’s roar.</span></p>
 <p><span>The evil dragon Gilbert responded with an angry roar too.</span></p>
 <p><span>“You damnable reptiles! How dare you return to Spirit Realm after we accidentally let some of you slip thirty thousand years ago! Kill them all!”</span></p>
 <p><span>Gilbert charged out of the stone palace and charged right into the center of conflict where the three ghoul races and evil dragons were fighting. It flapped its wings and swung its claws everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span>Dozens of Earth Ghoul clansmen were instantly torn to shreds and turned into fleshy bits by Gilbert.</span></p>
 <p><span>While chewing the flesh of the three ghoul races’ clansmen and swearing loudly, Gilbert also breathed green flames at his hated enemies. Everywhere, the three ghoul races’ clansmen melted like they were submerged in a pool of sulfuric acid the moment they were touched by the flames.</span></p>
 <p><span>Countless ghouls were turned into bloody skeletons in no time at all.</span></p>
 <p><span>Gilbert continued to attack towards all directions and slaughtered everything in sight. Due to his awakening, the battle situation turned from a draw to a one-sided victory.</span></p>
 <p><span>The three ghoul races’ clansmen were either torn apart by Gilbert’s claws or melted by his green flames. They died in droves under his attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span>The one dozen or so evil dragons joined Gilbert to attack back and forth inside the underground palaces.</span></p>
 <p><span>Very soon, the three ghoul races that had slipped to the underground of the Absolute Yin Graveyard noticed that everything was going wrong for them.</span></p>
 <p><span>The remaining martial practitioners began running away with all their might as they tried to return to the earth surface.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Swoosh swoosh swoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span>The seven godly lights unleashed by the Demon Sealing Tombstone returned from the underground as Qin Lie abruptly opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What is it?” the group hastily asked.</span></p>
 <p><span>“The evil dragon with a true name has awakened!” Qin Lie exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span>Everyone looked pleasantly surprised. He Yi looked at the withdrawing godly light of the Demon Sealing Tombstone with a pondering look on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Does his swift awakening has something to do with the seven godly lights?” Luo Kexin exclaimed in astonishment.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie nodded slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span>“In the ancient times, during the War of the Hundred Races, although a large majority of the races had joined forces to fight against the Heaven Fighting Race, a few races still chose to serve the Heaven Fighting Race loyally as their masters.” He Yi rubbed his chin while looking at the Demon Sealing Tombstone. Suddenly, he said, “The Evil Dragon Race was one of the Heaven Fighting Race’s most loyal pawns. They once swore an eternal oath of loyalty to the Heaven Fighting Race.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Everyone looked at him in astonishment when he said this.</span></p>
 <p><span>He Yi continued to explain, “An evil dragon is naturally cruel, war-like, bloodthirsty, obscene, base and shameless…”</span></p>
 <p><span>“You basically won’t find much merits to speak of from this race. In fact, the only trait they have that can be considered a merit is that they keep to their promises. As long as the promise is made by their ancestors, they will never go back against the promise even in death.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“When the Heaven Fighting Race first invaded the Spirit Realm, it was said that the Evil Dragon Race was one of the greatest opposing powers of the time. They brought huge trouble to the Heaven Fighting Race, and they never stopped fighting the Heaven Fighting Race even when the human race, the Giant Dragon Race, the Ancient Beast race, the Dark Nether Race, and the Asura Race had submitted to the Heaven Fighting Race.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“In the end, it seems like the Heaven Fighting Race’s leader at the time finally managed to sway the leader of the Evil Dragon Race.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“After the evil race had sworn loyalty to the Heaven Fighting Race, they became a bloody spear in the Heaven Fighting Race’s hands and fought at the frontline alongside them.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Later on, after the Heaven Fighting Race had dominated all the races and became ruler of Spirit Realm, the Evil Dragon Race was hailed as the greatest contributor of the war and was highly regarded by the Heaven Fighting Race. They were granted vast domains and many auxiliary worlds.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“When the hundred races rose to fight against the Heaven Fighting Race, the Evil Dragon Race remained loyal to the Heaven Fighting Race and fought hard against the hundred races.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“In the end, the evil races suffered huge losses and fell quiet after the Heaven Fighting Race escaped to the space of outer realms. No one knows if they have gone extinct or merely went into hiding. Of course, some people also said that they had left Spirit Realm alongside the Heaven Fighting Race.”</span></p>
 <p><span>He Yi set his gaze on Qin Lie after the explanation, “The Demon Sealing Tombstone is the Heaven Fighting Race’s artifact. Maybe it shared a connection with the evil dragons and therefore aided it in awakening ahead of time.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Lie nodded after the initial surprise, “That evil dragon is leading its people and slaughtering the ghouls right now. In fact, they’re almost done killing everyone inside. The rest were doing their best to escape from the place. I think it’s our time to act now.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Mm, you’re right. Everyone, seal the entrances and kill all of the ghouls that make it to the top!” He Yi ordered.</span></p>
 <p><span>He was a master artificer and was highly respected among the people. That was why people obeyed his words easier.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Should we leave soon after we kill the escaping ghouls? That evil dragon with a true name isn’t something we can deal with.” Tu Muo said.</span></p>
 <p><span>“That is the plan!”</span></p>
 <p><span>And so the martial practitioners of the four forces spread out again above the Absolute Yin Graveyard.</span></p>
 <p><span>Every time they saw a clansman of the three ghoul races emerging from the underground holes, they would immediately greet them with countless spirit artifacts and attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span>The three ghoul races’ clansmen who fought so hard to make it to the surface died horribly under their attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span>An hour later, no ghoul was still living underground, and none made it to the surface alive either.</span></p>
 <p><span>They were killed either by the evil dragons or the humans above the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span>Surprisingly, the evil dragons didn’t charge out of the Absolute Yin Graveyard after killing the three ghoul races’ clansmen. They continued to hide underground.</span></p>
 <p><span>Worried that those dragons would switch targets to them, the group waited for a moment but didn’t see any dragons emerging from the entrances. They all let out a secret sigh of relief.</span></p>
 <p><span>“What do we do now?” The group turned to look at He Yi.</span></p>
 <p><span>He Yi couldn’t help but frown.</span></p>
 <p><span>Right now, the evil dragon Gilbert was crawling inside a stone palace while his subordinates were eating the flesh of the ghouls.</span></p>
 <p><span>A wisp of soul energy appeared vaguely and ephemerally inside the stone palace.</span></p>
 <p><span>Gilbert’s dark green eyes glowed with intimidating light. He seemed to be searching for something inside the stone palace.</span></p>
 <p><span>Deep inside his pupils, tiny divine character seemed to be gathering and assembling themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span>A while later, the divine character suddenly joined together to form a Blaze Family imprint.</span></p>
 <p><span>He shook abruptly when that happened.</span></p>
 <p><span>Almost at the same time, Qin Lie who was still above the Absolute Yin Graveyard felt his bloodline boil.</span></p>
 <p><span>The divine characters flew like butterflies inside his blood, speaking to him something that only he knew.</span></p>
 <p><span>He closed his eyes and scoured for the profound knowledge hidden inside bloodline with every bit of soul consciousness, extracting them for his own use.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Everyone, do you guys want to leave for the center of Prism Continent or someplace else?” A long time later, he opened his eyes and looked at the crowd. “I need to meet an evil dragon inside the underground stone palace of the Absolute Yin Graveyard.”</span></p>
