 <p><strong>Chapter 1256 Slowly Coming Close</strong></p>
 <p>"You’re so strange. Last time you clearly wanted to kill her. Why are you suddenly trying to help her?"</p>
 <p>Stanca was puzzled, but even more so, he was curious about the relationship between Qin Lie and Indigo. He thought they talked Indigo had left them.</p>
 <p>"A God Race mixed-blood and Spirit Seed of the Spirit Race. How did you two meet?" he asked.</p>
 <p>"I think that she has the answer," Qin Lie said indifferently.</p>
 <p>"She knows you?" Stanca was shocked.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie frowned slightly. "Tell me about her present situation."</p>
 <p>Stanca was silent for a moment and said, "You cannot even get close to her, how can you help her? The Spirit Race clansmen hate the God Race. If you dare appear now, they will immediately kill you."</p>
 <p>Qin Lie had a dark expression. He said, "I can change my identity."</p>
 <p>Stanca was shocked.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie took a deep breath and started to adjust the Blaze Family bloodline in his body and calmed it down.</p>
 <p>Under Stanca's gaze, the color of his eyes and hair turned from crimson red to pitch black.</p>
 <p>He took out a robe from his spatial ring and put away the martial practitioner robes that had the insignia of the Blaze Family.</p>
 <p>"What about now?" he asked.</p>
 <p>Stanca nodded and reacted. "I almost forgot you were a mixed-blood. You do not look like a member of the Blaze Family right now. But your appearance... has not changed greatly."</p>
 <p>"I need to know if I can help her. If need arises, I can change more," Qin Lie said.</p>
 <p>He had the masks Mo Hai and the others had made in his spatial ring. If he needed to, he could completely transform.</p>
 <p>The premise was that he had to know if he could help Indigo.</p>
 <p>For some reason, when he heard that Indigo was in trouble from Stanca, he felt restless.</p>
 <p>The scene of Indigo looking at him from the darkness constantly appeared in his mind and could not be wiped from it.</p>
 <p>He seemed to feel there really was a connection between him and Indigo.</p>
 <p>However, up until now, he did not know what the relationship between them was.</p>
 <p>"Maybe she can give me an answer," he thought inside.</p>
 <p>"You can help her, I am sure of this. However, she can only tell you how to do that once you get close," Stanca said.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie thought for a while and said, "Lead the way."</p>
 <p>Stanca was slightly shocked and said, "Are you sure you will go? You are not afraid that I will lie and betray you?"</p>
 <p>Qin Lie looked deeply at him and said, "If you betray me, I will kill every Winged Race clansman in the Origin World!"</p>
 <p>Stanca's expression darkened and he said angrily, "You think you can do it?"</p>
 <p>"If I attack you in my state from last time, are you confident you can stop me?" Qin Lie said slowly.</p>
 <p>"After merging the Flesh Filling Tombstone?" Stanca's gaze turned scattered.</p>
 <p>"It seems you know everything," Qin Lie said coolly.</p>
 <p>"She told us. I had not expected that the God Race would deploy two Flesh Filling Tombstones.</p>
 <p>“Also, hasn't the Blaze Family's Flesh Filling Tombstone been lost for a long time? Why did it suddenly appear with you?" Stanca was even more curious.</p>
 <p>"Aren’t you a little too curious?" Qin Lie mocked.</p>
 <p>Stanca did not immediately reply. He thought seriously for a while and then sighed, "If you were to fight me in that state, I am not a match for you."</p>
 <p>As he said this, he seemed to admit defeat and walked away.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie stilled and reacted. He then took out a mask to cover his face from the spatial ring and changed his identity.</p>
 <p>"What race are you right now?" Stanca asked him, his back to Qin LIe.</p>
 <p>"What do you mean?" Qin Lie said in confusion.</p>
 <p>"I have to tell the Spirit Race your identity," Stanca explained.</p>
 <p>"Oh." Qin Lie reacted and said, "The human race."</p>
 <p>"Human race..." Stanca murmured lowly. "I have never heard of this race."</p>
 <p>He said no more and kept walking forward, towards the Spirit Race gathering spot.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie quietly followed him from behind.</p>
 <p>The person he feared most from the Spirit Race was coincidentally the little girl Indigo. He did not think much of all the other Spirit Race clansmen.</p>
 <p>Even if his identity was exposed, he could use the Tombstone Fusion Art to merge the Flesh Filling Tombstone into his flesh and get temporary boost in strength.</p>
 <p>He trusted that he didn’t need to fear attacks from the Spirit Race at his current power level.</p>
 <p>Especially when Indigo was in trouble.</p>
 <p>Due to this, he did not worry that Stanca would betray him or that someone in the Spirit Race would recognize him.</p>
 <p>A short while later.</p>
 <p>He appeared with Stanca from the darkness and walked to where the Spirit, Bone and Winged Races were gathered.</p>
 <p>"Stanca, who is he?"</p>
 <p>Salleh of the Bone Race couldn't help but ask when he saw Stanca suddenly appear with a strange youth after leaving not long ago.</p>
 <p>In a flash, the clansmen of the Spirit, Bone and Winged Races looked at Stanca.</p>
 <p>Stanca had a calm expression and said, "A member of the human race. When he went close to the Origin Sea, he was driven away by the Abyss Devils. I detected unusual soul vibrations and went to look. Coincidentally found him."</p>
 <p>"Human race..." Salleh's expression changed slightly. His eyes flashed with unusual light as he curiously examined the disguised Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>He had found Qin Lie before and talked to Qin Lie about Hua Zang. He naturally knew that Qin Lie was a mixed-blood of that race and the God Race.</p>
 <p>When Stanca suddenly brought a member of the human race over, he naturally paid attention.</p>
 <p>"Human race? Never heard of this race."</p>
 <p>"Why have you led him here?"</p>
 <p>"Stanca, why do you care about his life or death?"</p>
 <p>The Spirit Race clansmen were puzzled after Stanca explained and did not know what he was thinking.</p>
 <p>"This guy can help your Young Mistress. That’s why I brought him over," Stanca said.</p>
 <p>"Nonsense! How can he help the Young Mistress?" Bagi shouted.</p>
 <p>Sienna's expression changed as well and she said, "Stanca, what do you mean? You think your Winged Race can do as you want now that our Young Mistress is in a bit of trouble?"</p>
 <p>The other Spirit Race clansmen had grave expressions, the tension rising.</p>
 <p>They all misunderstood the situation, thinking Stanca brought someone over to attack them now that their Young Mistress was not capable of fighting.</p>
 <p>Many clansmen of the Bone Race instinctively gathered around Salleh and looked at him in confusion.</p>
 <p>Salleh shook his head and indicated for them to not move and watch.</p>
 <p>"Previously your Young Mistress and I talked alone so I believe she needs some help. This youth of the human race is the most useful help I can find for her." Stanca first comforted the Winged Race clansmen so that they calmed down. Then he said sincerely, "Please wait a moment, I can mentally communicate with your Young Mistress and have her explain."</p>
 <p>Therefore, under the shocked gazes of the clansmen of the three races, Stanca closed his eyes and mentally communicated with Indigo.</p>
 <p>"He came, he will help you. I do not know whether to trust him, talk with your own clansmen." Stanca passed his thoughts through his bloodline secret art to Indigo who was not in a good state.</p>
 <p>Indigo's long eyelashes fluttered as though she was about to open her eyes. However, after a while, she still could not open them.</p>
 <p>She said in a small and weak voice to Bagi and Sienna, "Have him come over, alone. Do not let Stanca close, I don’t trust Stanca."</p>
 <p>Baji and Sienna urgently wanted to persuade her otherwise.</p>
 <p>At this time, an older Spirit Race clansman took a deep breath and said, "We will unconditionally obey all of Young Mistress's orders!"</p>
 <p>Bagi and Sienna immediately closed their mouths.</p>
 <p>"Have him come over." This person walked out of the crowd and pointed at Qin Lie. Then he said to Stanca, "You stay where you are."</p>
 <p>"Oh, I did not plan to go over," Stanca touched his mouth and said coolly.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie nodded and expressionlessly walked towards the Spirit Race.</p>
 <p>All the clansmen of the Spirit Race stared at him nervously, afraid he would make a move on their leader.</p>
