 <p><strong>Chapter 570: Feeding</strong></p>
 <p><span style>“Yiya! Yiya! Yiya…!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three miraculous entities, which Qin Lie now realized were tiny versions of the fire, wood, and thunder spirits, were glued to Qin Lie’s face as they shook their heads in excitement and joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A grimace took over Qin Lie’s face. He had no idea what was going on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These three tiny beings basically looked the same as the Fire Qilin, the Thunder Crystal Beast, and the wood spirit. Only the little person with skin that resembled the bark of a tree didn’t look exactly like the wood spirit. Instead, it looked similar to a member of the Wood Race.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The auras of these tiny beings, however, were completely different from those of the Fire Qilin, the Thunder Crystal Beast, and the wood spirit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These three tiny entities constantly underwent wondrous changes. They would seem tangible one moment, but when Qin Lie looked at them again, they’d be intangible souls that, if he reached out to touch them, would feel like empty space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was what Qin Lie found extremely difficult to believe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A being that could transition between a physical body and a soul form? One that could easily switch between the two at will?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie just couldn’t comprehend it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the three little entities appeared, they incessantly bothered him as though they were playing around. This prevented him from focusing on refining the essences of the remaining spirits, leaving him frustrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The insulation diagram of the cultivation room could block sound. However, it wasn’t good enough to properly block power fluctuations. Once the tiny entities had been out for a while, Song Tingyu, Xie Jingxuan, and Xue Moyan sensed them. They left the rooms they were in and headed for Qin Lie in the cultivation room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon entering the cultivation room, Song Tingyu was the first to shriek in delight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What adorable little guys!” she exclaimed, reaching out to grab them without thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as she did, the three tiny beings immediately went intangible. Song Tingyu grasped at them, but realized she didn’t touch anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was almost as if she were trying to touch a ghost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dead souls?” Song Tingyu asked in shock. “Are these dead souls?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!” Xie Jingxuan exclaimed, her eyes shining with astonishing light. “They possess strong life forces and biomagnetic fields! They definitely aren’t souls of the dead!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Such potent soul fluctuations! These pure, clean souls… these are characteristics unique to a Pure Soul Spring!” Xue Moyan said, going pale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are these tiny beings, Qin Lie?” Song Tingyu asked, a strange expression on her face. “Are they children of the fire, wood, and thunder spirits?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know what they are.” Qin Lie grimaced. He thought for a moment, then explained, “The blood essences I refined from those three spirits mixed with three of the Pure Soul Springs. They were the ones to drain me of my soul energy and blood. It’s as if they were forged within my body like spirit artifacts…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His words astounded the three women.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are they completely new entities separate from the spirits?” Xue Moyan asked warily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They probably would qualify as new entities.” Qin Lie nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This statement left Song Tingyu, Xie Jingxuan, and Xue Moyan even more amazed. They stared at Qin Lie with gazes that seemed capable of spitting fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yiya! Yiya!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the tiny entity shaped like a Fire Qilin became tangible again, landed on Qin Lie’s shoulder, and sat back on its hind legs. It patted its stomach with its two front hooves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It… it seems to hungry,” Xie Jingxuan said in astonishment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tiny being’s movements clearly indicated that it was hungry and asking Qin Lie for something to eat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yiya, yiya…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two other tiny entities mirrored the first, patting their stomachs as if demanding food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They look pitiful!” Song Tingyu said, hurriedly taking some dried meat and fruit to give to them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Jingxuan and Xue Moyan also took out food for them to eat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the three tiny beings didn’t even look at the fruit and meat they took out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They just stared at Qin Lie, continuing to pat their stomachs and cry out in discontent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why don’t you try giving them food?” Song Tingyu asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Somewhat surprised, Qin Lie took out fruit and meat from his own spatial ring and handed them to the three little ones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tiny beings didn’t even look at the food. They wore anxious expressions that made it seem as if they were extremely hungry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They aren’t like us,” Xie Jingxuan said in realization. “They must not eat things like meat or fruit. Try something else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Something else?” Qin Lie frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a moment of thought, he pulled out everything he had in his spatial ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A variety of things including Heavenly Flame Crystals, the Astral Thunder Hammer, the wooden sculpture, spirit stones, an assortment of pills, and materials for forging Terminator Profound Bombs spilled out of spatial ring and onto the floor of the cultivation room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Woo~ooh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three tiny beings immediately cried out in excitement, leaping onto the spirit materials and gorging themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entity shaped like a Fire Qilin grabbed the a Heavenly Flame Crystal Qin Lie got from the Forbidden Land of Fire and began crunching mouthfuls of it as though it were chewing up a bone. Once it broke the Heavenly Flame Crystal into pieces, it happily swallowed them up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tiny being that resembled a Thunder Crystal Beast targeted the spirit materials meant for forging Terminator Profound Bombs. It devoured many of the beast cores that contained the power of thunder and lightning and even some of the Thunderblitz wood Qin Lie had taken from the thunder lagoon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The small person with skin that looked like tree bark circled the pile of materials on the floor. It initially didn’t find anything to eat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it suddenly locked on to one of the wooden sculptures, the one that Xie Jingxuan had obtained from the Forbidden Land of Wood. Without warning, it moved to that sculpture and bit off a piece of it, happily munching away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie, Song Tingyu, Xie Jingxuan, and Xue Moyan collectively gasped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn it!” Qin Lie screamed after a moment of shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He then wrenched the wooden sculpture from the tiny person’s mouth, immediately putting it and the wooden sculpture his grandfather had left him back into the spatial ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These two wooden sculptures were crucial to Qin Lie’s quest to find his grandfather. If this little person ate them, he’d lose important clues.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah ah ah! Yiya!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bark-skinned little person shouted miserably at Qin Lie, clearly dismayed by him taking the wooden sculpture away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It seemed to be blaming him for treating it unfairly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of the other two tiny entities, one was eating a Heavenly Flame Crystal, and the other was eating the main material needed to make Terminator Profound Bombs. Since it was the only one that didn’t have anything to eat, it naturally became unhappy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just as I suspected,” Xie Jingxuan said, taking a few tree branches out of her spatial ring and gently placing them on the floor. “They don’t eat the same things we do.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon smelling something good to eat, the little humanoid entity that had been crying at Qin Lie immediately abandoned him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It picked up the tree branches and started eating happily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As it ate, it looked up at Xie Jingxuan, delight showing in its tiny eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jingxuan, it feels comfortable with you since you received the inheritance of the Wood Race!” Song Tingyu exclaimed in realization.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Jingxuan focused on the tiny person, a genuine smile appearing on her usually cold face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eat slower,” she said softly. “I have a lot more where that came from.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing her smile, Qin Lie momentarily lost himself and said, “You look beautiful when you smile.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he said that, Xie Jingxuan’s smile disappeared and a frown replaced it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be stupid,” she said with a snort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie awkwardly rubbed his nose, then changed the topic saying, “These three little guys are going to be trouble.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Trouble?” Song Tingyu said, her curiosity piqued. “I can raise them if you don’t want to. They’re adorable!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They may not accept you.” Xue Moyan shook her head. “Their auras are very similar to Qin Lie’s. I feel like they’ll only accept Qin Lie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>By the time she said this, the tiny being shaped like a Fire Qilin had eaten many Heavenly Flame Crystals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After playing and satisfying its hunger, it seemed as though it wanted to sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone watched in a daze as it stretched in a lazy, content manner, flew up to the Soul Suppressing Orb in the space between Qin Lie’s eyebrows, and disappeared within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon after that, the other two tiny beings quickly satisfied their hunger. They lazily flew up to the Soul Suppressing Orb and slipped into it as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t think you’ll be able to adopt them, Sister Tingyu,” Xie Jingxuan said calmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her eyes held a hint of disappointment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The small being with bark for skin had given her a wondrous feeling. She felt strangely close to it and wanted to get even closer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a pity that the little guy clearly trusted Qin Lie alone. After satisfying its hunger, it immediately returned to Qin Lie’s body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She couldn’t do anything about that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh… about those tree branches…” Qin Lie said after a moment of shock. “Could you give me some? I don’t have any of that kind of spirit material. If these little guys get hungry again and come out, I’m afraid that one will continue to try eating my wooden sculptures.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Jingxuan rolled her eyes at him and took out some tree branches.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pay attention,” she said as she gave them to him. “That tiny being probably eats only spirit materials that contain wood energy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mn,” Qin Lie exclaimed, haphazardly storing all of the spirit materials. “I can see that.”</span></p>
