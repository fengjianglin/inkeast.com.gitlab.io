 <p><b>Chapter 754: Another Strong Enemy</b></p>
 <p><span style>East of the Heavenly Slaughter Continent, there was a desolate and endless ocean with many islands scattered about it. This territory belonged to the eastern barbarians.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no life on the islands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On that morning, before the sun appeared, a gray shadow twisted and manifested high above the clouds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gray shadow turned into Bhutto.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bhutto’s dark eyes looked around the surroundings eerily. His short body suddenly fell down towards the clouds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sea of clouds was vast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet as Bhutto’s bodies started releasing spatial cracks, the cracks made this space look like a spider web, or a shattered mirror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These were cracks even in the firmament.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crack crack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sounds of stone shattering came from the space around Bhutto. It was a sound of a blocked passageway slowly splitting apart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some time later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As more and more spatial rifts appeared, a dark and deep passageway was revealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An ancient, and noxiously rotten smell came out of the passageway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh whoosh whoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bhutto created dozens of spatial blades that cut the passageway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When threads of black light came out of the passageway, Bhutto’s eyes released light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, he burrowed sharply into the passageway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The passageway slowly expanded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Six hours later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A gray shadow flew out of the passageway and formed a figure of Bhutto. His eyes were dim, a clear sign of exhaustion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He waited with anticipation written all over his face at the entrance of the passageway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The skeleton of a rotting giant lizard that was thousands of meters long slowly popped its head out of the dark passageway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A tall and thin foreign race with blue faces and fangs stood on the head of the skeleton. They held all kinds of bone weapons, their eyes glowing blue as they looked grimly at the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person at the front wore all kinds of bone necklaces and bracelets. He held a skull staff as he excitedly shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bhutto!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah, Bergson, you are still alive!” Bhutto gave a smile that could scare people to tears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You helped us create the space passageway? Is this… really our homeland?” The old foreigner called Bergson asked in a trembling voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Behind him, all of the other blue-faced ferocious looking people were filled with anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, this is the main world! The Spirit Realm that once belonged to us Heaven Ghouls and you Blue Ghouls!” Bhutto laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ve finally returned. After thirty thousand years, we finally step onto our homeland again!” Bergson sobbed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd of Blue Ghouls cried tears of joy as they trembled all over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about Heaven Fighting Race? Are they still dominating this place?” Bergson cried for a while when he abruptly thought of the important matter. His eyes were full of terror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The era of the Heaven Fighting Race has ended. They were defeated by the united races, and fled for faraway space. They have not returned for a long time,” Bhutto snickered. “Old man, you would never see it coming… the current rulers of this world are humans!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Humans? The humans we always treated as food? Other than their astounding reproductive ability, what else do they have?” Bergson laughed disdainfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am also curious.” Bhutto shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah, the disappearance of the Heaven Fighting Race means that our time has come back!” Bergson waved the skull staff and said, “Where’s the Earth Ghoul Race? As one of the three great ghoul races, where are they?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know where they are hiding. After accommodating you, I will immediately leave and have the Earth Ghoul Race return to their home as well!” Bhutto laughed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you waiting for?” Bergson urged. “I haven’t seen Andrew for a long time. I wonder if he’s still alive.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, I’ll go create a passage to the Earth Ghoul Race immediately!” Bhutto nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Space threads formed on his body as his figure gradually blurred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dozens of seconds later, Bhutto disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, the flying spirit artifact made from the skeleton of the giant lizard completely flew out of the passageway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bergson found his bearings. He pointed at the Heavenly Slaughter Continent with his skull staff and ordered, “Go that way. Kill every human along the way!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>On an enormous black iron ship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Forefather Terminator and Feng Yi of Heavenly Artifact Sect, Qi Yang of Ten Thousand Beast Mountain, Yu Lingwei of Illusory Demon Sect, Luo Nan and others of Heavenly Sword Mountain finally arrived. They decided to surround Prism Continent and kill all members of the Heaven Ghoul Race.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The four great Silver rank forces moved as several flying artifacts roared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the eyes of those in charge, the only threat was the Heaven Ghoul Race. Everything else was inconsequential.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Once the fires of battle burn, remember to not run around recklessly. Try to stay near me.” While Nan Zhengtian was talking with Feng Yi and the others, Xu Ran found Qin Lie at the rear and informed him, “The Heaven Ghoul clansmen will try to kill you first. My wife and I will be responsible for your safety.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh.” Qin Lie said absent-mindedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You have other thoughts?” Xu Ran inquired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, Xu Ran, his wife and Lin Liang’er were on the black iron ship at the rear, the same as Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing.” Qin Lie shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard some news.” Shen Yue came out of nowhere. “It seems that the Setting Sun Islands have encountered some problems.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Problems? What kind of problems?” Xu Ran was puzzled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I heard that Illusory Demon Sect stopped selling spirit materials to Setting Sun Islands. This has caused the martial practitioners of the Setting Sun Islands and the artificers of Gray Island to have enormous amounts of spirit stones but no way to spend them.” Shen Yue said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How do you know?” Qin Lie was shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m responsible for Terminator Sect’s intelligence gathering,” Shen Yue explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yu Lingwei and Mo Lingye are extremely close. How can a conflict like this occur between Illusory Demon Sect and Blood Fiend Sect?” Xu Ran’s gaze was bewildered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It might not be Yu Lingwei’s intention,” Shen Yue said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?” Xu Ran frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shen Yue looked towards Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie explained in a few words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s nothing big.” Xu Ran said after listening, “If Blood Fiend Sect is uncomfortable at the Setting Sun Islands, they can move near the Heavenly Calamity Continent. Terminator Sect doesn’t have such complex relationships in our ranks. We all listen to Old Monster Nan. As long as he consents, no one dares to disobey. No one would do anything against his orders and go against their own side.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blood Fiend Sect just managed to establish themselves on the Setting Sun Islands, they built palaces, made wards, they must have spent great deal of energy. If they move not even two years after, they will have lost greatly.” Shen Yue continued, “Also, they had just conquered Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion. Gold Sun Island is also there. They cannot just leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then it is troublesome.” Xu Ran didn’t have a solution. “Terminator Sect is too far from the Setting Sun Islands. It is really not convenient to trade enormous amounts of spirit materials. We cannot help.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If Luo Han of Celestial Artifact Sect was willing to act and help the Setting Sun Islands build the best artifact teleportation formation, then this would be resolved,” Shen Yue said with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She seemed to have learned about all the hard problems Qin Lie had encountered and knew how to resolve them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie was slightly shocked and looked at her. He didn’t know why this Shen Yue was so interested in his matters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That old Luo Han?” Xu Ran’s face darkened. He shook his head and said, “Hard! It will be difficult to ask him to act!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they conversed, Tong Zhenzhen and Lin Liang’er only listened. They did not express any opinions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tong Zhenzhen seemed to be disinterested in sect matters like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Either move closer to us, submit to Illusory Demon Sect, or ask Luo Han to act. These are the only three choices.” Shen Yue looked deeply at Qin Lie and said wryly, “What will you choose?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie said, “Certainly not the second option.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really stubborn.” Shen Yue’s eyes lit up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shen Yue, I’m not skilled in matters like this and am not used to using my mind on these matters.” Xu Ran thought and then said with a chuckle, “Help Qin Lie. I know you will have a solution, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are solutions.” Shen Yue narrowed her eyes and bit softly at her lower lip. “But why should I help him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qin Lie is one of our own.” Xu Ran suddenly started laughing again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? Really?” Shen Yue looked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie was shocked. He looked at Xu Ran and then at Shen Yue. He kept on feeling something was not quite right.</span></p>
