 <p><b>Chapter 699: Fortune from Misfortune</b></p>
 <p><span style>Just as La Pu had said, the Limit Sublimation Art was an extraordinary secret technique.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When his physical body and the soul were frozen, and only the power of the bloodline could be mobilized with his emotions, it was impossible to cast any spirit art.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In such an unusual state, the Limit Sublimation Art that Duan Qianjie had taught him was not restricted by the wards at all. He could continue to cultivate it in this strange state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As an ice statue, Qin Lie could clearly feel a kind of mysterious power forming out of his body. Albeit minuscule, this power did exist, and was slowly nurturing his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gradually recovered his senses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Limit Sublimation Art would not cause his spirit power to grow, would not cause his soul power to rise, and would not influence his Soul Lake and True Soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a secret method that developed the potential of the physical body, slowly uncovering the its secret, increasing one’s talent and also increasing one’s bloodline power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sealed in the ice and having all of his cultivation methods and arts rendered useless, Qin Lie concentrated on the Limit Sublimation Art and immersed himself in the cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gradually lost track of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some time later, when he was still cultivating the Limit Sublimation Art, he saw the elegant Ice Phoenix come from the outside and land on a crystal palace of ice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Phoenix had clearly been in a fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Its beautiful and crystal feathers were covered in dust and scattered blood. Only its eyes were still cold and sharp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After it returned in its phoenix form, its ice-like feathers retracted. They formed an enormous ball of ice that glittered with icy light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the ball shattered, the Ice Phoenix once again turned into a naked young human girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie focused and found that this human body didn’t have any wounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This meant that the Ice Phoenix should have won the battle outside. Those dragonmen, lizardmen, and the subordinates of Forefather Dark Wind might have been frozen and turned into new statues to be sealed in other glaciers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the Ice Phoenix turned human, it walked around the frost palace naked and continued to learn to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie silently practiced the Limit Sublimation Art.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He found that in this special state, he could continue to practice the Limit Sublimation Art without worrying about being interrupted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, one had to exhaust themselves in battle to obtain a chance to cultivate the Limit Sublimation Art for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One could not maintain the state of absolute exhaustion of soul power, spirit power and physical body. This meant that the cultivation of the Limit Sublimation Art couldn’t be sustained for long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Duan Qianjie started to cultivate the Limit Sublimation Art, he had been going around challenging people stronger than him to push himself to his limits, just to be able to cultivate Limit Sublimation Art for a brief moment. He would then unleash his potential and enhance his cultivation talent, which ultimately allowed him to possess his current strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Qin Lie could continue to cultivate like this without needing to fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He suddenly rejoiced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If not for the Ice Phoenix’s unique seal of ice, if he hadn’t been put into such an unusual state, he would not have been able to cultivate this astounding Limit Sublimation Art for so long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time passed...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie was still cultivating the Limit Sublimation Art in his frozen state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One day, he felt Frost Island tremble violently again. He saw the frost palaces shake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Phoenix once again flew out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several days later, the Ice Phoenix returned in the body of a human female. Her picturesque face showed hints of exhaustion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On her back there were a dozen wounds of different severity, some of which were even bone deep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie watched as she walked into an ice palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the following days, it did not come out of the palace, and did not move around in its naked state nor try to practice the human language.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was recovering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she managed to recover from her wounds and leave the frost palace, Frost Island shook violently once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This time, even Qin Lie who was frozen in ice at the bottom of Frost Island felt a wave of trepidation inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew that someone truly strong had come to Frost Island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Phoenix changed into its original form and once again spread its wings, elegantly leaving through a crack in the ice above.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not good…” Qin Lie shook his head inwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew that the Ice Phoenix that had not healed from its wounds yet would face a great opponent this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Phoenix might be heavily injured or killed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as he had expected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the Ice Phoenix left the frost palace, he felt that Frost Island was constantly tremuring. The terrifying vibrations caused several of the palaces deep in the Frost Island to shatter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The violent tremors continued for an hour and then suddenly stilled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A short amount of time later, the Ice Phoenix landed on the ice crystal palace covered in blood. When she landed, she immediately changed into the shape of young human female and then fell at the feet of the enormous ice sculpture of Ice Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood slowly seeped out of her body. In the cold air, the blood immediately turned into blood crystals of ice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From far away, it looked as though a red crystals had wrapped around her body. She seemed to have sealed herself in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her eyes were tightly closed, and her long eyelashes didn’t tremble at all. Her soul aura also became weak and subdued.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She seemed to have gone unconscious from her serious injuries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cracks that had opened on the ice wall above the ice palace seemed to slowly heal under the influence of the cold energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This ice palace once again returned to a sealed state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wisps of white cold mist with flashing symbols mixed within came out of the ice walls, pillars, and shattered pieces of the ice palace. A visible ice seal slowly formed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Entire frost palace was shrouded in the white cold mist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie noticed that the extremely cold energy flowing from the walls, pillars and stones turned into mysterious ice power that wrapped around the walls of the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the effect of the ice power, the outer walls of the frost palace became colder and stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie immediately realized that the Ice Phoenix was wounded gravely this time. Before she became unconscious, she used a secret technique to activate the strongest ice seal of the ice palace, and used the remaining wards that the Ice Emperor had left to seal this palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She knew that she could no longer fight back so she made sure no one could invade this palace when she was unconscious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During her slumber, Frost Island once again became full of action.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people that came into Frost Island seemed to be searching for an entrance all over the island hoping to find her. As a result, they were destroying the glaciers all over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the initial shock, Qin Lie calmed down and continued to cultivate the Limit Sublimation Art.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zzt zzzt zzt!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiny flows of electricity formed in his muscles, bones, flesh and organs. They seemed to be cleansing his flesh, and using a mysterious method to nourish his body and excavate his potential.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could feel the blaze divine characters imprinted on his bones and flesh suddenly become unusually lively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bloodline power that had recovered by almost three tenths started giving off waves of heat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blood that had been frozen slowly started to melt under the help of the blaze divine characters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Time slowly passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After an unknown period of time, he suddenly stopped being able to practice the Limit Sublimation Art he had been able to cultivate all this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, he found that his frozen blood started to wake and surged wildly!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The terrifying aura that carried the smell of sulphur awakened, turning blood in his veins into burning lava..</span></p>
 <p><span style>His bloodline power was rising!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cold power that had frozen his body, soul, and spirit sea quickly melted as his blood boiled and the blaze divine characters became active.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seconds later, Qin Lie suddenly shook. He felt as though his soul had woken up. His soul consciousness could spread outwards. The spirit power in his spirit sea felt as though it was filled to the brim and moved towards his soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Snap snap snap!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wondrously, when he woke up, popping sounds came from his meridians, each of them seemingly filled with joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Drip! Drip!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the ice melted, it dripped off his body. The icy water carried the aura of the blazing flames and steamed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t feel any cold in his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His spirit sea, bones, flesh, Soul Lake, and True Soul immediately recovered to their usual state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was not in a hurry to move. He first calmed his emotions, suppressing the savage anger to stop the power of the bloodline from producing the blazing waves of heat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After calming down, he retracted the burning flames back into his body like tongues of flame. The blaze divine characters returned and imprinted themselves on his bones and flesh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He regained feeling in his limbs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was still in the early stages of the Fulfillment Realm. His cultivation had not grown. It didn’t change at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he felt as though he had been completely changed, his body reformed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He found that his mind was clear, his thinking had become faster. He was even able to solve multiple problems at the same time as though he could multitask.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stretching out his soul consciousness, he immediately that its range and penetrative ability had greatly increased. Even his perception had been enhanced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Circulating spirit power was akin to controlling a surging river through many channels. Now, the channels had been broadened, increasing the amount of spirit power they could hold, thicker, and even the speed at which the spirit power circulated had increased!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a moment of thought, he took out piece of dried rank five spirit beast meat and swallowed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He carefully inspected the changes in his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gradually, his eyes became brighter, and his expression more joyful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He found that his stomach was now able to hold even more food, and his ability to digest had also been enhanced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This meant that he could eat more food in one sitting and absorb it even faster!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This meant that the recovery of his physical body and his bloodline would increase in speed as well!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew that other than the lack of change in his cultivation, he had undergone a complete transformation!</span></p>
