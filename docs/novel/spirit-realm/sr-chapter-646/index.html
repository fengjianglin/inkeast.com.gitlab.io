 <p><strong>Chapter 646: An Interesting Person!</strong></p>
 <p>Duan Qianjie’s completely random question caused the Scarlet Tide Continent crowd to look astonished. They stared at Tang Siqi and him in puzzlement.</p>
 <p>Right now, not far away from the crowd, Qin Lie had become embroiled in a difficult battle once more.</p>
 <p>Tang Siqi hesitated only for a moment before she answered Duan Qianjie’s question honestly. “Tang Beidou was a clan elder of my Tang Family a few generations ago.”</p>
 <p>“We, the Tang Family, are only a small Black Iron rank force on the Scarlet Tide Continent. The Tang Family clansmen love to travel and roam the world. That was how Tang Beidou travelled to the Land of Chaos. Many years had passed since then. There was one time martial practitioner from the Land of Chaos happened to pass by the Scarlet Tide Continent suddenly visited the Tang Family and said that he was asked by Tang Beidou to pass this bracelet to the patriarch of the Tang Family. He said that if a Tang Family descendant ever went to the Land of Chaos, they may search for Tang Beidou using the bracelet.”</p>
 <p>“So you haven’t lied after all,” Feng Rong said suddenly.</p>
 <p>When they were leaving the ultimate blood ground, Tang Siqi had insisted on joining them with her reason being to find that old Tang Family clansman.</p>
 <p>At the time, both Feng Rong or Mo Hai assumed that it was just an excuse of hers to come along to the Land of Chaos and find Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>They didn’t think that there really was a Tang Family clansman at the Land of Chaos, and that he had even left behind a keepsake so that the descendants of the Tang Family could find him.</p>
 <p>“I see.” Duan Qianjie nodded and pondered for a moment. Then, he said, “Are you sure you want to find Tang Beidou?”</p>
 <p>“Ah?” Tang Siqi looked surprised and grew a little panicky. She hurriedly said, “I, I’m not in that much of a hurry…”</p>
 <p>Duan Qianjie took a step forwards.</p>
 <p>He extended a finger and pointed at Tang Siqi’s forehead from afar. A bright yellow light that was both gentle and warm landed straight at her forehead.</p>
 <p>“Whoosh!”</p>
 <p>Clumps of scarlet flames abruptly burst out of Tang Siqi’s body. The flames leaped erratically and discharged high heat energy.</p>
 <p>“S-senior!” Tang Siqi cried out in shock.</p>
 <p>She discovered that the fire spirit energy in her dantian’s spirit sea had suddenly gone out of control. They burned and erupted along with Duan Qianjie’s power.</p>
 <p>She didn’t know what Duan Qianjie was planning to do, which was why she looked anxious and worried.</p>
 <p>“Your constitution is fine, and your foundation is solid. Unfortunately, you have not spent any effort in constructing your physical body,” Duan Qianjie narrowed his eyes and carefully examined Tang Siqi from head to toe. Then, he withdrew the yellow light and said, “Give me your bracelet. I’ll find Tang Beidou for you. He must have his own considerations for leaving a keepsake behind for his descendants on purpose, but… the spirit art you cultivate is too gentle even though it is of the fire attribute. It is very suitable to forge artifacts, but it is a little lacking in terms of combat.”</p>
 <p>While saying this, Duan Qianjie showed his hand and motioned for Tang Siqi to take off her bracelet.</p>
 <p>The Scarlet Tide Continent crowd looked back and forth between the blood-soaked Qin Lie and Tang Siqi.</p>
 <p>Tang Siqi suddenly looked hesitant.</p>
 <p>“Is there a problem?” Duan Qianjie looked surprised.</p>
 <p>“What happens when we find Tang Beidou?” Tang Siqi suddenly asked.</p>
 <p>“What happens?” Duan Qianjie’s eyes suddenly looked strange. “It won’t be bad no matter what it is. As for what he might do, I’m not really sure. I’m not him after all.” Duan Qianjie paused for a moment before asking further. “What exactly are you worried about?”</p>
 <p>Since Duan Qianjie’s arrival, the Black Voodoo Cult and three great families martial practitioners around the area had scuttled off knowingly. There were no more new enemies who dared to show their faces there.</p>
 <p>The eight god corpses were also surrounding the island like guardians and intimidating the faraway enemies.</p>
 <p>Therefore, the Scarlet Tide Continent crowd was temporarily safe. They suddenly had a lot of time to observe the situation.</p>
 <p>Even Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan’s opponents were obviously being suppressed. It was only a matter of time before they were defeated.</p>
 <p>That was why they were all growing curious about Duan Qianjie and paid close attention to his conversation with Tang Siqi. They were all looking at them.</p>
 <p>“I, I was w-worried that…” Tang Siqi stuttered and struggled for a long time before she finally managed to say, “I think that my life now is pretty good, and I don’t want to leave the Setting Sun Islands just yet. I… don’t want to leave everyone.”</p>
 <p>When she said “everyone,” she subconsciously cast a glance at Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>A moment of surprise later, Duan Qianjie quickly came to realization and said, “In that case I shall do no unnecessary things. However, since you’ve come to the Land of Chaos and worn this bracelet on your person, Tang Beidou himself will come look for you once he is done with his seclusion.”</p>
 <p>“How is my… clan elder?” Tang Siqi asked anxiously.</p>
 <p>“How is he, you ask?” Duan Qianjie’s expression looked odd. A moment of thinking later, an awkward smile actually appeared on his slightly stiff face. “Beidou is a very interesting person.”</p>
 <p>Tang Siqi opened her mouth in great surprise. “Interesting…” That was not the answer she was looking for.</p>
 <p>But Duan Qianjie didn’t say anything else.</p>
 <p>His focus was either on Qin Lie or the sky above them.</p>
 <p>When the group chased after his gaze, they saw that a part of the sky was flooded by infinite colors of blood as an intense battle ensued.</p>
 <p>The color of blood was very deep. They could vaguely see a several hundred meters wide blood jade two-level Soul Altar hovering in the sky. On the Soul Altar, Jiang Zhuzhe had transformed into a unique blood demon and started unleashing a terrific power of destruction.</p>
 <p>There were two balls of black light around the bloody light. They were glowing inside the thick smoke as two blurry voodoo insects several hundred meters long surrounded the two Soul Altars that looked like black jade. They howled fiercely, charged into the color of blood and clashed against the blood demon from time to time.</p>
 <p>The space in that area looked like it was collapsing as an astounding amount of energy spread towards the far end of the sky like giant tides of a vast sea.</p>
 <p>Rainbows and clouds were instantly scattered into nothingness after they were blasted by the energy waves.</p>
 <p>Any martial practitioner below the Nirvana Realm that was in the area instantly exploded into fleshy bits.</p>
 <p>That area was the real forbidden area of the Setting Sun Islands. All non-Soul Altar experts who entered that area recklessly would only be met with death.</p>
 <p>Lang Xie’s bloody eyes were transfixed at that area as an abnormal shade of red surfaced on his face. He felt overwhelmed by emotions as a yearning for strength surged inside his heart.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie’s battle was far, far less significant compared to the intense battle between Jiang Zhuzhe and the Gongye brothers.</p>
 <p>Therefore, less and less people paid attention to Qin Lie’s battle.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t long before Song Tingyu and Xie Jingxuan had dealt with their opponents and finished their battle. They gathered towards Duan Qianjie on their own accord and watched the bloody colored battle on the sky seriously.</p>
 <p>“Pwack!”</p>
 <p>As his last opponent fell, the blood-soaked Qin Lie looked like he was about to collapse on the ground immediately.</p>
 <p>“Keep standing! You must circulate the Limit Sublimation Art while standing!” Duan Qianjie’s voice suddenly rang. “No matter how tired you are, no matter how much you feel like lying down, you must remember to stand tall! Lying down means relaxing your willpower and the end of your battle. Only by standing can you remind yourself that nothing has ended just yet. The Limit Sublimation Art must be cultivated while standing!”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie abruptly shook and forcefully suppressed the desire to lie down. He clenched his teeth and forced himself to hold a standing posture while cultivating the Limit Sublimation Art.</p>
 <p>The battle between Jiang Zhuzhe and the Gongye brothers had not only attracted the attention of every Scarlet Tide Continent martial practitioner, but also alarmed those people who shouldn’t have shown up here.</p>
 <p>Deep inside the thick clouds, a floating island sat quietly on the sky.</p>
 <p>Li Mu was right at the edge of the small island as his sword-like gaze penetrated the cloud’s cover and reached straight into the color of blood.</p>
 <p>He was observing the battle in silence.</p>
 <p>“Hmm!” Li Mu suddenly exclaimed softly.</p>
 <p>A tiny, rice-sized light suddenly appeared at the edge of the floating island.</p>
 <p>The dark light gradually grew larger and caused an increasingly big disturbance. Before long, the dark light condensed into a slim, dark figure whose appearance changed constantly and looked extremely blurry. It kept anyone from seeing their true appearance.</p>
 <p>Li Mu’s eyes lit up a little, and he smiled and bowed slightly towards the figure. “Hello, Sect Master Yu.” He noticed at first glance that Yu Lingwei had split out a wisp of her soul via soul projection.</p>
 <p>“Mister Li, between Xue Li and Jiang Zhuzhe, who do you think is the true Blood Fiend Sect?” Yu Lingwei’s voice was soft and gentle.</p>
 <p>“They both are,” Li Mu answered smilingly.</p>
 <p>“In that case, do you think that these two brothers could ever get along again?” Yu Lingwei asked again.</p>
 <p>This time Li Mu hadn’t answered immediately. Instead, he mulled over the thought seriously before answering, “No.”</p>
 <p>“Thank goodness then,” Yu Lingwei said quietly.</p>
