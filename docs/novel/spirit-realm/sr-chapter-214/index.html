 <p><b>Chapter 214: Qin Lie’s Counterattack!</b></p>
 <p>In the Procedural Hall, everyone was looking at Qin Lie. At such a dangerous time, everyone hoped to see a sliver of hope.</p>
 <p>But Qin Lie was too young and didn’t have any experience in managing a sect. So while everyone was hoping for great things from him, they were also secretly worried…</p>
 <p>Just as Xue Li had said, everyone was worried that Qin Lie’s decision would cause Armament Sect to enter danger, to go on a road towards death.</p>
 <p>“You have thought it through? To let me decide Armament Sect’s future?” Qin Lie asked one more time.</p>
 <p>With Luo Zhichang, Jiang Hao, and Fang Qi leading, everyone nodded with determined looks.</p>
 <p>“At least, you can order about Xue Li…” some people thought.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie took a deep breath, and then, his face turned cold. He said, “To the plaza!”</p>
 <p>His first move was to talk towards the plaza at the base of the mountain with the spirit pattern pillars. Everyone was puzzled, but they all stood and followed behind him.</p>
 <p>A short while later, Qin Lie and the higher-ups of Armament Sect returned to the plaza once more.</p>
 <p>Shi Jingyun, Wu Tuo, and Su Ziying were still tied to the spirit pattern pillars. Seeing the crowd come over, they stared hatefully at them.</p>
 <p>Their subordinates, disciples, and closest confidants had been pursued by Blood Spear and the outer sect elders, and then, they would be executed in front of them.</p>
 <p>There were still many traces of blood on the plaza that hadn’t been cleaned up yet. How could they not be filled to the brim with hate?</p>
 <p>“You think that Armament Sect can overcome this calamity with just an evil person? Armament Sect’s fate had been determined long ago. No one can save it!” Su Ziying’s eyes were frigid as she looked at the crowd. “Are the gates to the four districts being furiously attacked right now? We are just the first wave. There are many more outside Armament Sect. How will you withstand this?”</p>
 <p>Shi Jingyun and Wu Tuo also had dark and disdainful expressions</p>
 <p>“The people outside clearly know that you are being held here and dare to attack Armament Sect, do they not care about you? Or do they think that Armament Sect doesn’t dare to act?” Qin Lie said with a frown.</p>
 <p>Luo Zhichang’s expression was bitter.</p>
 <p>This was the crux of the problem.</p>
 <p>The people outside understood that Ying Xingran wasn’t a fanatic that would gamble it all. They were completely sure that Ying Xingran wouldn’t dare to disregard everything to kill the trio, so they didn’t think twice about attacking Armament City.</p>
 <p>In reality, artificers like Ying Xingran who wholeheartedly forged artifacts were very pacifistic.</p>
 <p>In the eyes of outsiders, Ying Xingran and Armament Sect, that was led by the artificers, did not have the resolve needed to offend the five forces.</p>
 <p>So they did not pay it any mind.</p>
 <p>“Dark Asura Hall, Seven Fiend Valley, Dark Shadow Tower, Purple Mist Sea, and Cloud Sky Mountain will only kill Blood Spear and outer sect disciples if they enter Armament Sect. The true artificers, even if Armament Sect does not exist any longer, will still live. Elder Mo Hai will enter Eight Extreme Temple and Profound Heaven Alliance while we five forces will divide the inner sect elders and disciples.</p>
 <p>Shi Jingyun looked at the crown, and her expression turned cold as she shouted, “However, if something happens to the three of us, the five forces will not be so peaceful! If we die, you artificers will most likely die with Armament Sect!”</p>
 <p>“So you do not dare to act against us!” Su Ziying smirked coldly. “You are afraid, afraid of dying with Armament Sect, afraid of angering the five forces and being killed!”</p>
 <p>“So they dare to attack Armament Sect because they know you do not dare to act rashly!” Wu Tuo also laughed.</p>
 <p>The words of the three people caused the three reverends to have wavering expressions. Because Luo Zhichang and Ying Xingran still wanted to live… they did not dare to act rashly.</p>
 <p>“Elder Cheng, give me a dagger,” Qin Lie suddenly said.</p>
 <p>A tired Cheng Ping said with a shocked face, “I do not have a dagger.”</p>
 <p>“I do.” Strangely, Mo Hai, the leader of the seven great inner sect elders, spoke.</p>
 <p>He handed a dragon-shaped crimson red dagger to Qin Lie. “It is called Dragon Fang, Profound Fifth Grade.”</p>
 <p>Feng Rong’s eyes shone with a curious light beside him as she said lightly, “A'Hai…”</p>
 <p>“I have gotten to where I am today because of Armament Sect. It has nothing to do with Profound Heaven Alliance and Eight Extreme Temple.” Mo Hai’s expression was aloof as he said, “Shi Jingyun, Wu Tuo, and Su Ziying have all received help from me. I have helped them forge artifacts, but now they want to destroy our Armament Sect, I cannot accept this.”</p>
 <p>When he said this, Shi Jingyun, Wu Tuo, and Su Ziying were shamed and shocked.</p>
 <p>Xue Li was sitting under a spirit pattern pillar. He narrowed his blood red eyes and snickered his strange laugh as he looked at Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie held the dagger Mo Hai gave him and walked towards Su Ziying without a word.</p>
 <p>“You dare touch me?” Su Ziying smirked coldly, “If I am damaged even a bit, Purple Mist Sea will bath Armament Sect in blood, have you thought about this?”</p>
 <p>She was the second wife of the master of Purple Mist Sea and was deeply favored by him. Her status in Purple Mist Sea was above all. If she was harmed in any way, Purple Mist Sea would not rest.</p>
 <p>The pupils of Luo Zhichang and the other’s shrank while their hearts rose.</p>
 <p>At this time, they felt slightly regretful. They regretted having Qin Lie decide the future of Armament Sect.</p>
 <p>It was a pity that they could not take back what they said. No matter what Qin Lie wanted to do, they could only look on from the side.</p>
 <p>Because Qin Lie was in charge of the present Armament Sect.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie swung the dagger under everyone’s disbelieving gaze. With one strike, he cut off Su Ziying’s left pinky!</p>
 <p>Su Ziying cried out.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie carefully put away this finger and then looked at Wu Tuo and Shi Jingyun. Under these two people’s shocked gazes, he cut off their left pinkies as well.</p>
 <p>Wu Tuo and Shi Jingyun gave muffled grunts. Pain flashed across their faces, but they did not make a sound.</p>
 <p>Still, their eyes were not disdainful as they looked at Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>“Elder Cheng, take these three fingers and go to the gates that Seven Fiend Valley, Cloud Sky Mountain, and Purple Mist Sea. Tell them that if they continue to attack, every one hour, I will cut off another finger,” Qin Lie said.</p>
 <p>Cheng Ping was stunned. He respectfully took the three fingers as he shuddered, and with a respectful gaze, he said, “I will go now!”</p>
 <p>The three reverends were astounded while the inner sect elders changed expressions but remained silent.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie looked at them and said, “If you want Armament Sect to be destroyed but still want to live, then you better get rid of those thoughts right now.”</p>
 <p>The three reverends and the elders nodded with bitter expressions.</p>
 <p>Under a spirit pattern pillar, Xue Li snickered. When he looked at Qin Lie, his eyes had an additional a sliver of admiration.</p>
 <p>“Good!” Feng Rong said loudly, not disguising her praise for Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>On the plaza, many Armament Sect martial practitioners looked at Qin Lie with a thread of sincere respect.</p>
 <p>“I need spirit materials with thunder attributes, best if the beast cores and spirit stones contain the power of lightning and thunder. I need to forge,” Qin Lie said.</p>
 <p>Feng Rong’s eyes lit up again. “Is it what you used to attack Blood Shadow?”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie nodded and said, “That is called the Terminator Profound Bomb, the only thing that I know how to forge. It can only be used once, but it is strong.”</p>
 <p>“Terminator Profound Bomb!” Xue Li shrieked.</p>
 <p>Everyone couldn’t help look at him. Even Qin Lie was slightly shocked. “Elder Xue Li, you have heard of the Terminator Profound Bomb?”</p>
 <p>“It really is the Terminator Profound Bomb? You didn’t get the name wrong?” Xue Li’s bloody eyes were slightly frightening.</p>
 <p>“Yes, it is called the Terminator Profound Bomb,” Qin Lie replied.</p>
 <p>Xue Li inhaled and suddenly said, “…If it is really that, haha, if you can forge them in large numbers, it can heavily wound the other side. Terminator Profound Bomb, heh, how do you have the recipe?”</p>
 <p>“An elder gave it to me,” Qin Lie answered. After a moment of thought, he probed, “This Terminator Profound Bomb has a history?”</p>
 <p>“This is a wondrous object that Forefather Terminator of Silent Heaven Continent invented and was famed in the nearby continents for its dominance and ferocity. It is terrifyingly powerful,” Xue Li snickered. “Your elder must be very powerful to have gotten the method to making the Terminator Profound Bomb that should only belong to Forefather Terminator. Heh, I’m not sure if it is real or not. From what I know, many people have recipes and say it is the Terminator Profound Bomb, but the things they forge aren’t worth a shit…</p>
 <p>“There are many thunder-oriented spirit materials in the spirit materials stores!” Fang Qi’s shone brightly.</p>
 <p>“I will go pick some out!” Qin Lie looked at Xue Li and said, “Please go into the city and help Lang Xie deal with that Xie Zhizhang. It would be best to capture him alive, but if that isn’t possible, just kill him.”</p>
 <p>“Even in my present state, I don’t need anyone helping me fight a martial practitioner in the middle stage of the Fulfillment Realm!” Xue Li snorted.</p>
 <p>“That’s even better. Just have Lang Xie move aside. Elder Luo, message Lang Xie?” Qin Lie said.</p>
 <p>“Alright!” Luo Zhichang nodded.</p>
 <p>“Do not send a message, I will go, and the boy will naturally step aside!” Xue Li smiled coldly and suddenly shot towards the edges of the city like a bloody rainbow.</p>
 <p>He seemed to have known where Lang Xie and Xie Zhizhang were fighting already.</p>
 <p>“Kid, seeing that you dare to kill and fit my tastes, when I come back, I will tell you a secret… a secret about the twelve spirit pattern pillars!” Xue Li’s strange laugh shot back from far away.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie was astounded. He looked again at the twelve spirit pattern pillars on the plaza. Hesitating, he asked Luo Zhichang, “Elder Luo, where did these twelve spirit pattern pillars come from?”</p>
 <p>Luo Zhichang suddenly became awkward and stammered as though he didn’t want to say.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie understood and went somewhere where Shi Jingyun, Wu Tuo, and Su Ziying could not overhear them. He asked again, “Xue Li is not from Scarlet Tide Continent, so does that mean that the twelve spirit pattern pillars are also from outside?”</p>
 <p>The three reverends gathered together, and Luo Zhichang replied for them, “The sect founder got the twelve spirit pattern pillars… stole them from outside.”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie was astounded.</p>
 <p>“This, this…” Luo Zhichang smiled weakly, “the generations after slowly discovered it over time. Because it was stolen, even he didn’t understand the mysteries of the spirit pattern pillars. He didn’t even know that there was an old demon sealed in the spirit pattern pillars.”</p>
 <p>“Where did he steal them from?” Qin Lie asked.</p>
 <p>“It is unknown.” Luo Zhichang shook his head.</p>
 <p>Armament Sect, which had a nine hundred year history, had a founder who was a thief?</p>
 <p>Because he stole the twelve spirit pattern pillars, he founded Armament Sect at Flame Volcano, and the generations gradually developed into its current state due to that?</p>
 <p>Qin Lie suddenly was torn between laughing and crying.</p>
