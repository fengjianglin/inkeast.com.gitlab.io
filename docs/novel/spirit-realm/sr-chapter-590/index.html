 <p><b>Chapter 590: Stealing Food from the Mouth of a Tiger</b></p>
 <p><span style>“Qin Lie… are you still going to continue waiting?” Xue Moyan asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Moyan had been watching from the sidelines for a very long time. After seeing Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Sea Pavilion begin their slaughter of the Xing Family, she could no longer suppress herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie didn’t answer immediately. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He focused his attention on the surface of the sea below, releasing a wisp of mind consciousness and using it to probe the water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tiny sparks of electricity flashed through his eyes every so often.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie narrowed his eyes. A strange feeling came over him as he discovered that the speed at which he released his soul consciousness was faster than he expected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An idea suddenly occurred to him, and he had his soul consciousness sink into the depths of the sea like a tentacle. He used it to examine the sea for signs of activity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He found plankton, fish, and fresh corpses underwater. He could even clearly sense the fragments of their consciousnesses dissipating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His soul consciousness reflected all of this into his Soul Lake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The range of his soul perception was now several times larger than it used to be. Now it could cover a more expansive area! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie currently stood atop a Flowing Gold Fire Phoenix at least several hundred meters above the sea… yet he could sense the tiniest of changes in its depths. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Netherpassage… netherpassage…” Qin Lie muttered to himself, carefully thinking the matter through. “So this is what netherpassage truly means…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How much longer do we have to wait?” Xue Moyan hurriedly asked again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The tiny sparks of electricity in QIn Lie’s eyes slowly faded. He cast a sideways glance at Xue Moyan and said, “You guys should stay here. We can’t be careless just yet, so I’ll be the first to go down there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re going down there?” Song Tingyu asked in surprise. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Cloud Palace and Sea Pavilion were currently engaged in pitched battle with the Xing Family. Countless martial practitioners were going to die in this fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The possibility of something happening to Qin Lie or him getting accidentally injured was extremely high.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Tingyu was worried about him. After a moment of thought, she said, “Let me go with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need, just stay here!” Qin Lie shook his head, a smile on his face. “I’m a meddler, so I naturally know how to protect myself. Don’t worry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie immediately left the wooden building and leaped onto a crystalline war chariot, preventing them from trying to persuade him any further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had long since memorized how to control such a chariot. The moment he entered the war chariot, it roared to life and swiftly descended from the Flowing Gold Fire Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Tingyu gritted her teeth. “That bastard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Relax!” Du Xiangyang said lazily, clearly not worried about Qin Lie at all. “There’s no way he’ll get hurt. Xiang Xi probably told Black Cloud Palace and Heavenly Pavilion about Qin Lie’s ‘backer.’ That Xiahou Sheng should know too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You mean Terminator Sect?” Luo Chen asked in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahahah! Of course I’m talking about Terminator Sect. You couldn’t possibly be thinking that Blood Fiend Sect would influence them in any way, right?” Du Xiangyang smiled and glanced at Xue Moyan. Then he calmly said, “Blood Fiend Sect in its current state is nothing to be afraid of, after all. Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families are particularly aware of that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Would they really yield to him because of Terminator Sect?” Song Tingyu asked, somewhat shocked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“They believe that Forefather Terminator is Qin Lie’s backer,” Du Xiangyang said, an easygoing expression on his face. “Heh… in all of the Land of Chaos, not many people would dare to offend him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only after Du Xiangyang explained this did Song Tingyu finally relax. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“That being said…” Du Xiangyang continued. “I’m pretty sure that Qin Lie is planning to butt heads with those people, so…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Frowns returned to everyone’s faces as his voice trailed off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Around a hundred crystalline chariots glowed with impressive translucent light, making them look like enormous crystal lamps in the sky. They rumbled as they descended upon the Xing brothers’ Flowing Gold Fire Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Explosions reverberated from that flying spirit artifact, and it immediately erupted in flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many Xing Family clansmen and Gold Sun Island martial practitioners loyal to the Xing Family had already begun engaging the enemy. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, numerous Sword Leaf Boats surrounded the Wavebreaker where Xing Yao and the others were. Chains shot from boats and smashed into the ship, tethering them tightly. Figures then disembarked from the boats, using those chains to climb aboard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Guo Yanzheng took a deep breath. “Are you certain you don’t want to leave, First Miss?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He and Qi Jing had already made up their minds to grievously wound or kill any enemies that came at them even if they died in the process..</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I’m certain.” Xing Yao’s face was pale. Despair now occupied her originally bright eyes. “I am not my father, my uncle, or my aunt. I am not talented at cultivating, nor do I have impressive skills. Even if I manage to barely survive this, I won’t be able to revive the Xing Family or avenge them by fighting the three great families. In light of that, I might as well die with everyone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see that you aren’t completely oblivious, Miss Xing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A derisive voice echoed from a corner of the deck. A youth leading a group of Black Cloud Palace experts walked over. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This youth was called Zheng Yun and was none other than the youngest son of Black Cloud Palace’s palace master. He was at the peak of the Netherpassage Realm, only one step away from the Fulfillment Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Back off!” a Xing Family clansman shouted angrily, attacking Zheng Yun with glittering silver daggers that looked like dense fish scales. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Watch out, young palace master!” a person behind Zheng Yun cried out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha!” Zheng Yun laughed as a giant pitch black flag suddenly emerged from the back of his neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black clouds covered this pitch black flag. It radiated cold spirit energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>A strange humanoid spirit beast suddenly appeared atop the giant flag. It was pitch black and had tentacles all over its body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This spirit beast seemed as if it had been imprisoned within the black flag for years. When it saw the shower of silver daggers flying toward it, it trembled violently, using its tentacles like whips and lashing at the incoming assault.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dozen or so daggers shattered as soon as the tentacles struck them. Not a single one of them hit Zheng Yun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The enormous black flag roared, engulfing the Xing Family clansman like a cluster of black clouds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Krak! K-krak!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>After a series of disturbing noises rang through the air, blood dripped from the flag.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before that Xing Family clansman could even scream, the demonic spirit beast within that enormous flag actually consumed him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire time this took place, Zheng Yun hadn’t even bothered to look at his victim. He laughed loudly and walked straight toward Xing Yao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Long time no see,” he said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xing Yao’s face was pale. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“My father once attempted to repair the relationship between our Black Cloud Palace and your Gold Sun Island through a political marriage. Back then, he told me to marry you and take you back to Black Cloud Palace.” Zheng Yun sighed. He then regretfully said, “It’s unfortunate that you don’t consider me marriage material.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Black Cloud Palace elders standing behind him wore sinister smiles on their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young palace master!” one of them said. “You can still marry her and make her your bride for one night! Hehehe!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the Fulfilment Realm elders of Black Cloud Palace began laughing and wickedly, voicing their agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their words made Xing Yao’s pretty face twist in anger and shame. “Zheng Yun! Even if doing so means immediate death, I refuse to do as you wish!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh! Oh no. Please, don’t. Don’t be angry!” Zheng Yun exclaimed in pretend panic. “I couldn’t possibly let you die, could I?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heheh! Even if you have to die, you should die after everyone else does, right?” Dropping the act, Zheng Yun looked behind him and viciously said, “Starting with Guo Yanzheng and Qi Jing, kill everyone but Miss Xing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment he gave this order, Black Cloud Palace’s elders immediately charged toward the Xing Family clansmen, ferociously beginning their bloody work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At nearly the same time, Heavenly Sea Pavilion martial practitioners had climbed aboard the other ship and begun their slaughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bang!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>A crystalline war chariot suddenly plunged from the sky and crashed between the martial practitioners of Black Cloud Palace and the Xing Family clansmen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The terrifying impact shattered that section of the tough wooden deck and sent bits of wood flying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people near Zheng Yun couldn’t help but cover their faces to avoid the sharp debris.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who goes there?” Zheng Yun yelled coldly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s that boy who pretended to be a member of the Xing Family!” Qi Jing exclaimed in astonishment. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie jumped from the war chariot as wood scattered across the deck, suddenly appearing beside Xing Yao and Guo Yanzheng. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie flashed a bright smile and nodded at Zheng Yun politely, saying, “Xiang Xi promised to have this little bitch service me. I’m quite sorry about this, but you wouldn’t take what I was promised, would you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?” Zheng Yun frowned slightly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A yellow-faced Black Cloud Palace elder moved closer to Zheng Yun, a meaningful look in his eyes, and whispered to him. “This person is a direct disciple of Forefather Terminator. Within Terminator Sect, he’s even more important than that Chu Li.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Obvious fear leaked from Zheng Yun’s eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie grinned at the Black Cloud palace martial practitioners, casually fishing a couple of Terminator Profound Bombs from his spatial ring and playing with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dense sparks of electricity coursed through these metallic balls. The ferocious thunder energy they contained was extremely shocking. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Terminator Profound Bombs!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>All the Black Cloud Palace martial practitioners and Xing Family clansmen cried out at the same time. The faces of everyone on both sides turned ugly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zheng Yun hastily put on a smile. “Haha… brother, what are you…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie nodded and winked at Zheng Yun, saying, “You understand, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zheng Yun had no choice but to maintain the smile on his face. Although this turn of events depressed him, he obediently set the delicious piece of meat in his mouth back down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A gentleman doesn’t take what isn’t theirs,” he said. “Since Enforcer Xiang already promised Xing Yao to you, I can only resign myself and part with her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After learning of Qin Lie’s “true” identity, no matter how much he wanted to obtain Xing Yao, Zheng Yun had no choice but to give her up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Cloud Palace was just a Copper rank force. In fact, just to survive up to this point, they had to attach themselves to Black Voodoo Cult. Compared to Terminator Sect, a force who controlled the entire Heavenly Silence Continent alone, Black Cloud Palace was nothing at all. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He believed that Qin Lie was the direct disciple of Terminator Forefather. He would have to be crazy to try and snatch what Qin Lie wanted. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you!” Qin Lie saluted Zheng Yun pretentiously, clasping a fist with a palm. </span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, Xing Yao exploded and pounced at Qin Lie like a madwoman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll kill you!” she shrieked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hated Qin Lie even more than she hated Zheng Yun. This fake Xing Family clansman had sown so much discord amongst her people and pushed her to the limit again and again. Now that he was going to take her for himself, Xing Yao could no longer tolerate him for even one second more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But she was only in the middle stage of the Netherpassage Realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She said it herself: her talent in cultivating was ordinary, and her skills were average at best. He strength was nothing impressive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was absolutely harmless to Qin Lie. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie simply smiled and watched Xing Yao take a stance that resembled a bird, her eyes shining with bone-deep hatred. A chirping sound echoed through the air, and spirit energy gushed from her palm, taking the form of an ethereal emerald bird.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Riiip!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The ethereal bird swiped at Qin Lie’s chest, tearing his clothes and leaving deep indentations on his skin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the attack couldn’t even break through his skin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Making a pulling gesture in front of him, Qin Lie pulled Xing Yao to his side and summoned countless chains of lightning into existence. They wrapped around Xing Yao, restraining her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like that, Xing Yao was instantly subdued.</span></p>
