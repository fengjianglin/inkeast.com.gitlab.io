 <p><b>Chapter 705: Did You Ask Me?</b></p>
 <p><span style>La Pu and Qin Lie’s expressions abruptly turned ugly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amidst the collapsed frost palaces, Forefather Dark Wind looked surprised by this turn of events as he first glanced at the elderly lizardman, then at the huge dragonman and ultimately at La Pu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Li and Lu Heng also paled slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yao Tian’s ancestor is a benefactor of the Ghost Eye Race, and I personally appreciate Yao Tian a lot. I will not allow anyone to raise a hand against Yao Tian as long as I’m here!” La Pu pondered for a moment before yelling word by word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An odd light appeared in Qin Lie’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elderly lizardman rubbed his scrawny chin and alternated gazes between La Pu and Qin Lie repeatedly with his dark red eyes. He looked like he was trying to figure out their real relationship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What if the old lizard and I both want this human boy?” The huge dragonman opened his big mouth and chuckled, “Your eighth eye hasn’t truly grown yet, has it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t bother to hide the threatening look on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>La Pu’s eyes grew darker, “So what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“La Pu, you’ve always been a smart guy. You should know that you’re not a match against me or the old lizard with your current strength.” Malice abruptly appeared on the huge dragonman’s face. “If one of us were to attack you, the only thing you could do is run like a rat, and if we were to join hands, you would have no chance of survival! Moreover, we are accompanied by our clansmen. Our people are watching over the entire Frost Island. You… won’t leave Frost Island alive if we were to wish it so!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This human is a little special, so you’d best be smart and hand him over, La Pu,” the elderly lizardman began persuading sinisterly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two foreign races’ leaders had come to a mutual understanding, and they were playing the “good cop bad cop” routine in attempt to force La Pu to submit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The situation had suddenly turned both complicated and hostile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hui Jia, Qing Luo, and other lizardmen and dragonmen quietly and wordlessly spread out to surround both La Pu and Qin Lie at the center.</span></p>
 <p><span style>La Pu’s gaze grew colder and colder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie was also frowning deeply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t expect that he would encounter such a situation after the barriers of the frost palaces were destroyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t understand why the two old monsters of the Lizard Race and the dragonmen had grown interested in him all of a sudden. He didn’t understand why they decided to join hands and force La Pu to turn him in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even now, he still had no idea why Hui Jia and Qing Luo were purposely attacking him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Forefather…” Lu Heng exclaimed softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Forefather Dark Wind waved his hand and made a silencing gesture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lu Heng could only shut up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A strange smile appeared on Forefather Dark Wind’s face. He examined the crowd non-stop while looking very interested in the recent development.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he never said a word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, he looked at La Pu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t turn him in without a fight no matter what you people are plotting!” La Pu gritted his teeth as the eyes spread out across his body began to open one after another, “I’ll create a chance for you to escape with my death later. You must focus all of your concentration and capture that chance when it shows up. If you’re lucky, then maybe you can survive…” He sneakily sent a message to Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie stared deeply at La Pu once with taut nerves, not saying a word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t going to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had made up his mind to fight to his death and unleash all of his strength. He would do his utmost to slaughter as many lizardmen and dragonmen as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It appears that La Pu had made up his mind.” The way the elderly lizardman was tugging at the corner of his mouth showed just how disdainful he felt. “It’s unfortunate that he hasn’t grown his eighth eye…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lucky for us, else he would be able to drag the both of us into the abyss of death even if we joined hands. If that had been the case, we would have had to give up on this human boy.” The huge dragonman laughed sinisterly with a fierce expression on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the duo was speaking, their auras began to grow at a tremendous rate to the point where the sounds of brewing energy storms could be heard from their bodies. The resulting squalls were extremely terrifying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A fierce battle was about to unfold at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No one seems to have asked for my opinion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was at this moment that the intrigued bystander, Forefather Dark Wind, suddenly let out an odd chuckle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several thousand clumps of green flames resembling demon heads or greenish lanterns abruptly flew out of Forefather Dark Wind’s sleeves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Green flames instantly filled every corner of the frost kingdom. Be it the collapsed or still standing buildings, they were all illuminated by the green flames, turning the whole cave into a scene straight out of the nine hells.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pure, jade green color also appeared inside Forefather Dark Wind’s pupils. It made him look extremely sinister.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The trio that was about to battle to certain death cast a glance at the completely unrelated Forefather Dark Wind. They weren’t surprised that he had chosen this moment to show off his might.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elderly lizardman shot an impatient glare at Forefather Dark Wind before saying, “Starting your highway robbery again, Dark Wind? Come on, tell us. What do you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If we find an ice-type ore vein inside Frost Island, the old lizard and I shall share more than half the profits with you. All you need to do is to keep your hands away from this matter. What do you think?” the huge dragonman also said angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two foreign races’ leaders knew Forefather Dark Wind quite well. They both knew that he was avaricious and his greed was insatiable, and so they chose to use profits to appease him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh no no.” Forefather Dark Wind shook his head repeatedly with a devious and cunning smile, “The reason I’m helping him is only because I find him somewhat pleasing to the eye! Also, he’s a human, so I want to help him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An obvious light of joy appeared in La Pu’s face when said this. Qin Lie himself was slightly surprised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop making up excuses!” The elderly lizardman grew more and more impatient. He waved his hands and said, “Dark Wind, stop wasting everyone’s time and tell us what you want. Is it this frost palace that you want?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We still have to find that Ice Phoenix after taking out La Pu. Stop causing trouble already!” the huge dragonman also roared angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you two really think that I was joking?” The smile on Forefather Dark Wind’s face gradually faded as he took on a dark and merciless expression. His aura grew scarier and scarier. “If it isn’t obvious enough, I’m telling you right now that this human boy is under my protection!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the hell are you doing, Dark Wind?” the elderly lizardman screamed. “He has the bloodline of the Heaven Fighting Race! He isn’t a pure human at all, and while the Heaven Fighting Race’s bloodline is extremely useful to both me and Gu Tuo, it is completely useless to you! Why do you have to interfere?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Must you muddle up the waters?” The huge dragonman turned extremely irritated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The elderly lizardman was called Chi Yan, and the huge dragonman was called Gu Tuo. Both of them possessed the strength of an early stage Imperishable Realm martial practitioner and were extremely deadly characters of the deeper region of the Ruined Lands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A Ghost Eye clansman could experience a great leap in power and wield strength equal to a human early stage Imperishable Realm martial practitioner if their eighth eye was open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was why they didn’t hold La Pu with incomplete eighth eye in high regard at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Forefather Dark Wind was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Forefather Dark Wind had established his Soul Altar and achieved the early stage of the Imperishable Realm long time ago. He was an infamous martial practitioner whose reputation was even slightly stronger than theirs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>None of them were certain that they could beat Forefather Dark Wind if they were to clash against him one on one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was why they were willing to sacrifice part of their profits to keep Forefather Dark Wind at the sidelines. They were both wary of Forefather Dark Wind’s terrific strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Forefather Dark Wind was obviously provoking them and had completely ignored the profits they offered. This made them both furious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“La Pu, take this Yao Tian kid and return to your Seven Eye Island immediately.” The green light in Forefather Dark Wind’s narrowed eyes grew brighter and brighter. The suspending green flames emanated with terrific energy that seemed like they would explode at any moment. “Leave this place to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Qin Lie and La Pu looked astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t understand why Forefather Dark Wind would do this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop wasting time,” Forefather Dark Wind urged them to move in an impatient tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>La Pu immediately reacted and grabbed Qin Lie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie resolutely grabbed the Ice Phoenix’s true body beneath his arm pit and moved towards La Pu on his own accord. This was so that La Pu could carry him along easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go!” La Pu grabbed Qin Lie’s shoulders and summoned thick pure nether demonic energy from inside his body. It wrapped around both of them, turning the duo into a ray of dark shadow that flew out through the giant hole in the ceiling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dark Wind! Do you really think you can fight the two of us alone?” Chi Yan howled sharply.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ll work together to injure Dark Wind first, then return to Seven Eye Island and kill La Pu. After that we’ll capture that boy with the Heaven Fighting Race’s bloodline alive!” Gu Tuo responded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A new series of explosion erupted at the bottom of Frost Island. Three old demons from the depths of the Ruined Lands unleashed their respective abilities and clashed fiercely against one another.</span></p>
 <p><span style>La Pu took Qin Lie away from this dangerous place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Qin Lie flew out of the giant hole in the ceiling, he noticed that the entire Frost Island had undergone a complete change. The tall ice mountains that used to stand tall were either destroyed or shattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gorgeous and vast sceneries of Frost island had completely vanished. The only things left were desolate ruins.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many ice attribute spirit beasts were torn ito pieces and covered up by huge blocks of ice everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many dragonmen, lizardmen and Forefather Dark Wind’s subordinates were gathering above the frost kingdom. Even further away, there were plenty of people who were collecting the bodies of spirit beasts and slamming pickaxes at ice mountains in search for ice attribute minerals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were all busy with their own thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when three terrifying auras appeared from inside the island, all humans and foreign races gathered on Frost Island stopped whatever they were doing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they received messages from Chi Yan, Gu Tuo, and Forefather Dark Wind, these people immediately began attacking one another and started a new round of battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s expression was dark as he looked at the intense battle happening everywhere on the island while he was grabbed by La Pu with one hand in midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t forget this, dragonmen, lizardmen!” Qin Lie’s heart was ice cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take down La Pu! Don’t let him to escape Frost Island!” At the bottom, shrill roars erupted from the mouths of dragonmen and lizardmen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dozen or so foreign clansmen with the ability to fly immediately soared to the sky and charged toward La Pu.</span></p>
