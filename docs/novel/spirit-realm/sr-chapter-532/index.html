 <p><b>Chapter 532: The Remains of the Blood Progenitor</b></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it finally over?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Down in the valley between two mountains, the eastern barbarians finally stopped panicking. Shocked expressions covered their faces as they realized how peaceful the world had become.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had lost more than a hundred people in a short time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Over half of their original force of over two hundred eastern barbarians had died to the ice storm of the Forbidden Land of Ice. The survivors surveyed the area, corpses of their fallen comrades littering the ground around them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened?” someone asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ice came from the frozen lake in the distance, smashed into an icy mountain, and caused an avalanche of boulders… we got caught in it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blood Fiend Sect’s ultimate treasure, the Bloodthirsty Dragon, charged into the frozen lake. The Demon Sealing Tombstone is floating above it right now!” Jiang Tianxing’s eyes flashed with excitement. “The lake is about to shatter, and the Land of Buried Gods will appear very soon! Get ready to move, everyone! Try to get inside of the frozen lake!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t care about the lives of the eastern barbarians at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go!” Jia Yue shouted. “To the frozen lake!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She could feel a voice coming from the depths of the frozen lake, urging her to move as quickly as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A strangely enchanting voice seemed to be communicating with her through her True Soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now is not the time to argue!” Sen Ye ordered in response. “The Land of Buried Gods has always been our true goal in the Graveyard of Gods! No matter how heavy our losses are, we must complete our mission!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eastern barbarians ignored the corpses of their tribesmen and moved forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look! Above the frozen lake! What is that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Demon Sealing Tombstone! That’s the Demon Sealing Tombstone!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a difficult journey, Ye Yihao, Huang Zhuli, Su Yan, Yu Men, and Feng Yiyou finally reached the top of another mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had arrived at a good time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this point in time, the ice spirit had just finished its frenzy and the Forbidden Land of Ice had finally become calm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The five of them stared down at the frozen lake from the top of the mountain. Seeing the Demon Sealing Tombstone hovering high above the lake, they were all but certain about the location of the Land of Buried Gods and the ice spirit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is it!” Ye Yihao became excited. “We’re finally headed in the right direction!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The frozen lake looks like it’s about to shatter.” Feng Yiyou’s gaze grew intense. “The Land of Buried Gods is probably going to be exposed soon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s get to the Land of Buried Gods at the fastest speed possible!” Yu Men shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All five of them were in agreement. Keeping their shields of light up, they swallowed medicinal pills first so that they could get back into fighting condition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At almost the same time, Qin Lie and the others charged down the peak toward the frozen lake, hoping to be the first to see the Land of Buried Gods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crack crack crack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thick layer of ice that made up the surface of the vast frozen lake continued to fracture and break apart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Underneath the frozen lake, bloody lights attacked the ice from below, charging about like countless swords made of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Sealing Tombstone floated high in the sky and continued to use its seven prismatic lights to assault the surface of the lake that protected the ice spirit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was trying to seal the ice spirit as fast as possible!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ice spirit was hiding in the depths of the frozen lake. It was strong, intelligent, and already aware of the situation. It controlled the Forbidden Land of Ice and fought back desperately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aaouuuuu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A grief laden howl echoed from deep within the frozen lake. The bloody bone dragon flew out from the gap in the surface of the lake and shot into the sky alongside bloody lights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Having grown to nearly two times its original massive size, the bloody bone dragon writhed in the air, howling unhappily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The small figure of a person seemed to be sitting atop its head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the more specific features of that person’s appearance were indistinct, their body looked as if it were made of bloody jade. It shone with blinding bloody light like a sanguine jewel shaped like a person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t give off any soul fluctuations, but their body emanated a dense aura of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The remains of the Blood Progenitor! The Bloodthirsty Dragon charged into the frozen lake to retrieve him!” Jiang Tianxing was the first to shout. “The Land of Buried Gods is definitely at the bottom of the frozen lake! There’s no doubt about it!””</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The remains of the Blood Progenitor!” Xue Moyan also shouted in shock. “Those are definitely his remains!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone could feel the bloody bone dragon’s intense sorrow. This Heaven Grade spirit artifact seemed to possess simple intelligence. Upon finding out that its creator, its first owner, had died long ago... it couldn’t help but grieve and howl angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look!” Ye Yihao shouted. “That’s Blood Fiend Sect’s ultimate treasure! The Heaven Grade artifact, the Bloodthirsty Dragon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aaouuuuu!” The Bloodthirsty Dragon howled toward the horizon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bloody lights that surrounded it formed ancient glyphs that resembled dragons. Hundreds of thousands of those glyphs hurtled down toward the frozen lake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boom boom boom!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earth-shaking explosions rang out from the ice below. The assault of the dragon-shaped glyphs completely shattered the thick layer of ice making up the frozen lake’s surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the frozen lake shattered, the seven divine lights of the Demon Sealing Tombstone reached down like the hand of a giant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gazes of everyone remotely nearby focused on the frozen lake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The frozen lake shattered, and ice accompanied by streaming lights shot outward, carried toward the eastern barbarians like an astonishingly frigid wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eastern barbarians cursed, wailing like ghouls as they scattered in every direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, before many of them had the chance to flee, their blood stopped flowing. Under the influence of the extreme cold, they froze to death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eastern barbarians of all three tribes fled in three directions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thousands of icy lights headed directly for Jia Yue. The dozens of white barbarians by her side couldn’t do a thing before they were frozen into statues.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Gao Yu was no exception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the frigid winds swept over them, Gao Yu became a crystalline stature like the white barbarians.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet his eyes still shone with a dark, evil light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deep within his eyes, countless ghosts floated around to form a strange glyph. That glyph seemed like the unyielding will of the Evil God, but also radiated an evil power like the remnant soul of an Evil God.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ghostly glyph in his eyes slowed the formation of the ice around his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gao Yu was still stuck inside of the ice, but he retained his consciousness and could look around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He saw thousands of icy lights enter Jia Yue’s body, streaming into her like water flowing into the sea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Yue immediately froze as well. However, this type of freeze differed from the one that killed everyone else. She became a person of ice, but the blood that flowed inside of her didn’t freeze. Instead, an unfathomable aura appeared within her. She suddenly gave off the feeling that she had become one with the Forbidden Land of Ice and was able to control this section of the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her eyes became as white as snow… and devoid of emotion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Something’s wrong!” Gao Yu thought, a chill washing over his heart. He immediately realized that the ice spirit had taken over Jia Yue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Jia Yue of this moment was nothing like the Jia Yue of the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>—She was no longer the white barbarian girl he was familiar with, but the ice spirit, the ruler of the Forbidden Land of Ice!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Sealing Tombstone arrived, having followed the tens of thousands of icy lights through the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It hovered above Jia Yue’s and Gao Yu’s heads, its dazzling godly lights writhing through the air like the tentacles of an octopus as if they were trying to decide which one of them was the ice spirit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The prismatic lights roamed back and forth above their heads, yet they didn’t attack Jia Yue. It seemed as if they were blind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crack crack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of a sudden, the frigid gusts of wind froze Di Fei, who had been fleeing in another direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Fei howled as an extremely cold power of frost entered his mind and reached his Soul Lake where his True Soul was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Di Fei’s Soul Lake immediately froze. The power of frost sealed his True Soul, seemingly cutting off his connection to the earth spirit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that instant, the aura of the earth spirit radiated from Di Fei’s body, peerlessly pure and bright.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The frigid winds caught a black barbarian woman with a gentle appearance, ice encroaching on her just like Di Fei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her eyes shook with fear and she cried, “Don’t hurt us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only a faint soul shadow could be seen in her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The calm, pure power of water emanated from her body, making her stand out as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A’Yue!” Sen Ye shouted in shock and confusion. “What’s happening to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“S-she’s been possessed by the water spirit!” a black barbarian shouted in realization.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Di Fei noticed someone at the peak of a nearby mountain. A scarlet barbarian stood there, completely encased in ice, but his body radiated the power of metal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… didn’t you die long ago?” Di Fei shouted. “Ka Deng!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This barbarian called “Ka Deng” had been killed by Black Voodoo Cult martial practitioners in the Forbidden Land of Metal. Di Fei had been the one to bury him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet that Ka Deng now appeared once again, showing up in the Forbidden Land of Ice.</span></p>
