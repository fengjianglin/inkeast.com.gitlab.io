 <p><strong>Chapter 639: Restrained</strong></p>
 <p>There were many crystalline chains that leapt in Pu Ze’s eyes. The Soul Altar he was sitting on was crawling with countless complicated and miraculous flowing lights that seemed to be calculating some sort of worldly principles non-stop.</p>
 <p>Inside Qin Lie’s body.</p>
 <p>There were thousands and tens of thousands of translucent chains of light that crisscrossed each other like ribbons. They bound around Qin Lie’s blood, bones and innards and kept him immobile.</p>
 <p>Other than his mind and Soul Lake, almost every part of his body were controlled by his opponent. He couldn’t even blink, so naturally speaking was an even greater impossibility.</p>
 <p>“You have nine natal palaces that contained the refined natal energy of thunder, ice and earth, and the blood spirit energy flows along your blood. Although all four heterogeneous energies were mixed inside one body, they are perfectly separate and showed no signs of attacking or influencing one another…” Pu Ze shook his head slightly, “Strange. How very strange. I’m not sure how you manage to do it.”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie couldn’t say anything. He could only watch Pu Ze coldly.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the Blood Fiend Ten Elders who were attempting to gather together and create the blood demon with their refined blood were ultimately unable to do so because the Nirvana realm experts of Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families were doing their utmost to stop them.</p>
 <p>The Blood Fiend Ten Elders had to stay near to each other and summon all of their refined blood to conjure that secret art of blood demons.</p>
 <p>Guan Xian obviously knew something about this secret art, which was why he continuously barked orders and stopped the Blood Fiend Ten Elders from succeeding again and again.</p>
 <p>The battle that should’ve gone evenly leaned toward the Black Voodoo Cult before anyone realized it due to Pu Ze’s appearance.</p>
 <p>Without the eight god corpses’ murderous interference, many martial practitioners of Black Voodoo Cult and three great families were freed from pressure. As an Imperishable Realm expert, Pu Ze had easily dealt with Black Voodoo Cult’s hidden threat the moment he acted. If he were to keep this up, then Blood Fiend Sect and Gold Sun Island wouldn’t be able to resist defeat at all.</p>
 <p>The Blazing Profound Bombs that could deal massive damage to Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families were used up almost all too quickly.</p>
 <p>Without the Blazing Profound Bombs, the eight god corpses or the bloody secret art that could kill Pu Ze, how exactly was Blood Fiend Sect going to win this battle?</p>
 <p>The three great families’ martial practitioners such as Xiahou Qi, Su Zhi, and Lin Bin looked spirited and cheerful at this moment.</p>
 <p>They didn’t know that Black Voodoo Cult had sent out an Imperishable Realm expert on this invasion, which was why they were secretly worried that they wouldn’t be able to kill Blood Fiend Sect to the last and allow some rats that might threaten them in the future to escape.</p>
 <p>But the moment Pu Ze appeared, all of their worries had turned to dust.</p>
 <p>A single Soul Altar expert—even if he was just a one level Soul Altar expert—could decide a battle at the level of the Setting Sun Islands singlehandedly.</p>
 <p>Pu Ze’s presence was critical in this battle. No one here could resist his power.</p>
 <p>Right now, Qin Lie was secretly regretting his mistakes on the inside. He was regretting the fact that he hadn’t listened to Li Mu’s advice.</p>
 <p>Li Mu had reminded him repeatedly to take out the jade token at first notice and summon for help the moment he saw the appearance of the enemy’s Imperishable Realm expert.</p>
 <p>Li Mu also said that he might not have the chance to take out the jade token if he didn’t act quick enough. He said that he might be killed directly.</p>
 <p>What really happened came very close to Li Mu’s prediction.</p>
 <p>Because he hadn’t taken out the jade token at first notice, he was shackled by Pu Ze before he was able to escape.</p>
 <p>If Pu Ze wanted to kill him, he might already be killed off without even the slightest chance of resisting at all.</p>
 <p>It was only now he fully realized how terrifying a Soul Altar expert was. It was only now that he understood that it was too early for him at his current level to think of resisting a Soul Altar expert’s might.</p>
 <p>“Who is your teacher, kid? Who taught you to cultivate like this?” Pu Ze stared at him silently. He actually looked interested in Qin Lie after inspecting his body thoroughly, and he asked as he continued to examine Qin Lie, “You are lucky you hadn’t experienced a fiendish rebound and died for cultivating so many different spirit arts at once.”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie’s eyes sparkled.</p>
 <p>“Oh, I forgot you can’t speak.” Pu Ze slapped his head and pointed at Qin Lie’s throat.</p>
 <p>A silver light abruptly flashed towards Qin Lie’s throat and cause a fierce reaction inside the chain.</p>
 <p>The crystalline chain around Qin Lie’s throat was shattered by the silver light, and the restrictive power immediately vanished because of it.</p>
 <p>“I don’t have a master.” Qin Lie opened his mouth and said.</p>
 <p>Pu Ze looked surprised, “You’re able to cultivate to this level despite having no master to guide you? I guess you are a talented person.”</p>
 <p>He didn’t seem too interested in the conflict between Black Voodoo Cult and Blood Fiend Sect. He actually didn’t act after shackling Qin Lie and the eight god corpses.</p>
 <p>Although Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families looked like they had the upper hand on the surface, if the battle continued like this then it might take them a very long time before they could obtain victory.</p>
 <p>Without his aid, Black Voodoo Cult and the three great families’ victory would be pyrrhic even if they won.</p>
 <p>“Pu Ze! Don’t just stand there and do nothing!” Guan Xian said darkly.</p>
 <p>“The reason I promised to come is only because of the eight god corpses. I am not interested in the grudges between your sect and the Blood Fiend Sect.” Pu Ze said with an indifferent look, “Once this battle is over, I want four god corpses… and this kid as well!” He pointed at Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>“You want him?” Guan Xian’s sneer rang from the thick black light, “He’s someone Nan Zhengtian himself had requested for! Have you tired of living so much that you would snatch someone that that old monster Nan Zhengtian wants?”</p>
 <p>“What? That monstrous Forefather Terminator wants him?” A hint of shock appeared on Pu Ze’s blank face for the first time.</p>
 <p>Forefather Terminator’s reputation rang loud and clear throughout the entire Land of Chaos. He was a towering mountain to any peak expert.</p>
 <p>Pu Ze was just a Black Voodoo Cult foreign delegate cooperating with Black Voodoo Cult right now. His one level Soul Altar might be invincible on the Setting Sun Islands, but it was leagues apart compared to Forefather Terminator’s.</p>
 <p>“That old monster fancied his talent and potential in the aspect of thunder and wished to take him in as a direct disciple. Are you saying that you would snatch someone whom that old monster wants?”</p>
 <p>Pu Ze suddenly backed down from his earlier demands, “Never mind, forget about it.”</p>
 <p>While the duo was conversing with each other, Qin Lie calmed himself down and attempted to find a way to open his spatial ring and take out the jade token.</p>
 <p>To open the spatial ring, he needed to press the ring’s surface with his finger and unleash a wisp of spirit energy and soul consciousness.</p>
 <p>But he couldn’t move his fingers right now. The simple task of taking out the jade token had become incredibly difficult.</p>
 <p>He was incredibly anxious.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, an incredibly obvious ripple appeared from the Soul Suppressing Orb.</p>
 <p>The six wisps of souls connected to him by blood were cheerfully coming out of the Soul Suppressing Orb.</p>
 <p>The Spirits of Void and Chaos were obviously hungry. It was time for them to feed again.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie was shocked.</p>
 <p>The Spirits of Void and Chaos would be facing the Soul Altar expert Pu Ze if they were to come out right now. No matter how amazing they were, they were absolutely not a match for Pu Ze since they were only at infant form.</p>
 <p>They would only be taken away by Pu Ze.</p>
 <p>“Don’t! Don’t come out!” Qin Lie head hurt. He quickly sent out his consciousness and told them to obediently stay inside the Soul Suppressing Orb.</p>
 <p>However, the six Spirits of Void and Chaos didn’t seem like they would obey his instructions this time around.</p>
 <p>……</p>
