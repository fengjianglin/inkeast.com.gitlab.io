 <p><strong>Chapter 230: Tu Shixiong</strong></p>
 <p>When the blood pond floated to the surface, Qin Lie appeared.</p>
 <p>He was now standing between Lian Dong and Han Qingrui.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie!”</p>
 <p>Tu Ze, Zhuo Qian, Kang Zhi, and Han Feng all cried out after seeing him appear so suddenly.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie! It is you. It looks like the rumors I heard weren’t false after all,” Han Qingrui said in shock.</p>
 <p>“Armament Sect’s current sect master? Heh, well met!” Lian Dong smiled, “As long as you are captured, the hall master is guaranteed to give me a generous reward!”</p>
 <p>He swung the snake spear in his hands as ribbons of green light formed and were about to entangle Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie! What are you doing here!” Zhuo Qian said urgently.</p>
 <p>“Senior Tu! Do you want everyone here to die?” Qin Lie shouted sternly towards Tu Shixiong.</p>
 <p>Once finished, the spatial ring on his finger flashed as a Terminator Profound Bomb suddenly appeared in his palm.</p>
 <p>“Rrrmb! Zzzt!”</p>
 <p>A dull rumble of thunder, accompanied by bolts of dark blue lightning, emanated from the metallic, fist-sized ball.</p>
 <p>A rampaging energy that was suppressed spun madly within the metallic ball, forming ripples in the area out of nowhere.</p>
 <p>“Stop, Lian Dong!” Tu Shixiong exclaimed in a low tone.</p>
 <p>“Great commander, are you going to go against Hall Master’s orders?” Lian Dong frowned.</p>
 <p>An imposing figure walked out of a stone building not far away. He had a long, narrow scar extending from his left cheek all the way to his thick neck, and that very scar was like an earthworm’s brand on his face, causing him to look incredibly fierce.</p>
 <p>This man was Tu Shixiong, the great commander under Second Hall Master Cao Xuanrui. He was also Nebula Pavilion’s founder and Tu Mo and Tu Ze’s father.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie had heard of the man’s fame even before when he was at Nebula Pavilion. He had even seen him as an idol to be admired at one time.</p>
 <p>Now he could finally see the so-called founder of Nebula Pavilion as he watched him walk over and stand beside Lian Dong with natural might.</p>
 <p>“If you do not want to die, then listen to me obediently.” Tu Shixiong shot a glance at Lian Dong.</p>
 <p>Lian Dong’s expression shifted as he cried out, “Great commander, the hall master personally instructed me to carry this out!”</p>
 <p>“I will personally explain things to the hall master.” Tu Shixiong no longer looked at him but Qin Lie instead. He stared at the metallic ball within Qin Lie’s hand as his expression grew more and more serious. He solemnly asked , “Is that the magic item that severely damaged Blood Shadow?”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie nodded.</p>
 <p>Tu Shixiong pondered for a moment before saying, “Take Old Han and Old Kang and leave, now.”</p>
 <p>“Old pavilion master…” Han Qingrui and Kang Hui softly exclaimed.</p>
 <p>Tu Shixiong waved his hands and frowned. “It has nothing to do with me. Qin Lie is the one who saved you from the brink of death. Without that item in his hand, you will be dead, and I no longer value our past relationship. Therefore, you have nothing to thank me for.”</p>
 <p>“Uncle Han, let us go.” Gripping the Terminator Profound Bomb in one hand, he turned around and headed to Armament Sect.</p>
 <p>Han Qingrui and Kang Zhi’s group followed behind him. From time to time they would turn around and look at the father and his sons, Tu Shixiong, Tu Mo and Tu Ze. Their eyes were filled with complicated expression.</p>
 <p>“I will report this matter as is to the hall master!” Lian Dong suddenly snorted coldly.</p>
 <p>The worm-like scar on Tu Shixiong’s face shook, and he turned around and, as fast as lightning, grabbed Lian Dong’s neck with his burly right arm.</p>
 <p>Just like that, he took hold of Lian Dong’s neck and lifted him up into the air. “I dislike people who threaten me,” hmphing coldly as he stared into Lian Dong’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“Father!”</p>
 <p>“Uncle Tu!”</p>
 <p>“Great commander!”</p>
 <p>The expressions of Tu Mo, Tu Ze, Zhuo Qian, and a few other Dark Asura Hall martial practitioners all turned into ones of extreme shock.</p>
 <p>Lian Dong had made it very clear that everything he did was all according to Cao Xuanrui’s orders. The reason he would stay with Tu Mo’s group was also because of Cao Xuanrui.</p>
 <p>Tu Shixiong might be Cao Xuanrui’s strongest commander, but he was just his subordinate, after all. Wouldn’t he not be giving Cao Xuanrui face if he treated Lian Dong like this?</p>
 <p>That was why even Tu Mo had grown anxious.</p>
 <p>“Great commander! What are you doing? How dare you treat me this way. I will definitely have the hall master thoroughly investigate this matter!” Lian Dong was utterly fearless. His face was already beet red, yet he still dared to utter threats.</p>
 <p>That was because he knew that it was essentially impossible for Tu Shixiong to take action against him. There was just no way Tu Shixong would harm him.</p>
 <p>That was why he had the confidence to yell at him.</p>
 <p>“Great commander, you must not act recklessly!” the other Dark Asura Hall martial practitioners cried out, also attempting to persuade him against it.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, would you really dare to kill me?” Lian Dong laughed coldly, “How dare you treat me like this. Do you believe that Tu Mo and Tu Ze won’t lose their lives, that your Tu Family won’t be slaughtered to the last man? You dare kill me?!”</p>
 <p>“Why not?” Tu Shixiong grinned and immediately applied a great amount of force.</p>
 <p>“Krak!”</p>
 <p>The sound of Lian Dong’s neck being broken came out just like that. Lian Dong, who had just been sternly threatening him earlier, had his head twisted unnaturally to the side. His eyes were still shining with disbelief.</p>
 <p>—To the very end, he still could not believe that Tu Shixiong actually dared to kill him!</p>
 <p>“Great commander! Heavens, h-how could you do this?”</p>
 <p>“Father! Y-you…”</p>
 <p>“Uncle Tu!”</p>
 <p>Tu Shixiong snorted coldly before carelessly tossing Lian Dong’s corpse away. With a face full of brutality, he said, “Don’t speak his name. If Cao Xuanrui himself dares to threaten my son, then I will kill him as well!”</p>
 <p>The moment he said this, every single Dark Asura Hall martial practitioner there turned as quiet as mice. They all thought Tu Shixiong had gone insane.</p>
 <p>Even Tu Mo, Tu Ze, and Zhuo Qian thought the same.</p>
 <p>Everyone already knew that Tu Shixiong was incredibly violent. They also knew that his methods were cruel and ruthless; they knew his bouts of madness even better.</p>
 <p>But what they knew best was that Tu Shixiong was absolutely not stupid.</p>
 <p>And Tu Shixiong’s actions today were no longer those of someone insane. From their point of view, his actions were those of a man seeking death!</p>
 <p>“Yuan Tianya died, and one of the seats for hall master in Dark Asura Hall has opened up. Of course, I will become that new hall master!” Tu Shixiong’s expression was savage as he exclaimed in a deep manner, “Even Cao Xuanrui will not stop me!”</p>
 <p>The crowd subsequently shivered upon hearing this.</p>
 <p>At the corner of the street, Qin Lie unexpectedly stopped and turned around to look at Han Qingrui and the others. “Uncle Han, Kang Zhi, Han Feng, and Uncle Kang, have your men return to the sect first.”</p>
 <p>“You guys go on ahead,” Han Qingrui instructed.</p>
 <p>The few martial practitioners who had been following them since Nebula Pavilion secretly sighed in relief when they saw the entrance just in front of them. After giving slight bows, they returned to the sect entrance.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie…” Han Qingrui sighed.</p>
 <p>“How did you come to be at Armament Sect?” Kang Zhi asked.</p>
 <p>“I don’t have time to explain. The reason I led you here is so that you can live on.” Taking out the Eye of Frost, Qin Lie called over Kang Zhi and Han Feng, saying, “Come to my side. Grip my shoulders.”</p>
 <p>Han Feng and Kang Zhi looked surprised, but even though they were confused, they still walked over and gripped his shoulders.</p>
 <p>A shiny, crystalline light gushed out of the Eye of Frost and covered all three of them.</p>
 <p>Under Han Qingrui and Kang Hui’s gazes, Qin Lie, Kang Zhi, and Kang Hui’s bodies turned transparent before disappearing entirely.</p>
 <p>Han Qingrui and Kang Hui both appeared thoroughly shocked.</p>
 <p>A few minutes later, Qin Lie reappeared and said, “Uncle Han, Uncle Kang, it’s your turn to grab onto my shoulders now.”</p>
 <p>The duo followed suit in joy.</p>
 <p>A dozen or so seconds later, Han Qingrui, Kang Hui, Kang Zhi, and Hang Feng were all within a sealed crystal house made of frost.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie had gone out of his way to build this crystal house to shelter people. They were placed at the corner of the land of profound ice, and it was completely sealed. Here, the quartet would not be able to see the ancient beasts sealed in ice or where they exactly were.</p>
 <p>Without his guidance, the four of them would not be able to exit or enter this place.</p>
 <p>The reason he was so careful was that he was worried that they might expose the secrets beneath the Arctic Mountain Range. He was worried that someone might be careless and would accidentally let the secrets in this place slip .</p>
 <p>—He was worried that those with ill-intent would discover this place and unseal the ancient beasts here, bringing a world-ending catastrophe to Scarlet Tide Continent.</p>
 <p>“Wh-what is this place?” Kang Zhi exclaimed in a strange note.</p>
 <p>“Forget what this place is. You only need to know that you are very safe here, that’s all.” Qin Lie touched the Eye of Frost and said continued, “I still have something else to do, so I’ll be leaving first. Take a good rest, I will come again.”</p>
 <p>Very soon, he reappeared at Armament City and looked at the sky. Then, he rushed towards the plaza.</p>
 <p>During the short period of his departure, the leaders of the five forces had gradually gathered at the sect’s entrance.</p>
 <p>“It’s about time to pull in the net,” Yu Dai said coldly.</p>
 <p>“Yes. The last sinners of Armament Sect have all returned,” Jiang Yuan nodded. “It is time we finish this.”</p>
 <p>“I also really want to see this newly appointed sect master,” Fu Zhuohui smiled coolly.</p>
 <p>“That Qin Lie junior is mine to dispose of. I hope that you give this old one face!” Jiu Liuyu exclaimed in a dark tone.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go!”</p>
 <p>The leaders of the five forces led their subordinates through Armament City and then destroyed Armament Sect’s entrance as well. Like murderous intent given form, the five charged towards the plaza.</p>
 <p>At the plaza beneath Flame Volcano.</p>
 <p>Armament Sect’s three great reverends, seven inner sect great elders, Shi Jingyun, Wu Tuo, Su Ziying, Song Siyuan, Xie Zhizhang, Zhan Tianyi, and Xue Li...</p>
 <p>All of the heavyweights were gathered at one place.</p>
 <p>The three great Fulfillment Realm experts Song Siyuan, Xie Zhizhang, and Zhan Tianyi all sat down in front of Xue Li in silence with serious expressions.</p>
 <p>Xue Li had promised that as long as the trio didn’t move, he wouldn’t act either.</p>
 <p>And so, all three of them obediently stayed their hand.</p>
 <p>They were waiting for the leaders of the five forces to come, waiting for them to kill every last man and woman in Armament Sect before settling this matter completely.</p>
 <p>The three great reverends and seven great elders of Armament Sect were waiting as well. They were waiting for their deaths...</p>
 <p>These ten people had even split up and sat down with one person per spirit pattern pillar. They had even chosen the places of their deaths beforehand.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie!” Luo Zhichang exclaimed, “Go! Escape Armament Sect!”</p>
 <p>“Run as far as you can!” Fang Qi also cried out.</p>
 <p>The three Fulfillment Realm experts narrowed eyes widened a little as they paid attention to the newcomer.</p>
 <p>“Junior! Just wait a little longer. I will break all of your fingers, one by one!” Su Ziying grit her teeth and exclaimed.</p>
 <p>Shi Jingyun and Wu Tuo’s gazes were also swimming around Qin Lie’s fingers. They obviously had the same line of thought on their mind.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, you had actually came, kid. Are you here to see this sect walk towards destruction?” Xue Li grinned and chuckled strangely.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie frowned and searched for Tang Siqi and Lian Rou’s figures. He beckoned them and said, “Senior Sister Tang, Senior Sister Lian Rou, please come over to my side.”</p>
 <p>At the outskirts of the plaza, beside a group of Blood Spear martial practitioners, Tang Siqi and Lian Rou appeared dark and forlorn while looking ready to die along with Armament Sect. There was not the slightest bit of hope in their eyes.</p>
