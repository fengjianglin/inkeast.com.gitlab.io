 <p><b>Chapter 507: Sudden Change!</b></p>
 <p><span style>“The six Pure Soul Springs I refined are no longer useful to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Thunder Crystal Beast let out a long breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The electric flames and arcing lightning that shrouded the Pure Soul Springs transformed into rainbow light and were swallowed by the thunder spirit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The power protecting the six Pure Soul Springs disappeared, suddenly leaving them exposed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pristine, refreshing soul aura radiated from the thunder lagoon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Tingyu and the others sitting around the thunder lagoon immediately became alert, their eyes bright with joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They could sense the wondrous presence of the Pure Soul Springs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of them were unable to suppress their curiosity. They turned and craned their necks to look down into the thunder lagoon..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shocked by the aura of the Pure Soul Springs, Qin Lie instinctively looked up and said, “Throw me a few jade bottles.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Du Xiangyang and Luo Chen immediately became nervous with excitement, happiness leaping to their faces. They hurriedly reached for the spatial rings and were about to take out some jade bottles to hold the Pure Soul Springs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at that same moment, a sudden change took place!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the electric flames and the arcing lightning were removed from the Pure Soul Springs, leaving nothing to restrain their clear soul auras from being released...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Soul Suppressing Orb in Qin Lie’s forehead seemed to detect it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like a third eye opening, a bright light abruptly shone from his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From their position above Qin Lie, the others were temporarily blinded by the bright light. They couldn’t see what was happening in the lagoon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This turn of events also stunned the Thunder Crystal Beast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh whoosh whoosh! Whoosh whoosh whoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As if moving of their own accord, the six Pure Soul Springs flowed toward Qin Lie’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Soul Suppressing Orb consumed all six streams of energy in the span of a few breaths, then receded back into Qin Lie’s forehead, going dormant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, almost as soon as the Soul Suppressing Orb disappeared from sight, the Demon Sealing Tombstone emerged from Qin Lie’s spatial ring on its own.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seven rays of light that resembled divine chains shot from the Demon Sealing Tombstone, flailing around the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They seemed to be looking for something, an action that left Qin Lie dumbstruck..</span></p>
 <p><span style>The seven chains of pure light explored the thunder lagoon, eventually locking on to the Thunder Crystal Beast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Qin Lie could react, the seven chains of divine light latched tightly around the Thunder Crystal Beast. Qin Lie could only watch in shock as the Demon Sealing Tombstone slowly pulled the Thunder Crystal Beast into it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, the thunder spirit transformed into a bolt of lightning that surged through the chains and disappeared into the tombstone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of this occurred in a flash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>First the Soul Suppressing Orb released its blinding light, seizing the Pure Soul Springs before going back into hiding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the Demon Sealing Tombstone flew out, searched the area, and sealed the Thunder Crystal Beast after failing to find anything else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the light in the thunder lagoon dissipated, Du Xiangyang and the others were once again able to see inside of it… but first they noticed that the lightning in the sky had grown less furious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie raised his head to look up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sky was devoid of its usual booming thunder. Even the swathes of lightning that resembled dragons had charged back into the abyss they had come from, disappearing from sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A deafening rumble emanated from deep underground. The Forbidden Land of Thunder seemed to be experiencing an earthquake of great magnitude, deep cracks appearing as the ground shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Forbidden Land of Thunder’s wondrous formation was collapsing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The perpetual thunder and lightning was finally coming to an end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All because the thunder spirit had been sealed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qin Lie! What happened?” Song Tingyu shouted in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He took the Pure Soul Springs!” Luo Chen sneered. “All of them vanished in that bright flash of light!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, that can’t be right!” Du Xiangyang shook his head. “We haven’t even given him the jade bottles yet! Did he have enough jade bottles to store every single one of the Pure Soul Springs?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He definitely had more than he led us to believe!” Luo Chen yelled, his expression icy..</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was sure that Qin Lie had taken all of the Pure Soul Springs for himself. He thought that Qin Lie created that blinding light so they wouldn’t be able to see him take them. He believed that Qin Lie didn’t want to share.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What he didn’t know was that the Soul Suppressing Orb in Qin Lie’s forehead had consumed the six Pure Soul Springs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t take them,” Qin Lie said, narrowing his eyes. He searched his mind and discovered that six streams of energy were uncontrollably flowing toward depths of the Soul Suppressing Orb he had yet to explore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie was just as confused as everyone else, and he didn’t know why the Soul Suppressing Orb would act so strangely at such a critical moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But he didn’t want to waste time trying to explain the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll explain what happened to the Pure Soul Springs when we have time. Right now, all of you need to come down here and help me gather the soul crystals!” Qin Lie shouted up to them. “Since the thunder spirit has been sealed, all the thunder and lightning in the Forbidden Land of Thunder will gradually dissipate. It’ll be difficult for me to achieve a level of strength like before! Black Voodoo Cult, the three great families, Celestial Artifact Sect, Ten Thousand Beast Mountain… even the eastern barbarians will return after realizing that something has happened. We don’t have much time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get the soul crystals first!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Focus on what’s important!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe Qin Lie!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Quickly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Du Xiangyang and the others quickly reached an agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Luo Chen knew they couldn’t delay the matter a moment longer. He stopped trying to interrogate Qin Lie and immediately jumped into the thunder lagoon alongside the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many things changed after the Thunder Crystal Beast was sealed. Like a fire at the end of its lifespan, the electric flames and arcing lightning that originally populated the thunder lagoon gradually died out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thunderous vibrations, originally furious and unceasing, slowly became calm like an ocean after a storm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All six of Qin Lie’s group landed at the bottom of the lagoon without a hitch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not all of the bright soul crystals scattered throughout the bottom of the lagoon were the same quality. Some were full of soul power, bright a translucent, while others weren’t as bright and contained impurities within them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet even soul crystals with impurities were worth as much as cities in the Land of Chaos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The smaller soul crystals in the lagoon were the size of walnuts, while the bigger, extremely valuable ones were the size of a person’s head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There must be at least a thousand soul crystals...” Excitement shone in Xie Jingxuan’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She hadn’t said a thing about the Pure Soul Springs. As soon as she landed, she moved about the muddy floor of the lagoon, using her spatial ring to gather soul crystals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone else jumped into action as well. They knew that now was not the time to talk, and instead they competed against each other to see who could gather the most soul crystals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie was among them, but didn’t immediately move to pick up the soul crystals from the floor of the lagoon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taking a deep breath, Qin Lie first worked to calm himself. He refrained from using his soul to examine the Soul Suppressing Orb and instead moved to take care of matters in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie looked at the eight thick logs of Thunderblitz wood. These logs of wood were extremely tall, protruding high into the sky like the Sealing Obelisks. Wrapped around each log were threads of silver metal. Upon closer inspection, he discovered that the wood held patterns that seemed to have been formed naturally. The grain of each piece of wood resembled patterned lightning and looked mysterious and profound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to capture the thunder spirit alive, it had taken a lot of effort for the eastern barbarians to gather these eight logs of Thunderblitz wood. Each one was thousands of years old and extremely valuable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though they were valuable to begin with, the logs of Thunderblitz wood had consumed enormous amounts of thunder and lightning from the thunder lagoon. As a result, each log contained an abundance of thunder and lightning energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These pieces of wood are top quality thunder and lightning spirit materials! They can be used to make Terminator Profound Bombs!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s eyes shone brightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Luo Chen and the others focused all of their energy on gathering soul crystals, he shoved all eight logs of Thunderblitz wood into his spatial ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once all eight logs were inside of his spatial ring, he put away the Demon Sealing Tombstone. Using his mind consciousness to inspect the ring, he discovered that the space within was full.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s spatial ring could only hold so much. Twelve Sealing Obelisks, eight logs of Thunderblitz wood… all of these were enormous. If Qin Lie added anything else to them, the limits of his spatial ring would be exceeded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have to get a high grade spatial ring,” Qin Lie thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were thousands of soul crystals on the floor of the thunder lagoon. However, with everyone scouring the lagoon for them, the floor was swept clean in just half an hour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bottom of the lagoon was promptly picked clean.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie concentrated on sensing his surroundings. Just as he was about to explore deeper into the lagoon, his expression changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bottom of the thunder lagoon could be considered the center of the Forbidden Land of Thunder. After the thunder spirit was sealed, the Pure Soul Springs were taken, and the soul crystals were cleaned out, distinct vibrations emanated from underground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Run!” Qin Lie shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone in his group looked at him with confused expressions as though they weren’t satisfied with their current profits. They seemed prepared to continue searching the area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The people of the three other forces, as well as the eastern barbarians, will probably be back soon,” Qin Lie explained. “Also, the thunder lagoon is going to explode soon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This place is about to explode?” Du Xiangyang asked in disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, it’s going to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what are we waiting for?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s get out of here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Run”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The seven of them soared from the bottom of the thunder lagoon, quickly ascending. Upon reaching the surface, Qin Lie chose a random direction to fly in and everyone followed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
