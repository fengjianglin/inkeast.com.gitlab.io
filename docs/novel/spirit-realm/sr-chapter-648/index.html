 <p><b>Chapter 648: Battle Soul Crystals!</b></p>
 <p><span style>Without the threat of the Black Voodoo Cult and the three families, Jiang Zhuzhe turned and immediately attacked the body of the Blood Progenitor that Xue Li was possessing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the terrifying power of second-level Soul Altar, the Blood Fiend Sect members on the Setting Sun Islands could not stop him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhuzhe stood between Xue Li and the Blood Fiend Ten Elders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In your hands, Blood Fiend Sect has no future!” Xue Li shouted angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Brother, you are as pedantic as in the past, you will never change.” Jiang Zhuzhe shook his head and sighed. “You are so traditional, how can you adjust to present times? The reason that Black Voodoo Cult is so prosperous and strong is because Jiang An is just as ruthless as I am. His method of using bodies to nourish voodoo insects and quickly increase the power of their members is not very different from my cultivation method based on drinking blood. Look at the present Black Voodoo Cult, their power in the Land of Chaos is just below Terminator Sect! And you, if you could accept me in the past, with the two of us working together, Blood Fiend Sect wouldn’t have fallen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And if you hadn’t drunk human blood, would Blood Fiend Sect have been destroyed?” Xue Li said darkly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually, the fighting between us and Black Voodoo Cult never stopped. Even if I had not drunk human blood to cultivate, Black Voodoo Cult would have found some other excuse to attack Blood Fiend Sect,” Jiang Zhuzhe explained patiently. “This is due to the struggle between our progenitor and the Voodoo Progenitor, from when Blood Fiend Sect and Black Voodoo Cult had just begun their existence in the Land of Chaos. The fighting has never stopped. A thousand years ago, Black Voodoo Cult secretly started to use people to nourish voodoo insects and the their power skyrocketed. If Blood Fiend Sect remained the same at the time, Black Voodoo Cult would have come attacking Blood Cloud Mountain Range sooner or later.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And because I saw the danger to our sect, I stepped onto this bloody path!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The reason we were attacked was because the path I chose was faster than Black Voodoo Cult nourishing voodoo insects with people! It was all because others were afraid, afraid of our sect reaching an unfathomable level of power, that other sects helped Black Voodoo Cult eliminate us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Senior Brother, you and Junior Sister being alive and able to reunite as a family is because I have repeatedly been merciful!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I hope that you will stop trying to stop me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As long as I am alive, don’t even think of doing as you please, Jiang Zhuzhe!” Xue Li shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, if that’s the case, then I will restrain you for another hundred years!” Jiang Zhuzhe’s eyes flashed with a bloody light as he said, “A hundred years later, I will release you. At that time, you will see that my path had been right! Blood Fiend Sect will be standing on top of all the other factions!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blood Fiend Ten Elders!” Xue Li ordered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s useless.” Jiang Zhuzhe shook his head. “The blood demon they would form from their essence blood may be able to deal with one of the Gongye brothers, but it cannot defeat me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because my knowledge of the secret arts of Blood Fiend Sect is far above theirs!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countless rays of bloody light suddenly flew out of Jiang Zhuzhe’s body to form bloody ribbons slithering between people like snakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blood of the Blood Fiend Ten Elders started to flow in an unusual fashion. They immediately lost control over their blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xue Li’s plan had been immediately stopped in its tracks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even his face was flushed red. The blood in his vessels was boiling unusually. Even he was affected by Jiang Zhuzhe’s power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do not move, I do not want to kill one of my own.” Jiang Zhuzhe’s tone was calm as he reached out towards Xue Li’s forehead. He seemed to want to pull out Xue Li’s soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the opposite island.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie felt helpless. He watched as Jiang Zhuzhe moved against Xue Li. No matter how hard he thought, he could not think of a solution.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two-level Soul Altar Jiang Zhuzhe was like an enormous and uncrossable abyss for the current him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The difference in cultivation realms between the two was too great.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if he could enter the body of the Blood Progenitor with his soul, the power he could control wasn’t even close to the power Xue Li could muster. And his own strength? It was far too insufficient, he stood no chance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Duan Qianjie’s eyebrow twitched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was ready to interfere with Jiang Zhuzhe’s next actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dian Qianjie suddenly raised his head to look at the sky, a hint of shock flashing through his eyes. His hand that had been rising suddenly stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhuzhe also seemed to feel something. He stopped moving towards Xue Li and looked into the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even further away, Li Mu within the sea of clouds also changed expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Sealing Tombstone that had been originally in the spatial ring suddenly floated out of its own accord as Qin Lie remained motionless. The Demon Sealing Tombstone suddenly floated into the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Arrgh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eight god corpses suddenly gave off low howls in unison. Their eyes were fixed on the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What came was a relentless and ancient fighting resolve that swept in like storming clouds that had travelled tens of thousands of miles from the ends of the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pure battle soul projection! This is the immortal battle soul!” Hong Bowen of the Blood Fiend Ten Elders shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, a deep and ancient voice speaking god language roared in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the same voice as the one he had heard when his blood essence had been absorbed by the Demon Sealing Tombstone!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He suddenly looked up to peer into the depths of the clouds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With his low cultivation, he should not have been able to see anything. Yet for some reason, when he looked into the sky, he could clearly see a majestic scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Within the clouds, a flood of consciousness floated over from unknown places.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were dozens of them. Each current consciousness resembled a long stream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were clear crystals flowing with those currents. It was possible to see mysterious characters within them. He could see short scenes of fights, as well as the scenery and people of the ancient era...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those were battle soul crystals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The legends said that in the ancient era, many powerful martial practitioners’ thoughts could form pure crystals. They could imprint their understanding of battle onto them. Those crystals were called battle soul crystals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Each battle soul crystal was formed by a lifetime’s experiences of a powerful elite, and imprinted with their great understanding of power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, there were large amounts of battle soul crystals in the currents of consciousness streaming in from far away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those battle soul crystals came from unknown and remote places.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Qin Lie’s blood essence had been consumed by the Demon Sealing Tombstone, it gave off ancient summons, and this seemed to be what came after confirming the location!</span></p>
 <p><span style>These battle soul crystals had to belong to the eight god corpses!</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were too many martial practitioners gathered on the Setting Sun islands but there were not many that felt these currents of consciousness. The ones that could see the battle soul crystals among them were even more scarce.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie was one of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He saw those currents of consciousness that carried large numbers of battle soul crystals turn into waterfalls and quickly land on the heads of the eight god corpses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mysterious and ancient characters flickered on the necks, faces, and skin of the god corpses. Then the auras of the eight god corpses started to furiously rise!</span></p>
 <p><span style>With every second, the eight god corpses seemed to grow stronger!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Battle soul crystals were the most genuine representation of a warrior’s battle experience and their understanding of power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if their intelligence had not completely recovered, when the lost battle soul crystals were put back in, these eight god corpses’ understanding of the martial way and the laws of the universe was quickly recovering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whoosh whoosh whoosh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Enormous waves reached towards the sky. The eight god corpses stood deep in the water as their aura rose, whirlwinds of pure power formed around them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those whirlwinds continued to spin, and the power they gave off grew increasingly stronger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lightning flashed in the eyes of the eight god corpses. Blinding light also came from their noses, eyes, and ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those were the purest of powers!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The decline of the soul consciousness continued for fifteen minutes. Then, the thought projections that seemed to have come from another world dissipated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The unknown divine characters on the eight god corpses once again sank back into their flesh. The whirlpools around them started to grow even more terrifying after a period of accumulation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crack crack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strange shattering sounds came from those whirlpools of pure power as though the space itself started collapsing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qin Lie, those power whirlwinds need a vent!” Duan Qianjie suddenly said gravely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s eyes lit up as looked towards Jiang Zhuzhe. A thought immediately formed in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eight god corpses moved in unison, eight pairs of eyes locking onto Jiang Zhuzhe. The power whirlwinds around them started to slowly move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zhuzhe’s face changed color.</span></p>
