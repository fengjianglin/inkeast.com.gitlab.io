 <p><b>Chapter 534: Five Progenitors and Three Emperors</b></p>
 <p><span style>After a brief moment, Ye Yihao and Huang Zhuli became gray skeletons, their flesh and organs disappearing without a trace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t even make a sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The people nearest to them, Su Yan, Feng Yiyou, and Yu Men, were focused on the remains of the ancient warriors scattered throughout the desolate plain, so they didn’t immediately notice what had happened to the two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their dried bones fell to the ground and disintegrated into dust.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Su Yan notice what happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>—And she unleashed a bloodcurdling scream.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Yiyou and Yu Men heard her scream, and when they looked over at the two piles of bone dust, understanding suddenly washed over them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Terror immediately filled their eyes. They felt a chill run down their backs and swiftly spread through their body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All three of them trembled in horror, coming to a sudden stop where they were in the desolate plain. They refused to move even a centimeter more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This turn of events had frightened their souls out of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie and the others, having paid attention to the body of the Voodoo Progenitor this entire time, saw the voodoo insects get consumed and the dismal fates of Ye Yihao and Huang Zhuli.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They exchanged looks and saw the terror and anxiety in each other’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Chen and Du Xiangyang inhaled deeply and inwardly rejoiced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>—They rejoiced that they didn’t immediately rush down into the Land of Buried Gods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahem...” Du Xiangyang licked his lips, his voice weak and hoarse. “I think… I think Qin Lie is right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone nodded in agreement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“L-let’s just watch for now and... not enter recklessly,” Su Tingyu said, shock on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t try to take the Blood Progenitor’s body, Qin Lie! Nothing here is right!” Xue Moyan continuously took deep breaths, trying to maintain her composure. The burning light of excitement in her eyes slowly died down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was struggling to curb the greed within her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’ll be best for us to calm down first,” Xie Jingxuan said in a relatively composed manner. “Don’t let the remains of those ancient warriors go to your heads.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the black barbarians that had been behind Feng Yiyou and the others charged down the side of the frozen lake to the Land of Buried Gods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How careless,” Sen Ye snorted, his expression full of disdain. He had witnessed the terrible fate of Ye Yihao and Huang Zhuli.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They have no clue how bizarre the Land of Buried Gods is!” Jiang Tianxing laughed out loud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gao Yu!” Sen Ye suddenly shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gao Yu had just slid down the icy wall that made up a part of the frozen lake’s interior. He glanced at Sen Ye and Jiang Tianxing’s group indifferently, nodded, then turned to travel toward the area the Evil God was in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We need to be wary of him!” Jiang Tianxing exclaimed grimly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve never trusted him,” Sen Ye said with a frown, his eyes cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good!” Jiang Tianxing snickered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The same goes for you!” Sen Ye added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Tianxing froze mid-smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Up to this point, the eastern barbarians were still the strongest, largest force in the Land of Buried Gods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although they had paid a significant price and lost half their number, more than seventy tribesmen surrounded Sen Ye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Most were black barbarians that were completely loyal to Sen Ye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the deaths of Ye Yihao and Huang Zhuli, Black Voodoo Cult had been utterly wiped out. Only Su Yan of the Su Family, Feng Yiyou of Celestial Artifact Sect, and Yu Men of Ten Thousand Beast Mountain still lived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were only three people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t have the Demon Sealing Tombstone or any powerful spirit arts. They weren’t a threat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sen Ye had nothing to fear from them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ones that Sen Ye had to be concerned about were the people in Qin Lie’s group!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite the fact that few people were in his group, they had the Demon Sealing Tombstone and Blood Fiend Sect’s terrifying weapon, the Bloodthirsty Dragon, on their side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Tianxing cultivated the Blood Spirit Art and used to be a part of Blood Fiend Sect. To Sen Ye, he didn’t deserve to be trusted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sen Ye only believed in his tribesmen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You and your father brought news of the Graveyard of Gods to us, but neither of you are eastern barbarians.” Sen Ye wore a somber expression. “I don’t know how telling us eastern barbarians about the Graveyard of Gods fits into your plans, but I know you are using us to achieve a certain goal!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My only goal is the body of the Blood Progenitor,” Jiang Tianxing replied, an awkward expression on his face. “It’s a pity that the Bloodthirsty Dragon took it from the Land of Buried Gods. Achieving that goal now seems unlikely, so I hope to take other remains from here to make up for it… I hope that we can continue this friendly relationship since neither I nor you eastern barbarians call the Land of Chaos home."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sen Ye snorted skeptically. “As long as we find the remains of the five progenitors and the three emperors.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah… the five great progenitors and the three great emperors…” Light flashed in Jiang Tianxing’s eyes. “I also hope to find their remains, and by extension, their inheritances. Rumor has it that all of them were laid to rest here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I hope that’s the case.” Sen Ye took a deep breath and shouted, “Everyone! Stay with me as we enter, and advance slowly!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eastern barbarians began moving forward from one end of the Land of Buried Gods. Their first target was the ancestor of the eastern barbarians, the Arrow God.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Feng Yiyou, Yu Men, and Su Yan won’t dare to make any rash movements. The eastern barbarians are moving toward the Arrow God, and Gao Yu is heading to the Evil God...” Du Xiangyang narrowed his eyes as he peered downward from the edge of the frozen lake, taking note of what their enemies were doing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie didn’t make a sound. He simply watched the Voodoo Progenitor's body and the two voodoo insects inside of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Yihao and Huang Zhuli had been connected to the voodoo insects by soul and blood. When the voodoo insects were sucked into the Voodoo Progenitor’s body, it seemed to use that connection to drain the soul energy and blood from both Black Voodoo Cult ringers..</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie had noticed that the body of the Voodoo Progenitor, which was covered in writhing threads of black light, slowly radiated a nearly imperceptible life force.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Voodoo Progenitor’s body, which had been lifeless for an interminable amount of time, resembled an ancient tree growing a tender green branch. It felt extremely strange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Jingxuan gasped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Voodoo Progenitor’s body is showing signs of life!” she exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Jingxuan was extremely sensitive to life fluctuations. She detected the mysterious changes occurring within the body of the Voodoo Progenitor as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment she finished speaking, everyone turned their attention to the Voodoo Progenitor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The voodoo insects are drinking the blood of the Voodoo Progenitor!” Xue Moyan wore an expression of disbelief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the group focused on the body, and as expected, the Eight-winged Centipede Queen and the Black Crystal Sky Scorpion were feeding off of the remaining droplets of blood inside of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The auras of Ye Yihao’s and Huang Zhuli’s souls could be sensed from the bodies of both voodoo insects. This shrouded the Voodoo Progenitor’s body with multiple soul auras, making anyone who sensed it feel uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It just… doesn’t feel right,” Du Xiangyang said, shaking his head. A strange anxiety weigh upon his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aaaaoooouuuuu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the sky above the Land of Buried Gods, the Bloodthirsty Dragon wailed mournfully once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood Fiend Sect’s ultimate treasure dove toward Qin Lie and Xue Moyan, long streams of blood trailing behind it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Blood Progenitor’s body sat atop its skull, bloody light flashing from it as if it were a sanguine sun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dense, fiendish blood energy seemed to well from either the Blood Progenitor’s body or the bloody bone dragon. It resembled a sea of blood that threatened swallow people up and drown them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Th-the Blood Progenitor!” Pan Qianqian screamed in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Terror suddenly filled Qin Lie’s and Xue Moyan’s faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Were it not for the bizarre changes occurring in the Voodoo Progenitor’s body or the terrible deaths of Ye Yihao and Huang Zhulie, Qin Lie and Xue Moyan might’ve welcomed the body of the Blood Progenitor with open arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that cruel precedent having been set right in front of them, Qin Lie and Xue Moyan felt nothing but fright. When they saw the bloody bone dragon carrying the Blood Progenitor’s body toward them, they considered fleeing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ba-dump ba-dump! Ba-dump ba-dump ba-dump!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The heartbeats of Luo Chen and the others suddenly became uncontrollably fast like the deep thumping of a drum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their blood began boiling, their faces flushed bright red, and they felt as if their bodies were about to explode.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone went pale with shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I feel like I’m going to blow up!” Du Xiangyang howled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on!?” Luo Chen shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bloody light radiated from Qin Lie and Xue Moyan. Their eyes became a deep scarlet, almost as if blood were about to gush from them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From their perspective, a sea of blood appeared right in front of them. Sanguine fluid dripped from the enormous dragon at the center of that sea, which growled as if it wanted to devour them and take over their souls...</span></p>
