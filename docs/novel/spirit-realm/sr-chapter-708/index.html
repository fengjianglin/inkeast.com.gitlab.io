 <p><b>Chapter 708: You Have To Take Responsibility!</b></p>
 <p><span style>The so-called Graveyard of Gods was not a place for the gods to be buried or a place to preserve the corpses of the strongest ancient elites.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Graveyard of Gods was a divine altar that the Heaven Fighting Race had built. Inside, it had seven spirit bodies guarding the seven forbidden lands used by Heaven Fighting Race to train their descendants and for them to gain experience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bodies of the ancient elites, the six Pure Soul Springs, and the corpses of the Blood Progenitor and Voodoo Progenitor in the Land of Buried Gods were the prizes the Heaven Fighting Race used to reward their descendants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The descendants of the Heaven Fighting Race trained in the seven great forbidden lands, and slowly grew up. They experienced all kinds of tests. Those that succeeded would obtain the Pure Soul Springs, the bodies of the ancient elites including the Blood and Voodoo Progenitor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of the rewards, the bodies of the Blood and Voodoo Progenitor and the six Pure Soul Springs were the best prizes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bodies of Blood and Voodoo Progenitor weren’t just perfectly preserved, there were Soul Altars hidden deep in their minds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seven level Soul Altars!</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the descendants of the Heaven Fighting Race, the six Pure Soul Springs and complete seven level Soul Altars were extremely valuable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The seven god corpses and the heads that were placed in the Land of Buried Gods were only there to maintain control over the Graveyard of Gods They provided power to the Graveyard of Gods so that it would keep working forever.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Demon Sealing Tombstone was the key to opening the Graveyard of Gods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When a Trial of the Graveyard of Gods finished, the descendants of the Heaven Fighting Race that succeeded in the end could use the key to seal the seven spirit bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This meant the true end to a trial.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The descendant of the Heaven Fighting Race that possessed the Demon Sealing Tombstone was recognized as the victor. They could prove themselves to the elders of the Heaven Fighting Race through the Demon Sealing Tombstone. They could receive the trust and recognition of those people. They could also use the key to get other benefits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I only know this much. As to what other uses the Demon Sealing Tombstone has, why the six of them could not come out after being sealed and what they changed into, those are not things I’m able to understand.” The Ice Phoenix explained in detail what she knew about the Graveyard of Gods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie seemed to realize that his coincidental meeting with a headless god corpse in the waters near Sea Moon Island and obtaining the Demon Sealing Tombstone was not an accident.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He speculated that because of his arrival and his bloodline, it caused the god corpse to go into a berserk rage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, the last god corpse that every faction had been searching for might have kept hiding underwater if it wasn’t for his arrival.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was because of his arrival which alerted the Demon Sealing Tombstone that the god corpse had gone berserk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking back to how he had thrown up a mouthful of blood when he had received the Demon Sealing Tombstone, and then the unusual peacefulness of the Demon Sealing Tombstone, his thoughts grew even clearer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was his blood that had been recognized by the Demon Sealing Tombstone!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was also why Luo Chen could not cause any response after he stole the Demon Sealing Tombstone, no matter what he did, and had even encountered backlash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After entering the Graveyard of Gods, the Demon Sealing Tombstone that was in Luo Chen’s possession sensed he was in the Land of Fire, abandoned Luo Chen, and flew towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thinking over the matter and connecting all the dots pointed at one conclusion. Everything was because he possessed the bloodline of the Heaven Fighting Race.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though he had yet to awaken his bloodline, couldn’t release the “blaze” divine characters, and could not use his terrifying bloodline, he still had the blood of the Heaven Fighting Race!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So this Trial in the Graveyard Gods in the Land of Chaos was opened for me alone from the start!” Qin Lie realized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the Demon Sealing Tombstone, it was akin to having the key to opening the Graveyard of God’s Trial.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was because of him that the Graveyard of Gods had come alive and exhibited its wonders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was not for him, if he did not have the Demon Sealing Tombstone and entered the Graveyard of Gods, maybe nothing would have happened in the Graveyard of Gods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The participants from the other nine Silver rank forces were there just to make up the numbers. They were to accompany him during his Trial in the Graveyard of Gods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was the reason that the Graveyard of Gods could activate and change!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he thought through all this, he finally understood the connection between him and the Graveyard of Gods, and he knew a bit more about the wonders of his bloodline.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My promise with the first voodoo creature is nothing major. We are no different. It also hoped to flee from the Graveyard of Gods. The Demon Sealing Tombstone is the crux to the seal. Both me and the creature, as well as all others, were just prizes for the descendants of the Heaven Fighting Rac. Obviously, we were not willing to be just trophies, so we worked together to resist the power of the Demon Sealing Tombstone,” the Ice Phoenix continued to talk.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Inside the Forbidden Land of Ice, as the ice spirit, I could use the frost power there. Therefore, I had considerable power. That voodoo creature is extremely intelligent. It hid inside the body of the Voodoo Progenitor, and faked its death to fool the Heaven Fighting Race. They believed it had died along with the Voodoo Progenitor. After the corpse of the Voodoo Progenitor had been thrown in and the Heaven Fighting Race left, it secretly woke up. As the ice spirit, I immediately felt it. I communicated with it and found that it urgently wanted to leave just like I did. It also knew of many mysteries. We had an unspoken agreement and I allowed it to exist in the Forbidden Land of Ice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There isn’t much else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie listened carefully with a frown. He thought for a while and then took out the wooden sculpture he obtained from the Forbidden Land of Wood. He asked, “Have you seen this before?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No.” The Ice Phoenix shook her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have been the ice spirit for a long time. Have you ever seen outsider enter the Graveyard of Gods and move through its lands?” Qin Lie asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, beings of other races can enter through some spatial cracks or through special methods without the Demon Sealing Tombstone as the key.” The Ice Phoenix thought for a while and then said, “Without opening the Graveyard of Gods with a key, it would be in an unusual state. All the defensive formations set up by Heaven Fighting Race would be active. Those who entered without a key would be attacked and scattered among the seven forbidden lands. Almost all of them die to the traps left behind by the Heaven Fighting Race. ”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie was astounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This meant that the Wood Race that came in from the outside with the wooden sculpture must have entered via some unorthodox method.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The result was that the terrifying wards of the Graveyard of Gods reacted and exterminated them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Phoenix’s words meant that his idea of using the wooden sculpture to learn the identity of the Wood Race clansman who held it and his plans to use it to search for his grandfather had to end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Next, Qin Lie asked about other matters concerning the Heaven Fighting Race.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Phoenix responded to each of his questions and said all she knew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie was satisfied with her cooperation. When he found that he knew what he wanted to know and asked all the questions that he should have, Qin Lie thought for a moment and then suddenly said, “You can leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Phoenix stilled. Light appeared in the depths of her icy eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had a complex look in her eyes as she gazed at Qin Lie. A long silence later, she asked, “I can leave?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.” Qin Lie’s tone was calm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the minds of highly intelligent races, the humans have always had a bad reputation. Humans do not hold to their word. They are cunning, devious, dishonorable. They do not abide by the rules, they forget favors done to them. They only see their own benefits, each of them is selfish and savage…” The Ice Phoenix described her impressions of humans, paused, and then said, “Aren’t you going to be like the other humans, after getting your answers, you will seal me in the Demon Sealing Tombstone or capture me alive? Even if you do not have the spirit power to make me your spirit pet, you can use me to trade for endless wealth. Why aren’t you doing it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop wasting your words. Leave as soon as possible, before I change my mind. With your skill, if you disguise yourself well, you can recover in a decade or so. By that time, if you live as a human in the Land of Chaos, unless you encounter people with two level or three level Soul Altars, no one will notice anything unusual about you. You will truly possess the freedom you desire,” Qin Lie urged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t you forget that I obtained the core inheritance of the Ice Emperor from you and also another inheritance that belonged to you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For me, those things are not especially valuable. I turned the inheritance the Ice Emperor left behind into my Frost Arts. That Frost Concept Diagram is just another part of the inheritance. It will take more time and energy to comprehend it. I cannot master it completely after getting it.” Qin Lie’s expression was relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In reality, after he realized the power of his bloodline were the blazing flames and that the power of his bloodline could not merge with the Frost Arts, he decided to not spend more time on cultivating the Frost Arts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ice and fire couldn’t coexist. He was worried that if he cultivated the Frost Arts too much, it would affect power of his bloodline.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to this, he did not have a strong urge to take back the Frost Concept Diagram that the Ice Phoenix had stolen from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure you do not want to take back what is rightfully yours?” The Ice Phoenix’s eyes flashed with an even stranger light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure.” Qin Lie’s expression was impatient. “Are you going or not? Why are you suddenly so chatty?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want to go right now,” the Ice Phoenix suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie was speechless. He looked dazedly at her for a while. He nodded. “Alright, you stay on this desolate island. I’m leaving.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he spoke, he dismissed her, and Qin Lie walked towards the crystalline war chariot in the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strangely, the Ice Phoenix followed in his footsteps silently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before he got onto the crystalline war chariot, an icy light flashed. The Ice Phoenix got onto the chariot first and then sat down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing?” Qin Lie’s expression darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After fighting against you in the frost kingdom, injuries to my soul only deepened, and my strength had been greatly reduced. Even now, after my soul returned to my true body, I have no way of disguising my unique spirit beast aura. If we separate and I encounter other martial practitioners, they will easily recognize me! So…” Ice Phoenix stopped and acted as though she wouldn’t leave him. “You have to take responsibility!”</span></p>
