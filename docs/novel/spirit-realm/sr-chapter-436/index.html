 <p><strong>Chapter 436: This is a Misunderstanding!</strong></p>
 <p>The voodoo insects had flown away earlier, and the two Illusory Demon Sect girls were currently being burned by the flames. The bloody holes at the center of their foreheads had been scorched black. The entry wounds could no longer be seen.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the newly arrived Illusory Demon Sect disciples had only seen their fellow disciples getting burned to death, so they did not understand what actually happened earlier.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie and Chu Li could not be absolved of the blame even if they jumped into the yellow spring.</p>
 <p>The five Illusory Demon Sect girls wore bright yellow dresses. They had bright eyes, white teeth, and skin like snow. They were as beautiful as flowers.</p>
 <p>They were all in the late stage of the Netherpassage Realm.</p>
 <p>The eyes of all five girls were currently filled with angry light. They surrounded Qin Lie and Chu Li almost immediately.</p>
 <p>“Sister Xue! This way!” someone cried out.</p>
 <p>A person could be heard moving swiftly through the forest. Another woman was heading their way.</p>
 <p>“It’s not what you think,” Chu Li awkwardly said, attempting to explain.</p>
 <p>“Do you think we’re blind?” a girl with an oval face asked with eyes that might as well be spitting fire. “We have eyes. We can see what happened! Stop your babbling!”</p>
 <p>Chu Li’s face darkened, and became irritated, no longer attempting to explain. “Whatever.”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie frowned and inwardly lamented his bad luck. He wasn’t sure how to deal with this.</p>
 <p>The voodoo insects had already flown away, so he was only wasting the fiery energy of his blood essences by keeping them burning. In light of this, he hurriedly drew them back into his body.</p>
 <p>The two Fire Qilin shaped flames flew from the charred corpses of the two Illusory Demon Sect girls and transformed into translucent drops of blood in midair. They obediently returned to Qin Lie’s side.</p>
 <p>“It’s him!”</p>
 <p>Every one of the Illusory Demon Sect girls focused their hateful gazes on Qin Lie’s person.</p>
 <p>The situation was now plain for all to see. The two girls had been burned to death and the Fire Qilin blood droplets had flown to Qin Lie. Who else could have done it but him?</p>
 <p>The three blood essences sank into Qin Lie’s palm. He took out several Heavenly Flame Crystals to replenish their fiery energy.</p>
 <p>Since the leader of the Illusory Demon Sect martial practitioners hadn’t arrived yet, he tried to think of a way to explain the situation and avoid a fight.</p>
 <p>The Illusory Demon Sect’s ringer was none other than Xue Moyan, Xue Li’s biological daughter.</p>
 <p>Xue Li was aware that he had a daughter, Xue Moyan, and knew that she would be participating in the Trial, so he had urged Qin Lie to think of a way to help Xue Moyan. Xue Li wanted Qin Lie to do his everything he could to find the holy medicine that would cure Xue Moyan’s soul.</p>
 <p>To that end, Xue Li had even given Qin Lie half of the Blood Codex.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie had long since decided to act according to Xue Li’s wishes and do his best to help Xue Moyan if he did run into her in the Graveyard of Gods.</p>
 <p>But he could never have imagined that his meeting with Xue Moyan would turn out like this.</p>
 <p>He still couldn’t think of a good way to explain the matter after a long while.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie had a terrible headache.</p>
 <p>“Sister Xue!” the oval-faced girl cried out.</p>
 <p>A tall girl with snow white skin dressed in a bright yellow dress suddenly appeared before their eyes.</p>
 <p>She stood right beside the burned corpses.</p>
 <p>The girl looked to be about twenty years old. She had a pair of long, artistic eyebrows and a pair of eyes that resembled pools of crystal clear water.</p>
 <p>“Chu Li.” The girl raised her head and looked at Terminator Sect’s Chu Li. Her eyebrows furrowed softly, and her voice was crisp and pleasant. “You killed them, didn’t you?”</p>
 <p>She didn’t even spare Qin Lie a glance.</p>
 <p>Chu Li snorted coldly and didn’t bother explaining. He knew that it would be pointless to try since they wouldn’t believe him anyway.</p>
 <p>“It wasn’t Chu Li, it was him!” the oval-faced girl gritted her teeth and glared at Qin Lie, her eyes full of hate.</p>
 <p>It was only then that Xue Moyan looked at Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>Her eyebrows were still furrowed, but now there was a hint of doubt in her clear eyes. “Who are you?”</p>
 <p>She did not recognize Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>Xue Moyan had investigated all the martial practitioners of the other eight great forces before the Trial began. She hadn’t investigated just ringers like Chu Li either—every person from every force who was even remotely notable and powerful had their realm and appearance roughly investigated.</p>
 <p>For example, even though Du Xiangyang and He Wei were not chosen as Heavenly Sword Mountain’s ringer, they were powerful enough to be included in her research.</p>
 <p>It could be said that the glaring, dangerous individuals of every force had caught her eye.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie obviously had not been one of them, indicating that he was not qualified worthy of Xue Moyan’s attention.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, he was not wearing the uniform unique to Heavenly Sword Mountain. In addition to that, even though he was obviously working with Chu Li, he wasn’t wearing Terminator Sect’s uniform. Therefore, he did not seem to be a member of Terminator Sect either.</p>
 <p>This was why Qin Lie’s identity and background made her doubtful and confused.</p>
 <p>“My name is Qin Lie. I hold a sword token of Heavenly Sword Mountain and am representing them in this Trial. I hail from the Scarlet Tide Continent,” Qin Lie said, introducing himself.</p>
 <p>This introduction did not lessen Xue Moyan’s confusion and instead made it worse. She shook her head and said, “I’ve never heard of such a person in Heavenly Sword Mountain or the Scarlet Tide Continent.”</p>
 <p>In her heart she had already put Qin Lie in the category of small fries who were not worthy of notice.</p>
 <p>“I don’t care if you believe me or not, but I will still explain myself regardless. Your companions died at the hands of the Black Voodoo Cult’s voodoo insects. Their deaths have nothing to do with us.” Qin Lie ultimately decided to try and explain anyway. “This is really just a misunderstanding!”</p>
 <p>“He’s lying, Sister Xue! There are no voodoo insects at all!” the oval-faced girl said harshly, pointing at Qin Lie. “We only saw him unleashing his flames and burning Little Die to death!”</p>
 <p>Xue Moyan nodded slightly and decisively ordered, “Take them out!”</p>
 <p>Including Xue Moyan, there were a total of six girls from Illusory Demon Sect. When they moved, they created numerous beautiful illusions that looked exactly like them. The illusions even possessed life and soul auras.</p>
 <p>It was impossible to distinguish which ones were real.</p>
 <p>The six girls and their illusions moved at the same time, resembling beautiful fairies who were about to overtake Qin Lie and Chu Li in an instant.</p>
 <p>“Indiscriminate women!” Chu Li snorted coldly.</p>
 <p>Bright silver Terminator Profound Bombs suddenly appeared in Chu Li’s hand. Terrifying thunderous rumbles immediately resonated from within them.</p>
 <p>Since Chu Li couldn’t be bothered to explain himself, he planned to blast his way out with the Terminator Profound Bombs, step over the corpses of the Illusory Demon Sect girls, and leave.</p>
 <p>“Leave Chu Li to me!” Xue Moyan cried out softly.</p>
 <p>The five Illusory Demon Sect girls paled and moved away when they saw Chu Li take out the Terminator Profound Bombs.</p>
 <p>They knew exactly how powerful they were.</p>
 <p>Xue Moyan was the only one who continued to circle Chu Li like an ephemeral fairy, continuing to create more and more illusions.</p>
 <p>“Brother Chu, please don’t kill her!” Qin Lie suddenly screamed.</p>
 <p>Chu Li was just about unleash the Terminator Profound Bombs and help Qin Lie when he froze and looked at him with eyes full of doubt.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie smiled bitterly. “Brother Chu, please give me face this once and don’t fight them. Let us leave this place and speak later.”</p>
 <p>“I need a reason!” Chu Lie yelled.</p>
 <p>“I will give you a reason once we leave!” Qin Lie answered solemnly.</p>
 <p>“I can leave, but can you?” Chu Li snorted coldly.</p>
 <p>“Of course.” Qin Lie took out a Terminator Profound Bomb that he had refined himself and tossed it, yelling, “Explode!”</p>
 <p>An Illusory Demon Sect girl was in the direction that he had tossed the Terminator Profound Bomb. Her expression changed as she hastily moved out of the way.</p>
 <p>An intense shockwave exploded from that direction, and Qin Lie charged through the terrifying lightning and explosive shockwave.</p>
 <p>“Stop him!” the oval-faced girl screamed.</p>
 <p>“I have a lot of Terminator Profound Bombs!” Qin Lie snorted.</p>
 <p>Just as he said, many more Terminator Profound Bombs the size of fists appeared in his left hand. Based on how they looked, they did not seem to be any weaker than the ones in Chu Li’s hand.</p>
 <p>The Illusory Demon Sect girls all paled at the sight.</p>
 <p>As a result, Qin Lie charged out of the encirclement by threatening to indiscriminately destroy everything with the Terminator Profound Bombs, frightening the girls and making them cautious.</p>
 <p>“Brother Chu! Give me face and don’t fight with them now. I’ll explain everything later!” Qin Lie cried out from afar.</p>
 <p>Chu Li snorted and dazzling starlight shone from his clothes just as Xue Moyan’s illusions charged at him.</p>
 <p>Amidst the blinding light, Chu Li actually used his spirit armor and flew up into the sky. Once he was in the air, he vanished with a flash.</p>
 <p>Xue Moyan wasn’t able to touch him.</p>
 <p>“After them!” she ordered.</p>
 <p>The girls of Illusory Demon Sect attempted to chase after the two like numerous yellow butterflies.</p>
 <p>Using the spirit armor, Chu Li flew into the air and immediately ascertained Qin Lie’s position. He dove toward the ground and arrived beside Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>“Let me carry you!” Chu Li yelled.</p>
 <p>“Okay!” Qin Lie responded.</p>
 <p>Chu Li quickly moved to Qin Lie and grabbed his shoulders. Since the girls of Illusory Demon Sect could only move along the ground, Chu Li and Qin Lie were able to fly into the distance and leave.</p>
 <p>It was in this way that the two of them escaped from the curses and attacks of the girls, ultimately disappearing from sight.</p>
 <p>“Bang!”</p>
 <p>Having been released by Chu Li, Qin Lie fell from the sky and landed in some thorny bushes.</p>
 <p>Chu Li did this to vent his frustration.</p>
 <p>Considering how tough Qin Lie was, the thorns of this bush did no other damage than tearing his clothing.</p>
 <p>“What happened back there?” Chu Li snorted. “Have you never seen a woman before? Were you so confounded by their beauty that you would let them slaughter you however they pleased?”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie smiled bitterly. “About that…”</p>
 <p>Just as Qin Lie was about to explain, he suddenly remembered that Xue Moyan was the daughter of Mo Lingye and Xue Li and had intimate ties to Blood Fiend Sect—</p>
 <p>—the Blood Fiend Sect that was a taboo in the Land of Chaos.</p>
 <p>If Xue Moyan’s identity were accidentally exposed because of his explanation, wouldn’t Xue Moyan be in great danger?</p>
 <p>Qin Lie could not tell Chu Li the truth!</p>
 <p>However, since Chu Li was still waiting for an explanation, it would probably be difficult for them to work together if Qin Lie could not appease him.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie thought about it then sighed. He forced himself to lie and began spouting nonsense, “Illusory Demon Sect’s Xue Moyan is actually my fiancée. Our marriage was set up by her father and my grandfather, but we’ve never seen each other before. I came all the way from the Scarlet Tide Continent and participated in the Trial to seek her out and see what kind of a woman she is…”</p>
 <p>“It’s that complicated?” Chu Li’s expression twisted in confusion.</p>
 <p>“Er... I didn’t expect to cause such a huge misunderstanding with the voodoo insects during our first meeting. I can’t say anything if she believes that I am the killer, so I’m waiting for her to calm down and figure out the truth before explaining our relationship in the future. Please forgive me, Brother Chu.” Qin Lie smiled bitterly.</p>
 <p>“What’s your relationship with Song Tingyu then?” Chu Li asked, rubbing his chin.</p>
 <p>“Ahem... I am a man... and a man sort of lacks self-control when it comes to these matters. You understand, right?” Qin Lie laughed dryly.</p>
 <p>“Oh, right, I understand. I understand completely.” Surprisingly, Chu Li actually patted Qin Lie’s shoulders in a friendly manner and even smiled. There was no trace of the anger from earlier. “Kid, we’re similar in that we both want to kill Ye Yihao. I didn’t think we’d be similar in this way as well!”</p>
 <p>“Brother Chu, you too?” Qin Lie asked in surprise.</p>
 <p>Chu Li laughed proudly, a look of satisfaction on his face, and said, “Brother Lie, if we set aside other matters and compare notes on this alone, then I am definitely qualified to be your elder brother! Hahahaha!”</p>
 <p>“Big Brother Chu is amazing.” Qin Lie saluted Chu Li.</p>
 <p>“Oh, it’s nothing, I’m just average.” Chu Li waved his hands humbly. “It’s only three or five women. It’s nothing, haha! Totally nothing.”</p>
