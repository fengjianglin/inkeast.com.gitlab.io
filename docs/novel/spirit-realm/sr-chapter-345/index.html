 <p><strong>Chapter 345: Pact</strong></p>
 <p>Qin Lie and Ku Luo discussed Qin Shan and the Dark Nether Race for a very long time.</p>
 <p>Ku Luo and the Horned Demon clansmen had attempted to slowly consume the land until they reached Herb Mountain.</p>
 <p>Then they would use Herb Mountain’s teleportation formation and move this Horned Demon group to the Nether Continent.</p>
 <p>They hadn’t been spreading the nether demonic energy too much recently because their people were not yet fully prepared. There were also many elderly and young people that they did not bring with them.</p>
 <p>Not only that, but they were also worried that the reactions of Eight Extreme Temple and Profound Heaven Alliance might be too intense, which was why they wanted to take things one step at a time.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie and the Horned Demon Race quickly reached an agreement.</p>
 <p>Blood Spear’s group could pass through the evil nether passageway and enter the Nether Realm first. They would be carried by the evil race’s flying nether beasts from the Nether Realm to the bottom level of the Nether Battlefield, the ultimate blood ground, to cultivate.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the Ling Family would be left in Armament City to cultivate using the nether demonic energy.</p>
 <p>As for Qin Lie, he would need to head to Herb Mountain to help the Horned Demon Race confirm if a teleportation formation was inside of Herb Mountain and whether or not it was usable.</p>
 <p>Of course, if Profound Heaven Alliance still dared to trade with the Horned Demon Race, then Ku Luo would exchange the Profound Yin Nine Leaf Lotus for Ku Lu anytime.</p>
 <p>“Lord Lang Xie, Instructor Feng, Elder Mo Hai, Senior Sister Tang... I’ve negotiated with the Horned Demon clansmen. They will arrange for someone to send you through the evil nether passageway and toward the ultimate blood ground to cultivate.” Qin Lie had walked out of the cave of Flame Volcano and arrived at the area where the Blood Spear martial practitioners were gathered.</p>
 <p>He immediately saw that Lang Xie, Feng Rong, Mo Hai, and the others were sitting up straight and channeling spirit energy to resist the encroachment of the nether demonic energy.</p>
 <p>Lang Xie, Feng Rong, and Mo Hai raised their heads and looked at him. Their faces were somewhat cold.</p>
 <p>“Qin Lie, I can’t believe that you’re actually working with the evil race!” Feng Rong hmphed coldly.</p>
 <p>Mo Hai and Tang Siqi also sighed softly. Judging from their looks, they were a kind of disappointed in Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>Previously, they were busy escaping from Profound Heaven Alliance, Eight Extreme Temple, and Joyful Union Sect’s pursuit. They did not have the leisure to think about other things, so they did not think too deeply about it.</p>
 <p>Now that they were safe, their expressions were a little ugly after some careful thought.</p>
 <p>Their perspective of the evil race was essentially no different from that of Profound Heaven Alliance and Eight Extreme Temple. They also viewed the evil races as the source of evil, fearsome beasts.</p>
 <p>Although they were now forced to step into a land covered in nether demonic energy, they still couldn’t accept standing with the evil races deep in their hearts.</p>
 <p>This was also why they instinctively defied Qin Lie, who obviously shared a relationship with the evil race.</p>
 <p>“These people have lived on the Scarlet Tide Continent all this time and are too heavily influenced by Profound Heaven Alliance and Eight Extreme Temple. They’re unable to change their minds in an instant.” Xue Li floated above Lang Xie and Feng Rong’s heads before snorting. “Fools! When you one day step out of the Scarlet Tide Continent and enter other high ranking continents, then you will know exactly how common foreign races are. When that happens, when you enter a certain auction house or some special cultivation area, you will notice that the people you run into and stand shoulder to shoulder with are all foreigners! If you still choose to judge a person of a different race as an outsider and attempt to beat or murder them at the slightest offense, then you, yourselves, will become the true outsiders!”</p>
 <p>Xue Li had accepted the fact that Qin Lie had connections to the Horned Demon Race with no problem whatsoever. This was because the continent that he used to live in also had a lot of foreign races, and the relationship between various large forces and the evil races were intimate as well.</p>
 <p>“Perhaps it is us whose outlook isn’t wide enough and limited to the Scarlet Tide Continent.” Feng Rong sighed quietly. “But, but we…”</p>
 <p>“Learn to accept it slowly. Learn to communicate with a foreign race. This will be extremely beneficial to you in the future.” Xue Li pondered for a moment, looking at them before saying seriously, “You are the only bloodline left of Blood Fiend Sect. I hope that you may one day step out of the Scarlet Tide Continent and revive the Blood Fiend Sect!”</p>
 <p>Many Spirit Hunting Beasts flew out from behind Flame Volcano under Ka Meng’s commanding shout.</p>
 <p>Nearly thirty Spirit Hunting Beasts had come to rest beside Blood Spear’s group, urged by many Horned Demon warriors with three horns.</p>
 <p>“These Spirit Hunting Beasts will take you to the ultimate blood ground to cultivate. As for me, I will attempt to build a teleportation formation in the outside world that will directly connect to the ultimate blood ground. In the future, you will be able to go between the ultimate blood ground and the Scarlet Tide Continent through the teleportation formation.” Qin Lie stared at the Blood Spear martial practitioners and said solemnly, “I am truly sorry that I dragged all of Blood Spear into this mess. I will do my best to make it up to you.”</p>
 <p>Lang Xie stared at Qin Lie for a moment before nodding slightly, saying, “Let’s go.”</p>
 <p>Under Feng Rong and Lang Xie’s guidance, the Blood Spear martial practitioners and Mo Hai sat on the Spirit Hunting Beasts. Tang Siqi, who had insisted on coming against the wishes of the three great reverends, suddenly looked at Qin Lie deeply before she was about to step onto a Spirit Hunting Beast.</p>
 <p>“Senior Sister Tang, please wait for a moment,” Qin Lie suddenly said.</p>
 <p>Tang Siqi’s eyes lit up slightly, full of expectations as she came to a stop. Clad in a long, rose red skirt and looking extremely beautiful, she appeared to be somewhat nervous as she waited for Qin Lie’s arrival.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie stopped in front of her and hesitated for a moment before taking out a few Spirit Gathering Boards from the spatial ring.</p>
 <p>Pulling Tang Siqi’s hand, Qin Lie put the Spirit Gathering Boards in her palm and said, “These Spirit Gathering Boards contain four ancient basic diagrams—Spirit Gathering, Spirit Storage, Amplification, and Strengthening. I have labeled all of them in detail, and I hope they will be useful to you.”</p>
 <p>The four ancient basic diagrams, Spirit Gathering, Spirit Storage, Amplification, and Strengthening, all came from the Soul Suppressing Orb. They had helped cleanse Qin Lie’s heart, preventing him from losing control and returning to his previous self.</p>
 <p>As an artificer, Tang Siqi had always been very interested in these four ancient diagrams, but she had never asked Qin Lie for them.</p>
 <p>Now, after a moment of thought, Qin Lie decided to give these four ancient diagrams to her so that she might break through her limits in artifact forging.</p>
 <p>“Ancient diagrams!” Mo Hai, who was about to climb up the Spirit Hunting Beast, suddenly shook and looked in their direction.</p>
 <p>He stared at the Spirit Gathering Board in Tang Siqi’s hands.</p>
 <p>After a while, Mo Hai finally seemed to come to a realization and said to Qin Lie, “S-so the Spirit Gathering Boards that were brought by Xie Jingxuan weren’t inscribed by Li Mu, the owner of Li’s Shop. It was you who created them.”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie smiled in reply.</p>
 <p>As for Tang Siqi, she extracted her hand from Qin Lie’s in embarrassment, a blush on her cheeks. “Take care of yourself. I... I will be leaving with the great elder and the others. I will research the four spirit diagrams well and will not disappoint you.” She shot a seductive glance at Qin Lie before finally sashaying her way up the Spirit Hunting Beasts, waving goodbye to Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie chuckled.</p>
 <p>The Spirit Hunting Beast, which was several meters, long carried Blood Spear’s group to the evil nether passageway.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie waited until Lang Xie and the others had disappeared before turning around to look. He immediately noticed Ling Yushi, who was standing on top of a big rock that jutted out at the collapsed Flame Volcano. She was watching at him with a half smile.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie suddenly felt a little nervous.</p>
 <p>The current Ling Yushi was no longer the Ling Yushi from back in Ling Town. Be it her aura, methods, realm, or intelligence, the current Ling Yushi, whose blood of the Evil God had awakened, was growing at an unbelievably rapid speed.</p>
 <p>Her secret mind arts that could see through one’s heart made even Qin Lie feel like it was difficult to adapt to. The pressure was rather heavy when he was hanging out with her.</p>
 <p>“I just gave her something,” He explained to Ling Yushi, rubbing his nose with a somewhat embarrassed look.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need to explain.” Ling Yushi smiled gently before saying coolly, “There were many times where, without even guessing, I only needed to look to know what they were thinking about. Heh, that Senior Sister Tang of yours and her feelings for you… how could you not notice?”</p>
 <p>Qin Lie felt his head grow to be as big as an ox.</p>
 <p>“I still prefer the original Qin Lie,” Ling Yushi said quietly.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie kept quiet.</p>
 <p>After a while, he said with a bitter look, “Something very strange has happened to me. I... I’m not sure how to explain it.”</p>
 <p>“Never mind. This is my fault as well. I am also changing—changing into a version of me that even I don’t quite recognize anymore.” Ling Yushi walked over from afar. Her beautiful face gradually regained her former serenity and gentleness. She arrived beside Qin Lie and held his hand of her own accord, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Qin Lie.</p>
 <p>“This is the place.” Ling Yushi pointed at the detonated plaza. “More than half a year ago, it was at this place where Xuanxuan and I thought we were definitely going to die. I thought that we would be killed by the Blood Spear martial practitioners. It is you who, at the sacrifice of your identity, defended Xuanxuan and I. Even earlier than that, back at Ling Town, there were several times where you saved the Ling Family from Du Haitian’s schemes. At Icestone City, you betrayed Nebula Pavilion, helping us by killing Du Haitian and his entire family. There are many more examples such as this.</p>
 <p>“In truth, The Ling Family and I owe you far too much... so much that I feel I can tolerate all of your flaws.”</p>
 <p>After a pause, Ling Yushi looked gently at him and quietly said, “What else is there that cannot be said between you and I?”</p>
 <p>“Last time at Armament Sect, I merged with an aspect of my soul from before I was ten years old. This matter sounds absurd and is difficult to comprehend, but it truly happened.” Qin Lie’s eyebrows were furrowed deeply as he attempted to explain his problem bit by bit.</p>
 <p>“Why would the you from before you were ten years old be so evil and scary? Weren’t you just a kid before you were ten years old?” After listening to his explanations, Ling Yushi asked with great shock.</p>
 <p>Qin Lie smiled bitterly.</p>
 <p>“I have wronged you.” After a while, Ling Yushi slowly sorted out her thoughts and smiled gently at Qin Lie, saying, “It’s okay. Perhaps I can help you seek out your true self.”</p>
