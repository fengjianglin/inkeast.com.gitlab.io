 <p><b>Chapter 700: An Opportunity</b></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie realized that after cultivating the Limit Sublimation Art day and night in this period of time, the potential of his body had been developed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The potential caused his spirit power, body and consciousness to be wondrously enhanced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was an advancement of his innate talent!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“An increase in innate talent means an increase in the speed of gathering spirit energy, absorbing spirit stone energy, and replenishing power of body and bloodline. In battle, higher speed of spirit power circulation and enhanced range and penetrative ability of soul consciousness will greatly affect my combat ability! I really gained fortune from this misfortune of being frozen in this place. I was also able to cultivate the Limit Sublimation Art, for so long, reaping great benefits.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie was overjoyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He walked out of the ice seal and inspected his body carefully. After getting a complete make-over, his anger towards the Ice Phoenix lessened greatly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After stretching and moving his limbs to find that he was in an unusually good condition, he took out dried spirit beast meat from his spatial ring. He used the meat to recover from his exhaustion after using the power of his bloodline.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t in a hurry to approach the Ice Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He maintained a distance of a few hundred meters. He stood there as he chewed on dried meat. He felt his body digest and his power increase as he observed the Ice Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After being heavily wounded, the Ice Phoenix was curled up in its human form. She was completely frozen in the blood that had seeped out of her and hadn’t moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie only watched. Before his body recovered, he didn’t dare to spread his soul consciousness to inspect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Multiple days later, after he finished eating all the dried meat in his ring, his exhaustion gradually disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He reckoned he had almost completely recovered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He finally slowly walked towards the Ice Phoenix and came to the feet of the giant ice statue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Phoenix was still unconscious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Standing right beside her, Qin Lie could see that the countless beads of blood on her body had frozen, encasing her in a big crystal of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie finally spread his soul consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His soul consciousness formed a thread and slowly got closer to the blood crystal. Suddenly, an extremely cold aura seeped out of the crystal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The wisp of soul consciousness that Qin Lie had released had been frozen and become an icy thread, unable to approach further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As expected of a Ice Phoenix that can transform…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He murmured in a low tone and frowned. Then he retracted that wisp of soul consciousness and started to think again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A while later, he lifted his head to look at the Demon Sealing Tombstone and the seven divine lights that had been turned into an ice sculpture, yet still floated in the air, looking extremely eerie. The seven rays of light still hung from the tombstone’s surface.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was hesitating if he should break the Demon Sealing Tombstone free of the ice shell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He believed that the power of his lifeblood essences and “blaze” divine characters would be enough to melt the ice on Demon Sealing Tombstone and the seven godly lights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the moment he released the Demon Sealing Tombstone, it would continue its pursuit after Ice Phoenix, attempting to seal the ice spirit… the Ice Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, the Ice Phoenix and the other six spirit bodies would forever disappear into the Demon Sealing Tombstone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At most, the Demon Sealing Tombstone would give him three refined drops of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was this what he wanted?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are more intelligent than the other six spirit bodies, and strong. You know the secrets of the Graveyard of Gods and the Land of Buried Gods. You and the first voodoo creature also have an agreement. You know about Jia Yue, and you know the mysteries of this frost palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rubbing his chin, Qin Lie hesitated as he looked at the unconscious Ice Phoenix. “According to you, your ancestor… was the closest partner of the Ice Emperor. It should have been the Ice Emperor’s pet or mount. If I seal you at this time, all of the mysteries you know will be hidden in the Demon Sealing Tombstone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he talked to himself, Qin Lie became even more indecisive. He didn’t know what to do with the Ice Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew that if the Demon Sealing Tombstone was released, he might not be able to stop the Demon Sealing Tombstone from sealing the Ice Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, if he didn’t seal her when she was unconscious, what should he do when she woke up and recovered her strength?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Qin Lie was hesitating, he felt the aura of the Spirits of Void and Chaos from the Soul Suppressing Orb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His mind moved, and the six Spirits of Void and Chaos floated out of the Soul Suppressing Orb. He looked at them and realized their bodies had become smaller.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was clearly caused by using too much power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was because of this that he hadn’t felt any movement from them since he broke free of the ice shell. The six Spirits of Void and Chaos were simply too exhausted, so exhausted that he didn’t even feel their presence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not good!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing the six Spirits of Void and Chaos had shrunk so much after tirelessly trying to damage the frost power that had sealed him without eating for weeks, Qin Lie hurriedly took out spirit materials of six attributes from his spatial ring that he had gotten from La Pu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Clack clack clack!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piles of spirit materials lay in front of him divided into the six types.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The six Spirits of Void and Chaos looked weakly at the spirit materials. Their small eyes lit up and then, with Qin Lie’s help, they were shoved into the six piles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because he didn’t want to think about the Ice Phoenix, he looked towards the six piles of spirit materials. He saw the six Spirits of Void and Chaos slowly start to feed and the pieces of spirit materials gradually disappear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Another day passed. Qin Lie still hadn’t decided how to deal with the Ice Phoenix.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boom boom boom!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>One day, he suddenly felt the ground and the frost palace shake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew that the person who had wounded the Ice Phoenix finally found the frost palace hidden deep in Frost Island and was already destroying the thick ice walls outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the violent trembling continued for a while, the Ice Phoenix slowly woke up. Within the blood crystal, the long eyelashes flickered and she slowly opened her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then she saw Qin Lie standing beside her at first glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her eyes which had been slightly dazed immediately filled with cold murderous intent. She seemed to immediately understand what had happened. “You, you were not sealed by the frost power? &nbsp;Was it because you also cultivate the core art of Ice Emperor?” she interrogated Qin Lie with her slightly unpracticed and awkward human language.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie’s expression changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had yet to decide what to do with the Ice Phoenix. In this moment, after the Ice Phoenix ruly woke up, he instinctively reacted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He immediately ignited three of his lifeblood essences and shot them towards the Demon Sealing Tombstone and the seven icicles that were actually the godly lights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, he dashed back in retreat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Waves of power came from his spirit sea, flesh and blood. At his fastest speed, he prepared to receive the Ice Phoenix’s storm of attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Behind him, the six Spirits of Void and Chaos had been still feeding on the six piles of spirit materials.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feeling his sudden change, the six Spirits of Void and Chaos that had almost finished recovering suddenly floated from behind him like six little suns of different colors. They bared their teeth at the Ice Phoenix and seemed ready to fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Phoenix’s cold eyes skipped past Qin Lie and looked towards the six Spirits of Void and Chaos with slight shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Those six became these?” the Ice Phoenix asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not really.” Qin Lie was on his guard as he said, “Using my blood, and the six Pure Soul Springs, their essence blood, soul blood, and my soul power, they had been formed through a method even I don’t know. They are called Spirits of Void and Chaos by other people. Right now, I’m raising them and helping them grow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I was sealed by the Demon Sealing Tombstone, would I also become like this?” the Ice Phoenix asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, Qin Lie noticed that the Demon Sealing Tombstone and the seven godly lights were being defrosted by the flames of his lifeblood essences and the “blaze” divine characters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Phoenix also noticed this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It did nothing to stop him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am not sure.” Qin Lie shook his head. “There were six Pure Soul Springs and they were all used. I do not have any more.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ice Phoenix was silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A moment later, she suddenly said, “Open your Soul Lake and True Soul, channel the core inheritance you received from the Ice Emperor. I will return the inheritance that I took from you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qin Lie was astounded.</span></p>
