 <p>Two-Face stared at me in disbelief, words seeming to fail him. After some time, he faltered, "A-are you... some kind of bigshot?"</p>
 <p>“I’m undercover, what do you think?” I chuckled. “But I can let you go without getting approval." I looked at my cell phone and said, "It's ten in the morning and the police will arrive at about two in the afternoon. If you leave before that, I promise not to say a word about you."</p>
 <p>Moved by my words, he asked, "Why do you believe me? I mean, what if I’m lying?"</p>
 <p>I shook my head, "I believe what I see in your eyes..."</p>
 <p>Suddenly, there came a heavy sound of footsteps behind Two-Face who urged me to hide. Scarface was probably making his rounds. There wasn’t a suitable place to hide so I slipped into the gap between the hall stairway and the wall, crouching as low as physically possible.</p>
 <p>Two-Face picked up his axe and continued chopping when Scarface entered the courtyard with a loud yell, "You lazy motherfucker! I didn't hear you working earlier. Are you bumming around again?"</p>
 <p>Two-Face faltered, "I-I was taking a short break."</p>
 <p>"Where did the chief store the cigarettes?" demanded Scarface.</p>
 <p>"<em>Ge</em>, you should smoke less. After all, it’s so difficult to buy cigarettes in this miserable place,” replied Two-Face. “If the chief finds out, he’s going to give you another lecture."</p>
 <p>"Oh fuck off, will you?!” shouted Scarface. “It’s not your turn to say shit! You already know what happened this morning. Four and Five, those two bastards, dug up something and ran away on their own. The chief took a bunch of the good stuff and chased after them. I'm supposed to keep an eye on the three fools here. If it were up to me, I’d kill them off right now. <em>Sigh</em>, what the fuck is going on? Whatever, just get me a pack of cigarettes or I'll cut you!"</p>
 <p>"Okay, I'll pass them to you later," said Two-Face as he bowed respectfully.</p>
 <p>Only after Scarface left did I stick my head out again. "What did the abbot take with him?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"Guns!” exclaimed Two-Face. “They have more than a dozen service rifles. But I don't know where they are hidden."</p>
 <p>I contemplated the circumstances. If they had guns, the situation might escalate later on, causing casualties among the police. Perhaps the safest way forward was to first subdue Scarface on our own.</p>
 <p>"Wait for a while. Don’t deliver the cigarettes just yet,” I said.</p>
 <p>Upon further reflection, I recalled having seen a special sort of herb outside the temple. I ran outside, carefully uprooted the herb and handed it to Two-Face. "This herb is called Barrenwort. Grind it up and mix the liquid into the cigarette contents."</p>
 <p>Two-Face stared at me in horror. "Is it poisonous? You mustn't poison him!” he blurted. “If he finds out, he’ll kill me!"</p>
 <p>"Don't worry, it’s not poison!” I chuckled. “This stuff will only arouse him!"</p>
 <p>"But if I open the cigarette pack, he’ll definitely be suspicious,” he added. “After a few brushes with death, these guys have learned to suspect anything and anyone."</p>
 <p>"Is there any way to fool him?" I asked.</p>
 <p>He pondered for a moment and said, "There is one way. I can steal a cigarette for myself. I usually smoke but that’s only when they allow me to or I’d be asking for a beating. But this time it’s worth it. So are you 100% sure you can handle him?"</p>
 <p>"Of course,” I nodded. “Don't worry, I will capture him alive. By the way, there’s one more thing I’d like to ask. Do you know what the code is?"</p>
 <p>"They won't let me dig for the treasure but they’ve repeated those words so many times I can even recite it,” he explained. “Listen up, it’s ‘3 <em>zi mao</em>, 2 <em>zi si,</em> 1 <em>chou zi</em>, 4 <em>wei hai</em>’."</p>
 <p>Upon hearing the code, I was astonished. What the hell was this?!</p>
 <p>"Do you remember it?" asked Two-Face after he repeated the words once more.</p>
 <p>"I do, but aren’t the words out of order?” I asked. “What do the numbers represent?"</p>
 <p>"If I could solve the mystery, I wouldn't be stuck here…” lamented Two-Face, his lips curling into a bitter smile. “I’d be long dead!"</p>
 <p>"After giving Scarface the cigarettes, you should run as far as possible!" I remarked, patting him on the shoulder.</p>
 <p>Two-Face sighed, "I’ve been on the run for ten years. My job, my family, they’re all gone. What’s there for me to do when I leave?"</p>
 <p>"Rather than waste away in this temple, isn’t it better to give it a try out there?” I said. “You can dress up as a traveling monk. Although life will be a little difficult, you won't have to be bossed around by these criminals any longer."</p>
 <p>Two-Face suddenly fell to his knees but I quickly caught him. "What are you doing?" I asked.</p>
 <p>"How will I ever repay your great kindness? I don't even know what your name is."</p>
 <p>"I’m Song Yang, and if you’re ever in Nanjiang City, you can drop by the station and ask for me. I’ll buy you a meal."</p>
 <p>After Two-Face agreed to sneak the herb into the cigarette, I slipped back into our courtyard, only to be greeted by an impatient Scarface standing arms akimbo at the door as he looked outside. I stuck myself to the walls, carefully making my way back to the meditation room. Upon noticing my furtive figure, Dali excitedly pulled me into the room. "Dude, you scared us half to death! I was so worried that guy would just barge in!"</p>
 <p>"Don’t worry,” I assured him. “We’ll have to act out a play in a bit.”</p>
 <p>I roughly explained that the plan was for two of us to pretend having sex in bed, making noises that would lure Scarface into the room. Bingxin's cheeks colored with embarrassment at my words and shyly protested, "Song Yang-<em>gege</em>, this is all happening too sudden! Besides... Besides... " she looked at Dali, her words trailing off.</p>
 <p>"We don't have to do anything,” I explained. “It’s just making a little noise so Scarface hears us. Don’t worry, Dali and I will be the ones acting."</p>
 <p>“Fucking hell! Is this your new method of taking advantage of me?!” Dali's eyes widened in shock. “You must be interested in me!"</p>
 <p>"Can’t you be serious about this?!” I chided. “We’re trying to capture a vicious criminal alive so we must all cooperate well. If we fail, we will die. Do you understand?"</p>
 <p>The two nodded earnestly.</p>
 <p>After a while, Two-Face came to deliver a pack of cigarettes to Scarface as planned, opening the pack first which elicited a harsh slap across the face from the hot-tempered man. "Motherfucker! You’re getting bolder and bolder, aren’t you?!” cursed Scarface. “Who said you could smoke my cigarettes?!”</p>
 <p>"<em>Ge,</em> I’m craving a cigarette. I just need one,” begged Two-Face with his face lowered.</p>
 <p>Face contorting with a venomous outburst, Scarface stomped on the cigarette butts on the ground and spat with fury, "You wish! Get the fuck out of here before I beat the shit out of you!"</p>
 <p>Dali and Bingxin watched on in stunned silence. Scarface’s blatant disregard was proof enough of Two-Face’s slave-like status among the group.</p>
 <p>However, the anger had completely washed away any trace of suspicion, especially after such a commotion. Scarface slid a cigarette between his lips and began chain smoking three cigarettes in one go. I winked at Dali and Bingxin, motioning for them to get ready.</p>
 <p>Wrapped in the warm quilt, Dali and I were almost stuck together, skin on skin. Dali complained bitterly, "This time it's worse than the last! Why do we have to do it under the blanket?!"</p>
 <p>"Stop complaining!” I retorted. “It’s not like I’m taking my pants off!"</p>
 <p>"Judging from the progression of events, the next time I’ll probably end up losing my virginity..." sighed Dali.</p>
 <p>I started thrusting my hips while Bingxin crouched beside the bed and let her voice go. Face crimson with shame, she got down to business, mixing moans with inarticulate words, "Song Yang-<em>gege</em>, not so hard! Ahh… It feels so good!" Even I felt my face heating up from such explicit words.</p>
 <p>I suddenly felt something hard against my crotch. "Dali, you shameless bastard!” I growled in a low voice. “Why the hell are you hard?!"</p>
 <p>Dali insisted on his innocence, "No, it’s the knife you gave me."</p>
 <p>In this situation, investigating if it was really a knife or something else wasn’t the best idea.</p>
 <p>Bingxin continued moaning but there wasn’t any sign of movement from outside.</p>
 <p>"Song Yang-<em>gege</em>,” she whispered. “Your plan isn’t working!"</p>
 <p>"Just keep going," I said.</p>
 <p>I was certain Scarface couldn’t resist his arousal under the temptation of Bingxin’s moans and the sounds of fierce thrusting now that the Barrenwort he ingested was starting to act on his body. After all, this herb was a time-tested aphrodisiac that worked even on sheep.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, there was a heavy kick on the door that immediately fell with a loud bang. Dali retracted into the sheets to prevent from being seen. Scarface stared at the bed, face flushed, nostrils enlarged, panting like a dog in heat. "You little motherfucker!” he cussed. “You’re having a good time with the little bitch, eh! Those slutty moans are making me horny as fuck!"</p>
 <p>"Get the hell out of here!" I yelled.</p>
 <p>Scarface strode over, shouting, “You little son of a bitch! How dare you yell at me?! You’re in my territory now! If anyone’s fucking, I should be the first one!"</p>
 <p>Lifting the blankets, Scarface was shocked to see two sweaty male bodies clinging together. He stood rooted to the ground but soon reached behind him. Right then, I shouted, "Do it!"</p>
 <p>Under Scarface’s feet was a noose trap made out of sheets, the other end firmly gripped in Bingxin’s hand. With a forceful yank, his feet were entangled, throwing him off balance as his body leaned backwards.</p>
 <p>Without a moment’s hesitation, I covered him with the sheets and tightly wrapped them around him!</p>
