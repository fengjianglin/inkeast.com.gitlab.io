Only after he was imprisoned did he understand that Wang Yizhou’s love for machinery was beyond obsessive. In his eyes, machinery was of utmost importance, far exceeding the value of human beings. Hence, human lives were mere trifles–insignificant little things. His thoughts and impulses were indicative of a severe antisocial personality disorder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wang Yizhou once said, "The human body is a failure in terms of mechanical structure."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the dean’s death, the police focused their attention on Qi Sheng. The matter of the dean’s plagiarism and the enmity between them was common knowledge in the school.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While Qi Sheng was anxiously dealing with the police, Wang Yizhou fell to his old ways again. It seemed that the darkness hidden in his heart had finally been released with the execution of the first crime. He used torture contraptions he invented to kill the orphanage teacher who abused him as a child and his biological father who constantly beat him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite being fully aware of all three crimes, Qi Sheng desperately led the police to himself. When questioned by the police about his alibi during the time of the crimes, he intentionally gave vague answers to draw their suspicions towards himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Qi Sheng felt that he was already an old man with one foot in the grave but Wang Yizhou still had a bright future ahead of him. It was worthwhile to exchange the limited years he had left for the future of his beloved student!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But as a teacher, he was at a complete loss, exasperated that his beloved student had started down a dark and dangerous path. Qi Sheng was torn between his frustration with his student’s behavior and the helplessness he felt knowing that Wang Yizhou's sadistic heart had been born out of society’s cruelty. How could he blame Wang Yizhou? Thus, Qi Sheng made his student promise him, "If you really must do such a thing in the future, you can only punish the wicked and you must be fair!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the day he was taken away by the police, he saw Wang Yizhou kowtowing in the direction of the police car, tears streaming down his face as he refused to get up. Wang Yizhou’s reaction further bolstered his confidence that the sacrifice he made was worth it. However, ten years later, Wang Yizhou had unexpectedly turned into an inhumane monster with no regard for morality.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did you really not think of it?” I asked. “When you suffered the consequences for him, you should have known what a big mistake it was!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I knew that,” sighed the old man. “But I just couldn't do it. I couldn’t watch a mechanical genius who might rewrite the history of human science and technology in his life go to jail and lose all chance at the future that might have awaited him. His talents could bring about a leap in technology in our country that’s ten years ahead of the rest. We wouldn’t have to continue facing the ridicule and the technological restrictions imposed by the United States and Japan. He could even realize our country’s dream of becoming a great powerhouse! In that case, who cares about a few dead people? The atomic bomb invented by Einstein killed even more but his achievements are unprecedented and unparalleled. Are you telling me that a few million lives are more important than Einstein’s?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Your thinking is flawed,” I said. “Now I see that you’re not so different from Wang Yizhou after all. Perhaps the only thing that sets you apart is that Wang Yizhou has put his beliefs into practice while you haven’t! When you compare him to Einstein, it’s an insult to Einstein. Your beloved student never invented anything that would benefit mankind. But he did do one thing, and that is murder for money!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"However, you should be glad that it’s not illegal to have such distorted thoughts,” added Xiaotao. “Very soon, we will overturn your conviction and clear your name."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man waved her off hand and sighed, "Forget it. I don’t have many years to live. What can an old man who’s been imprisoned for so long do when I leave? I know best exactly what prison is like. When he comes in, I can at least take care of him for a few years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiaotao and I did a double take, eyes meeting each other in a meaningful gaze...&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This old man was sick!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Well, if he didn’t care about clearing his name, then we could put an end to the matter. When we were about to leave, the old man cupped his fist and said, "Excuse me, could you do me a favor?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?” I asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He pushed the pack of Chunghwa cigarettes over. "How could a prisoner like me enjoy such luxurious cigarettes on my own? How many do you think I’ll end up smoking?” he asked. “Please take this to the canteen outside and exchange it for some regular ones."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a simple request so I agreed and went outside to exchange several Hongtashans. On my way back, I passed by the prison yard and was startled by the crisp rattle of the barbed fence as someone charged towards me. I turned around only to be greeted by Deng Chao's wide grin, although his eyes were far less friendly than his smile would suggest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I see you’ve got a bunch of cigarettes!” he chortled. “Is that for me?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Do you smoke now?" I asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"What’s the saying again? Every cigarette you smoke takes five minutes off your life. You try staying in here! I bet you’ll wish you were dead!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Deng Chao spoke to me more politely. Judging from his pale face, he had just been released from solitary confinement, a place that could tame even the craziest person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Do you regret it?" I asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"Regret? Of course I do!” he laughed. “Every single day, I regret that I didn’t kill you!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"You make it sound as if you could," I scoffed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"I'll tell you a little secret,” Deng Chao said in a low whisper. “It won't be long before we meet again. When we do, don’t forget to prepare a welcome feast for me!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xiaotao tugged at my sleeve. "This guy’s crazy! Let's go!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When I turned around to leave, I happened to bump into a prison guard. I stopped him and pulled out two packs of cigarettes. "Do me a favor,” I said. “One of these is for you. Please give the other to the prisoner standing near the fence. He’s a schoolmate of mine."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After the guard had walked away, Xiaotao asked, "Why are you so kind to give him cigarettes?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"We were once schoolmates after all," I sighed. “Anyway, this is the last time I’ll ever see him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After handing the cigarettes to Qi Sheng and wishing him all the best, Xiaotao and I left the prison. As soon as we got into the car, Xiaotao leaned in towards me and pressed her body against mine, rubbing my chest with her breasts as she tempted me with those seductive eyes. "Great Detective Song, do you have any bold ideas now that we’re out in the wilderness?" she teased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Speaking of bold ideas, I had more than one, but I quickly restrained myself. The thought of losing my virginity at the gates of the prison made me cringe.&nbsp;</span></p>

My head was filled with her sweet fragrance as her clear eyes that seemed to melt into golden rays stared back at me. She pushed me against my seat with her hand over my pounding heart. Back against the seat, I felt as if every fiber of my being vibrated with excitement from her touch.&nbsp;</span></p>

Wang Yizhou had already been handed over to the judicial authorities, and the case against him was a rock. The prosecutor explained that he might even be able to fight for a death penalty. Right now, they were having trouble finding Wang Yizhou a defense lawyer, but that wasn’t something we had to worry about.</span></p>

When Mr. Xu, founder of the website, was transferred to the detention center, he shouted arrogantly, "They will definitely come to save me! Just watch!"</span></p>

These crimes were extremely serious, so the punishment was just as grave.</span></p>

They could care less about these lives which suggested Mr. Xu wasn’t as important as Kong Hui.</span></p>

"Song Yang, Deng Chao is dead," she said, her tone solemn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At first, I froze from the shock of the news but I soon recovered and realized that there was something wrong with her tone. "How did he die?" I asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">"There was a fight and he was stabbed with a knife, but that’s not the point!" I heard Xiaotao take a deep breath on the other end of the line. "The vehicle transporting his body had an accident on the road and his body mysteriously disappeared!" she announced.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The implication of her words hit me like a bat to the head–Deng Chao had escaped from prison!</span></p>
