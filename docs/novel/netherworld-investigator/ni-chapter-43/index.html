<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>I ran over to the edge of the rooftop and found that there was a five-story building on the other side, and the two buildings were separated by a three-meter gap. Bai Yue and Wang Yuanchao both jumped over to that building!</p>
 <p>At the time, the Wang Yuanchao was chasing after Bai Yue on the rooftop of that building like a cat pursuing a mouse.</p>
 <p>Three meters… If it had been on the ground, I thought I might be able to jump across this distance, but if it was between two buildings that were tens of meters high? No way. My bones and flesh would turn into a pulp if I fell from that height!</p>
 <p>I decided that I definitely wouldn’t jump, so I took out my mobile phone and called Huang Xiaotao.</p>
 <p>“Bai Yue escaped to the opposite residential building and Wang Yuanchao is now there too. You should surround him there.”</p>
 <p>“Okay, got it!” replied Huang Xiaotao.</p>
 <p>I glanced at the director who was on the ground with a broken leg and said, “By the way, you should send a police officer here too, the accomplice is here and he’s injured.”</p>
 <p>I hung up the phone, then walked over to the director. When he heard my footsteps, his first sentence was, “Did they catch Bai Yue?”</p>
 <p>“Any time now,” I said, kneeling down near him. “You and your son will soon be brought to justice…”</p>
 <p>The director suddenly grabbed my collar and said, “Please let Bai Yue go! I was the one who killed those women! It was me!”</p>
 <p>The director’s grip was very tight. I was so shocked by his sudden movement that I broke out in cold sweat. I didn’t know at that point whether he had a knife hidden under his sleeve or not, so I didn’t dare to do anything reckless. At that moment, Dali ran over and aimed the ultraviolet light at the director’s eyes and said, “Old man, let go of his collar, are you thinking about attacking a police officer?”</p>
 <p>The director was blinded by the light. He quickly let go of my collar and covered his eyes with both his hands.</p>
 <p>I kept a distance from him and asked, “Why did you help Bai Yue to murder the two innocent women?”</p>
 <p>“It was my son’s request,” said the director. “Of course, a father must find a way to fulfill it. After all, I never really did my duties as a father when he was young.”</p>
 <p>“But you’re a religious person. If you do this kind of thing, aren’t you afraid of going to hell?” I said.</p>
 <p>“Moses commanded us to stone prostitutes to death,” said the director. “Do you think that I will go to hell for killing those women?”</p>
 <p>I was dumbfounded.</p>
 <p>“What the hell is this old man talking about?” asked Dali.</p>
 <p>He retorted me with something from the Bible. He’d read the Bible all his life, so naturally he was familiar with all the passages, but I hadn’t. All I read were some Bible stories.</p>
 <p>But in any case, I don't think that a religion that preaches love and kindness to your neighbor would encourage people to kill prostitutes. He must’ve twisted the words in order to justify himself and his crimes.</p>
 <p>“Magdalene was a prostitute too,” I said. “But she washed Jesus’ feet with her tears, and after being crucified at the cross Jesus immediately redeemed her. If your Lord looks down on prostitutes, then why would he also save Magdalene? A true Christian practices compassion and kindness, not murder and violence like you.”</p>
 <p>The director widened his eyes and said nothing.</p>
 <p>At this time, there was a burst of gunshots that rang through the night sky. The body of the director trembled fiercely, and he struggled to climb up to his feet.</p>
 <p>“What happened to my son,” he asked. “What did they do to my son?”</p>
 <p>Dali ran over to the edge of the rooftop and said, “Officer Wang seized him.”</p>
 <p>“Is he alive?” the director asked.</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Dali nodded.</p>
 <p>It was as if a weight was lifted off of the director’s shoulders. He heaved a sigh and fell to the ground.</p>
 <p>In a short while, a police officer arrived and took the director away.</p>
 <p>“Dude, that was awesome!” said Dali. “You said something to the old man and he went speechless! How did you know about all these things?”</p>
 <p>“From the Bible, idiot!” I said, “Magdalene was a prostitute, but she helped Jesus, so he redeemed her.” Well, to be frank, I saw it from the movie The Da Vinci Code.</p>
 <p>“How are you so knowledgeable, dude?” Dali asked enviously.</p>
 <p>“Well, you should play less games and read more books, then.” I replied.</p>
 <p>I suddenly remembered one thing, and caught up with the dean. He was being taken downstairs by the police officer. His leg was shot, so he was in a lot of pain.</p>
 <p>“Why did you want to attract the bats to the crime scene?” I asked him.</p>
 <p>The director seemed dejected at the time. He seemed to have aged ten years since I last saw him in that office.</p>
 <p>“I thought that if the police believe the murderer was a vampire, then they will not track Bai Yue down...” he said.</p>
 <p>I was silent for a while. He read the Bible for his whole life, so he believed that other people also believed what was written in the bible. Unfortunately for him, the police force was a secular institution. Whether the criminal was a vampire or a devil was completely irrelevant, because they will track them regardless.</p>
 <p>After a while, we were all downstairs. Huang Xiaotao patted me on the shoulder and said, “Song Yang, this time you made another great contribution to the police force!”</p>
 <p>“That’s not true. Credits should be given to Wang Yuanchao,” I said modestly.</p>
 <p>Wang Yuanchao was smoking by a police car. The wound on his forehead was bandaged and the leather jacket on his body was dirty. I went over to him and thanked him.</p>
 <p>“Officer Wang, how did you know that there was another building on the other side?” I asked.</p>
 <p>“I didn’t know,” he replied.</p>
 <p><em>Isn’t that a bit too reckless?</em> I thought. In the unlikely event that the criminal committed suicide by jumping off the building, wouldn’t he be sacrificing himself in vain?</p>
 <p>But then again, if Wang Yuanchao did not take the opportunity to jump over the building, Bai Yue would’ve escaped. So even though I found Wang Yuanchao’s actions too wild, I secretly was grateful to him that he took the chance.</p>
 <p>“Now that the case has been settled,” said Huang Xiaotao, “the rest will be handed over to the forensics team. We are now bringing the suspect back to question him. I’ve already asked Wang Yuanchao to send you back to college.”</p>
 <p>“No, it’s fine,” I said. “Officer Wang has done enough for the night. I don't want to bother him anymore. We’ll take a cab back to college.”</p>
 <p>“Then be careful on the road,” said Huang Xiaotao.</p>
 <p>A few days after the case ended, Dali searched for the news online every day, but this vampire case did not appear in any media. Perhaps the police felt that it was too bizarre and violent, so they sealed it up.</p>
 <p>Soon Huang Xiaotao called and told us that there was a celebration feast that night and that we were invited to attend.</p>
 <p>Naturally, Dali would not refuse when it came to anything that involved food. We took a cab and went to a restaurant. We were taken to a big private room by the waiter. The whole room was filled with members of the task force. When we came in, everyone enthusiastically applauded.</p>
 <p>The atmosphere of the house was very jolly. I was very embarrassed by the attention, so I awkwardly nodded and smiled to everyone until Dali and I found a place to sit down.</p>
 <p>Just as we sat down, Xiaozhou came over, holding a glass. He was already a little drunk. After he was drunk, he was completely different from the usual gentleman that he was.</p>
 <p>“Song-<em>ge</em>,” he said, suddenly addressing me as a ‘big brother.’</p>
 <p>“The murderer really isn’t a vampire, he’s just a weird human being. I was the biggest idiot! Without you, we definitely would’ve hit a dead end. From now on, I’ll respect you like a big brother, come on, let me pour a drink for you!”</p>
 <p>“Never mind, Officer Zhou, I don’t really drink alcohol.”</p>
 <p>“Okay, I’ll pour you some juice then!”</p>
 <p>He grabbed a glass and a bottle and poured me a glass of orange juice. The other police officers also came to toast but were stopped by Huang Xiaotao. “Go wait at the bar, I still have something to say to Song Yang!”</p>
 <p>“<em>Ooooh</em>, Team Leader Huang has something to say to Song Yang!” the police officers teased.</p>
 <p>“I really do have something serious to say to him, you morons!” said Huang Xiaotao. Her face was red and she was stomping her feet with anger.</p>
 <p>“The team leader has <em>something serious&nbsp;</em>to say to Song Yang! <em>Ooooh</em>!” teased another police officer, while pointing at her, to which everyone followed suit.</p>
 <p>“You, you, you...” Huang Xiaotao's face was red to the ear. “That’s it! Your bonus will be deducted!”</p>
 <p>Huang Xiaotao sat down beside me and said indignantly, “Geez, what a bunch of lunatics!”</p>
 <p>She wore a white shirt and ultra-short jeans tonight, and the sultry figure was perfectly revealed by the close-fitting clothing. Her two lean long legs were exposed, her shirt had a deep neckline, and her chest was slightly exposed. Although Huang Xiaotao had the looks of a model, she was not just slim and pretty like most models. Her arms and abdomen were clearly muscular, and her legs looked lean and strong. She looked healthier and stronger than most women. As I thought of her beauty, I found myself blushing, so I quickly bowed my head down and concentrated on my drink.</p>
 <p>“Xiaotao-<em>jiejie</em>,” cried Dali. “You look so beautiful tonight!”</p>
 <p>“Haha, I can’t help it, I guess.” replied Huang Xiaotao.</p>
 <p>She then tapped on my shoulder and said: “Song Yang, yesterday Bai Yue confessed everything, and the truth was almost the same as your speculations, except for one thing which you didn’t expect...”</p>
