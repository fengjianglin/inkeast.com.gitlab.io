 <p>Even as Bai Xiaochun looked over, Zhao Tianjiao threw his head back and roared, performing a double-handed incantation that caused the countless lightning bolts to converge on his palms in the form of a pair of one-meter-wide spheres.</p>
 <p>Although the lightning started out as silver, in the blink of an eye, it turned golden, and then shot directly toward the white shadow.</p>
 <p>“Be destroyed!” Zhao Tianjiao shouted, his energy surging in such shocking fashion that Bai Xiaochun couldn’t help but gasp at the sight.</p>
 <p>“So badass!” Bai Xiaochun thought, completely shaken. The dazzling balls of lightning were blindingly bright, and pulsed with a terrifying power that was incredibly astonishing.</p>
 <p>The white shadow was difficult to make out clearly, as if it weren’t even corporal, but rather, a glob of light. But suddenly, it twisted and distorted, transforming into a white hand that shot forth toward Zhao Tianjiao with incredible speed.</p>
 <p>Intense rumbling sounds echoed out into the dark of night, filling the entire ship, which was when Bai Xiaochun realized that Zhao Tianjiao’s goal was actually to arouse everyone on board. If he could get more people to come and join the fight, they could pool their power to eradicate the white shadow once and for all.</p>
 <p>However, Zhao Tianjiao had underestimated the power of the white shadow. When the huge hand came into contact with the balls of lightning, a huge boom rang out, and blood sprayed out of Zhao Tianjiao’s mouth as his lightning spheres collapsed into pieces.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun had never seen lightning destroyed like this before; it transformed into countless sparks which scattered around in all directions, accompanied by crackling, pitter-patter sounds as it hit the walls of the corridor.</p>
 <p>The white shadow was powerful, but was still shaken by Zhao Tianjiao’s full-power attack, which shoved it backward a few meters, and even caused it to dim a bit. But then, it shivered, splitting up into nine different parts that all shot toward Zhao Tianjiao, apparently intent on either possessing or consuming him.</p>
 <p>Simultaneously, a frigid coldness spread out from the shadow that seemed capable of freezing the soul.</p>
 <p>When Chen Yueshan saw the danger Zhao Tianjiao was in, her face fell, and she leapt forward, right hand clenched into a fist that rocketed toward the incoming white shadows. Simultaneously, her left hand flashed in an incantation gesture, causing bursts of moonlight to gather around her, merging together into the image of a full moon.</p>
 <p>Bizarre light streamed out from the moon which, under the direction of another incantation gesture, poured into Chen Yueshan herself as she shot toward the white shadows.</p>
 <p>Shockingly, as she passed along, the power of Time erupted out, as though the moonlight itself were causing everything it touched to age!</p>
 <p>Zhao Tianjiao’s eyes were burning with anger in this critical moment of danger. Taking a deep breath, he suddenly shoved his hands out in front of him, causing thunderclaps to echo out as a whole series of golden balls of lightning began to build up around him.</p>
 <p>However, things weren’t over yet. Zhao Tianjiao’s two followers also joined in the fight, gritting their teeth as they bravely leapt toward the seemingly illusory white shadows.</p>
 <p>As everyone joined forces in the fight, Bai Xiaochun gritted his teeth off to the side. He knew that, considering everyone was working together, if he didn’t join in, he would never have the face to appear in front of Zhao Tianjiao and the others later on. Roaring, he emerged from his cloak of invisibility and charged toward the white shadows.</p>
 <p>In his anxiety, Bai Xiaochun couldn’t help but wonder why no one else had shown up to help. However, the truth was that from the moment the white shadow had appeared up until now, only about ten breaths of time had passed.</p>
 <p>Even as everyone joined forces, the nine separate white shadows which had just sprang into motion changed directions. Two of them shot toward Zhao Tianjiao’s followers, two headed toward Chen Yueshan, two headed toward Bai Xiaochun, and the remaining three continued toward Zhao Tianjiao.</p>
 <p>More rumbling sounds echoed out. The white shadows slammed into the two followers, causing blood to spray out of their mouths as they staggered backward, trembling. Not only were their lips turning purple, but the hair all over their body was turning white. However, what was most shocking of all to Bai Xiaochun was that their eyes were turning blank, as if their souls were flickering on the verge of being extinguished.</p>
 <p>Chen Yueshan also noticed that, and let out a furious shout. At the same time, her Moon Time Disk slammed into the two white shadows, causing a boom to ring out, and leaving Chen Yueshan shuddering in place. Cracks even spread out across the floor beneath her feet. At the same time, numerous frigid ice spikes appeared all around her, blocking her path and making it impossible for her to move. Blood oozed out of the corners of her mouth as she shouted, “Watch out, Elder Brother Zhao! It’s a soul attack!!”</p>
 <p>Simultaneously, she performed numerous incantation gestures and pressed her finger down on various acupoints to prevent her injuries from worsening.</p>
 <p>As for Bai Xiaochun, he closed in on the two white shadows, performing an incantation gesture with his right hand to unleash the Frigid School Will-Evolving Incantation. Instantly, Frigid Master power spread out in all directions; he was fighting cold with cold!</p>
 <p>As rumbling sound spread out, Bai Xiaochun trembled visibly; he was currently in the late Gold Core stage, making his frigid qi incredibly shocking. By this point, he would even be able to cause ice to build up on Heavenspan River water. However, the frigid coldness being utilized by the white shadows was different than his own, and also different than the type he remembered the statue of Gongsun Wan’er using. This was a type of coldness that could cause the soul to fall into a deep slumber!</p>
 <p>It truly was... a soul attack!</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s face fell as he sensed the frigid qi pouring into him and rushing toward his head!</p>
 <p>In that moment of crisis, he let out a powerful roar, simultaneously drawing upon his Undying Live Forever Technique as he lifted his left foot up and then slammed it down into the ground!</p>
 <p>What he was unleashing was not incredible fleshly body power, but rather... the Undying Hex!</p>
 <p>Furthermore, he wasn’t using the Undying Hex on his opponent, but rather, himself!</p>
 <p>Cracking sounds echoed out as rifts spread out across the surface of his skin, apparently coming from the inside of his body to the outside. In the blink of an eye, they had completely covered him, and also prevented the frigid qi from invading his soul.</p>
 <p>Everything happened so quickly that Bai Xiaochun really had no time to react; everything he was doing came from instinct alone, even his use of the Undying Hex.</p>
 <p>Battle instinct was something that Bai Xiaochun had learned about back in the Luochen Mountains. Perhaps it was his terror regarding death, or his intense obsession with being able to live forever, but either way, in moments of crisis such as this, his instincts were more on point than ever.</p>
 <p>As the effects of his Undying Hex spread, Bai Xiaochun found that the invading frigid qi was blocked outside of him, and what was inside of him was being forced out.</p>
 <p>Even as Bai Xiaochun breathed a sigh of relief, his face suddenly twitched as he looked over at Zhao Tianjiao, who was currently under attack by three white shadows. The shadows easily destroyed all of the spheres of lightning that Zhao Tianjiao had unleashed, and then formed together into a white sword that stabbed toward his forehead.</p>
 <p>Zhao Tianjiao’s face fell as, at the same time, the ground beneath his feet began to freeze up. In that moment of ultimate danger, Bai Xiaochun opened his Heavenspan Dharma Eye, causing control power to erupt out toward the flying sword.</p>
 <p>“Stop right there!!” he shouted as violet light streamed out from his third eye, backed by his late Gold Core stage cultivation base. The light then wrapped around the white sword, which lurched to a stop right in front of Zhao Tianjiao.</p>
 <p>That slight pause was the opportunity Zhao Tianjiao needed. Before, he had been sure that he wouldn’t be able to avoid the blow, and had planned to let the sword stab his forehead, and then take advantage of the moment in which his opponent attacked his soul to use some other method to fight back. Although he had been confident in being able to succeed, it still would have been a dangerous move. But now that Bai Xiaochun was helping him, it was without the slightest hesitation that he took action, causing his eyes to become completely replaced by flickering, golden lightning!</p>
 <p>“Lightning Detonation!” he roared. Instantly blinding lightning erupted from his eyes, spreading out in all directions. The white sword instantly began to fall to pieces. Then it retreated, and all of the other white shadows flew toward it, taking a human shape that seemed to look deeply at Zhao Tianjiao and then Bai Xiaochun before fading away.</p>
 <p>It almost seemed as if it could come and go as it pleased!</p>
