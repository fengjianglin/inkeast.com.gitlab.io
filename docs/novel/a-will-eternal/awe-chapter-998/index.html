<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Off to the side, Bai Zhentian gasped for breath as he looked over at Bai Xiaochun. Merely thinking about what that simple wave of a finger had done to him caused his heart to tremble with foreboding.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Bai Xiaochun was ignoring him, Chen Hetian’s eyes blazed with anger, and he said, “You can't stop this war, Bai Xiaochun. You can’t possibly deal with the consequences of betraying the Celestial!!”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun looked over at him coldly. “Unless you feel like dying… shut up!”</p>
 <p>His gaze caused Chen Hetian to shiver in fear. Despite his fury, he didn’t dare to keep speaking. Furthermore, he also realized that it had been quite impulsive of him to run his mouth. Bai Xiaochun was obviously the type of person he couldn’t afford to provoke.</p>
 <p>Ignoring the livid Chen Hetian, Bai Xiaochun picked Mistress Red-Dust up again and then handed her over to Song Junwan.</p>
 <p>“Wan'er, take care of Zimo for me…. After everything’s taken care of here, I’ll explain.” With that, Bai Xiaochun looked up into the sky!</p>
 <p>Up above, the Giant Ghost King was fighting the demigod patriarch of the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect. Although both of them were aware that Bai Xiaochun had come, they didn’t have time to pay much attention to him. Both demigods knew that the slightest lapse in concentration could lead to terrible consequences.</p>
 <p>At the moment, Bai Xiaochun had the beginnings of an idea regarding how to stop the war, but wasn’t completely confident in being able to succeed. Whether it was the Celestial or the gravekeeper, there was little he could do other than try to persuade them to agree with his viewpoint.</p>
 <p>Regardless, he couldn’t allow the River-Defying Sect to participate in the fighting. Furthermore, he needed the fighting in the immediate vicinity to stop first.</p>
 <p>“Everybody, stop fighting!” he said loudly. His voice sounded like millions upon millions of thunderclaps, and caused everything in the area to shake violently. The entire battlefield filled with the echoing sound of his voice, almost like the combined shouting of an innumerable host of people.</p>
 <p>“Stop fighting!!”</p>
 <p>“Stop fighting!!!”</p>
 <p>“Stop fighting!!!!”</p>
 <p>The cultivators on both sides of the conflict were deeply shaken, and could sense something in those words that seemingly surpassed heavenly might. On an instinctive level, they were forced to stop in place and obey the words they heard.</p>
 <p>However, even after forcing everyone to stop fighting, Bai Xiaochun’s heart was still in chaos. He knew that the most important aspect of the fight was not on the battlefield below, nor was it the conflict between the devas…. The most important fight was overhead, between the two demigods. Forcing himself into a state of calm focus, he looked up and spoke in a voice even louder than before.</p>
 <p>“Giant Ghost, old pal. Patriarch Starry Sky. Listen to me for a moment. Stop fighting!!”</p>
 <p>His voice was propelled by urgency, sweeping up into the sky to form a tempest of violent wind. Earlier, the Giant Ghost King and Patriarch Starry Sky had been able to sense some of Bai Xiaochun's level of power, and had also noticed how he stopped everyone from fighting. But now that they heard his voice in their own ears, how it thrummed with focus and determination, both of them gasped in shock.</p>
 <p>However, considering how involved they were with fighting each other, they couldn’t afford to be distracted. The Giant Ghost King was right in the middle of waving the hand of his gargantuan giant ghost form, which caused it to collapse into black smoke that re-formed into a larger, autonomous ghost hand that shot forward toward Patriarch Starry Sky.</p>
 <p>Patriarch Starry Sky waved his remaining arm, causing an illusory starscape to materialize behind him, making it seem as if he were shouldering the entire starry sky. Eyes burning with killing intent, he performed an incantation gesture and then pointed out, sending countless stars from behind him shooting toward the Giant Ghost King.</p>
 <p>When Bai Xiaochun saw that they were just continuing to fight, his eyes flashed, and his fury built. Holding his breath, he shot up into the air.</p>
 <p>As he did, he unleashed all of the power of his cultivation base, causing the fluctuations of the great circle of the Deva Realm to roll out. At the same time, he began to pulse with fleshly body power, his qi and blood merging with his cultivation base to reveal… power that surpassed that of a deva. This was… demigod power!</p>
 <p>As of this moment, Bai Xiaochun… was not technically a demigod, but in terms of battle prowess… was no different than one!</p>
 <p>He became a vertical beam of light that shot up like a reverse falling star, heading right toward where the demigods were fighting!</p>
 <p>Down below, Patriarch Spirit Stream and everyone else from the River-Defying Sect watched with visible excitement. All of them were thinking back to the scene in which Bai Xiaochun raced out to stand between the Spirit and Blood Stream Sects.</p>
 <p>“Can he do it again…?” Patriarch Spirit Stream murmured. Considering how exhausted everyone on the battlefield was, if the fighting truly stopped… it would be a blessing to both the Heavenspan cultivators and the Wildlanders.</p>
 <p>The River-Defying Sect cultivators weren’t the only ones who felt that way. After the lull in the fighting created by Bai Xiaochun’s shout, all of the cultivators down below were now looking up into the sky with keen anticipation.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun accelerated rapidly until he was like a burning ball of fire, streaking up into the sky, surrounded by wave-like ripples.</p>
 <p>“Cloud Lightning Forefather Transformation!”</p>
 <p>As he climbed to the heights of the firmament, he began to grow larger and larger!</p>
 <p>60 meters tall. 90 meters. 120 meters….</p>
 <p>As he grew taller, his frame filled in with muscle, and he began to radiate a powerful energy. Even as everyone looked on, he reached a height of 210 meters!</p>
 <p>“Cloud Lightning Forefather, Eighth Transformation!” he shouted, continuing to grow until he was 240 meters tall, powerfully built, with a wild and barbaric air.</p>
 <p>270 meters…. 300 meters…. 330 meters….</p>
 <p>Things weren’t over yet! 360 meters. 390 meters….</p>
 <p>By the time he reached the area where the Giant Ghost King and Patriarch Starry Sky were fighting, he had reached the last of the Cloud Lightning Forefather Transformations!</p>
 <p>“Eleventh Transformation!!”</p>
 <p>Intense rumbling sounds echoed out that were so loud it that seemed like they might end the heavens and crush the earth. At that point, Bai Xiaochun was 510 meters tall, and truly looked like the forefather of all humanity.</p>
 <p>Each of the Cloud Lightning Forefather Transformations increased one’s height by thirty meters. Therefore, normally speaking, the eleventh transformation would push a cultivator to a height of 330 meters. However, because Bai Xiaochun cultivated the Sun-Moon Vast-Sky Incantation, each of his eyes added the power of an additional three transformations. By adding that power of six further transformations, he was propelled to a height of… 510 meters!</p>
 <p>His cultivation base surged, and his fleshly body power caused boundless blood-colored light to surround him like clothing. In all respects, he was completely eye-catching.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the entire world had begun to tremble, and a new energy appeared that only the demigods could sense. It was as if… the entire world approved of Bai Xiaochun!!</p>
 <p>It was something that, previously, only the gravekeeper, the Hell-Emperor, and the Celestial had been able to wield… the power of the world itself!</p>
 <p>The Giant Ghost King’s face fell, and Patriarch Starry Sky looked over in complete disbelief as Bai Xiaochun, completely oblivious to any divine abilities being unleashed… lunged in between the two of them!!</p>
 <p>“Stop fighting!” Bai Xiaochun growled. Because of his Forefather Transformation, he looked completely barbaric. Face twisting viciously, he clenched his right hand into a fist and punched out at Patriarch Starry Sky’s divine ability, the dazzling starry sky!</p>
 <p>A deafening boom could be heard as his fist smashed into the countless heavenly bodies, sending all of them spinning away!</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun shivered from the force of the blow. After all, this was a demigod he was dealing with. However, thanks to the regenerative powers of his Undying Blood, it took only a single breath of time for him to be back at his peak level.</p>
 <p>“I said stop it!!” he shouted, clenching his left hand into a fist and striking out at the black smoke hand coming from the Giant Ghost King!</p>
 <p>Winds screamed as the black hand of smoke was ripped to pieces.</p>
 <p>And yet, things still weren’t over! Even as his Undying Blood healed him, Bai Xiaochun waved both of his hands out in front of him, shoving both of the demigods apart. For the third time… he spoke in a voice that echoed like thunder in the ears of the Giant Ghost King and Patriarch Starry Sky.</p>
 <p>“I told you two… to stop fighting!!!”</p>
 <p>RUUUUUUUUMBLE!</p>
 <p>The two shocked and injured demigods could do nothing other than fall back!</p>
