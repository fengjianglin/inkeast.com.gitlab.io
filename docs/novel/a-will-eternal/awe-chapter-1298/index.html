 <p>“This isn't going to work….” Bai Xiaochun thought. “1,080,000 ruins aren’t going to be enough. If I want to defeat the Mortal Renegade, I need more outside power….”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Eyes bloodshot, he shouted, “Time Immemorial Codex!”</p>
 <p>The Time Immemorial Codex consisted of the Sutras of the Former, Present, and Future, all of which were divine abilities based on the Essence of time.</p>
 <p>Before becoming a sovereign, Bai Xiaochun could not not have combined the powers of the sutras to release the true potential of the Time Immemorial Codex.</p>
 <p>But now, as a sovereign, he had far more control over both Essence and cultivation base, and thus, was in a far different position than before.</p>
 <p>In terms of what exactly the combined power of the Time Immemorial Codex would look like, not even Bai Xiaochun was fully sure. However, considering that he had created it, he had an inkling.</p>
 <p>Before, he had often thought that his speculations about what the Time Immemorial Codex could eventually do might have been a bit too outrageous. But now, with full control over the Essence of time, he suddenly realized… that his concerns might have been incorrect!</p>
 <p>“Former!” he shouted, reaching up to touch his forehead. Instantly, his memories became magical symbols that swirled out to form a spinning vortex.</p>
 <p>“Present!” The Gates of Life and Death appeared, one behind the Mortal Renegade, one behind himself.</p>
 <p>“Future!” Their fates were now intertwined, whether the Mortal Renegade wanted them to be or not. And although the Mortal Renegade was actually capable of severing that connection… Bai Xiaochun did not give him the time to do so. Without the slightest pause, he touched his own forehead and simultaneously pointed at the Mortal Renegade!</p>
 <p>“Fusion: Time Immemorial, Everlasting Existence!”</p>
 <p>Rumbling sounds echoed out as the vortex surrounding Bai Xiaochun exploded in size. Somehow, it seemed to connect to some other unknown location; at the same time, the starry sky around Bai Xiaochun and the Mortal Renegade began to twist and spin. A tempest of time sprang up, filled with strange images and sights.</p>
 <p>A mysterious power came with that tempest of time, causing the Mortal Renegade’s Finger of Extermination to instantly weaken, along with the attacks being unleashed by his Dao clones in the 1,080,000 worlds in the starry sky!</p>
 <p>“The River of Time and Space?” the Mortal Renegade blurted, his face falling. “Impossible! No, wait! This isn’t the River of Time and Space. This… exists <em>outside</em> of the River of Time and Space!”</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaochun looked on in surprise as the vortex around them suddenly vanished, and everything went back to normal. But then, only a moment later, it was to the shock of both opponents that, off in the distance, in the location where the Eternal Flower had once hung in the starry sky, a vast army of devilish specters could be seen.</p>
 <p>Behind that army was a massive giant, striding in the direction of the Eternal Flower.</p>
 <p>That giant… was none other than the Mortal Renegade!</p>
 <p>This… was a scene from the distant past, right after the Mortal Renegade finished destroying everything else in existence, and arrived at the Eternal Flower!</p>
 <p><em>Time Immemorial, Everlasting Existence</em> was a fusion of the former, the present, and the future. It was a Daoist magic that… recalled ancient history, and allowed one to step into the past.</p>
 <p>However, it was different than the legendary River of Time and Space. By stepping into that river, one could actually travel to the past, and even change it. At least, that was what the legends spoke of. No one had ever done such a thing. Not even the Mortal Renegade was capable of entering the River of Time and Space.</p>
 <p>Naturally, Bai Xiaochun’s Time Immemorial Codex was not capable of doing so either. It was more like a mirror that could reflect the river. And yet, the reflection it cast was no mere illusion!</p>
 <p>Although one could not change the past, if one were to be injured by events or entities from this reflection of the past, they would not vanish once the mirror vanished!</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun had no other options. He knew that he could not defeat the Mortal Renegade single-handedly, nor could his 1,080,000 Dao clones achieve victory. Therefore, he needed outside help. And thus, by means of his Time Immemorial, Everlasting Existence, he would step into the past and search for a way to achieve victory there!</p>
 <p>“This is where you want to fight?” the Mortal Renegade said. He laughed, and then reached out toward the version of himself that was hanging over the Eternal Immortal Domains. The other Mortal Renegade looked over in confusion. But then, to Bai Xiaochun’s shock, black smoke suddenly poured out of the Mortal Renegade of the past, transforming into numerous vicious faces that, under the control of the present-day Mortal Renegade, shot toward Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>“This can’t be right….” Bai Xiaochun thought, nearly weeping. Although his cultivation base was already significantly drained because of using the Time Immemorial Codex, he gritted his teeth and once again twisted time.</p>
 <p>Rumbling sounds could be heard as another vortex sprang up around both him and the Mortal Renegade, covering the starry sky, rendering physical vision and divine sense useless. When things returned to normal, they were at another point in the past, surrounded by nothing but empty space.</p>
 <p>“Done playing around?” the Mortal Renegade said coolly. He shot toward Bai Xiaochun, who tried to twist time again. Unfortunately, his cultivation base still needed a moment to recover, so he was forced to simply back away. Booms rang out as the Mortal Renegade landed a blow, causing Bai Xiaochun to tumble backward, blood spraying out of his mouth. However, at that point, he had enough energy to reverse time again.</p>
 <p>And thus, he and the Mortal Renegade continued to shift back and forth through moments of the past. Bai Xiaochun continued to try to find some advantage that would help him to gain victory, but sadly, all he could do was view the past, not change it. And every time he reappeared, he was forced to flee again.</p>
 <p>Although he never got the advantage he sought, the fact that the Mortal Renegade was forced to use numerous trump cards to try to kill him ensured that this trip through time was actually an effective way to defend himself.</p>
 <p>The Mortal Renegade’s face continued to turn grimmer and grimmer. Although Bai Xiaochun felt like he was in the passive position, so did the Mortal Renegade. Although the trip back in time had not affected him negatively in any way, he was getting increasingly frustrated by his inability to actually kill Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>“Who is this guy? The fact that his cultivation led him to this level shows that he’s no ordinary individual. Furthermore, he is like me in that he pursued his own Dao…. But how come fighting him seems like some sort of comedy routine!?” The Mortal Renegade couldn’t help but glare furiously at Bai Xiaochun, who was as frustrating to chase as a mouse whose tail had been stepped on.</p>
 <p>Even worse… as Bai Xiaochun came to realize that the Mortal Renegade actually couldn’t do anything to him as they flitted back through time, he started to negotiate….</p>
 <p>“Hey, Mortal Renegade. Let’s talk things over. Since you can’t kill me, and I can’t kill you, why don't we just call it quits…?</p>
 <p>“I know it wasn’t easy for you to wake yourself up. Do you really <em>have</em> to eat my home? Look, how about this: You leave the Eternal Flower alone, and the two of us can become friends!</p>
 <p>“There’s really no need for all this fighting and killing. There are always other ways to work things out. We can solve them, whatever problems you have. Come come. Let’s talk things out. I'm sure we can figure out a way for you to become Eternal.</p>
 <p>“Ai, come on, talk to me!” As Bai Xiaochun continued to chatter, the Mortal Renegade’s face began to turn green from rage. In the end, he finally couldn’t take it anymore.</p>
 <p>“SHUT UP!”</p>
 <p>Startled, Bai Xiaochun quickly twisted time again, taking himself and the Mortal Renegade backward once again. When they reappeared, they were in some unknown period of time, and their fight continued….</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, out in the 1,080,000 sets of ruins, their Dao clones continued to fight to the death.</p>
 <p>Eventually, after many shifts, and much fighting, the Mortal Renegade felt like he was going crazy. And Bai Xiaochun was starting to tire, both physically and mentally. He continued to try to negotiate with the Mortal Renegade regarding the Eternal Flower, but nothing worked. Finally, he drew even more deeply on his cultivation base in an attempt to shift further back in time than he had so far.</p>
