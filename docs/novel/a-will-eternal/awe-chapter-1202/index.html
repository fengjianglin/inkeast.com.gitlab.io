        <p> <strong><a href="/novel/a-will-eternal/">A Will Eternal</a></strong></p>
<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s voice caused everything in the area to tremble, and all of the cultivators, regardless of the level of their cultivation base, to be shaken to the depths of their souls.</p>
 <p>Some cultivators were shaking physically, and seemed to be on the verge of collapsing. Even the devas were as pale as death, and were trembling.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t something Bai Xiaochun was doing on purpose, it was just the fact that his cultivation base was too high. Now that he was in the late Celestial Realm, his Willpower had pushed his Daoseed to the point where it was about to bloom, making his voice the type that would cause virtually all types of cultivation bases in the Eternal Immortal Domains to be deeply shaken.</p>
 <p>When Bai Xiaochun realized what was happening, he restrained the fluctuations rolling off of him as much as possible. And yet, to the crowd around, it still felt like having a boulder pushing down on their chests.</p>
 <p>The two devas were already getting some clues to what was going on, but neither dared to speak out of turn. Clasping hands, one of them said, “Exalted one… yes… we are in the second immortal domain of the Vile-Emperor Dynasty, very close to the Saint-Emperor Dynasty’s second immortal domain….”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun immediately looked to the south, which was the location of the Saint-Emperor Dynasty’s second immortal domain, the north of which had been occupied by the Giant Ghost King and the Grand Heavenmaster.</p>
 <p>Now that the damaged fan was whole, its teleportation function worked very differently than it had in the past, where he would be sent back to a specific spot. That old method left him quite limited, since the Vile-Emperor could easily keep that location under watch. Now, he could teleport to virtually anywhere in the world!</p>
 <p>Although he didn’t have precise control over the final destination, it at least made it easy to get to any one of the five different immortal domains.</p>
 <p>“It’s too bad the accuracy is so limited,” he thought, shaking his head. “Otherwise the teleportation function could actually be my biggest life-saving magic.” In contrast, the function of traveling to the fan seemed to work in exactly the same way as before.</p>
 <p>“I have a lot to do now that I'm back…. First is Uncle Li and everyone who was with him, and then the Giant Ghost King and Grand Heavenmaster. I guess I need to find Gongsun Wan’er first. She should know all the details.</p>
 <p>“Whatever I do, I need to get a firm foothold here, and I need to find my people. In that case… the first thing I should do is fight a shocking battle!” Eyes shining with bright light, he thought about the plan he had come up with, whereupon his eyes shone with determination.</p>
 <p>His plan was to do something monumentally shocking, and thus notify everyone in the Eternal Immortal Domains that he was back. Furthermore, by winning such a fight, he would also make it clear… that there were now three major powers in the Eternal Immortal Domains!</p>
 <p>After confirming where he was from the devas, he sent his divine sense out to scan the immortal domain he was in, and locate its capital city. Then, it was without any hesitation that he burst into motion, leaving behind nothing but thunderous booms and screaming winds.</p>
 <p>The crowd of cultivators was thrown backward by the wind cast by his departure. Meanwhile, the two devas looked at each other, eyes flickering with shock.</p>
 <p>“Was he…?”</p>
 <p>“He looked familiar…. I think I’ve seen his picture before….”</p>
 <p>“Celestial cultivation base…. It must be him…. He killed Celestial Deadfall, captured Prince Ur-Demon, executed the Vile-Prince, and even withstood a palm strike from the Vile-Emperor…. That was definitely King Heavenspan, Bai Xiaochun!!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The realization of who Bai Xiaochun was caused their minds to spin as surely as if they had been struck by lightning.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaochun was streaking through the air faster than if he had resorted to teleportations. Because of his indescribable speed, he rapidly closed in on the capital city, and was soon only moments away from it.</p>
 <p>Ordinary celestials would take days to make the trip, but within no time, Bai Xiaochun was there!</p>
 <p>The city itself was a colossal boulder, with countless other smaller rocks and boulders floating in the air around it, all of them covered with numerous structures. Because of that, it was known as Megarock City.</p>
 <p>Vile-Emperor Dynasty cultivators streamed into and out of the city, and considering that it was noontime, the place seemed particularly bustling.</p>
 <p>No one noticed Bai Xiaochun’s arrival, allowing him to hover unseen in the air above Megarock City.</p>
 <p>There was only one person who could possibly detect him, someone seated cross-legged in meditation inside of a grand hall in the boulder…. Reverend Devourer!</p>
 <p>In terms of battle prowess, the most powerful celestial in the Vile-Emperor Dynasty was Virūpākṣa. Years ago, the second most powerful had been the old woman who ended up being killed by the sovereign clone. Back then, Reverend Devourer had been third most powerful. However, after the old woman was resurrected, she was not as strong as before, which meant that Reverend Devourer was now the second most powerful celestial in the dynasty. Despite that, his personality had not changed; he was as careful and cautious as ever.</p>
 <p>The way he had pretended to be injured during the fight with the sovereign clone, and the way he had retreated from battle with Bai Xiaochun, were all manifestations of that cautious personality. Then came the events in Vile-Emperor City, which had resulted in him being punished by the Vile-Emperor by being sent to this remote location.</p>
 <p>Reverend Devourer didn’t mind being punished in this way, and in fact didn’t really view it as a punishment at all. He had actually enjoyed his life in this immortal domain during the years which had passed.</p>
 <p>“I guess it’s all thanks to that Bai Xiaochun,” he sighed. “Otherwise Prince Ur-Demon would have been the one sent here.” Most other people had forgotten about Bai Xiaochun, but not him. He still remembered what it had been like to face that multi-colored flame.</p>
 <p>He wasn’t sure why exactly he was sighing right now, but he knew that he suddenly felt uneasy, as though something momentous were about to occur. He even sent some divine sense out into the city, but didn't detect anything out of the ordinary. Rising to his feet, he decided to go out to take a closer look.</p>
 <p>However, it was in that very moment that a voice spoke out from the sky above the enormous boulder, a voice which caused all cultivators in the entire city to tremble in fear, and which spoke directly to Reverend Devourer!</p>
 <p>“It’s been a long time, Reverend Devourer!”</p>
 <p>To the people in Megarock City, it felt as if the weight of the heavens was descending upon them, and as for Reverend Devourer, he felt like his mind was being struck by heavenly lightning!!</p>
 <p>“That divine sense… that aura… that voice….” Eyes widening, Reverend Devourer sent his divine sense up into the air above the city, where he finally caught sight of a young man in a white robe, with long black hair!</p>
 <p>“Bai… Bai Xiaochun!?!?” Reverend Devourer stammered.</p>
 <p>Almost as soon as the words left his lips, the expressionless Bai Xiaochun waved his hand in the direction of the hall in which Reverend Devourer stood.</p>
 <p>Rumbling sounds filled all creation, and Reverend Devourer let loose a frenzied shriek as he shot out of the hall. As he did, the entire thing was crushed out of existence!</p>
 <p>Thanks to his timely evasive move, Reverend Devourer was only brushed by the attack, but it still caused him to cough up an enormous mouthful of blood. Instantly, his eyes lit up with terror and incredulity; this feeling was something that surpassed anything Celestial Virūpākṣa could do. It was almost on the same level as… the Vile-Emperor.</p>
 <p>“Breakthrough. He broke through!!” Reverend Devourer felt like his scalp was about to explode, and he abandoned any thoughts of fighting. He simply turned and fled!</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s facial expression didn’t change at all. In the past, he had taken Reverend Devourer very seriously when it came to conflict, but now, the man seemed anything but threatening!</p>
 <p>Waving his hand, he said, “Be crushed!”</p>
