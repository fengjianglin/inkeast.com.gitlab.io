 <p>There weren’t even a hundred Foundation Establishment cultivators surrounding him, only a few dozen. Furthermore, most of them were in early Foundation Establishment, although a handful were in mid Foundation Establishment.</p>
 <p>Thankfully, the mid Foundation Establishment cultivators only had grim looks on their faces, and didn’t actually attack. They had a different status than the early Foundation Establishment crowd, and for them to join everyone else in trying to attack Bai Xiaochun would be too much of a loss of face.</p>
 <p>Even without them, though, there were still dozens of Foundation Establishment Dharma protectors and elders, who were powerful enough to shake heaven and earth. Furthermore, in the Blood Stream Sect, there was no such thing as debate and discussion; there was only the law of the jungle!</p>
 <p><em>Provoke me, and die!</em></p>
 <p>It was completely different from the Spirit Stream Sect. Here, the only thing that mattered was strength!</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s actions had enraged the people from Middle Peak, and now they were attacking him with deadly force that far surpassed anything from the Qi Condensation stage. Divine abilities burst out, blood qi surged, and blood swords unique to Middle Peak all appeared. In the blink of an eye, more than ten blasts of sword qi descended directly toward Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun was just calming down from the incident with the rabbit, but now, he began to shiver uncontrollably. It was as if every part of his body were screaming at him that he was in deadly peril.</p>
 <p>Booms echoed out, shaking everything in the area. The dozens of Foundation Establishment cultivators all attacked at once, making it very difficult for Bai Xiaochun to dodge. In the blink of an eye, more than ten blasts of sword qi slammed into him.</p>
 <p>“Let me explain....” he said, staggering backward. Because of the blood qi he had absorbed, his Undying Gold Skin emanated blood-colored light. In combination with the Undying Heavenly King, he was stronger than ever, and his defenses were even more ridiculously strong than before.</p>
 <p>The Foundation Establishment cultivators gaped in shock, and many eyes went wide.</p>
 <p>“This Nightcrypt has been secretly cultivating a body refinement technique!”</p>
 <p>“No wonder he was able to survive the Fallen Sword Abyss. It was all thanks to that body refinement technique!”</p>
 <p>“His fleshly body defenses are so strong! Even our combined attack couldn’t shake him!”</p>
 <p>Their expressions turned very serious, and yet, they showed no signs that they would cease attacking Bai Xiaochun. The stronger he seemed, the more they wanted to kill him to stave off any problems from cropping up in the future.</p>
 <p>Cold gleams flickered in their eyes as they once again unleashed a combined attack.</p>
 <p>More than ten beams of sword qi slammed into Bai Xiaochun. No matter how he tried to evade or dodge, the dozens of Foundation Establishment cultivators stayed hot on his tail, unleashing constant attacks.</p>
 <p>Booms rang out. Some people even went and destroyed his immortal's cave.</p>
 <p>“Run if you want, Nightcrypt, you won’t escape this time!”</p>
 <p>Rumbling sounds filled the air as divine abilities and magical techniques slammed down. By this point, Bai Xiaochun was in a sorry state, having been repeatedly hit by numerous blasts of sword qi.</p>
 <p>Even with his Undying Live Forever Technique, blood still sprayed out of his mouth, until finally, he looked up, eyes bloodshot, expression vicious and even murderous.</p>
 <p>What people saw was Nightcrypt, awe-inspiring, bloodthirsty, merciless, and completely enraged.</p>
 <p>As of this moment, his blood qi was bursting, and his killing intent surging.</p>
 <p>“Enough running!” he said, wiping the blood from his mouth. “You buffoons have tried to kill me three times already. Things have gone too far!! Do you really think I’m scared of you people?!” His hair was in disarray, and his clothing ripped nearly to shreds. From the moment he had arrived in the Blood Stream Sect, he had been on edge and nervous, and now, all of that anxiety had reached a bursting point.</p>
 <p>He was tired of being wound so tight. These people wanted to kill him, and weren’t holding anything back. Their intentions were clear. Murder. The intense sensation of deadly crisis caused Bai Xiaochun to throw his head back and roar at the top of his lungs. Then he took a step forward, appearing directly in front of a young man in the early Foundation Establishment stage.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s expression was vicious as he unleashed the Mountain Shaking Bash. Blood sprayed out of the Foundation Establishment cultivator’s mouth, along with a miserable shriek as he was sent tumbling backward like a kite with its string cut.</p>
 <p>At the same time, seven or eight blasts of sword qi shot toward Bai Xiaochun. However, his own blood qi erupted out, shoving them away. Rumbling sounds could be heard as he blurred into motion toward two Middle Peak Dharma protectors. In the time it takes a spark to fly off of a piece of flint, he was right in front of them, his arms outstretched.</p>
 <p>The two Dharma protectors’ eyes widened, and they immediately unleashed their reserves of blood qi. Their hands flashed with incantations gestures, causing their qi to take form and rush forward to block Bai Xiaochun. However, his hands were filled with boundless power, and blasted through the blood qi as easily as a hammer smashes through ice. As the qi shattered, Bai Xiaochun’s hands latched onto the arm of each Dharma protector.</p>
 <p>“Screw the hell off!” he shouted. Then he jerked his hands to the side, and the two arms exploded into a cloud of blood. Agonized shrieks rang out as the two Dharma Protectors flew through the air to slam into a nearby immortal's cave.</p>
 <p>Middle Peak was descending into chaos. Meanwhile, the disturbance to the blood qi in the sect caused quite a few Foundation Establishment cultivators from Nameless Peak, Corpse Peak, and Lesser Marsh Peak to look over in surprise.</p>
 <p>Even the grand elders turned their heads to see what was happening, as did the blood masters, who looked toward Middle Peak from within their temples.</p>
 <p>On Ancestor Peak, the prime elders sent out streams of divine sense to observe Bai Xiaochun fighting against the crowd on Middle Peak.</p>
 <p>“Who is that kid?”</p>
 <p>“What a devilish personality! Look at how many people he got to attack him.”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha! Now that’s how we do things in the Blood Stream Sect! It doesn’t matter how young you are, when people try to kill you, you have to fight back!”</p>
 <p>As the cultivators from the other mountain peaks watched the excitement, Bai Xiaochun crushed one Foundation Establishment cultivator after another. All of them were completely shaken, and left coughing up blood.</p>
 <p>“Nightcrypt!” At that point, a cold snort echoed out as Song Que transformed into a blood-colored mountain peak, complete with three 30-meter-long blood-colored streams of sword qi that caused the entire area to shake.</p>
 <p>“Sword qi? I have some too!” Eyes bloodshot, Bai Xiaochun waved his right hand, unleashing the Blood Annihilation World technique. A stream of Undying Blood qi poured out from him, which he sent speeding toward Song Que with the wave of a finger.</p>
 <p>This was no ordinary stream of blood qi. Close examination would reveal that it was laced with a golden color. As soon as it appeared, an indescribable aura erupted out.</p>
 <p>Massive rumbling sounds filled the air, and all of the blood qi in the area trembled as though a king had appeared, and even raced toward it at top speed.</p>
 <p>As the local blood qi was sucked into the sword qi, the image of the sword grew larger. In the blink of an eye, it became like a 30-meter-long mountain shooting up into the sky.</p>
 <p>Compared to this sword qi, all other sword qi was like filth. Only Bai Xiaochun’s sword qi was the true and proper type!</p>
 <p>A domineering air seemed to fill it, like it was the ruler of all swords in the world. The sky shook, and everyone present felt their hearts pounding in their chests. The sword qi almost seemed impossible to control, as if it could shake everything in existence, even their cultivation bases!</p>
 <p>Everyone was completely and utterly shocked.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on!?!?”</p>
 <p>“What kind of sword qi is that!?!?”</p>
 <p>“Heavens! This Nightcrypt has also been cultivating the Blood Annihilation World!?!?”</p>
 <p>When the sword qi appeared, even the mid Foundation Establishment elders were shocked. Under the astonished gazes of all the onlookers, the spectacular sword qi shot toward Song Que.</p>
 <p>Song Que’s face fell, but he had no time to react. Heaven-shaking, earth-shattering rumbling sounds echoed out as his three blasts of sword qi were completely destroyed. Even his mountain peak form was destroyed, and he was revealed, blood spraying out of his mouth, a look of astonishment on his face as he was sent tumbling backward.</p>
 <p>“Impossible! You--” Song Que’s scalp was tingling in astonishment. Bai Xiaochun’s sword qi left him completely and utterly shaken. He had never even seen sword qi like this. It was so mighty that it exceeded anything he could imagine. Even the sword qi he had developed by cultivation in the blood waterfall was completely cowed by it!</p>
 <p>He wasn’t the only one who was shaken. Everyone in the area felt their minds reeling. Bai Xiaochun’s domineering use of sword qi left their eyes wide and their scalps numb from the shock.</p>
 <p>The crowds on Lesser Marsh Peak, Nameless Peak, and Corpse Peak were also looking on with wide eyes. The grand elders of the three peaks were left gasping, and the blood masters’ eyes shone with intense light.</p>
 <p>Cries of astonishment could even be heard on Ancestor Peak!</p>
 <p>“The level of that sword qi… it’s Blood Qi Plasma!”</p>
 <p>“That kid’s name is Nightcrypt? What a genius! I can’t believe he reached such a level completely under the radar!”</p>
 <p>“In the Blood Annihilation World, everything comes down to refining the blood. The four levels are Refined Blood Qi, Blood Qi Plasma, Inverse Blood Ancestral Awakening, and Blood Qi Tribulation!” Even more streams of divine sense arrived on Middle Peak to observe the chaotic fighting.</p>
 <p>The highest echelons of the Blood Stream Sect leadership were now observing Bai Xiaochun’s sword qi!</p>
 <p>It was at this point that Master God-Diviner suddenly cried out, “Kill Nightcrypt! If he doesn’t die, he’ll definitely try to get revenge on us in the future!”</p>
 <p>With that, he performed an incantation gesture and attacked. Everyone else seemed to agree, as they all joined forces to attack Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>“Something’s off about this guy!” Song Que shouted, glaring murderously at Bai Xiaochun. “That’s not the Middle Peak’s Blood Annihilation World!” He wasn’t sure why, but after exchanging blows with this Nightcrypt, his heart was filled with deep, profound hatred for him, hatred that seemed completely irreconcilable.</p>
 <p>It was a sudden and inexplicable feeling, but there it was in his heart.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun dodged the attacks, and then looked around at the brutal, vicious expressions on the faces of the people surrounding him. Suddenly, he began to laugh with rage, and his eyes burned with murderous coldness.</p>
 <p>“You think this isn’t the Blood Annihilation World? Well, I think I need to show you people what the Blood Annihilation World really looks like!” With that, he leaped high up into the air. Even as the Foundation Establishment cultivators turned into beams of light to follow him, he waved his hand in the direction of Middle Peak!</p>
