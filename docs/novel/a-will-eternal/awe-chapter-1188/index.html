<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Behind Celestial Virūpākṣa were streams of divine sense, which belonged to the other celestials in the city, all of whom had detected what was occurring with the spell formation.</p>
 <p>Most of them intentionally hung back a bit. After all, Bai Xiaochun had just killed Celestial Deadfall and seriously injured Reverend Devourer, leaving all of them quite shaken.</p>
 <p>Some, such as Prince Ur-Demon, were so frightened that they only dared to send out divine sense, and even then, let Celestial Virūpākṣa take the lead.</p>
 <p>Celestial Virūpākṣa, on the other hand, was the strongest celestial in Vile-Emperor City, and had long since come to hate Bai Xiaochun. He had become suspicious of him back when they were both on the damaged fan, and had also suffered at his hands during the incident with the sovereign clone. Therefore, he did not hesitate at all to intervene when Bai Xiaochun tried to break open the spell formation.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun looked up, aware that if Celestial Virūpākṣa hindered him in opening the spell formation, then the other celestials from Vile-Emperor City would also come.</p>
 <p>Then, not only would he be in great danger, but it would also be impossible to save Patriarch Spirit Stream and the others. And that was without even mentioning the fact that the Vile-Emperor could also show up eventually.</p>
 <p>Not much time had passed since he made his move, and he didn’t dare to gamble on how long the Vile-Emperor would remain in secluded meditation. If he emerged, then it could lead to a complete catastrophe!</p>
 <p>“So, killing Deadfall didn’t scare them. Well, if I can make Virūpākṣa stand down, then that should strike fear into their hearts!” Knowing he had no other choice, he threw his head back and roared, drawing fully upon his cultivation base to shove the Greatsword of the North down toward the spell formation!</p>
 <p>A boom rang out as the sword stabbed into the formation, which trembled violently, but held. However, stabbing the sword into the formation not only reduced some of the danger to those inside, it also made it much more difficult for the formation to repair itself.</p>
 <p>Looking up, Bai Xiaochun unleashed shocking fleshly body and cultivation base power as he shot toward Celestial Virūpākṣa!</p>
 <p>“Have a death wish?!” It wasn’t that Celestial Virūpākṣa hadn’t seen Bai Xiaochun kill Deadfall. It was that he still believed that, even if Bai Xiaochun were stronger than he was, he could still be handled. And that was especially true now that he wasn’t wielding his Greatsword of the North.</p>
 <p>As the two closed in on each other, Bai Xiaochun unleashed the Undying Emperor’s Fist at nearly the highest level it could reach.</p>
 <p>A huge boom rang out, causing wild colors to flash in heaven and earth. Blood sprayed out of Bai Xiaochun’s mouth as he staggered backward. Virūpākṣa was equally shaken, his eyes shining brightly, and his heart swelling with shock. Even he was surprised by the fist strike Bai Xiaochun had just unleashed.</p>
 <p>Before he could attack again, Bai Xiaochun’s wounds were healing up, and a ferocious smile could be seen on his face as he unleashed… yet another Undying Emperor’s Fist!</p>
 <p>Deafening rumbling sounds could be heard as blood sprayed out of Bai Xiaochun’s mouth again. And yet, he didn’t hold back. In the blink of an eye, Bai Xiaochun attacked and was rebuffed five times in a row. And yet, Celestial Virūpākṣa was having a hard time sustaining the force, and staggered backward, coughing up blood.</p>
 <p>Looking livelier than ever, Bai Xiaochun lunged after him. Off in the distance, Prince Ur-Demon and the other celestials gasped at the sight of what was happening.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun seemed to be gripped by madness, and was doing things that none of them could ever have imagined him doing. To them, he seemed completely different from the past. As of now, he clearly pulsed with veins of steel!</p>
 <p>He was obviously injured, to the point where he was coughing up mouthfuls of blood. Even with his powers of regeneration, it didn't seem like he should be able to sustain such terrible injuries.</p>
 <p>In the face of such madness and such veins of steel, even the valiant Celestial Virūpākṣa was coughing up blood, and finally seemed to be hesitating.</p>
 <p>Wiping the blood off of his mouth, Bai Xiaochun said, “Bring it on!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With that, he blurred into motion, unleashing more Undying Emperor’s Fists, causing all heaven and earth to tremble as shadowy emperors unleashed a torrent of destruction. He seemed to completely disregard any injuries to himself as he fought with increasingly shocking battle prowess!</p>
 <p>With the Undying Codex bolstering him, Bai Xiaochun seemed beyond the point of coming to a compromise. He would either kill his opponent, or die trying!!</p>
 <p>As his murderous aura raged, Virūpākṣa struggled to fight back. After coughing up seven huge mouthfuls of blood, his face fell.</p>
 <p>“Are you really trying to get killed, Bai Xiaochun!?” he shouted. There was nothing for Virūpākṣa to do other than shout and curse. As of this moment, Bai Xiaochun’s arm was in shreds, his bones visible beneath the skin. He was coughing so violently that the blood that came out was filled with chunks of internal organs.</p>
 <p>And yet, Bai Xiaochun was in such a state of madness, and his murderous aura was so intense, that Virūpākṣa was already hesitating about whether to keep on fighting. At this point, even winning could place him in grave danger!</p>
 <p>“It's not worth it!” He suddenly shot backward in the face of Bai Xiaochun’s next attack. Although it was a big loss of face, the danger was too great. Just like Reverend Devourer, he chose to flee, and even regretted having gotten involved to begin with.</p>
 <p>Off in the distance, Prince Ur-Demon and the other celestials saw what was happening, and gasped in shock. After exchanging stunned glances, they turned to head back into the city.</p>
 <p>“Screw it. As long as he doesn’t cause problems in the city, we should just leave him alone.”</p>
 <p>“This guy is obviously crazy….”</p>
 <p>“The Vile-Emperor might be in secluded meditation, but if things keep going on like this, he’ll definitely come out and take care of things!”</p>
 <p>Ignoring the fleeing Celestial Virūpākṣa, Bai Xiaochun flew back down to the Greatsword of the North. Panting for breath, he grabbed it by the hilt and then yanked it out of the spell formation. Even as his wounds healed up, he drew upon both his cultivation base and fleshly body power to slash the sword downward again.</p>
 <p>“Open up!”</p>
 <p>BOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!</p>
 <p>He hit the very spot where he had stabbed the sword into the formation, causing cracks to spread out in all directions. Then, the spell formation exploded!</p>
 <p>As the dust settled, the tens of thousands of Heavenspan Realm cultivators who had been inside looked up. Despite being weakened, they knew that they now had a new lease on life. And then they saw Bai Xiaochun. Although some didn’t recognize him, many were his friends. And many began to shed tears.</p>
 <p>“Arch-Ancestor!”</p>
 <p>“It’s the Arch-Ancestor!!”</p>
 <p>“The Arch-Ancestor came to rescue us!!” Bai Xiaochun couldn’t keep a calm heart in the face of such exclamations. Almost immediately, he focused on Li Qinghou and Patriarch Spirit Stream, who looked profoundly weakened by this point. Rushing over to Li Qinghou, he reached out to help him to his feet.</p>
 <p>“Uncle Li!”</p>
 <p>Considering how long it had been since they had last seen each other, it should have been a joyous reunion. And although Li Qinghou was visibly excited, his face suddenly turned grim, and he gripped Bai Xiaochun’s shoulders tightly.</p>
 <p>“Xiaochun,” he said, sounding very anxious, “you have to go save Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo!!”</p>
 <p>When Bai Xiaochun heard that, a tremor passed through him, and he suddenly couldn’t breathe. He had been searching for news of those two very women for many years, only to hear their names now, in this moment of critical danger.</p>
 <p>“They were taken away by the Vile-Prince!” Li Qinghou continued, “You have to rescue them!!”</p>
 <p>Looking just as anxious as Li Qinghou, Patriarch Spirit Stream added, “Xiaochun, they’re pregnant! And considering how the two of them have been acting around each other… you have to be the father! I'm not sure why they’ve been pregnant for so long, but from what Junwan told me, she’s definitely bearing your child. Go, save them!!”</p>
 <p>“WHAT?!?!” Bai Xiaochun was as struck to the core as if he had been hit by lightning. Although others might not understand the situation, based on what the Giant Ghost King had told him, he knew that it was because of his bloodline and the Undying Live Forever Codex that the pregnancy terms of both women had been extended in such dramatic fashion. As of this moment, what he had felt before almost didn’t count as being angry. As of this moment, he felt more fury than could be imagined!</p>
