 <p>Bai Xiaochun was already 5,000 kilometers away, his heart pounding. He could sense that the vortex he had created was gone, which meant that the battleship was likely closing in at top speed.</p>
 <p>“Complete and utter bullying!!” the Giant Ghost King grumbled. His face was pale, and he looked quite bedraggled. Without the help of the moonflower just now, he would have suffered a bitter defeat at the hands of the other demigods. “If I had the Grand Heavenmaster and the other heavenly kings to back me up, we five could definitely have stood up to them!”</p>
 <p>The Giant Ghost King was actually feeling quite embarrassed by how the fight had played out.</p>
 <p>“It’s a good thing we hatched our plan and left that town,” Bai Xiaochun said. “If we had been caught by Ghostmother there, we would have been like fish in a barrel.” At the moment, he was feeling very irritated. Considering the look of wild ambition he had seen in Ghostmother’s eyes, he was sure that she would chase him down to the bitter end.</p>
 <p>If he were in the Heavenspan Realm, things would have been a bit easier, with plenty of options and places to go to remain safe. But in the Eternal Lands, and on the border of the Vile-Emperor Dynasty, it was too dangerous to allow any delays to occur.</p>
 <p>“If only I could get Ghostmother off of that battleship,” he thought with a sigh. Unfortunately, Ghostmother was being very careful, and hadn’t made any slipups. Right now, he had no options. Sending his divine sense out, he scanned the Eternal Sea, and yet saw nothing but endless water, with no places to hole up.</p>
 <p>As Bai Xiaochun and the Giant Ghost King anxiously tried to come up with a plan, massive rumbling sounds could be heard coming from the bone lizard behind them.</p>
 <p>When the howls of the evil ghosts that made up the black cloud reached Bai Xiaochun and the Giant Ghost King, their pupils constricted.</p>
 <p>A moment ago, the bone lizard had used the blood mist to gain an additional burst of speed that sent it rocketing forward even faster than before.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun only had the time to flick his sleeve to separate himself and the Giant Ghost King, then turn to face the bone lizard.</p>
 <p>Cracking sounds could be heard as rifts opened up everywhere. However, these were the Eternal Lands, and therefore, the rifts healed almost immediately.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, a sea of flames had erupted out of the mouth of the bone lizard, sending intense heat out in all directions.</p>
 <p>Yet again, the black beam of light shot out, filled with deadly power.</p>
 <p>The two ghost faces were also present, and were fanning out as if to block Bai Xiaochun and the Giant Ghost King’s path.</p>
 <p>It was a moment of deadly crisis, and there was no time to contemplate the situation. Bai Xiaochun immediately threw his hands out.</p>
 <p>“Waterswamp!”</p>
 <p>Water vapor roiled out, turning the world hazy. Even as Ghostmother’s eyes narrowed up on the battleship, Bai Xiaochun threw his arms down.</p>
 <p>“Kingdom!!”</p>
 <p><em>Roar!</em></p>
 <p>Heaven and earth trembled as a beastly howl filled the air that seemed to come from countless years in the past. As it echoed out, a huge black landmass rose up from within the watery swamp!</p>
 <p>Blood scales and bloodshot eyes could be seen, along with a fishy odor as… a gigantic crocodilian head appeared!</p>
 <p>By the time the lower jaw was visible, the demigods present were so stunned that their jaws dropped.</p>
 <p>As for the bone lizard, it was huge, but compared to this crocodilian creature, it actually looked insignificant.</p>
 <p>“What is that?!?!” That was what all the demigods were thinking as they rushed backward in retreat. Meanwhile, the huge crocodilian mouth opened… and snapped toward the bone lizard.</p>
 <p>The Giant Ghost King knew Bai Xiaochun well, but when he saw this, he was so shaken his eyes nearly popped out of his skull.</p>
 <p>“Is that really a divine ability?” he thought, his heart pounding with fear. He also backed up, doing everything in his power to get as far away as he could. Bai Xiaochun did the same thing, not even waiting to see what would happen behind him as he fled with the Giant Ghost King.</p>
 <p>The bone lizard wanted to give chase, but it was too late as the huge crocodilian mouth snapped down onto it. From a distance, it almost looked like the crocodilian creature had risen up out of the Eternal Sea and swallowed the lizard!</p>
 <p>The battleship seemed powerless to fight back. Not even the blood mist shield could help it to flee out of the closing crocodilian mouth.</p>
 <p>The enemy demigods were terrified to find that they couldn’t get out of the affected area; the mouth slammed shut, causing intense rumbling sounds to fill the air. Then, the crocodilian creature sank back down, making it seem almost like it was going down into the waters of the Eternal Sea.</p>
 <p>When the crocodilian head disappeared, the watery swamp faded away. After about ten seconds passed, the rumbling sounds were gone.</p>
 <p>Then, a rift broke open, and the bone lizard shot out, howling the entire way.</p>
 <p>It was visibly damaged! Although the Waterswamp Kingdom hadn’t destroyed it, it had inflicted serious injuries! Apparently, the Waterswamp Kingdom was even stronger when unleashed within the Eternal Lands!</p>
 <p>Although Ghostmother looked slightly anxious, her eyes glowed with excitement.</p>
 <p>“So, I finally got you to pull out a true trump card! And don’t you dare think that using it on me a second time will have the same results!” She chuckled, a sound filled with both avarice and anticipation.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun was even stronger than she had hoped, and now that he had revealed his true trump card, she felt confident enough to attack him directly!</p>
 <p>Smiling a radiant smile, she turned the battleship in his direction and began to chase him down!</p>
 <p>She only had three demigods left, but was confident that if she could get her hands on Bai Xiaochun, it would all be worth it!</p>
 <p>“You’re mine, Bai Xiaochun, all mine!”</p>
 <p>Ghostmother licked her lips slowly, a sight that, if anyone could see it who didn't know the current circumstances, would have jumped to very different conclusions about what was going on….</p>
 <p>Several thousand kilometers away, Bai Xiaochun and the Giant Ghost King were fleeing across the Eternal Sea. Grim expressions covered their faces, and neither was saying much. As for the Giant Ghost King, bitterness and unease filled his heart. The terrifying strength of Ghostmother had already sapped his hope of reaching the Saint-Emperor Dynasty.</p>
 <p>“What do we do?” he murmured inwardly. “We have to think of something?!” Of course, he hadn’t noticed that a strange light that had begun to glitter in Bai Xiaochun’s eyes.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun simply wasn’t willing to give up. He was now confident that if it weren’t for the bone galleon, even a celestial like Ghostmother wouldn’t be able to kill him. Ghostmother’s only strength lay in that battleship.</p>
 <p>“I wonder how Hou Xiaomei is doing…?” he thought. After all, Ghostmother had brought Hou Xiaomei and Big Fatty Zhang with her to the Eternal Lands, and yet, he hadn’t seen any hint that they were currently with her. Presumably, Ghostmother would remain tight-lipped if he tried to get any information about them from her.</p>
 <p>“You know… two measly demigods is not a very good blood tribute…. We need to do something far more shocking!” Expression flickering, and eyes turning more bloodshot, he began to build on an idea he had just come up with moments before.</p>
 <p>After some more thought, he turned and grabbed the Giant Ghost King’s shoulder.</p>
 <p>“Hey, old pal. What do you think… about kidnapping Ghostmother?! What kind of reward do you think the Saint-Emperor would give us for her!?”</p>
 <p>The Giant Ghost King had just been thinking about ways to escape the situation when Bai Xiaochun grabbed him. When he looked over and saw the wild look in Bai Xiaochun’s eyes, and heard his suggestion, he was completely taken aback.</p>
 <p>“Kidnap Ghostmother?” Something about the whole situation seemed very familiar, but there was no time to think about that now. The mere idea left the Giant Ghost King feeling stunned. After all, there were a total of six celestials in the Vile-Emperor Dynasty, all of whom were shocking figures. If one were to be kidnapped, it would send shockwaves through all of the Eternal Lands. That would be a blood tribute that defied the imaginations of everyone.</p>
 <p>“We shouldn’t do anything impulsive, Xiaochun….” he began. After all, the two of them were currently fleeing from certain death. To the Giant Ghost King, Bai Xiaochun’s suggestion seemed almost ludicrous.</p>
 <p>“Come on! Yes? Or No?” Bai Xiaochun said, glaring. If the Giant Ghost King had immediately agreed, he might have hesitated. After all, the idea really was a bit crazy.</p>
 <p>But when he saw how nervous the Giant Ghost King was, he felt more than a little annoyed.</p>
 <p>Forehead veins bulging, he gritted his teeth and said, “Giant Ghost, old pal, didn’t you say you wanted to do something momentous? What could be better than kidnapping a celestial? You want big? If we do that, it’ll shake all of the Eternal Lands!”</p>
 <p>The Giant Ghost King’s heart began to pound as he thought, “Why not kidnap an archaean then…?” But then he suddenly realized why the look in Bai Xiaochun’s eyes seemed so familiar…. “Fudge! That’s what he looked like… when he kidnapped me! He’s a kidnapping expert!”</p>
 <p>A wry smile broke out on the Giant Ghost King face. Then he gritted his teeth and said, “Alright, let’s do it! How do we pull it off?!”</p>
