 <p>Archaean fleshly body!</p> 
 <p>Archaean cultivation base!</p> 
 <p>When the power of Bai Xiaochun’s fleshly body and cultivation base combined, he began to pulse with an energy akin to an ancestral awakening!</p> 
 <p>The sky flashed with wild colors, winds screamed, and the Eternal Immortal Domains quaked. All living beings were shaken to the core. As for Bai Xiaochun, his eyes glittered brightly; he had come under a lot of pressure in recent days, so while this dramatic rise in battle prowess didn’t alleviate the brewing crisis of the Mortal Renegade, it at least relieved it a bit.</p> 
 <p>As his fleshly body broke through, his powers of regeneration grew even more focused, causing his injuries to rapidly heal. Soon, he was back to normal, and even beyond that, to the point where the flame of his life force burned like an invisible sun!</p> 
 <p>“Eternal Mother!” Looking up, he fixed his gaze on the bell, and began to walk forward. It took a single step, and he was there in front of it, where he reached out with his hand, not to attack with his fist, but to casually strike it with his palm.</p> 
 <p>His movement seemed ordinary in nature, but contained massive, destructive force. The bell tolled, and the little turtle gasped. As for the Saint-Emperor, he was yet again flabbergasted, and couldn’t contain his shock.</p> 
 <p>“That palm strike….”</p> 
 <p>He could tell that the energy unleashed by the palm strike was formidable, but was not very focused, and allowed much of the energy behind it to disperse. That was what caused the strange phenomena. It was a result of simply not utilizing this divine ability to the fullest extent possible. The higher one’s cultivation base was, and the greater one’s command of magic, the more likely something like this was to occur. It was a like a natural reaction.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s seemingly ordinary palm strike did not shake heaven and earth, and yet, revealed how tightly connected his cultivation base and fleshly body were!</p> 
 <p>It was something that many people in the Eternal Immortal Domains would call the aura of an ancestor, and was what the Saint-Emperor had just called the Ancestor Realm!!</p> 
 <p>Of course, the Ancestor Realm was not a cultivation level, but rather, something that was described in ancient records when someone's cultivation base and fleshly body combined perfectly. And according to the ancient records, only the three ancestors themselves had ever done something like this.</p> 
 <p>Perhaps people with lower cultivation bases could manage to achieve something similar, but their combination would not result in this sort of energy. Only someone in the Archaean Realm could do something so profoundly shocking!</p> 
 <p>It was a state in which one could converge the energy of heaven and earth into one spot, and use it to crush anything in one’s path!</p> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaochun’s palm strike landed, the bell emitted a sound that was vastly louder than anything from before. The entire semi-transparent bell began to twist and distort, almost is if it were about to break. Heaven-shaking, earth-shattering rumbling sounds could be heard, and a massive burst of backlash power flooded out toward Bai Xiaochun, like an invisible wave that instantly swept over him completely.</p> 
 <p>Before, he might have been able to survive, but his powers of regeneration would not have been able to keep up with the effects. But now, things were different. Eyes shining, he didn’t even take a step back. He kept his hand placed on the surface of the bell, almost as if he were absorbing the backlash. His expression was the same as ever as his five yin organs were quickly repaired, and sent out power that not only dispersed the effects of the backlash, but also healed him!</p> 
 <p>The process takes a while to describe, but happened in only a single breath of time. After the terrifying backlash power was negated, Bai Xiaochun chuckled, and struck the bell again!</p> 
 <p>This time, he didn’t stop. It was as if he wouldn’t give up until the Eternal Mother woke up! Without stopping, he let loose eight more palm strikes. Counting the blows he had unleashed before, he had now struck the bell nearly thirty times!</p> 
 <p>Booms filled heaven and earth, and the bell continued to distort. The backlash attacks continued, but Bai Xiaochun didn't stop. As his Undying Codex worked at full speed, he experienced something like a physically comfortable baptism. Thirty-one palm strikes. Thirty-two….</p> 
 <p>With each palm strike, he felt more comfortable than before, almost as though countless tiny hands were slowly massaging him inside and out. Even his soul was affected, filling him with a pleasurable sensation that pushed him to the point of forgetting about the Eternal Mother, and focusing completely on the feeling….</p> 
 <p>And thus, he struck out thirty-three times. Thirty-four. Thirty-five…. Forty times!</p> 
 <p>With the fortieth blow, the pleasurable sensation reached an incredible height, causing him to gasp and pant loudly, but only for a moment. When he realized what he was doing, he quickly closed his mouth.</p> 
 <p>The more than ten blows he had struck caused the Eternal River to tremble everywhere, and struck the inhabitants of the lands with profound shock.</p> 
 <p>“Heavens! How many times is the Arch-Emperor going to strike that bell…?”</p> 
 <p>“For some reason, it almost seems like he’s enjoying himself. Look at his facial expression….”</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, the Saint-Emperor and the little turtle were struck as mute as wooden chickens. Not only were they shocked that Bai Xiaochun was still going, they were flabbergasted by the look of pleasure on his face.</p> 
 <p>And the truth was… although the people in the Eternal Immortal Domains hadn’t noticed how he had begun to pant earlier, the Saint-Emperor and the little turtle had been right there, and had heard it clearly.</p> 
 <p>“He’s… enjoying it?” the Saint-Emperor thought, a strange expression appearing on his face. He simply didn’t understand why Bai Xiaochun would look like this; it was really a very odd facial expression.</p> 
 <p>And from the way he was striking the bell, it seemed like he didn’t want to ever stop. And that was the truth! Bai Xiaochun’s eyes were shining as he was baptized by the backlashes, prompting him to strike the bell over and over without cease.</p> 
 <p>Fifty. Sixty. Seventy….</p> 
 <p>The tolling of the bell shook the entire world, and caused huge waves to surge on the Eternal Sea and the Eternal River. As for the light that represented the Eternal Mother, it was flickering even more brightly, and seemed to be just on the verge of waking up.</p> 
 <p>Eventually, to the shock and excitement of the little turtle and the Saint-Emperor, and to the astonishment of the other inhabitants of the lands, that light suddenly began to shrink in on itself, transforming into an enormous eye!</p> 
 <p>It was closed, but almost immediately began to tremble. Then, with Bai Xiaochun’s final strike on the bell… it slowly opened!</p> 
 <p>The Eternal Mother was waking up!!</p> 
 <p>As the eye opened, the Eternal Immortal Domains were bathed with radiant light. All of the plants and vegetation, all of the mountains and rivers, all of the various people, began to shine brightly. From a position far out in the void, it was as if the Eternal Immortal Domains were a spectacularly glowing flower, right in the middle of the process of blooming!</p> 
 <p>At the same time, an indescribable warmth embraced all living things, regardless of the level of their cultivation base, something intimate, like the touch of a mother upon her child!</p> 
 <p>“Eternal Mother!” the Saint-Emperor breathed, trembling with excitement. He quickly clasped hands and bowed.</p> 
 <p>The little turtle looked on with wide eyes, feeling a little guilty as he backed up. Hiding behind the Saint-Emperor, he peeked around to look at the Eternal Mother, incarnated in the form of an eye.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaochun was also overwhelmed by that motherly sensation, and bowed deeply.</p> 
 <p>“Greetings, Eternal Mother!”</p>
