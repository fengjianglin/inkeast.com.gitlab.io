<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>“Nightdevil?” When Bai Xiaochun heard what the blood trees were screaming, his jaw dropped. He had no way of knowing, but because of the brutality of the previous day’s events, quite a few people had taken to calling him Nightdevil.</p>
 <p>Annoyed by the shrieking trees, he snorted coldly and said, “Shut up!”</p>
 <p>His voice was accompanied by a brutally murderous air that scared the blood trees so much that they started trembling and lapsed into silence. Terrified, the trees that had planted themselves onto the path leading to the immortal’s cave pulled up their roots and cleared the way.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun clasped his hands behind his back, stuck his chin up, and coolly said, “Master God-Diviner, get out here!”</p>
 <p>Everyone who heard him was completely shocked.</p>
 <p>Inside the immortal's cave, Master God-Diviner’s face when ashen, and a crazed look appeared in his eyes. Gritting his teeth, sweat popping out on his forehead, he cried, “Nightcrypt, don’t push things too far!!”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun didn't step into the forest of blood trees. The pressure from the spell formation was too threatening. However, in response to Master God-Diviner’s words, he smiled grimly and then unleashed some blood qi. In the blink of an eye, all of the blood qi in the area began to churn, transforming into a dense mist.</p>
 <p>The faces on the blood trees began to quiver, but they didn't dare to scream. They simply began to huddle together in shock.</p>
 <p>The Foundation Establishment cultivators in the area could sense what was happening, and saw the shocking blood qi building up around Bai Xiaochun. Inside the immortal's cave, Master God-Diviner sat there with ashen face, chuckling bitterly. The madness in his eyes grew, and just when he was about to jump out and fight to the death, Bai Xiaochun’s cruel voice once again filled the area.</p>
 <p>“I’ll give you three breaths’ of time to get the hell out of there,” he said proudly. “I want this immortal's cave.” With that he flicked his sleeve.</p>
 <p>Master God-Diviner had been ready to unleash the power of the spell formation to fight to the death with Bai Xiaochun. But when he heard his words, his eyes went wide with surprise. He almost couldn’t believe it. “You think I’ll risk my life based on your kindness, Nightcrypt? What makes you think I’ll believe you?!?!”</p>
 <p>Sticking his chin up, Bai Xiaochun replied, “Calm down. I’m a man of my word. If I say I’m going to take your immortal's cave, then I’m going to take your immortal's cave!”</p>
 <p>Even as the words left his mouth, the door to the immortal’s cave opened, and Master God-Diviner flew out at top speed, flying off into the air. As he did, his voice echoed out, “Nightcrypt, the Blood Stream Sect is a devilish sect, but we keep our promises. If you go back on your word in front of all these Fellow Daoists, you’ll be hated by everyone! No one will ever believe you again!”</p>
 <p>Master God-Diviner was truly afraid. He feared that Bai Xiaochun was intentionally drawing him out of his immortal’s cave to attack him. Even as he flew off, he tossed down the jade pendant to the immortal's cave.</p>
 <p>Never could he have imagined that Bai Xiaochun really had just come for the immortal's cave, and not his life. In fact, he still couldn’t believe it, and his heart pounded with the feeling of having nearly escaped a deadly catastrophe.</p>
 <p>As he caught the jade pendant, Bai Xiaochun stared at the fleeing Master God-Diviner. Only then did he understand what was going on. Sighing, he ignored Master God-Diviner and then stepped into the blood tree forest.</p>
 <p>As soon as the blood trees realized they had a new master, they were all smiles, and even began to lavish him with praise.</p>
 <p>“Master Nightdevil is mighty and extraordinary, invincible under the heavens.”</p>
 <p>“Master Nightdevil is a master strategist! He can succeed with even the most difficult tasks!”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun looked at the fawning blood trees with a somber, cold expression, and yet, a gleam of encouragement could be seen in his eyes. At first, the blood trees had been very nervous, but when they saw the encouraging look, they mustered their courage and heaped more flattery upon him. Bai Xiaochun sighed and shook his head.</p>
 <p>“I really am quite outstanding,” he murmured. “No matter where I go, people are always trying to flatter me. It's annoying, and yet, I can’t really stop them either.” His sighs caused the blood trees’ flattery to increase.</p>
 <p>“Compared to Nightdevil, no other devils exist in the world!”</p>
 <p>“With a single glance, Nightdevil causes all the female cultivators to swoon....”</p>
 <p>“When Nightdevil sighs, the heavens turn dim!”</p>
 <p>As the blood trees went all out with their praise, Bai Xiaochun happily stepped into Master God-Diviner’s immortal's cave. The blood qi here didn't seem any less strong than that near Song Que’s blood waterfall. Bai Xiaochun felt even more satisfied than before.</p>
 <p>There were seven or eight puppets present which all offered formal greetings. He quickly sent them over to his old collapsed immortal's cave to bring his belongings over.</p>
 <p>Soon, the fact that Bai Xiaochun had occupied Master God-Diviner’s immortal's cave spread through all of Middle Peak. Yet again, a whole new set of stories regarding Nightcrypt’s brutality were told.</p>
 <p>Half a month went by, during which time the stories of Nightcrypt grew more and more wild. All of the cultivator clans in the area already knew about him.</p>
 <p>Soon, everyone was aware that a new, savage figure had appeared in the Blood Stream Sect. He had single-handedly fought an entire group of Foundation Establishment experts, and even killed seven or eight of them. He had drawn upon all the blood qi of Middle Peak to form an enormous, shocking blood sword.</p>
 <p>And then there was his Inverse Blood Ancestral Awakening, which left everyone completely astonished.</p>
 <p>“He has a strange personality, and is completely unpredictable. One second he’ll be slaughtering people left and right, the next, he’s calm and lets everyone off the hook. It’s impossible to figure him out....”</p>
 <p>“I heard that, according to Patriarch Limitless, it was Nightcrypt’s devilish personality that enabled him to escape alive from the Spirit Stream Sect's Bai Xiaochun. Nightcrypt has obviously been extraordinary for some time!”</p>
 <p>“Not even Song Que is a match for him! It’s too bad he’s only at Mortal-Dao Foundation Establishment. Otherwise, he'd be even stronger than he is now!”</p>
 <p>“That’s nothing. I heard that the grand elders of all four mountain peaks fought over him. In the end, he chose Grand Elder Song Junwan of Middle Peak. What a pity....”</p>
 <p>Of course, news leaked from Blood Stream Sect territory into the territory of other sects. Eventually, even the warring Profound Stream Sect and Pill Stream Sect had heard of Nightcrypt.</p>
 <p>The Spirit Stream Sect was closer than they were to the Blood Stream Sect, so they were privy to more details. Eventually, both the north and south banks of the Spirit Stream Sect were abuzz with the topic.</p>
 <p>Ghostfang was in secluded meditation, but even he heard some of the stories. Frowning, he thought back to the Fallen Sword Abyss, but couldn’t recall a Blood Stream Sect disciple with that name. “Nightcrypt? I don’t remember him....”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyou was also in secluded meditation. After thinking the matter over, he couldn’t recall any information about the person in question. But that didn’t matter. He wasn’t happy about anyone being stronger than him. When it came to the Chosen of any generation, they knew that the only way to maintain their place was to keep getting stronger and stronger.</p>
 <p>“Nightcrypt....” Zhou Xinqi took a deep breath. The Spirit Stream Sect paid very close attention to the affairs of the Blood Stream Sect. Zhou Xinqi was very shocked by the news, especially when she heard that he had fought a battle with an entire group of Foundation Establishment experts. Gritting her teeth, she focused even harder on her cultivation.</p>
 <p>It was the same with Beihan Lie, Lu Tianlei, Xu Song, Gongsun Yun and many other Chosen. The stories about Nightcrypt spurred them into even greater focus. As for the sect leader and the other high level leaders, they also took note, but what interested them more was the Inverse Blood Ancestral Awakening.</p>
 <p>“If this Nightcrypt keeps getting stronger, he could turn into quite the calamity....”</p>
 <p>“Put more resources into the search for Bai Xiaochun. Ever since the kid left, not even a shadow of him has turned up. Even the people we sent to watch over him haven’t been able to turn up any clues.”</p>
 <p>The Spirit Stream Sect Chosen and leadership figures were shaken. As for the ordinary Inner Sect disciples, most of them weren’t very impressed with the stories they heard.</p>
 <p>“What the hell is a Nightcrypt? Can he even come close to Sect Uncle Bai?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, exactly. If Sect Uncle Bai fought him, this Nightcrypt would be turned to ash in a second!” That was what many people were saying, especially Hou Xiaomei and Big Fatty Zhang. Xu Baocai was especially fervent in his opinions as well.</p>
 <p>In fact, to confirm her theory that the newly famous Nightcrypt would be completely destroyed by the simple wave of Bai Xiaochun’s finger, Hou Xiaomei went to consult with Hou Yunfei, who was in secluded meditation.</p>
 <p>After a long moment of thought, Hou Yunfei smiled and said, “Nightcrypt? There were too many people attacking Xiaochun at the same time. I don't really remember them all.”</p>
 <p>“I <em>knew&nbsp;</em>that guy was a nobody! Big Bro Xiaochun is the <em>awesomest</em>.” At first, Hou Xiaomei was very happy. However, her mood quickly soured. “Where do you think Xiaochun is now anyway? How come nobody can find him? I hope he’s not in trouble.”</p>
 <p>Hou Yunfei tousled her hair and looked off into the distance.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry about him,” he said with a slight smile. “No matter where he ends up, the people who’ll end up in trouble are the unlucky folks around him. Who knows how many folks he’s driven crazy so far?”</p>
 <p>Hou Xiaomei thought back to all of the past events Bai Xiaochun had been involved with, and smiled. Finally, she took a deep breath. Eyes filled with determination, and cheeks flushed, she decided that she had to work hard at her cultivation. Without doing that, there wasn't any hope at all of anything happening between her and Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>As stories of Nightcrypt spread, Bai Xiaochun was sitting by the blood cistern, working on his cultivation. With the help of the strong blood qi in the area, he was already working on the second level of the Undying Heavenly King.</p>
 <p>By now, more than half of the Heavenspan River water had merged into his first spiritual sea. Before long, the process would be complete.</p>
 <p>That would signify that he had begun to break through from early Foundation Establishment. It would also represent another step of progress with his Human Controlling Grand Magic. At that point, he would be able to experiment in ways that he had only been able to dream about before.</p>
 <p>Although he hadn’t come across an opportunity to use his Heavenspan Dharma Eye, he was confident that when he opened it, it would be even more powerful than before.</p>
 <p>Then there was his Mountain Shaking Bash. He continued to practice with it, which caused booming sounds to echo around his immortal's cave as he grew more and more familiar with it.</p>
 <p>He didn’t give up on his work with protomagnetic power either. Although he hadn’t mastered it, he was convinced that it was an extraordinary magic, and his heart thumped with anticipation at being able to use the powers of gravity and repulsion.</p>
 <p>“If I could completely come to understand it, then if someone stronger than me was chasing me, I could just wave my finger, and they wouldn't be able to get close. As for anyone weaker than me, I could just wave my hand, and they would fly toward me.” When he thought about that, his eyes glittered like diamonds.</p>
