<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>When Bai Xiaochun’s face appeared up in the air, the Master Cloud Lightning whom Bai Xiaochun had not yet encountered happened to be flying along through the swamp in another location, his expression very grim.</p>
 <p>When he sensed the deva fluctuations rolling out, his eyes flashed with cold light.</p>
 <p>He was essentially the older brother of the twin Master Cloud Lightnings, who had once existed as one person with one body. Although a cultivation accident had split them into two, their minds were still connected, and they could communicate with each other via a secret magic.</p>
 <p>The older brother already knew about everything which had occurred between Bai Xiaochun and his other half. As the fight had been playing out, he was in the plains area, separated from the desert by the swamp.</p>
 <p>At that time, he had been too far away to be of any help, but had immediately begun to race toward the desert. Now that he was here in the swamp, and had suddenly detected Bai Xiaochun’s aura, he called out to his younger brother via their secret magic.</p>
 <p>“Bai Xiaochun is in the swamp! Hurry over, and we can fuse together and kill him!”</p>
 <p>The younger of the twin Master Cloud Lightnings was just about to leave the swamp and enter the plains. However, upon receiving the message, his eyes flashed angrily, and he turned and headed back into the swamp.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaochun was shooting like a meteor toward Big Fatty Zhang.</p>
 <p>Because they hadn't been very far apart to begin with, his aura was already able to descend on the area around Big Fatty Zhang.</p>
 <p>As it did, the huge spider that had just risen up suddenly shivered. From the look in its eyes, it apparently viewed Big Fatty Zhang as being special for some reason. Ignoring the pressure from Bai Xiaochun, it leaped into the air, howling as it shot toward Big Fatty Zhang.</p>
 <p>Shocked, Master Lightning Origin and his companions fell back. However, before they could move very far, the spider shot out several strands of black silk, which wrapped around the entire group. Blood sprayed out of Big Fatty Zhang’s mouth as he was then dragged down into the waters of the swamp.</p>
 <p>Master Lightning Origin and his companions reacted with utter despair, and struggled to free themselves, but were unable. Just like Big Fatty Zhang, they were dragged down. At the same time, black mist began to pulse on all of their faces. From the way it wriggled and writhed, it almost looked like they were covered with black spiders.</p>
 <p>Big Fatty Zhang was the weakest of the group, and was the most adversely affected. He immediately passed out, whereas the more powerful cultivation bases of Master Lightning Origin and his companions enabled them to fight back a bit longer.</p>
 <p>As the spider sank down into the swamp and dragged Big Fatty Zhang and the others with it, a sound like heavenly thunder burst through the air. Bai Xiaochun’s enraged face appeared up above, and shouted, “How dare you!!”</p>
 <p>The swamp below immediately sank down because of the pressure, revealing Big Fatty Zhang and the others.</p>
 <p>As for the huge spider, it shivered and tried to escape.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaochun’s expression distorted as he transformed into a beam of light that shot down toward the depression in the swamp.</p>
 <p>At the moment, Bai Xiaochun wasn’t thinking at all about conserving spiritual energy or the power of his fleshly body. Waving his hand, he sent his flying shuttle whooshing out in front of him.</p>
 <p>The shuttle sent the swamp water shooting out in all directions, simultaneously destroying countless leeches and larvae. By this point, Big Fatty Zhang and the other captives were completely out in the open, albeit tied up with black silk.</p>
 <p>Without any hesitation, he grabbed the silk attached to Big Fatty Zhang and yanked him upward. That in turn caused the huge spider to be pulled up out of the swamp, to hang in midair.</p>
 <p>The spider stared at him with hateful, crimson eyes. Aware that it couldn’t escape, it sprayed a huge amount of black silk at him.</p>
 <p>“Have a death wish?!” Bai Xiaochun shouted angrily. Back before he had arrived, it might have made sense for the spider to ignore him. But now that he had unleashed the power of his cultivation base, it made sense for the spider to give up on its prey. And yet, it went beyond that and attacked him.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun was not happy at all that it had tried to take Big Fatty Zhang away so forcefully, and the matter was even worse considering the black spider marks on Big Fatty Zhang’s face, which were clearly venomous. Although many people would be unable to assess such a bizarre poison, as a grandmaster of the Dao of medicine, Bai Xiaochun instantly realized that it was a type of venom which affected the soul!</p>
 <p>And its function… was to kill the host!</p>
 <p>Eyes flashing with cold light, Bai Xiaochun performed an incantation gesture, sending his flying shuttle forth to sever the silk threads that bound Big Fatty Zhang.</p>
 <p>At this point, the image of a crescent moon appeared in one of Bai Xiaochun's eyes. He was well aware that there were many entities in this swamp that should not be provoked, and that if a fight broke out, it needed to be ended quickly. Therefore, he called upon… the Sun-Moon Vast-Sky Incantation!</p>
 <p>The first level of the incantation involved summoning a moon. At the moment, he had cultivated the technique to the point where he could summon a partial moon. As he utilized the technique, a shocking crescent moon appeared up in the sky.</p>
 <p>Moonlight instantly spilled down in astonishing fashion, causing all of the lands to turn silver.</p>
 <p>When that light touched the black spider silk, it melted away. A look of shock and terror appeared on the spider’s face, and it tried to sink down further into the swamp. However, it was too slow! An image of a moon had already appeared on its back!</p>
 <p>“Fallen Moon!” Bai Xiaochun growled. Brilliant light shot down from the moon onto the spider, causing the moon mark on its back to expand rapidly. An agonized shriek could be heard from the spider as the moon symbol dug deep into it. The spider trembled, and then green, viscous fluid began to seep out from inside of it. Then, even as it hoped to try to escape into the swamp, it exploded!</p>
 <p>It had been destroyed in body and soul!</p>
 <p>Only when the spider died did the black marks on Big Fatty Zhang and the other cultivators vanish.</p>
 <p>Master Lightning Origin and his three companions had not yet lost consciousness, so they were able to see everything which had just happened. When they saw the traces of the venom vanish, they immediately turned and fled in three different directions, their faces as ashen as death.</p>
 <p>Never could any of them have imagined that chasing Big Fatty Zhang would end with a deva patriarch from the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect coming over in a fury.</p>
 <p>“You pick on my Eldest Brother and then think you can just leave?” There was no way Bai Xiaochun would simply let them escape. Pulling the still unconscious Big Fatty Zhang with him, he took a step forward and waved his finger, sending the flying shuttle shooting toward the first of the three cultivators from the north.</p>
 <p>A scream echoed out as, in the blink of an eye, the shuttle stabbed through the man, and then headed toward the second. After cutting down the second, it shot at high speed toward Master Lightning Origin.</p>
 <p>It was in this very moment that the enormous face of Master Cloud Lightning appeared up above in the sky.</p>
 <p>“Do you dare, Bai Xiaochun?!?!”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun was not surprised at all at the sudden appearance of Master Cloud Lightning, and in fact, had detected his impending arrival earlier. However, in his urgency to save Big Fatty Zhang, he had ignored him. Now, he glared up at the face and said, “Are you egging me on or something?! I absolutely hate it when people egg me on!”</p>
 <p>Without any hesitation, he sent the flying shuttle shooting forward with greater speed.</p>
 <p>Even if the monkey-like Master Lightning Origin had been more nimble, he wouldn’t have been able to dodge out of the way. Expression that of despair, he shrieked, “Master, save--”</p>
 <p>Before he could finish speaking, the flying shuttle stabbed through his forehead.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun hadn’t set out with the intention of killing these people. However, their actions would have led to Big Fatty Zhang’s death if he hadn't come to save him in the nick of time.</p>
 <p>The sight of his apprentice being killed caused Master Cloud Lightning to howl, “Bai Xiaochun!!”</p>
 <p>His face swirled together into a beam of light that shot directly toward Bai Xiaochun with deadly, destructive power!</p>
