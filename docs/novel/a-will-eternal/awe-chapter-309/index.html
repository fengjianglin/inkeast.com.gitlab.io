<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>“Profound Stream Sect, do you surrender?!” The words of the Blood Stream Sect’s arch-patriarch echoed out in all directions. Simultaneously, orders were passed down to the disciples. The giants powered by the Outer Sect disciples of the Spirit Stream Sect roared as they battered the spell formation, joined by the enormous blood spheres composed of Outer Sect disciples from the Blood Stream Sect.</p>
 <p>A huge boom rippled out from this first major attack. The cultivators inside the Profound Stream Sect’s city were having a difficult time continuing to power the spell formation, and were left trembling. And that was only from an attack by the Outer Sect disciples! The sheer numbers involved left the Profound Stream Sect cultivators’ cultivation bases in chaos.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the Outer Sect disciples shouted in unison: “Profound Stream Sect, do you surrender?!”</p>
 <p>Their voices were like thunder that rattled the hearts and minds of the Profound Stream Sect cultivators. Before they could even begin to do some breathing exercises to recover, a wave of refined corpses, gargoyles, war chariots and battle beasts charged forth in a second major attack.</p>
 <p>That attack was even more intense than the previous attack, and released even greater pressure than the previous one. The Profound Stream Sect cultivators felt as if their cultivation bases were about to be torn to pieces. Even the patriarchs were included. Everyone was well aware that the attacks leveled by the two sects would only continue to get stronger!</p>
 <p>Before they even had time to react, and almost concurrent with the second attack, the Inner Sect disciples of the two sects launched a third attack! The spell formation incarnations of the Spirit Stream Sect and the locust-like magic of the Blood Stream Sect formed together into something like a sharp sword which slashed toward the spell formation!</p>
 <p>“Profound Stream Sect, do you surrender?!”</p>
 <p>Their cry caused the entire city to shake. The spell formation shield distorted, and the Profound Stream Sect cultivators shook violently. Their cultivation bases couldn’t take much more. This third attack was even more powerful than the others, and many of the pale-faced cultivators inside the formation were even beginning to wither up.</p>
 <p>There was no chance for any of them to rest or recuperate for even a moment. Things weren’t over yet. Next came the Chosen and peak lords from the seven mountain peaks of the south and north banks of the Spirit Stream Sect, in the form of enormous spell formation giants. At their side were their contemporaries from the four mountain peaks of the Blood Stream Sect. A fourth powerful attack!</p>
 <p>This attack was completely different from the first three. It was like stabbing a dagger into the heart of a dying person. The spell formation trembled, and the cultivators supporting it from within all began to cough up blood. Yet again, there was no other choice for them but to allow the spell formation to shrink.</p>
 <p>Next came the spell formation giants from Mount Daoseed, including Bai Xiaochun’s. Joining them were the blood masters and elders from the Blood Stream Sect. Terrifying roars echoed out as they unleashed the fifth major attack!</p>
 <p>That attack unleashed power even greater than all of the previous attacks put together. Bai Xiaochun joined in the thunderous battle cry as the spell formation distorted, and then shrank down again. Mountains in the area crumbled, and the city seemed in grave danger of simply collapsing!</p>
 <p>More blood spilled out of the mouths of the cultivators powering the spell formation, whose Qi passageways were already significantly injured. Some of them were so withered that they had to be replaced. As that happened, the thunderous shout of the Spirit and Blood Stream Sects reached their ears.</p>
 <p>“Profound Stream Sect, do you surrender?!”</p>
 <p>The Profound Stream Sect cultivators’ hearts were pounding in their chests, but before they could pull themselves back together, a sixth major attack headed their way!</p>
 <p>That attack came from the well over 100 prime elders from both sects. They held nothing back as they unleashed the most powerful attack yet onto the spell formation!</p>
 <p>The spell formation rumbled as cracks spread out. It shrank down again, exposing the outer areas of the city. More cultivators inside coughed up blood, and many of them lapsed into unconsciousness.</p>
 <p>The main emotion in the minds of most cultivators in the city was despair! And yet, another attack was already incoming. The cultivation bases of the blood rippers and legacy echelon cultivators erupted. Trump cards were unleashed without hesitation. Visually, the seventh major attack looked like shooting stars slamming into the spell formation shield.</p>
 <p>BOOOOOOOOOMMM!</p>
 <p>The damage to the spell formation spread out even further. The walls of the city began to fall, revealing the exhausted, bitter Profound Stream Sect cultivators inside. Some of the cultivators who had been powering the spell formation were instantly destroyed in body and soul.</p>
 <p>The area covered by the spell formation shrank yet again, leaving many cultivators outside of its protection.</p>
 <p>Some of those cultivators had once been members of the Pill Stream Sect. They could only sit there silently with gritted teeth; they had no desire to be considered part of the Profound Stream Sect anymore.</p>
 <p>Then, the eighth major attack closed in!</p>
 <p>Six patriarchs of the Blood Stream Sect and four from the Spirit Stream Sect joined together for the eighth attack! They were like ten gods, and the mere sound of them unleashing their battle prowess was like thunder from the heavens.</p>
 <p>“Profound Stream Sect, do you surrender?!” The air shattered, and the ground quaked violently. As the attacks of ten patriarchs slammed into the spell formation, the patriarchs of the Profound Stream Sect roared and held nothing back to resist.</p>
 <p>Booms rang out constantly. More than half of the city was destroyed now, and all of the patriarchs of the Profound Stream Sect were left coughing up blood. Their faces were ashen, and their bodies withered. They looked older than before, and even Patriarch Crimsonsoul was staggering backward, blood spraying out of his mouth.</p>
 <p>It was in that moment that the remnants of the Pill Stream Sect unleashed their own powerful attack. A huge pill furnace smashed into the spell formation shield, and the tens of thousands of cultivators behind it attacked with suicidal abandon. Another powerful shout filled the air.</p>
 <p>“Profound Stream Sect, do you surrender?!”</p>
 <p>One of the cultivators within the Pill Stream Sect was a young woman with a gauzy white veil. Her facial features were obscured, but her eyes were visible, and they were spectacularly beautiful. Virtually all of the cultivators in the Pill Stream Sect were obsessed with her. Within that sea of people, she was like a pearl on a beach, resplendent and beautiful!</p>
 <p>Booms echoed out as the spell formation trembled. When the pill furnace slammed into it, a huge gap ripped open. Patriarch Crimsonsoul spread his arms wide, and the power of a great circle Nascent Soul cultivation base exploded out as he joined the scattered remnants of the Profound Stream Sect cultivators who were powering the spell formation.</p>
 <p>However, that was when Bai Xiaochun noticed something up in the air above the spell formation. His eyes went wide when he realized that he was looking at a very familiar monkey.</p>
 <p>The old monkey was holding an enormous staff raised overhead. Eyes flickering with an archaic light, as well as a dignity that could shake heaven and earth, he smashed the staff downward.</p>
 <p>“Profound Stream Sect, do you surrender?!” roared an ancient-sounding voice. The spell formation shook violently, and finally, exploded!</p>
 <p>A shockwave blasted out in all directions. Patriarch Crimsonsoul coughed up an enormous mouthful of blood. The other cultivators of the Profound Stream Sect were all soaked in blood from various wounds. At the same time, something shot into the city, something that moved so quickly it was impossible for anyone to see it clearly at first. Only when it landed on the altar in the middle of the city was it possible to tell that it was a rabbit!</p>
 <p>The rabbit’s eyes glittered with a mysterious light as it snatched the incense off of the altar and extinguished it!</p>
 <p>When that happened, the middle-aged man fighting the scarecrow suddenly vanished. Then the scarecrow looked down, radiating the terrifying energy that only the deepest reserve powers of a sect could. That energy locked down onto the wounded patriarchs of the Profound Stream Sect, making it impossible for them to even move.</p>
 <p>Everything happened almost too quickly to process. The monkey appeared, broke open the spell formation, then the rabbit extinguished the incense, and finally the scarecrow sent energy crushing down. It all happened within the space of a few breaths of time.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s eyes were wide as he stared at the rabbit on the altar. Suddenly, he got a very bad feeling....</p>
 <p>That was when Bai Xiaochun suddenly realized that numerous cultivators from the two sects were all vying with each other to enter the city. That was even true of the scattered remnants of the Pill Stream Sect on the other side, led by the young woman in the white veil. Bai Xiaochun slapped his thigh.</p>
 <p>“Battle merit! Whoever gets into the city first will get a big reward!” Suddenly inspired, he roared and shot off at top speed. Bruiser seemed to understand exactly what he was thinking, and gave him a push off. Bai Xiaochun flew forward, wings flapping, blasting across the battlefield like a meteor. He immediately passed everyone else, and then quickly stepped onto the shattered city wall.</p>
 <p>“Profound Stream Sect, are you going to surrender?!” The echo of his shout caused Patriarch Crimsonsoul’s heart to fill with bitterness. He looked around at the Profound Stream Sect cultivators, and then over at Bai Xiaochun. He knew that after surrendering, he would have to come up with a method of resolving the differences between the two of them. Even as his eyes flickered, the other patriarchs clasped hands and bowed to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>“We surrender!”</p>
 <p>Everything went quiet for a moment, and then cheering erupted from the Spirit and Blood Stream Sects. The Profound Stream Sect cultivators sighed, and Bai Xiaochun’s eyebrows shot up and down in excitement. Sticking his chin up, he waved his sleeve and proudly said, “With the snap of a finger, I, Bai Xiaochun reduced the Profound Stream--”</p>
 <p>Before he could finish speaking, a little turtle head popped out of his bag of holding and looked up at him. The turtle sighed.</p>
 <p>“Ah, it’s been a long time since I've heard someone blow their own horn so loudly.”</p>
