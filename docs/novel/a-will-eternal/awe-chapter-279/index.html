<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Bai Xiaochun looked out at the Blood Stream Sect, at all of the familiar faces. Song Que was there, as were Song Junwan, Xu Xiaoshan, Jia Lie, Master God-Diviner, the three blood masters, and others.... There was also the Song Clan patriarch and Patriarch Limitless, within the blood clouds.</p>
 <p>The only person he didn’t see in the crowd was Xuemei.</p>
 <p>However, there was no time to think about her right now. At the moment, the sea of blood was only about 15,000 meters away from the Luochen Mountains.</p>
 <p>At this distance, he could see the murderous expressions on the faces of all the Blood Stream Sect cultivators. He saw the killing intent in Song Junwan’s eyes, and he saw how the gazes of the Song Clan patriarch and the others in the blood cloud flashed like lightning. Clearly, all of them were ready to kill and ready to die.</p>
 <p>It was in that moment that the light of spell formations rose up from the Spirit Stream Sect. The giants roared, and the hundreds of war chariots emitted blinding light as they vibrated on the verge of springing into motion.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun looked over and spotted Big Fatty Zhang in one of the giants, and although he couldn't quite see his face, based on what he knew of him, he knew that it was covered with a ferocious expression.</p>
 <p>Lightning danced in the air above the Spirit Stream Sect forces, and the magical symbols glowed with dazzling light. The seventeen stars that were the legacy echelon cultivators floated there majestically, and the prime elders were already preparing their divine abilities.</p>
 <p>The founding patriarch slowly raised his right hand. When it fell... they would attack in full force!</p>
 <p>The host of cultivators from the Blood Stream Sect was just as prepared. Within the blood cloud, the arch-patriarch, the old man in giant form, stared at the Luochen Mountains, his eyes glinting with ferocious light. Clearly, he was on the verge of giving the final order to attack!</p>
 <p>The distance between the two armies grew shorter and shorter. 15,000 meters. 9,000 meters... 6,000 meters... 3,000 meters!</p>
 <p>The fighting would break out at any moment!!</p>
 <p>The founding patriarch’s arm was just about to fall. The arch-patriarch’s mouth opened to speak.... And within the dantian region of the ninth formation’s giant incarnation, Bai Xiaochun could be seen, his eyes completely bloodshot, his heart twisting with anxiety.</p>
 <p>He did not want these two sects to go to war, nor did he wish to see people die. From a young age until now, all he cared about was living forever. He wanted to keep on living, and he wanted all the people he knew to keep on living with him.</p>
 <p>His anxiety began to turn into madness, and in that moment of deep apprehension, he howled a howl that could shake heaven and earth. He had already decided it was time to put his life on the line. Just as the two sides were about to clash... he shot out alone from within the ninth formation giant!</p>
 <p>Nobody could ever have anticipated that he would fly out alone in such away. In the heat of the moment, when everyone was focused completely on the fighting which was about to take place, no one could have imagined that they would see Bai Xiaochun flying out of the ninth formation in a beam of light, a pair of wings fluttering at his back as he sped out of the Luochen Mountains!!</p>
 <p>The glowing shield that protected the Luochen Mountains was designed to defend against the Blood Stream Sect, and would do nothing to members of the Spirit Stream Sect!</p>
 <p>Before anyone could react, Bai Xiaochun was hovering in the air outside of the Luochen Mountains!</p>
 <p>Everyone in the Spirit Stream Sect was completely and utterly shocked, and immediately began to cry out in alarm.</p>
 <p>Big Fatty Zhang’s eyes went wide, and his mind spun. He simply couldn’t imagine what Bai Xiaochun was doing flying out alone.</p>
 <p>“Xiaochun, what are you doing?! Get back here!!!”</p>
 <p>Hou Xiaomei was in one of the giants, and as soon as she saw what was happening, a tremor ran through her, and she screamed, “Big bro Xiaochun, you....”</p>
 <p>Third Fatty Hei and Xu Baocai both gasped, and their eyes went wide. They almost felt like their minds were being struck by lightning. Zhou Xinqi was in control of one of the spell formation giants, and although she almost couldn’t believe what was happening, she cried, “Bai Xiaochun....”</p>
 <p>Li Qinghou was one of the legacy echelon cultivators high up in the air, shining like a star. However, when he saw Bai Xiaochun fly out into the open, his eyes went wide as if with madness. “What are you doing, Bai Xiaochun?!?!”</p>
 <p>He wasn't the only one who almost went crazy. Sect Leader Zheng Yuandong reacted with a similar shout of anger, and even the founding patriarch gasped in disbelief.</p>
 <p>Ghostfang, Beihan Lie, Xu Song and all the other Chosen were dumbstruck. A tremor ran through Shangguan Tianyou, and at the same time, a spark of joy flickered in his heart as he realized that Bai Xiaochun would almost certainly be killed.</p>
 <p>All of this takes some time to describe, but from the instant that Bai Xiaochun flew out until the crowd reacted, only a moment passed. Even as everyone gaped in shock, Li Qinghou and the patriarchs prepared to fly out and retrieve Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>Out beyond the border of the mountains, right between the two sects, Bai Xiaochun roared, “Stop! No fighting, everyone! Listen to me!!”</p>
 <p>Despite his words, no one seemed inclined to stop. Furthermore, it only took a moment for the shocked members of the Blood Stream Sect to realize who they were looking at.</p>
 <p>“Bai Xiaochun!!” Song Que was the first. Madness rose up in his eyes, and threw his head back and laughed uproariously. Without any hesitation, he launched into motion. “Have a death wish, huh? Allow me to make your wish come true!!”</p>
 <p>Song Que wasn’t the only one to react in such a way. More Blood Stream Sect disciples recognized Bai Xiaochun, and were instantly delighted. Roaring with laughter, they all charged in his direction.</p>
 <p>“Is this Bai Xiaochun a complete moron, or what? I can’t believe he flew out alone!”</p>
 <p>“It doesn’t matter why, and it doesn’t matter if it’s a trap, I'm gonna kill him!”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha! Bai Xiaochun’s in the open now, and he’s not gonna make it back alive!” Numerous figures flew out from the Blood Stream Sect. As for the blood masters near the boundless darkness, they had already discussed among themselves how to kill Bai Xiaochun during the fighting. However, they knew that, considering how important he was to the Spirit Stream Sect, it wasn’t likely they would have a chance to fight him alone.</p>
 <p>And yet, Bai Xiaochun had just foolishly flown out by himself, only to shout infantile words about stopping and not fighting. Laughing at the tops of their lungs, the three blood masters flew out as quickly as bolts of lightning.</p>
 <p>Even Song Junwan was spurred into action. Master God-Diviner, Jia Lie, and numerous others were all striving to be the first to attack Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>“Kill Bai Xiaochun!!”</p>
 <p>The two armies weren’t very far away from each other to begin with, placing all the people who wanted to kill Bai Xiaochun very close. As that happened, the Song Clan patriarch laughed.</p>
 <p>“Very amusing,” he said, taking a step forward. Just as he was about to attack and kill Bai Xiaochun, the Spirit Stream Sect’s Patriarch Ironwood teleported out to block his path.</p>
 <p>Rumbling sounds could be heard as Patriarch Limitless flew out, and yet, Patriarch Li Zimo gave a cold snort and rushed to block him.</p>
 <p>The Spirit Stream Sect’s founding patriarch flew out with a grim face and a murderous aura. His intention was to grab Bai Xiaochun and bring him back behind the shield, but before he could get close, a teleportation interrupted him as the Blood Stream Sect’s arch-patriarch appeared in front of him!</p>
 <p>No words were spoken. Everyone immediately unleashed attacks. Countless giants sprang out from the Luochen Mountains, driven by Hou Yunfei and other friends of Bai Xiaochun. They along with Li Qinghou all had one goal: <em>save Bai Xiaochun!</em></p>
 <p>“Bai Xiaochun, get back here!!”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun could see that his words were being completely ignored. The patriarchs were already starting to fight, and the Blood Stream Sect army was moment away.</p>
 <p>There he was in the middle of the battlefield, watching as both sides prepared to slam into each other. As for the cultivators who were coming to try to kill him, they were only about 300 meters away. Jia Lie was using some unknown method to fly at incredible speed, putting him among the closest of the group.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun was starting to get very nervous. Eyes shining madly, and clearly throwing caution to the wind, he roared at the Blood Stream Sect cultivators, “Back down, all of you!!”</p>
 <p>In response the Blood Stream Sect cultivators laughed at the tops of the lungs.</p>
 <p>“Bai Xiaochun, I was under the mistaken belief that you were a true Chosen, but it turns out that you’re just a lunatic!”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha! I can’t believe you think we're going to retreat! Who do you think you are?”</p>
 <p>“Bai Xiaochun, you might be the Heaven-Dao Foundation Establishment cultivator of the Spirit Stream Sect, but on this battlefield, you’re going to be a corpse in a matter of moments!”</p>
 <p>After hearing Bai Xiaochun’s words, the three blood masters were convinced that he was a complete madman....</p>
 <p>Jia Lie threw his head back and laughed uproariously, pushing forward with even greater speed. He didn't necessarily want to be the person to kill Bai Xiaochun; he just wanted to be the first to land an attack on him. What a great story that would make in the future!</p>
 <p>“Are you kidding me?” Jia Lie cried. “You Spirit Stream Sect scoundrel! What gives you the right to tell us what to do?”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s face was grim as he stared at the incoming Blood Stream Sect cultivators. Slapping his bag of holding, he produced his Nightcrypt mask. Flicking his sleeve, he said, “What gives me the right? I'm the blood master of Middle Peak!”</p>
 <p>Those words brimmed with murderous intentions, with veins of steel, with madness, with devilishness. As he placed the mask onto his face, a shocking aura erupted out to fill the world!</p>
