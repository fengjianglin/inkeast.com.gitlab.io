<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Bai Xiaochun's words echoed out, shaking everything in the ancestral land. Up in the sky, an enormous vortex was forming that almost seemed to represent the fury of the heavens.</p>
 <p>The ancestral mountain was shaking violently, with rocks and debris tumbling down everywhere. As for the clan members who still stood on the mountain, they were so shocked they couldn’t even think straight, and were merely watching events play out with their jaws hanging open!</p>
 <p>This was a case of brothers trying to kill each other!!</p>
 <p>One was the qilin son of the Bai Clan, the other was a bastard son. One had once been a blazing sun, while the other had been a bug!</p>
 <p>But now, everything had been turned around. The qilin son was the bug, and the bastard son was the blazing sun!</p>
 <p>Although Bai Xiaochun wasn’t incredibly tall, as he stood in front of Bai Qi, he seemed to blot out the violet sky, and to make the crimson sun up above grow dark!</p>
 <p>The sight of a single person surpassing the sky and blocking the sun created an image that caused the observing members of the Bai Clan to devolve into further shock. Members of the direct bloodline and auxiliary bloodlines alike were so astonished they forgot to breathe, and their minds were struck motionless.</p>
 <p>Bai Lei’s scalp was tingling so hard it felt like it might explode, and the fifth young lady’s eyes were blank with astonishment. What Bai Xiaochun was doing right now was something they would never be able to forget for the rest of their lives. No matter how many years passed, they would never be capable of blotting out this memory.</p>
 <p>“Don’t push things too far, Bai Hao!!” The despair in Bai Qi’s eyes had reached an indescribable level, and he was seemingly paralyzed. He wanted to fight back, but the pressure weighing down on him from Bai Xiaochun made it impossible. It was like facing a windstorm of such epic power that it left him completely powerless.</p>
 <p>It didn’t matter that he was in the great circle of Core Formation. It didn’t matter that he was the qilin son of the Bai Clan. To stand in front of Bai Xiaochun was like standing in terror at the gates of the underworld.</p>
 <p>Taking a step back, Bai Qi screamed, “If you kill me, the Bai Clan will never rest until they find you! You won’t be able to get away from them! No matter how big the Wildlands are, you’ll never escape!!”</p>
 <p>Terror and fear gripped Bai Qi’s soul, driving him into madness as he cried, “Don’t be rash, Bai Hao! We can talk things over! I'm... I'm your big brother!!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Who cares?!” Bai Xiaochun said, his voice exploding like thunder from the highest heavens. With that, he reached out with his right hand, the mere movement of which caused the violet sky and the red sun to distort as his energy skyrocketed, bursting past his previous level with explosive intensity!</p>
 <p>RUUUUUUUUUUMBLE!!</p>
 <p>The lands around him quaked violently as massive energy began to build up; it was almost as if the entire ancestral land was being crushed!</p>
 <p>And the hand to do the crushing... was the very hand which Bai Xiaochun had just reached out with!</p>
 <p>Everyone on the mountain was deafened, and their eyes went blank. No soul and no mind could go unaffected by that hand!</p>
 <p>They weren’t the only ones to be affected. The clan members outside of the stone gate were all astonished, and Madam Cai was screaming her head off.</p>
 <p>“Stay your hand, Bai Hao!!”</p>
 <p>The clan elders were reeling in shock, their auras destabilized by the sight of Bai Hao raising his hand toward the ashen-faced, screaming Bai Qi.</p>
 <p>Everyone else in the clan was equally shocked. All eyes, all streams of divine sense, were focused on the screen, and the image of Bai Xiaochun!</p>
 <p>“Is that... really Bai Hao...?”</p>
 <p>“That palm... it....”</p>
 <p>“Bai Hao... is turning traitor!!”</p>
 <p>The clan chief was going mad, raving and raging as he battered the stone gate and its spell formation. Tears of blood leaked out of the corners of his eyes as he was forced to watch helplessly as his son was about to be killed.</p>
 <p>“I'm going to skin you alive, Bai Hao!” he shrieked. As of this moment, he was no longer a clan chief, but rather, a father.</p>
 <p>And yet, despite everything, he couldn’t forget... that he wasn’t just Bai Qi's father, he was... Bai Hao’s father too!!</p>
 <p>As the Bai Clan reeled in shock, something else was happening in a hidden chamber in the catacombs beneath the clan. Within that secret chamber, seven wrist-thick candles were spread out in a circle, and were burning with green flame.</p>
 <p>In the middle of the circle of candles, a wrinkled old man sat cross-legged in meditation. He was little more than skin and bones, with a virtually hairless head, and looked almost like he had just crawled up out of the grave.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the old man’s eyes opened, and began to glow with the light of the sun and the moon. It was an oppressive glow that, if anyone could see it, would immediately make them forget about everything except the man’s eyes.</p>
 <p>The old man slowly looked up, and his vision passed through the earth and soil until he could see Bai Qi and Bai Xiaochun on the screen on the stone gate.</p>
 <p>The old man didn’t even bother to look closely at Bai Qi. Instead, his eyes came to focus on Bai Xiaochun....</p>
 <p>His voice sounded like bones rubbing against bones as he murmured, “With latent talent like that... and that aura... he’s much more suitable than Bai Qi to be my next incarnation....”</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, back in the ancestral land, Bai Xiaochun’s soaring energy filled all heaven and earth, making him the complete focus of all attention!</p>
 <p>Although his hand was not physically large, it seemed powerful enough to wipe away everything in existence! It was so strong it could destroy the sun and moon, rip apart the ancestral mountain, and shatter all the lands!</p>
 <p>As Bai Qi watched that hand rising up, it was as if the violet sky vanished, and the crimson sun disappeared. To Bai Qi, Bai Xiaochun’s hand became the will of the heavens, and the only thing that existed in the entire ancestral land! To Bai Qi, that hand became the representation of death itself!</p>
 <p>His eyes felt like they were going to explode, and his blood didn’t even seem capable of pumping through his veins. “Don’t tell me you’re going to turn traitor against the clan, Bai Hao!?!?”</p>
 <p>He knew that outside, his father and mother were doing everything they could to break inside and save him.</p>
 <p>He also knew that hundreds of clan members on the mountain were all looking at him....</p>
 <p>But... none of that mattered. He was filled with the terrifying realization that nothing in heaven or earth could possibly save him.</p>
 <p>Almost as soon as Bai Qi mentioned turning traitor, Bai Xiaochun’s voice could be heard, responding with crushing volume that caused the air itself to vibrate!</p>
 <p>“So what if I turn traitor!?”</p>
 <p>As those words echoed out, Bai Qi's senses converged on one thing. It was as if all light, all energy, and everything else in the ancestral land had vanished, and the entire world consisted of one single palm.</p>
 <p>And then... the palm descended!!</p>
 <p>“No!!!” Bai Qi screamed hysterically. He was not willing to die, and definitely not willing to die by Bai Hao’s hand. His eyes were bloodshot, his hair in disarray, and his mind gripped by madness. Without any hesitation, he overdrew his cultivation base, using every scrap of energy he could find, and more, performing a double-handed incantation gesture that caused soul power to thrum within him.</p>
 <p>Then, he shoved out with both of his hands to fight back against Bai Xiaochun!</p>
 <p>However, such resistance was like a mantis trying to stop a war chariot. The palm descending onto him was backed by the power of all heaven and earth, and could crush anything in its path as easily as crushing dried weeds!</p>
 <p>The palm landed on Bai Qi’s head, destroying all resistance. Cracking sounds could be heard as his body began to fall apart, completely and utterly incapable of withstanding the blast of that palm!</p>
