<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Bai Xiaochun had been mentally reviewing all of the wonderful things he knew about to try to figure out more things to request, but before he could, he found himself being dragged away by Bai Lin.</p>
 <p>Even still, Bai Xiaochun was chuckling inwardly. He had demanded an exorbitant compensation moments ago, and would have been happy if only part of his requests had been fulfilled.</p>
 <p>Feeling very pleased with himself, he looked over at Bai Lin, the deadly crisis he had just endured still fresh in mind.</p>
 <p>“General, didn’t you just ask me if there was a way to make the pill furnace explosions even more powerful...?”</p>
 <p>“What?” Bai Lin replied, his pupils constricted. “Didn’t you say that was impossible?”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s eyes widened into a glare. “Impossible? What do you mean impossible? Of course it’s possible. Or at least, it could be!” Gritting his teeth, he continued, “All you want is a bigger explosion, right? It’s simple. Some time back, I actually caused a pill furnace explosion so big it almost leveled an immortal mountain! All the plants and vegetation were incinerated, and everything else was burned to a crisp!”</p>
 <p>As soon as Bai Lin heard this, his eyes began to shine brightly. He was completely obsessed with the exploding pill furnaces, and as such, he quickly asked, “What do you need? Just say the word!”</p>
 <p>“The specific medicinal pill formula is one aspect. But more important is the actual furnace involved. I need the same type of pill furnace they had back in the Blood Stream Sect. I'm not really sure how to explain it. Why don’t you have the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect send some people to the River-Defying Sect, and look for the grand elder of Lesser Marsh Peak in the Blood Stream Division? He can explain the details. Just have the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect make some similar pill furnaces based on his specifications!</p>
 <p>“Pill furnaces like that are especially strong, so the explosions they make are incredibly large!</p>
 <p>“Just don't forget that I’m from the River-Defying Sect, General Bai, so please make sure the representatives from the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect are a bit more polite than usual!”</p>
 <p>“No problem at all!” Bai Lin said enthusiastically. Laughing, he told Bai Xiaochun to go back to the Armory on his own, while he went back to discuss things with Song Yiduo.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun made his way back to the armory, his mood much better than before. By now, he had recovered from the sensation of deadly crisis. However, he couldn’t forget the ordeal he had just gone through, nor the icy killing intent he had seen in the eyes of the necromancer who had attacked him.</p>
 <p>“I can’t believe that the Wildlanders were willing to sacrifice over a hundred savage giants, three soul cultivators, and a necromancer, all to try to kill me....” As of that moment, he made the decision to never go up onto the Great Wall itself unless it was absolutely necessary.</p>
 <p>After all, once his new exploding furnace made its debut, and he started pumping out Soul Convergence Pills, the Wildlanders would hate him more than ever. Before long, his head would definitely fetch an astronomical price in the Wildlands.</p>
 <p>That thought left his heart stirring with fear and fury both.</p>
 <p>“I never wanted any of this,” he thought with a sigh. “But I guess there’s nothing I can do about it. We’re just on different sides, that’s all.” Then he thought about the fact that he would be leaving in ten years, and breathed a sigh of relief...</p>
 <p>“Might as well not worry about it. In ten years, I’ll be gone anyway. For now, I need to focus on battle credit, and even more importantly, getting myself into the great circle of the Gold Core stage. I also need to cultivate my Undying Live Forever Technique to completion. Once I do all that, I’ll be in a much better position.” After returning to the Armory, he went into secluded meditation and began to work on his cultivation.</p>
 <p>Seven days sped by in a blur. Bai Xiaochun himself had no idea how Bai Lin and Song Yiduo managed it all, but on the eighth day, the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect’s teleportation portal was activated, and a whole batch of supplies was sent to Great Wall City.</p>
 <p>That afternoon, Bai Lin came personally to Bai Xiaochun’s residence, and with the wave of his hand, sent a thousand pill furnaces rumbling down out of the sky.</p>
 <p>There were also numerous bags of holding, plus something completely new. There were ten shocking pill furnaces, each of which was fully 300 meters tall. When they descended from the sky and landed onto the ground, everything in the area shook violently.</p>
 <p>Dust blew out in all directions as incredible pressure weighed down. Zhao Long and all of the other soldiers under Bai Xiaochun’s command looked at the pill furnaces with complete shock.</p>
 <p>“Those... those are pill furnaces?”</p>
 <p>“Heavens! I've never seen a pill furnace that big before!!”</p>
 <p>“There’s no way those are pill furnaces. Those are some kind of powerful magical treasure! Look at what they’re made from! That’s the same stuff they make Nascent Soul-level battleships from. Deep sea meteoric iron!” Even as their cries rang out, Bai Xiaochun emerged from his meditative trance and walked out of his room. When he saw the pill furnaces out in the courtyard, he gasped just as loudly as everyone else.</p>
 <p>“Well, what do you think?!” Bai Lin said, laughing triumphantly. In order to procure all of these items, Bai Lin had been forced to beg for help from his grandfather, and had used every other method at his disposal. Furthermore, to produce these ten enormous pill furnaces, all of the power of the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect had been mobilized, and they had even called upon help from other parts of the eastern cultivation world.</p>
 <p>The River-Defying Sect had been completely shaken when an emissary from the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect arrived and respectfully asked many questions of them. At the same time, they got some news about Bai Xiaochun, leaving the entire River-Defying Sect very excited.</p>
 <p>“Those are all of the medicinal plants you requested,” Bai Lin continued, pointing at all of the bags of holding. “By the way, this is about the limit of my abilities to procure resources....”</p>
 <p>Feeling profoundly pleased, Bai Xiaochun rushed over to examine the bags of holding, his heart beating more rapidly with every moment. Within moments, his face was flushed with excitement.</p>
 <p>Although there were no Nascent Soul Pills or nine-colored flame fuel, there were ten Godly Vestige Pills, as well as all of the medicinal plants he had requested. Although there wasn’t a mind-bogglingly large number of them, everything he had asked for was present. Most importantly, the earthspirit tubers and other ingredients that could increase life force were all present in large numbers.</p>
 <p>Eyebrows raised in delight, Bai Xiaochun nodded repeatedly as he inspected the bags. Next, he walked over to inspect the pill furnaces, including the 1,000 ordinary furnaces, and also the ten 300-meter-tall ones.</p>
 <p>After examining the huge pill furnaces, Bai Xiaochun was delighted to find that in terms of quality, they actually exceeded the pill furnace he'd used on Lesser Marsh Peak. Furthermore, they could also be sealed even tighter; the surfaces were covered with spell formations for just that purpose.</p>
 <p>“Xiaochun, most of the things you requested are here. For the items that aren’t, give me some time to try to think of a way to get them. Right now, the most important thing to consider is that the biggest battle yet to be fought will be coming in the next few months!</p>
 <p>“Therefore, time is of the essence. You need to start producing Soul Convergence Pills as quickly as possible, and also work on those ten destructive furnaces!” With a final deep look at Bai Xiaochun, Bai Lin turned and left.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun rubbed his hands together, eyes shining as he circled around the ten huge pill furnaces a few more times. Finally, he threw his back and laughed.</p>
 <p>“Zhao Long. Liu Li. You and the rest of the battalion are going to help me make some unheard-of super-pills, the likes of which have never been seen before!” The 100 members of the battalion all voiced their agreement, whereupon the ten huge furnaces were set up in the middle of the courtyard, surrounded by the 1,000 ordinary furnaces in concentric rings.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, there were simply too many furnaces, so Bai Xiaochun waved his hand, issuing orders to his men to expand his residence. After tearing down and absorbing more of the nearby empty residences, he had a new courtyard that was fully 30,000 meters across, giving them more than enough space.</p>
 <p>The first furnaces he started to work with were the huge ones. Bai Xiaochun knew that they were extraordinary, and therefore, used ten times as many earthflame stones as usual. In fact, he even went to the length of putting some of the stones inside the pill furnaces themselves. He also added numerous medicinal plants that would cause violent explosions when they got hot enough. For each type of plant, he was liberal with his usage, adding in hundreds of portions.</p>
 <p>“All I want is an explosion, right? For concocting other types of medicines, I need to put a lot of thought into the formula, but for exploding furnaces, it's simple.” Brimming with self-confidence, he walked among the ten huge pill furnaces, adding medicinal plants in here and there, and even adding in some low-quality Soul Convergence Pills he had concocted in the past.</p>
 <p>He also added some of the other medicinal pills he had in his bag of holding that he didn't plan to use in the future. After a bit of thought, he also went so far as to add quite a few types of poison medicine....</p>
 <p>Still worried that the explosions wouldn’t be powerful enough, he gritted his teeth and added in many of the mystery pills he had concocted in the past, pills that he would never dare to consume.</p>
 <p>In the end, he had no idea exactly what type of bizarre medicinal pills would form within the furnaces, but the entire point was to make the ingredients inside of the furnaces unstable to the point where they would explode.</p>
 <p>Finally, he patted his hands in satisfaction.</p>
 <p>“That should do it,” he said, looking contentedly at the ten huge furnaces. By now, he very much looked forward to seeing what they would do when they finally exploded.</p>
 <p>Having accomplished these things, he rested a bit before beginning to work with the 1,000 ordinary pill furnaces.</p>
