<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>“You might qualify to tangle with demigods, Bai Xiaochun. But you certainly don’t qualify to prevent us from fighting!” Patriarch Starry Sky’s voice echoed like thunder from the highest heavens. His hand flashed with incantation gestures as he sent his Spear of the Starry Sky speeding closer and closer to Bai Xiaochun!</p>
 <p>The air around Bai Xiaochun couldn’t withstand the force, and shattered, and even the land far beneath him began to quake.</p>
 <p>No one on the battlefield uttered a single word. Everyone was looking up to see what would happen. Meanwhile, Bai Xiaochun took a slow breath, and the burning, blood-colored glow in his eyes began to intensify. At the same time, his energy began to rise!</p>
 <p>Rumbling sounds filled the air, and his hair whipped about him, making him seem like a god of battle. Directly facing the enormous spear… he extended his right hand!</p>
 <p>“Like I said. Time will tell whether or not I can beat you into submission.” With that, he violently clenched his hand into a fist.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the moon sigil in his left eye shone with dazzling light, and the sun mark in his right eye blazed to life. With his Cloud Lightning Forefather incarnation, and the full power of his fleshly body and cultivation base at play… he had battle prowess that could transform the heavens and temper the earth!</p>
 <p>All of this takes a bit of time to describe, but happened in the mere blink of an eye. The Spear of the Starry Sky closed in with indescribable energy, until it was right in front of Bai Xiaochun!</p>
 <p>The spear was impossibly huge, fully 30,000 meters long. It radiated intense levels of energy that made it seem like countless heavenly mountains were about to crush Bai Xiaochun out of existence. In fact, it seemed strong enough to end the world. It was easy to imagine a scene in which that spear hit Bai Xiaochun and crushed him out of existence as easily as a dried weed.</p>
 <p>However, it was in that moment that, instead of backing up, Bai Xiaochun actually shot forward, becoming a meteor that headed directly toward the Spear of the Starry Sky.</p>
 <p>“Cloud Lightning Forefather… Sun-Moon Binary Brilliance!”</p>
 <p>A wild and barbaric aura erupted out of Bai Xiaochun, along with a howl that truly seemed to come from the forefather of all humanity. At the same time, each of his eyes shone with the brilliance of both a sun and a moon! Dazzling light erupted out as Bai Xiaochun… slammed into the Spear of the Starry Sky!</p>
 <p>The Giant Ghost King was visibly shaken, and Patriarch Starry Sky had a very serious expression on his face. The cultivators down below forgot to breathe as they watched the spectacular scene playing out up above!</p>
 <p>An indescribably loud boom echoed out, shaking everything in the entire area, and causing the air to vibrate in shocking fashion.</p>
 <p>BOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!</p>
 <p>The 30,000-meter-long Spear of the Starry Sky stopped in place. Then, cracks spread out across its surface, making it obvious from the very outset that it couldn’t sustain a single blow from Bai Xiaochun. However, it lasted for several breaths of time, during which the rumbling sounds grew more intense. Finally… the spear collapsed into pieces!</p>
 <p>Innumerable starry sparks showered out everywhere as Bai Xiaochun was thrown backward by the force of the impact. Blood oozed out of the corners of his mouth, and his chest was mostly caved in. His cultivation base was also in chaos, and his skin was covered with countless rips and tears.</p>
 <p>However, when he planted his foot in an attempt to stop his backward motion, the rips and tears in his skin closed up, and his chest was no longer caved in. He took a second step back, whereupon his cultivation base stabilized, and his fleshly body power was back at its peak.</p>
 <p>Then he took a third step, stopping his momentum and looking up. As he did, his energy surged mightily…. It was as if he hadn't even been hurt to begin with!</p>
 <p>Eyes glittering brightly, he looked at Patriarch Starry Sky, still surrounded by the cascades of shattered starlight.</p>
 <p>“That’s all you’ve got?” Bai Xiaochun said. Countless gasps could be heard from the congregated cultivators below, many of whom also cried out in shock….</p>
 <p>“He’s not hurt at all!!”</p>
 <p>“Heavens! This Bai Xiaochun… he recovered almost immediately from Patriarch Starry Sky’s divine ability!!”</p>
 <p>“This… this….”</p>
 <p>They weren’t the only shocked ones. The Giant Ghost King was equally stunned.</p>
 <p>He looked over at Bai Xiaochun, eyes wide with disbelief, completely taken aback by what he was seeing.</p>
 <p>“With regeneration abilities like that… who could possibly kill him?!”</p>
 <p>Patriarch Starry Sky was nearly overwhelmed by massive waves of astonishment, and immediately began to pant.</p>
 <p>As a demigod, he had been able to see how badly Bai Xiaochun had been injured by his spear. Although the destruction of the spear was not surprising, it was most certainly a shock to see Bai Xiaochun recover in the time it took to step backward a few times.</p>
 <p>It defied belief, and at the same time, cause fear to bubble up deep in his heart.</p>
 <p>“His battle prowess is that of a demigod, but… his regeneration abilities surpass even the Celestial’s!! Dammit, where did he get regeneration abilities like that!? I refuse to believe that he can keep doing it over and over! He has to have limits!” Patriarch Starry Sky stared at Bai Xiaochun through narrowed eyes as he rotated his cultivation base. A moment later, he threw his hand out, causing even more spectacular energy than before to fill the air.</p>
 <p>“So, you can stand up to the Spear of the Starry Sky. Very well, try this!” He bit his tongue and spat out a mouthful of blood, which exploded into a blood mist. After the blood mist merged into the starry sky above, the stars began to shine with such intensity that they seemed as bright as daylight!</p>
 <p>As the starlight spilled down, it converged upon itself into something ten times as majestic as the Spear of the Starry Sky. The energy which radiated out surpassed anything from before as… a 300,000-meter-long dragon appeared! It was… the Dragon of the Starry Sky!</p>
 <p><em>Roar!</em></p>
 <p>The dragon’s eyes shone like the most brilliant of heavenly bodies, shaking the entire sky as it looked in Bai Xiaochun’s direction and roared.</p>
 <p>As it began to speed toward him, Bai Xiaochun looked at it, his own eyes shining brightly.</p>
 <p>“Patriarch Starry Sky, it doesn’t matter what divine abilities you use on me. They’re all… useless!” With that, he strode forward, becoming a blazing meteor that shot toward the Dragon of the Starry Sky just as he had gone to meet the spear moments ago.</p>
 <p>As he blurred into motion, his right hand clenched into a fist, and he punched out. A black hole sprang into being, sucking in all of the power of his cultivation base and fleshly body. At the same time, a shadowy emperor appeared behind him.</p>
 <p>The emperor’s head seemed to touch the top of the sky, and his feet were planted firmly on the ground. All creation trembled violently, causing Patriarch Starry Sky’s face to fall.</p>
 <p>The domineering air which radiated out from that shadowy emperor was terrifying to the ultimate degree!</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s fist rocketed toward the Dragon of the Starry Sky, joined by the fist of the shadowy emperor!</p>
 <p>This was none other than… the Undying Emperor’s Fist!</p>
 <p>Mountain-toppling, sea-draining energy was unleashed onto the seemingly unkillable dragon, which let out a howl that shook the entirety of the Wildlands!</p>
 <p>The cultivators below were deafened, and their minds spun. Many began to cough up mouthfuls of blood.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the power of Bai Xiaochun’s fist strike was so incredible that, apparently, it neared the limits that governed the entire world. As a result, the very same world net appeared in the sky as had appeared during the battle between the gravekeeper and the Celestial!</p>
