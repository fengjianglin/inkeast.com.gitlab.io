<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Before Bai Xiaochun and his battalion could even reach the Great Wall, a blood-colored cloud suddenly appeared on the horizon, spreading out with incredible speed.</p>
 <p>Within the blood-red cloud were countless vengeful souls that looked quite different from the ordinary type. These souls were crimson, and seemed to contain something boundlessly evil.</p>
 <p>As they neared, the souls began to clump together into the shape of a head, fully 9,000 meters tall. It was the face of a young woman, complete with long, flowing hair and eyes that sparkled with sinister coldness. Astonishingly, that head radiated an energy that seemed capable of rocking both heaven and earth!</p>
 <p>Standing on the very top of the head was a young woman in a crimson garment, who was barely visible within the cloud. Although it was impossible to make out her features clearly, she radiated an aura that seemed to fuse with heaven and earth!</p>
 <p>The scene playing out was completely and utterly shocking!</p>
 <p>“Chen Hetian!!” the young woman cried in a voice that wasn’t loud, and yet echoed out in bizarre fashion, completely disregarding Great Wall City's spell formation to fill the entire city. Anyone who heard the voice would sense their mind spinning, and would feel as if they were drowning in a sea of blood. Virtually all of the cultivators of the five legions, including the ones inside the city, couldn’t help but scream in response.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun was leading his 100-man battalion up to the wall when the sound hit them all. His subordinates immediately found blood oozing out of their eyes, ears, noses, and mouths, and began to shriek in fear. Bai Xiaochun also began to tremble; it felt like two daggers were stabbing into his ears, and it was only because of the Heaven-Dao aura within his Gold Core that he was mostly unscathed by the sound.</p>
 <p>“A deva!” Bai Xiaochun gasped. At the same moment, the eye atop the enormous pagoda in the middle of the city suddenly cast bright light out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Although it wasn’t the dead of night at the moment, the sky was dark, casting all the lands into murkiness. Therefore, when the huge eye began to shine brightly, it made it look like a heaven-shaking, earth-shattering sun.</p>
 <p>As the light spread out, the cultivators in Great Wall City and on the wall itself quickly recovered from the effects of the deafening noise, which was rapidly driven out past the shield.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, an old man appeared within the huge eye, flashing through the air to appear high above Great Wall City. The instant he appeared, a ghost image sprang up resembling the entire city, which vanished moments later as he stepped out beyond the wall. “Back down Red-Dust, you she-devil!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>That old man was none other than Chen Yueshan’s father and Zhao Tianjiao’s Master, Chen Hetian!</p>
 <p>He wore a long white robe, had a third eye on his forehead, and just like the young woman in red, seemed connected to both heaven and earth.</p>
 <p>Rumbling sounds echoed out as these two shocking forces appeared out in the open. In the blink of an eye, Chen Hetian had reached the blood cloud, and vanished inside. Moments later, muffled rumbles like the crash of thunder echoed out from inside, and the cloud itself began to churn and seethe.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun couldn’t help but gasp at the sight. Clearly, that young woman was a deva from the Wildlands, and the battle she was fighting with Chen Hetian was beyond that which ordinary cultivators could participate in.</p>
 <p>Moments later, Bai Xiaochun and the rest of his battalion recovered, and proceeded up to the Great Wall. The first thing they heard upon arriving were the booms and screams of the combat going on beyond the wall.</p>
 <p>There were more than 700,000 savages from over a hundred tribes out there, a mighty force that was so awe-inspiring that Bai Xiaochun’s eyes went as wide as saucers upon seeing them.</p>
 <p>So many vengeful souls were gathered that it was impossible to see the end of them; within their midst were the giants, who were equally innumerable.</p>
 <p>Based on the slight differences between them, these giants were clearly from more than a hundred different tribes, and interspersed among them as they charged toward the wall were numerous vicious beasts.</p>
 <p>The lands quaked because of their passage, and even the Great Wall itself seemed to be swaying back and forth.</p>
 <p>And that was just the land. Up in the sky were even more giants and vengeful souls, screaming through the air along with thousands of soul cultivators!</p>
 <p>Among those soul cultivators could be seen both men and women, all of them good-looking, but with cold expressions. They were people who could attack with vicious power, and at the same time, could control the savages among whom they were scattered!</p>
 <p>Further off in the distance were even more powerful figures, figures who were guarded closely by even more soul cultivators. Necromancers! Most of the necromancers wore dark robes, and with the single wave of a hand would send countless vengeful souls screaming out in front of them in devastating attacks.</p>
 <p>Even further off in the distance were five black altars hovering in midair. Black beams of light shot out from the five altars, connecting together in a pentagram-like sealing pattern. High up in the sky, the pentagram split the air and cracked it open, allowing numerous ghostly hands to stretch out from beyond, accompanied by cackling screams.</p>
 <p>Atop each altar was a wrinkled old man in a black robe, all of whom were chanting scriptures that caused the rifts overhead to widen.</p>
 <p>Those were merely the things Bai Xiaochun could see with his own eyes. The army was so huge that it was impossible to even see where it ended.</p>
 <p>The vast size of the army left Bai Xiaochun wondering if the Great Wall forces could even hold out against it. As he looked around, he could see various expressions on the faces of the cultivators of the five legions. However, none of them were expressions of fear, as if this enormous army were nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
 <p>It didn’t take long for the Great Wall’s shield to begin to ripple and distort, and then slowly begin to advance forward onto the battlefield. At the same time, the cultivators of the five legions began to break up into groups and charge forward to fight.</p>
 <p>At that point, Bai Xiaochun received orders from the colonel who was his commanding officer, instructing him to lead his troops into the fight.</p>
 <p>As the shield advanced across the battlefield, the forces of the Great Wall began to engage in close-quarters fighting with the Wildlanders.</p>
 <p>The savage giants were the least difficult of the enemy forces to deal with, considering that they weren’t very numerous. The vengeful souls which surrounded them didn’t fear being destroyed, and had always been the most troublesome. However, that was before Bai Xiaochun came to the Great Wall.</p>
 <p>As of this moment, it was to Bai Xiaochun’s surprise that cultivators of the five legions were already tossing out Soul Convergence Pills into the fight.</p>
 <p>Soon, the booms of exploding Soul Convergence Pill filled the air, as well as the shrieking of the vengeful souls who were sucked together in one place, and those who were destroyed in the secondary blast.</p>
 <p>Not only were the vengeful souls affected in devastating fashion, but the savage giants were also injured by the explosions, and were sent staggering backward with blood spraying out of their mouths.</p>
 <p>Even just one Soul Convergence Pill was powerful on its own, but to have more than a thousand exploding at the same time struck terror into the hearts of the Wildlands forces.</p>
 <p>Thus, the five legions were able to advance slowly but surely across the battlefield!</p>
 <p>In addition, the several thousand elite cultivators of the five legions were specifically targeting the soul cultivators and engaging them in deadly duels.</p>
 <p>The sounds of fierce fighting filled the battlefield, and although everything seemed chaotic on the surface, the truth was that the Great Wall forces had the advantage, both because of their shield, and because of the Soul Convergence Pills.</p>
 <p>As the shield inched across the battlefield, the five legions followed along, forcing the Wildlands savages to either retreat, or get stuck inside the shield to fight the cultivators, and eventually be cut down.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, because of how the cultivators of the five legions were well-disciplined and frequently rotated their forces up to the front lines and back, there were few casualties. It was really a terrifying situation for the enemy.</p>
 <p>It was the same on the ground and up in the air as well.</p>
 <p>As for the huge eye atop the pagoda, its gaze swept across the battlefield, killing giants and decimating vengeful souls, hewing furrows into the earth and sending powerful ripples through the sky.</p>
