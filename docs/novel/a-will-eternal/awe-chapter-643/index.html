<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>During the half a month that passed after Bai Xiaochun went from being a guard to a prisoner, Giant Ghost City changed. No longer was there a brooding pressure weighing down on the city. Instead, it once again became a hustling, bustling place. As far as most people were concerned, all of the rumors that had been spreading were just that: rumors.</p>
 <p>The three great clans continued to buy up all of the souls in Giant Ghost City, just like they had been before. Just about everything went back to normal. The only slight difference was that the ten great marquises of Giant Ghost City, who normally didn’t make very many public appearances, were now more commonly seen out in the city.</p>
 <p>From all outward appearances, there wasn’t anything happening in the city that was particularly noteworthy. As for the three great clans, their deva patriarchs all remained in secluded meditation, or at least, that was what the clans stated publicly.</p>
 <p>In secret, the three deva patriarchs were constantly looking up into the sky, as if... they were waiting for something.</p>
 <p>Another seven days went by, during which time the people of Giant Ghost City were as busy with their lives as ever. Meanwhile, beneath the moat, in Devil Penitentiary, Bai Xiaochun’s life was wonderful. Although he was technically a prisoner, he got special treatment in Cellblock D, to the point where things were almost exactly the same for him as when he had been a guard.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, because he was still the number one dark inquisitor, he continued to get interrogation requests from the other three cellblocks. And because he never failed to get information in an interrogation, his fame grew.</p>
 <p>Currently, the deputy warden and ten captains from Cellblock B were clustered around him, leading him in the direction of their cellblock.</p>
 <p>“Brother Bai Hao, you’re really doing us a favor here. That Lu Shiyou is a treacherous villain, and no matter what methods we use, we simply can’t get him to tell us where his loot is stashed.”</p>
 <p>“That's right, Brother Bai Hao. If you can get him to talk, we’ll give you thirty percent as your reward.” As the group chattered, they cast smiling glances at Bai Xiaochun. By this point, he was extremely famous, and all of the guards knew that getting on his good side was the path to riches and fortune.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun laughed heartily and said, “Ah, no problem at all, my brothers. All Cellblock B has to do is make the request, and I would do everything in my power to help, reward or not.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His way with words left the group from Cellblock B feeling very pleased. Of course, the traditions of Devil Penitentiary had to be maintained. Whether it was for tradition or to maintain a good relationship, they would give definitely give him a share no matter how polite he was up front.</p>
 <p>Before long, they were out of Cellblock D. Along the way, any guards they happened across would smile and call out a greeting to Bai Xiaochun. And of course, he would always return their greetings. That was simply how Bai Xiaochun did things. When people treated him well, he did the same in return, which always led to people feeling more and more pleased with him.</p>
 <p>Soon they were in Cellblock B, which wasn’t as big as Cellblock A, but was larger by far than Cellblock D. The cells there were also more impressive, and the prisoners inside them were far more brutal than the prisoners in Cellblock D.</p>
 <p>Before long, they came to a stop in front of one particular skull cell, whereupon the deputy warden politely said, “Well, here we are. Now it’s all up to you, Brother Bai Hao.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Nodding, Bai Xiaochun clasped his hands behind his back and looked at the cell, within which was a middle-aged soul cultivator who was none other than Lu Shiyou. Although the man seemed completely at ease, his eyes widened a bit when he saw Bai Xiaochun; after all, he had heard the rumors about the number one dark inquisitor.</p>
 <p>Lu Shiyou smiled, and then spoke in a soft voice, “You don’t need to waste your time with me. I’m not the tight-lipped kind. However, my cultivation base is ruined, and I'm dying. In fact, I won’t last for more than ten years. Therefore, I only have one demand that I'm sure Devil Penitentiary can meet, considering how powerful you people are. I want a hundred beautiful female cultivators per day to keep me comfortable. Ten years from now, when I'm on my deathbed, I’ll tell you all the details about my stash of loot.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun completely ignored his words. After having one of the guards open the cell door, he entered, and black smoke spread out in all directions.</p>
 <p>The guards of Cellblock B immediately got excited, whereas Lu Shiyou began to pant. Staring at Bai Xiaochun, he said, “What are you doing!? Just wait ten years! It’s not like I'm afraid of dying or something. If you don’t give me what I want, then I won’t say a word!”</p>
 <p>Clearing his throat, Bai Xiaochun said, “Look, let’s talk things over. You’ve heard of me, right? When I ask questions, I frighten even myself! What’s the point of trying to hold out?”</p>
 <p>Based on what the guards had told him on the way over, this Lu Shiyou had been a city guard before being locked up.</p>
 <p>In terms of why he had been incarcerated, he had no one to blame for the matter but himself. He was the type of person who would seek revenge over the smallest grievance, and would do everything in his power to kill people he didn’t like, then wipe out their entire family. He had also used his authority as a city guard to raid the headquarters of numerous small clans within the city and take away all their wealth. Over the years, he had built up quite an accumulation of fortune.</p>
 <p>If that were all there were to his vices, he might have been able to get away with it all. After all, his status as a city guard made him difficult to deal with. However, he was also a lecherous fellow, and had taken advantage of numerous women during his so-called ‘raids’. A few days before, he had forced himself on a female cultivator who happened to be connected to one of the marquises of Giant Ghost City. That was what ultimately led to his downfall. The enraged marquis had his cultivation base crippled, and instead of killing him, had sent him to be locked up in Devil Penitentiary.</p>
 <p>In Devil Penitentiary, a goldmine like him was the type that the guards would never let off the hook. However, because he knew he only had a short time to live, he kept making all sorts of demands in exchange for talking. Not only was Cellblock B unable to meet all of his demands, but they didn't want to wait ten years, and thus, had asked for help from Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>Backing up a few steps, Lu Shiyou loudly said, “There’s no need to talk anything over!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun sighed. So far, he hadn't run into a single prisoner in Devil Penitentiary who had been willing to cooperate. Shaking his head, he patted his bag of holding in very practiced fashion to produce an Aphrodisiac Pill. After crushing it, he sent the resulting powder flying over to Lu Shiyou, who couldn’t prevent it from entering his mouth and nose.</p>
 <p>Clasped his hands behind his back, Bai Xiaochun stuck his chin up and proudly said, “The people I interrogate always start out refusing to talk, but after a few hours, they won’t shut up.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even as the words left Bai Xiaochun’s mouth, Lu Shiyou eyes flickered angrily, and yet, that didn’t match the odd expression that appeared on his face at all.</p>
 <p>This was a completely different reaction than the prisoners usually gave when Bai Xiaochun performed interrogations. Not only did Lu Shiyou not seem to be in pain at all, but the odd look on his face only lasted for about ten breaths of time before he looked as normal as he had moments before. His skin was covered with a sheen of sweat, and his eyes were shining as he looked at Bai Xiaochun and said, “What happened? Do you have more?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He actually seemed a bit anxious, like someone might be when they were interrupted right in the middle of something vitally important.</p>
 <p>“Huh?” Bai Xiaochun blurted, shocked. This was his first time encountering a situation like this. Looking down at some of the residual medicinal powder in his hand, he briefly wondered if he had grabbed the wrong pill. However, after confirming that it was an Aphrodisiac Pill, he looked back up in at Lu Shiyou in disbelief.</p>
 <p>Eyeing the medicinal power in Bai Xiaochun’s hand, Lu Shiyou said, “Give me some more! Hurry up, give me more....”</p>
 <p>Beads of sweat popped out on Bai Xiaochun’s forehead at the oddness of the situation. Waving his hand, he sent the residual powder over to Lu Shiyou.</p>
 <p>Excited, Lu Shiyou leaped to his feet and swallowed the powder. A tremor then ran through him, and he leaned back against the cell wall, closing his eyes as if in intoxication. By this point, Bai Xiaochun’s scalp was tingling in shock, and he subconsciously stepped back a few paces, looking at Lu Shiyou as if he were a ghost.</p>
 <p>“What’s... what’s going on? It’s not working? He... he actually likes it?” Bai Xiaochun felt like his world was crumbling around him. Never could he possibly have imagined that someone would actually enjoy the effects of the Aphrodisiac Pill....</p>
 <p>“He's... a complete pervert!”</p>
 <p>Before Bai Xiaochun could recover from his shock, Lu Shiyou shivered. Other than being soaked with sweat, he had now gone completely back to his normal state. Opening his eyes, he shouted, “Do you have more? Give me more!”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun was so shocked by Lu Shiyou’s behavior that he was panting. However, his curiosity was also piqued, so he produced another Aphrodisiac Pill and threw it over.</p>
 <p>Lu Shiyou grabbed it excitedly and stuffed it into his mouth. Enough time passed for half an incense stick to burn, after which he madly yelled, “Give me another! No, give me three!!”</p>
 <p>A strange expression could be seen on Bai Xiaochun’s face as he produced another pill. If Lu Shiyou’s cultivation base hadn’t been crippled, then he would have attacked Bai Xiaochun to try to take it. At that point, Bai Xiaochun cleared his throat and awkwardly said, “Um... tell me where your loot is stashed, then I’ll give you another one.”</p>
