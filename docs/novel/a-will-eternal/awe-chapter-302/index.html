<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>The 300-meter-long sword seemed capable of slashing open the heavens. It was a dazzling arc of light that sliced through everything in its path, causing an intense screaming sound to fly across the battlefield.</p>
 <p>It almost sounded like the howling of armies of ghosts, a sound which struck down to the very soul. The four Profound Stream Sect cultivators who had just been about to kill Xuemei were completely shaken. They almost felt as if a huge hand had reached into their minds and crushed their brains into paste.</p>
 <p>They felt pain that ordinary people would never be able to withstand. It was only because of their powerful cultivation bases that they survived, and yet, blood oozed out of their eyes, ears, noses, and mouths. Looks of terror appeared in their eyes as they fell back at top speed.</p>
 <p>Without any consideration for what would happen as a result, they drew upon every drop of power their cultivation bases could provide, even drawing upon their life force!</p>
 <p>The greatsword which bore down on them filled them with a threatening sensation of deadly crisis that bordered on complete catastrophe!</p>
 <p>Time seemed to slow as the blood-colored greatsword descended. The first Profound Stream Sect cultivator it hit screamed, throwing all of the power of his cultivation base into his defense, along with a host of defensive treasures. However, the sword destroyed his treasures with ease, shattering them without pause. A moment later, the man’s head was sailing through the air.</p>
 <p>As for the rest of his body, the sword was so large that, instead of cutting him in half, it completely destroyed him, transforming him into nothing more than a mist of blood!</p>
 <p>His body, his soul, even his bag of holding and everything in it, were all completely destroyed!</p>
 <p>The second and third cultivators let out more bloodcurdling screams as they too were reduced to nothing more than clouds of blood.</p>
 <p>The last of the Foundation Establishment cultivators had the most powerful cultivation base, and was higher ranked than the others. Currently, his eyes were completely bloodshot, and he was trembling with madness. As the greatsword closed in on him, he produced a jade slip, which glowed with flickering light as the power of teleportation appeared.</p>
 <p>All of this is lengthy in word, but happened in the time it takes a spark to fly off of a piece of flint. At the same time, Bai Xiaochun’s blood-colored greatsword slashed down toward the man.</p>
 <p>The sight of the sword slicing through the air was so dazzling that even the blood rippers, legacy echelon cultivators, prime elders, and patriarchs of the three sects were all taken aback.</p>
 <p>They had just seen three Foundation Establishment cultivators from the Profound Stream Sect killed in body and soul, and now the last one was trying to teleport away from the very same blade which had killed his fellows.</p>
 <p>The man vanished, and the greatsword slammed into the ground beneath the spot he had just occupied. Everything shook, and cracking sounds could be heard as rifts snaked out for 300 meters in every direction.</p>
 <p>The final cultivator had vanished without a trace....</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun heaved a sigh of relief. Ignoring the man who had escaped, he turned to look at Xuemei. Blood dripped down from behind her mask as she looked back at him, mixed emotions in her eyes. A moment later, she collapsed into unconsciousness.</p>
 <p>Immediately, Blood Stream Sect disciples rushed over to catch her, then led her off.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun could see that she had been seriously injured, but not mortally so. Considering how important she was in the sect, she would definitely get the best spirit medicine the Blood Stream Sect had to offer.</p>
 <p>He had a million things he wanted to say to her, but he knew that they would have to wait until the war was over. However, he was still excited by one fact. “This time, you’re not going to get to just go into secluded meditation to hide from me!”</p>
 <p>Relishing the thought, he turned and looked in the direction of the huge city.</p>
 <p>In the moment that he did so, the cultivator who had just teleported away suddenly materialized on the city wall. Fear lingered in his eyes, and he was out of breath, but his expression was vicious.</p>
 <p>“Bai Xiaochun, I’ll never forget this!” he roared. “You can't kill me that easily!! One day when you’re not expecting it, I’ll be there to kill you!!” Only by shouting something like that could he suppress the terror he felt because of the sword he had just faced, and Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>Taking a deep breath, he was just about to head down into the city when he realized that the other cultivators in the area were all looking at him with strange, shocked expressions.</p>
 <p>“What are you....” To the man’s surprise, he suddenly felt a piercing pain in his forehead. He reached up and touched his face, and his hand came a way wet with blood. A look of terror appeared in his eyes as a tremor ran through him. Before he could even finish speaking, his forehead began to split apart. Within the blink of an eye, his entire body collapsed onto the ground, cut in half!</p>
 <p>He had been just a bit too slow to teleport away, and the greatsword really had slashed through him in the moment before he fled....</p>
 <p>Blood splashed about in all directions, causing the surrounding Profound Stream Sect cultivators to shake madly with fear.</p>
 <p>As for the 10,000 cultivators surrounding Bai Xiaochun, after a moment of silence, they erupted into wild cheering.</p>
 <p>“Junior Patriarch!!”</p>
 <p>“Blood Lord!!”</p>
 <p>Their cries echoed out loud and clear. Even the cultivators off in the distance could hear them, and then they began to join in. Soon, all members of the Blood Stream Sect and the Spirit Stream Sect on the battlefield were shouting at the tops of their lungs.</p>
 <p>The bedraggled Profound Stream Sect had already been suffering setbacks. Then Bai Xiaochun showed up and killed four of their most powerful cultivators in quick succession. Almost immediately, large portions of the battlefield were affected....</p>
 <p>It was a key opportunity, and the patriarchs of the Spirit Stream Sect and the Blood Stream Sect immediately waved their sleeves and issued orders.</p>
 <p>“Bring the final battle to the Profound Stream Sect!!”</p>
 <p>“Everyone, on the offensive!!”</p>
 <p>In response, the prime elders, blood rippers, and legacy echelon cultivators took the lead, transforming into bright beams of light that shot forth into the fighting. Tens of thousands of cultivators down below advanced. It was like a sea of blood filled with the giants of the Spirit Stream Sect, surging forward, an unstoppable force that crushed anything in its path as easily as a boulder crushing a drinking glass!</p>
 <p>The ground quaked, and intense, fierce fighting instantly broke out everywhere. The Profound Stream Sect army trembled and fought back madly. Higher up in the air, the Profound Stream Sect patriarchs instantly realized that the reason all of this was happening was Bai Xiaochun!</p>
 <p>“If Bai Xiaochun dies, we can turn things around!!”</p>
 <p>“We have to kill Bai Xiaochun!!” Unfortunately for the Profound Stream Sect patriarchs, they couldn’t do anything against the combined Spirit and Blood Stream Sects. Their Core Formation cultivators were being locked down, and could not get anywhere close to Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>“Pay any price to take down Bai Xiaochun. Even sacrifice Foundation Establishment disciples if we have to!” As the orders went out from the patriarchs, the Profound Stream Sect cultivators on the battlefield had different reactions. Some hesitated, some shrank back. However, a good portion of the Foundation Establishment cultivators immediately charged toward Bai Xiaochun’s location.</p>
 <p>There were also several black puppets which roared and began to stride toward him. Meanwhile, there were sword formations up above that the Core Formation cultivators of the Spirit and Blood Stream Sects had mostly disregarded because of how easy they were to destroy. Now, those sword formations began to rotate and speed toward Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>Scalp tingling, Bai Xiaochun sprang into motion, barely dodging dozens of greatswords.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath. He had known that the battlefield was a dangerous place, but now he was even more convinced of that fact. Although he had avoided the first volley of greatswords, more sword formations were flickering up above, and vast numbers of Profound Stream Sect cultivators were charging toward him. Eyes turning bright red, he threw his head back and roared, “Die!!”</p>
 <p>He felt like he was back being chased by the Luochen Clan, or even in the Fallen Sword Abyss. A murderous aura spun around him as he launched himself toward one of the nearest black puppets. After slamming into it, he called up Violet Qi Cauldron Summoning, and then the Throat Crushing Grasp, which shot like lightning toward the puppet’s throat.</p>
 <p>A cracking sound could be heard as a tremor ran through the puppet. Its head was destroyed, and it staggered backward. However, Bai Xiaochun lunged forward, calling upon his fleshly body strength to grab it and hoist it over his head like a shield.</p>
 <p>In that instant, dozens of greatswords screamed down from above, stabbing into the black puppet in numerous locations. The black puppet exploded, and the Profound Stream Sect cultivators inside of it were all killed instantly.</p>
 <p>Panting, Bai Xiaochun burst into motion again, heading toward the city, followed by tens of thousands of cultivators.</p>
 <p>Enraged, he cried, “Follow me. Let’s take this city down!”</p>
