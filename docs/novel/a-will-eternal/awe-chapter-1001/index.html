 <p>The Dragon of the Starry Sky howled beneath the world net. Despite how powerful it was, it still felt like it was trembling on the verge of collapse.</p>
 <p>However, as it exerted control to keep its body intact, and even prepared to counterattack… Bai Xiaochun’s eyes flashed, and his regenerative powers kicked in. Instead of falling back in the face of the dragon, he clenched his fist and… in completely unprecedented fashion, unleashed another Undying Emperor’s Fist!</p>
 <p>After mastering the Undying Blood, Bai Xiaochun could tell that his Undying Emperor’s Fist was not limited in the way it had been in the past. Thanks to his regenerative powers… he could unleash it over and over again!</p>
 <p>Three punches. Four punches. Five punches!!</p>
 <p>A series of five domineering fist strikes was more than the Dragon of the Starry Sky could take, and its entire 300,000-meter body exploded, sending a blast of energy raging onto Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>The force of the detonation shocked even the Giant Ghost King, who considered trying to interfere, but couldn’t react quickly enough. This was one of Patriarch Starry Sky’s trump cards, something he had planned to use on the Giant Ghost King, but was now forced to use on the troublesome Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>From a distance, it was possible to see that the detonation of the Dragon of the Starry Sky created a massive vortex, almost like an enormous mouth that loomed over Bai Xiaochun to swallow him up. The destructive power of that vortex would be shocking to even a demigod, much less any cultivator under that level.</p>
 <p>The disciples of the River-Defying Sect were getting very anxious. Song Junwan’s face was ashen, and she trembled in fear and disbelief. Patriarch Spirit Stream panted as he stared nervously at the huge vortex.</p>
 <p>However, even as everyone watched in anxiety and anticipation, Bai Xiaochun’s voice rang out from inside of the vortex.</p>
 <p>“That’s all you’ve got?” he said, striding out into the open. His hair was in complete disarray, and he was seriously injured. However, with each step he took… his aura grew stronger, and his wounds healed.</p>
 <p>By the time he emerged fully from within the vortex, he wasn’t harmed at all, and his aura was all the way back at its peak.</p>
 <p>“Impossible!!” Patriarch Starry Sky gasped, staggering backward in complete disbelief.</p>
 <p>He could accept that his Spear of the Starry Sky had been defeated. And he could even handle the destruction of his Dragon of the Starry Sky. But the fact that even the detonation of that dragon hadn’t killed Bai Xiaochun was something that seemed to defy all reality. He didn’t even look like he had been hurt!</p>
 <p>Patriarch Starry Sky’s scalp tingled in fear, and his heart pounded in terror. He finally had to admit that this was an enemy he couldn’t defeat. Even worse, he was finally coming to the realization that Bai Xiaochun might actually be able to beat him into submission!</p>
 <p>“This guy can recover from any injury! None of my divine abilities can do anything to him…. I guess… I've lost the initiative, which means that the next thing which will happen is… he’ll attack me….” Having reached this point in his train of thought, Patriarch Starry Sky’s eyes began to shine with terror and fear.</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, he thought back to a powerful expert from years past, a person who all of the demigods in the lands of Heavenspan had feared. That person… was very much like this Bai Xiaochun, a person with terrifying regenerative capabilities.</p>
 <p>“The famed Blood Ancestor….” Patriarch Starry Sky murmured.</p>
 <p>He could well imagine that, with regenerative abilities like this, Bai Xiaochun wouldn’t necessarily be invincible in this heaven and earth. However, the only people who could possibly be a match for him would be the Celestial or the gravekeeper.</p>
 <p>No demigods could possibly qualify to tangle with Bai Xiaochun, not even the most experienced and qualified of them. In fact… it wouldn’t even be a certainty that demigods could team up to defeat him!</p>
 <p>“The only way to beat him would be to defeat his regenerative powers, or handle him like the Blood Ancestor…. Have the Celestial crush him, pierce through the power of his undying body to directly slaughter his nascent divinity!”</p>
 <p>The Giant Ghost King was reacting similarly, and simply couldn’t control his facial expression. Bai Xiaochun’s powers of regeneration surpassed all imagination, and left the Giant Ghost King completely aghast.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, if Patriarch Starry Sky suddenly thought about the Blood Ancestor, then it made even more sense for the Giant Ghost King, one of the four heavenly kings of the Arch-Emperor Dynasty, to… think of exactly the same thing!</p>
 <p>Years ago, the Blood Ancestor… had vied for the throne with one of the Arch-Emperors, but had eventually ended up dying in the lands of Heavenspan!</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun could see how shocked the two demigods were. Taking a deep breath, he looked at Patriarch Starry Sky and said, “Any more divine abilities you want to try out? If not, then I guess I’ll take my turn.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, yes, I have more,” Patriarch Starry Sky said, his eyes bloodshot. Suddenly, he reached up and touched his forehead, causing his divine soul to fly out into the open and shoot up into the starry sky above.</p>
 <p>As his divine soul merged with the starry sky, starlight that was even more blinding than anything before began to shine down.</p>
 <p>“This is my most powerful divine ability, Bai Xiaochun. Let’s see if your regeneration powers can save you from this!” In the blink of an eye, Patriarch Starry Sky began to descend in the form of a starry sky!</p>
 <p>It was as if the heavens were embodied, and falling down toward the earth!</p>
 <p>“Most powerful divine ability, huh…?” All of a sudden, the desire to do battle surged strong in Bai Xiaochun. His previous two clashes with Patriarch Starry Sky had been defensive in nature. He hadn’t even tried to unleash a counter attack. But now… he was done holding out. Without any hesitation, he shot up to meet the descending starry sky.</p>
 <p>Shouting, he used the Mountain Shaking Bash and the Undying Hex to pick up speed.</p>
 <p>Rumbling sounds echoed out as the power of countless heavenly bodies came to focus on Bai Xiaochun. He was shaking on the verge of collapse, and yet, after only a breath of time passed, was fully recovered. And that was when he unleashed his Undying Emperor’s Fist!</p>
 <p>If one fist didn't work, he would use ten!</p>
 <p>If ten failed, he would use a hundred. Then a thousand. Then ten thousand!</p>
 <p>“You will be destroyed!” he shouted. Fist after fist struck, causing the starry sky to tremble violently. Inside, Patriarch Starry Sky’s divine soul was rapidly reaching a point of instability. Gritting his teeth, he rotated his cultivation base to try to hang on, causing destructive power to surge out to meet Bai Xiaochun. However, no matter how badly Bai Xiaochun was injured, his Undying Blood made him terrifyingly resilient!</p>
 <p>He quickly recovered from any injury, and his aura always returned to the peak. He seemed completely indomitable, utterly domineering. Everyone watching the scene was dumbstruck. The Giant Ghost King’s jaw hung open, and Patriarch Starry Sky was as shocked as if the heavens had collapsed!</p>
 <p>Finally, the starry sky shattered…. The stars exploded, and Patriarch Starry Sky’s divine soul fled out into the open, terrified!</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun also appeared, moving so quickly that he transformed into a series of afterimages… that headed directly toward Patriarch Starry Sky’s divine soul!</p>
 <p>His goal was not to kill him, but to beat him into submission!</p>
 <p>Patriarch Starry Sky looked over at Bai Xiaochun, who seemed to be clad in World Raiment, with his will having surpassed the will of the world itself. He seemed impossible to defend against, to the degree that Patriarch Starry Sky’s battle spirit immediately vanished. As of this moment, he truly feared Bai Xiaochun!</p>
 <p>“Fine, I agree, I agree! It’s too tiring fighting you. Truce! A truce!! No fighting!”</p>
