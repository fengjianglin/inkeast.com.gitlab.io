 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s consciousness was fading. At the same time, everything around him seemed to slow down. He suddenly found himself thinking about how he used to light incense on Mount Hood, and everything that happened in the Spirit Stream Sect, the Blood Stream Sect, and then the River-Defying Sect....</p>
 <p>As those memories flashed through his mind, he smiled.</p>
 <p>It was a smile of both bitterness and helplessness.</p>
 <p>He practiced cultivation in order to live forever, and yet, in pursuit of that goal, he always ended up in deadly crises. The slightest mistake in such a situation could lead to him losing his poor little life.</p>
 <p>It was somewhat of a paradox.</p>
 <p>“To live forever,” he murmured, “you don’t just have to struggle against the heavens, you have to fight other people. It’s a narrow, rugged path to walk, a path that most people give up on. Many people meet defeat, or end up losing their way....</p>
 <p>“Living forever.... That's the whole reason I started to practice cultivation. To live forever....</p>
 <p>“Live forever.... I’m going to live forever!!” Suddenly, everything became incredibly clear. Although he felt incredibly weak at the moment, he was completely focused on living forever. That one simple thought continued to fill his mind, like the rumblings of thunder!</p>
 <p>“I can’t count on other people all the time. I have to get stronger! Only if I get strong enough can I make sure that nobody interferes with my will to live forever!!” Bai Xiaochun trembled as his heart and mind roared, causing his nine spiritual seas to begin to rage and emit thunderous rumblings.</p>
 <p>The Heaven-Dao aura which had built up in his nine spiritual seas throughout Foundation Establishment suddenly erupted out. It was like a string, connecting all of the nine spiritual seas and drawing them together into one!!</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun had already been in a position to begin the process of reaching Gold Core. Now, being completely focused on his desire to live forever, and with his life actually being on the line, he was ready to break through!</p>
 <p>“Live forever!!” Bai Xiaochun threw his head back and roared, and as he did, his nine spiritual seas erupted with shocking energy, energy that surged out of him and connected to heaven and earth!</p>
 <p>The Heaven-Dao aura caused colors to flash in the sky, and a huge wind to kick up. An enormous, swirling vortex appeared overhead, so large that the entire Sky River Court was covered!</p>
 <p>The sudden appearance of the rumbling vortex caused many people to look up and then involuntarily gasp!</p>
 <p>Even as the wind swept around Bai Xiaochun, bolts of lightning appeared up above, as well as an illusory scene that looked somewhat like nine seas.</p>
 <p>It was in that exact moment that his Gold Core opponent closed in with killing intent surging. Even as he reached out to attack, his face fell, and the energy surging from Bai Xiaochun battered him backward by over 30 meters!</p>
 <p>“You....” the young man said, his face a mask of disbelief. What shocked him was not the fact that Bai Xiaochun was choosing this moment to step into Core Formation, but rather, that this type of Core Formation was something completely different than anything he had ever seen before!</p>
 <p>Never before had he ever seen such strange signs and portents appear in heaven and earth during Core Formation.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun hadn’t even actually reached Core Formation, and yet the mere pressure and aura was so powerful that he couldn’t get close. The young Gold Core cultivator was completely and utterly taken aback.</p>
 <p>He wasn’t the only one. Everyone in the area was shocked beyond belief!</p>
 <p>“That....”</p>
 <p>“That’s....”</p>
 <p>“That’s a Heaven-Dao aura. Don’t tell me... don’t tell me he’s going to reach Heaven-Dao Gold Core!?!?”</p>
 <p>The Nascent Soul Daoist masters from the Sky River Court were also shocked, and some of them even had looks of jealousy on their faces.</p>
 <p>Heaven-Dao Gold Core was something out of legend!</p>
 <p>The term Gold Core was actually a blanket term often applied to different levels. The Core Formation stage was more properly classified into the heaven, earth, and mortal varieties. The Mortal-Dao of men led to Mortal Core. Earth-Dao led to Earth Core. And Heaven-Dao led to Gold Core!</p>
 <p>Only Heaven-Dao Gold Core could truly be considered Gold Core!</p>
 <p>The only way to reach Heaven-Dao Gold Core was to start out in Heaven-Dao Foundation Establishment. And yet, being in Heaven-Dao Foundation Establishment wasn’t a guarantee of being able to reach Heaven-Dao Gold Core!</p>
 <p>Heaven-Dao Gold Core experts were as rare as phoenix feathers or qilin horns, and not a single one had appeared in the last 10,000 years, not even in the Middle Reaches. The crushing pressure exerted by the Heaven-Dao Gold Core stage was something that could only be read about in the ancient records.</p>
 <p>Although the Nascent Soul patriarchs of the River-Defying Sect weren’t as surprised as everyone else, they were still taken aback. They knew that Bai Xiaochun was in the Heaven-Dao Foundation Establishment stage, but that didn’t necessarily mean that he would reach Heaven-Dao Gold Core!</p>
 <p>There was always a chance that he would fail, but if he succeeded, and formed a Heaven-Dao Gold Core, then it would mean his future potential was almost limitless, and he would also be capable of crushing anyone else in the same stage as him!</p>
 <p>The battlefield suddenly went quiet. The Heaven-Dao aura which was now crushing down on everyone ensured that all fighting stopped!</p>
 <p>All eyes were looking in the direction of Bai Xiaochun. Not even a deva would be able to interfere with the process of Heaven-Dao Gold Core, and if they tried, they would be punished by the heavens!</p>
 <p>Failure or success would not depend on any outside force, only on the person striving to reach Core Formation!</p>
 <p>As everyone watched, the crashing of thunder grew louder and louder in the sky above. At the same time, Bai Xiaochun’s ninth sea began to merge with the eighth, and at the same time, the first sea merged with the second!</p>
 <p>As the four seas merged together, colors flashed in the sky, the wind screamed, and the pressure grew more intense. Even the Nascent Soul cultivators were panting.</p>
 <p>“The merging has started....”</p>
 <p>“The process of breaking through from Foundation Establishment into Gold Core involves merging the spiritual seas. To start out by merging four together is the best. Merging six spiritual seas at the beginning is rare, and for someone to merge eight would be rare even in the Upper Reaches riversource sects!”</p>
 <p>“Bai Xiaochun already has four of the seas merged together....” The Gold Core and Nascent Soul cultivators were all looking up at the signs in the sky, and commenting among themselves.</p>
 <p>However, many of the cultivators from the Sky River Court actually sighed in relief when they saw that Bai Xiaochun had only merged four of the seas.</p>
 <p>“A mere four merged spiritual seas means that he will fail to reach Heaven-Dao Gold Core!” The Sky River Court cultivators weren’t the only ones to realize this; the patriarchs from the River-Defying Sect were now starting to get nervous.</p>
 <p>As the junior patriarch of the River-Defying Sect, the patriarchs viewed him with utmost importance. They had originally planned to do everything in their power to help Bai Xiaochun reach Heaven-Dao Gold Core after the battle was over.</p>
 <p>But then, something unexpected had happened, and Bai Xiaochun was forcing Core Formation in the middle of the fighting. To the River-Defying Sect, this unexpected event was turning out to be a big setback.</p>
 <p>However, it was at this point that, all of a sudden, cries of shock began to rise up.</p>
 <p>“He's not stopping at four!!”</p>
 <p>“Another merging is taking place!!”</p>
 <p>Two spiritual seas had merged on the top, and two on the bottom. But now, the first two spiritual seas were beginning to merge with the third!</p>
 <p>And that wasn’t the end of it! The eighth and ninth spiritual seas were slowly beginning to join together with the seventh!</p>
 <p>As that happened, the Heaven-Dao aura grew even more intense, suppressing the cultivation bases of all cultivators, and even throwing them into chaos.</p>
 <p>More and more cries of shock rang out.</p>
 <p>“How could this be happening?!?!” The Sky River Court cultivators were completely shocked, especially the young Gold Core expert who had been trying to kill Bai Xiaochun moments ago. That young man was trembling, his expression that of complete disbelief, and his heart was filled with regret at the realization that he had provoked a monster.</p>
 <p>“Six seas!!” Patriarch Frigidsect from the Spirit Stream Division and Master Godwind of the Blood Stream Division were both overjoyed. The other patriarchs had the same reaction, and as for Li Qinghou and the other Gold Core cultivators, they were watching with wide eyes.</p>
 <p>And yet, before the uproar could even commence, something else happened up above in the sky!</p>
 <p>The first three spiritual seas began to merge into the fourth!</p>
 <p>Simultaneously, the seventh through ninth spiritual seas began to connect to the sixth!</p>
 <p>Everything was changing!</p>
 <p>The bottom four spiritual seas and the top four spiritual seas were drawing closer together, and between all of them was the fifth spiritual sea!</p>
 <p>Although the fifth spiritual sea didn’t seem to be doing anything at all, it was obvious that all nine of the spiritual seas were merging together!!</p>
 <p>The Heaven-Dao pressure grew stronger than ever, exploding out into the entire area with unprecedented intensity!</p>
 <p>That pressure was almost like a natural protection offered to anyone stepping into the Heaven-Dao Gold Core stage. As the pressure roiled out, something else happened that no one noticed. The ancient gravekeeper appeared high up in the sky. First, he looked at the spiritual seas, then down at Bai Xiaochun....</p>
 <p>Everyone watched as the nine spiritual seas slowly converged upon each other; as they did, they began to form a shape....</p>
 <p>Clearly, that shape was a circle!!</p>
 <p>The nine golden spiritual seas were completely eye-catching. To everyone who was looking at them, they seemed almost like a golden sun!</p>
 <p>It was a true and authentic Gold Core!</p>

 <p>Hey everyone, in my original story Legends of Ogre Gate, one of the most popular characters, Sun Mai, is a sort of crazy scholar who often quotes "Kong Zhi," who is essentially Confucius. In the supplementary game information based on the novel, we have a "Sun Mai's sayings of Kong Zhi" generator in the works. Like I said, Sun Mai is a bit crazy and he often changes the true sayings of Kong Zhi or even makes up his own sayings and passes them of as Kong Zhi's. So this generator is a bit tongue-in-cheek. Even if you've never read Legends of Ogre Gate, it's worth check out. Very funny. <a href="http://thebedrockblog.blogspot.com/2017/12/legends-of-ogre-gate-chapter-56-sun.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Here's the link</a>. Of course, we're still perfecting it, so feedback is welcome.</p>
