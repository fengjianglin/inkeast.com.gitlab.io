<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Even as the savage giant was shoved away, Bai Xiaochun’s right hand flashed with an incantation gesture, and he pointed out, sending a dozen flying swords out at top speed, completely cutting off the giant’s path of retreat.</p>
 <p>There was no time for the giant to even react. In the blink of an eye, miserable shrieks rang out as the flying swords slashed him to pieces.</p>
 <p>He died so quickly that he didn’t even have a chance to self-detonate before being destroyed in body and soul.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun didn’t hesitate for even a moment. After cutting the giant down, he exploded into action, bearing down on the next giant and waving his hand to send his flying swords forward.</p>
 <p>The giant wanted to evade, but Bai Xiaochun was too quick, and within moments, the giant’s head was flying through the air!</p>
 <p>As that happened, more giants closed in and prepared to attack.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun looked up, simultaneously reaching out with his right hand and then slamming it into the ground, causing rumbling sounds to echo out, as well as a gale force wind. The savage giants’ faces fell as Bai Xiaochun unleashed incredible speed to fight back against more than ten of them at the same time.</p>
 <p>RUUUUUUUUUUMBLE!</p>
 <p>Although the scene playing out now didn’t count for much when considering the battlefield as a whole, in that particular area, Bai Xiaochun was a like a god of death!</p>
 <p>The giants in the area couldn’t do anything to stop him or even obstruct his path. However... overall, there were just too many savage giants.</p>
 <p>It didn’t take long before more than a hundred of them were unleashing deadly attacks. Bai Xiaochun’s defenses were beginning to crumble, one layer at a time. And yet, his eyes were completely bloodshot, and even gleaming with madness.</p>
 <p>“What a bunch of bullies! I can’t believe all of you are ganging up on one person!” Both offended and enraged, he shot forward like a meteor, then slammed into the chest of one of the giants, who flew backward uncontrollably. However, the rest of the more than one hundred giants were circling around him, cutting off all avenues of escape. Finally, Bai Xiaochun slapped his bag of holding and tossed out a big handful of medicinal pills.</p>
 <p>As they flew through the air, they exploded, sending streams of hallucination smoke out in all directions. As soon as the smoke bored into giants’ bodies, they began to act very strangely, giving Bai Xiaochun the perfect opportunity to break past them.</p>
 <p>However, even as he did, hundreds more howling giants poured toward him, their killing intent surging. There were even a few in the lead position who reeked of the aura of self-detonation.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s eyes widened. By this point, he couldn’t evade even if he wanted to. More than ten savage giants all self-detonated simultaneously, sending corrosive blood out in all directions. Bai Xiaochun’s face fell as a huge portion of his defenses crumbled. And yet, he borrowed some of the force of the momentum to flee!</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, the battlefield was huge, and he was a great distance from the spell formation shield. There was no way he could make it to the shield in any short period of time, and furthermore, hundreds of savage giants were swarming forth to surround him.</p>
 <p>“You’re <em>dead</em>, Devil Bai!”</p>
 <p>“I'm gonna eat ya!!” As the giants closed in, more fierce fighting broke out. The madness in Bai Xiaochun’s eyes burned hotter than ever as he waved his hand, causing roughly thirty percent of the magical items swirling around him to explode.</p>
 <p>The shocking force released by the detonation of the magical items sent hundreds of savages tumbling backward with blood spraying out of their mouths. However, before Bai Xiaochun even had an opportunity to flee, more giants began to close in on him.</p>
 <p>Shockingly, they appeared to be trying to bury him with numbers.</p>
 <p>Cold grins appeared on the faces of the distant tribal chiefs. As of this point, they were certain that as long as nothing unexpected happened, Bai Xiaochun would be killed beyond the shadow of a doubt. However, some of the chiefs even began to head in his direction.</p>
 <p>As for the other chiefs, they headed in other directions to start fighting the five legions’ colonels who had been pulled out past the shield!</p>
 <p>As the battlefield sank into chaos, Chen Hetian’s anxiety began to mount. Never before had the Wildlands used tactics like this, and it had caught him completely unprepared. Unfortunately, considering how he was being pinned down by the red-garbed young woman, there was little he could do to reverse the situation.</p>
 <p>Although Bai Lin and the other generals and major generals were still inside of the protection of the spell formation, the necromancer souls they were fighting were extremely dangerous and vicious.</p>
 <p>The entire tide of battle had been reversed in the shortest of moments. The shield continued to advance, and more cultivators were returning to its safety, but too many of the five legions’ forces had been separated, making it difficult for them to extricate themselves from danger.</p>
 <p>Because of the recent turn of events, the battlefield had quickly become a sea of blood!</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s throat was already hoarse from the shouting. He was completely inundated by a sensation of deadly crisis, and was spattered with blood and gore. Considering how he was being completely surrounded, he finally had to abandon his idea of trying to use frigid qi to teleport to safety.</p>
 <p>Although he had put on an impressive performance so far, the truth was that up until now, he had mostly been relying on fleshly body power. After all, he was outside of the Great Wall, where there was almost no spiritual power at all. If he used magical techniques, he would not be able to replace the spiritual energy they used, and would quickly drain himself.</p>
 <p>Once that happened, death would be just around the corner!</p>
 <p>Therefore, he could only use spiritual power in the most critical of moments. Gritting his teeth, he decided to detonate another large portion of magical items.</p>
 <p>An earth-shaking explosion rang out, and more savage giants were seriously injured. However, the bloodthirsty madness in their eyes shone brightly as, instead of retreating, they lunged forward and self-detonated.</p>
 <p>The booms sounded like drums of death that finally battered through the remaining layers of Bai Xiaochun’s personal shields.</p>
 <p>His armor could only hold out for so long, and even the detonation of his last group of magical items barely allowed him to break through. By that point, his armor was crumbling into dust.</p>
 <p>Behind him was a pile of corpses. In the short amount of time that the fighting had been going on, Bai Xiaochun’s strength and madness had shocked the nearby giants to the core!</p>
 <p>“I can’t believe Devil Bai... single-handedly killed so many of us!”</p>
 <p>“Dammit! Not only is he shockingly skilled at concocting medicine, but his battle prowess is incredible! He can’t be left alive! I'm definitely gonna eat him!”</p>
 <p>“He has shocking levels of defense, but at the moment, is right out in the open. He’s definitely going to die today!” Roaring, the giants once again raced to surround him. Among the group were three who were larger and fiercer than the others, and also faster. They were the first to close in on him.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s face was ashen, and he was stooped over, panting for breath. The giants were closing in on him like a rising tide, and it almost seemed impossible for him to kill all of them. When he heard their roars, and smelled the reek of blood in the air, his eyes turned crimson.</p>
 <p>“You think you can kill me just because I ran out of defenses?” All of a sudden, he started laughing, a laughter that contained no small amount of madness. By this point, he had already decided to throw caution to the wind. It was obvious that he was in a deadly predicament, and if he didn’t go all out, he wouldn’t even have a chance of making it out alive.</p>
 <p>Continuing to laugh, he stood up straight, and his fleshly body power began to thrum. Then, a blast of wind shot out in all directions as his skin turned completely golden, and the illusory image of a Heavenly King appeared behind him. Simultaneously, numerous complex magical symbols that resembled hexing marks appeared all over his legs and arms.</p>
 <p>His Undying Live Forever Technique was now on full display!</p>
 <p>With that, he took a step forward, and then unleashed... the Mountain Shaking Bash!</p>
 <p>The sudden development happened too quickly for the three of the fastest giants to react. A moment later, a string of afterimages stretched out as Bai Xiaochun shot forward toward the nearest of them.</p>
 <p>That giant had originally been grinning in confidence because of his own incredible fleshly body strength. However, when Bai Xiaochun slammed into him, his eyes went wide, and before he could cry out... he was launched into the air with a bang!</p>
 <p>The cracking sound of breaking bones could be heard, and blood spurted out in all directions. Finally, the giant screamed, and yet before he could land on the ground, a pop could be heard as he exploded into a cloud of blood and gore!</p>
 <p>A single move on Bai Xiaochun’s part had killed him in body and soul!</p>
