<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>“What did I do to deserve this…?” Chen Hetian mourned, wishing he could weep. He felt even worse when he looked around at the devastation caused by the fighting earlier, including countless destroyed buildings and structures.</p>
 <p>“Someone else kidnapped his friends, but he came looking for me….” he grumbled angrily. The main thing he was worried about was the possibility of this scenario playing out again, and then another time after that, and so on….</p>
 <p>“However, this is also a good opportunity. If he gets into a fight with Li Xiandao, I can make a big fuss about it…. The demigod patriarch has surely noticed that Bai Xiaochun came to cause trouble. Although he didn’t say anything, if Bai Xiaochun keeps up with this sort of thing, the patriarch will <em>not</em> be pleased!” Eyes flashing brightly with anger, he sent a message to Li Xiandao, hoping to secure his cooperation in turning the situation into a disaster for Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>“You’re setting yourself up for a catastrophe, Bai Xiaochun!”</p>
 <p>Even as Chen Hetian plotted, Bai Xiaochun was weighing matters over in his heart. He hadn’t forgotten that the demigod patriarch was in charge of the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect, which meant that it wouldn’t be a good idea to push things too far….</p>
 <p>Now that he had determined who the true culprit was, he knew how he would handle the situation. Pushing forward with incredible speed, he left a string of sonic booms behind him as he headed toward Li Xiandao’s residence.</p>
 <p>As he closed in, a stream of deva will erupted out from the Li Clan.</p>
 <p>Li Xiandao appeared and said, “Calm down, Fellow Daoist Bai. This is a misunderstanding, that’s all. A misunderstanding…. I’ve already sent for your two friends. All you have to do is wait for a moment.”</p>
 <p>With that, he clasped hands and bowed, a friendly smile on his face. Considering how short of a temper he had, if this were any other person he was dealing with, he would have attacked immediately and killed them. But he truly feared Bai Xiaochun, and his heart still trembled with terror based on what he had seen back in the River-Defying Sect.</p>
 <p>In retrospect, he wished he could go back and do something to put Bai Xiaochun in check before he reached his full potential. But now he was a true chosen of the sect, with a limitless future. He was not the type of person to provoke, and thus, smoothing things out with him right now was obviously the best choice.</p>
 <p>By now, he had received Chen Hetian’s message, and actually agreed with the other deva’s plan. And yet, he still wasn’t sure of exactly what to do. Until he decided for sure, the best thing was to still put on a show of deference in front of Bai Xiaochun. That way, Bai Xiaochun would look even more unreasonable and domineering to the demigod patriarch.</p>
 <p>Based on what Li Xiandao knew of the demigod patriarch, the man might not necessarily intervene immediately when a deva started throwing his weight around, but he definitely wouldn’t be happy.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, showing deference to Bai Xiaochun wouldn’t be a loss of face. After all, they were both devas, so taking the initiative to bow his head was an appropriate thing to do.</p>
 <p>To Li Xiandao, anyone beneath the Deva Realm was nothing more than a bug. Only people in the same cultivation level as himself counted as powerful experts!</p>
 <p>When Bai Xiaochun saw that Li Xiandao was acting deferentially, his eyes flickered, and he immediately came to the conclusion that something fishy was going on.</p>
 <p>“You kidnap my friends and then tell me to calm down? What the hell, Li Xiandao?!”</p>
 <p>Li Xiandao’s eyes flickered, and he backed up a few paces.</p>
 <p>Seeing that, Bai Xiaochun’s eyes narrowed.</p>
 <p>“Taking the initiative to bow his head, and trying to goad me into making a mistake? Well played, Li Xiandao!” Racing to come up with his next move, he accelerated, and then unleashed an attack. A moment later, he and Li Xiandao were fighting back and forth.</p>
 <p>All of the cultivators on the other rainbows had shifted their attention from Chen Hetian to this new area. As for Chen Hetian himself, his divine sense was locked onto the area as well.</p>
 <p>Chen Hetian really couldn’t contain himself. He hated Bai Xiaochun so much, and was so invested in plotting against him, that he began to chuckle coldly as soon as the fighting broke out.</p>
 <p>“Beat him! The harder the better!” Feeling wonderful about how things were going, he kept his focus directed completely on the scene playing out.</p>
 <p>Least under pressure was Bai Zhentian, who was also pleased with how things were playing out between Bai Xiaochun and Li Xiandao. At the same time, he was feeling very glad that, other than the River-Defying Sect incident, he had never done anything to build up a grudge between himself and Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>“What an unreasonable lunatic!” he thought, sighing. By this point, he realized that something seemed to be a bit off about Li Xiandao’s actions. But then he thought about what he knew of Chen Hetian, and quickly speculated as to what was going on. It actually made the current situation even more intriguing.</p>
 <p>As the booms rang out, Li Xiandao fell back over and over again. Despite being in the mid Deva Realm, he found Bai Xiaochun to be a very tough opponent, with seemingly boundless energy. The divine abilities and magical techniques that Bai Xiaochun had at his disposal were as troublesome for Li Xiandao as they were for Chen Hetian, and left him feeling almost completely helpless.</p>
 <p>What had him feeling even more frustrated was that, as a deva patriarch, there was no way that he would go around causing problems for measly disciples who weren’t even in the Nascent Soul stage. From what he remembered, it was an elder from among his subordinates who had taken Bai Xiaochun’s friends. Later, the man had sent one of Li Xiandao's own grandsons to ask for his approval in the matter, and for help to make sure that no sect rules were violated.</p>
 <p>By this point, he truly detested that grandson of his. Although, what irritated him the most was not the trouble itself, but the fact that his grandson hadn’t come to remind him of the situation after Bai Xiaochun rose to power.</p>
 <p>That lack of a reminder was what had led to the current situation. If the matter had been pointed out to him earlier, he could have resolved the situation by numerous means.</p>
 <p>As he considered all of these things, he decided that since Bai Xiaochun seemed inclined to push things too far, then the best thing was to go along with Chen Hetian’s plan. Therefore, he put an even more deferential expression onto his face.</p>
 <p>“Listen to me, Bai, old pal. I already took care of the situation with your friends. They’ll be here any moment! There’s no need for this fighting! I’ll definitely compensate you for everything!”</p>
 <p>When Bai Xiaochun heard that, he snorted coldly in his heart. Taking a step forward, he said, “That’s not how this is going to work. Ai. I don’t really want to beat you up either. But I treated Chen Hetian unfairly earlier, and got in a big fight with him. Now that I have the real culprit in front of me, if I don't beat him up a bit, how would Chen Hetian feel? It just wouldn’t be fair! And what would other people think?!”</p>
 <p>Many jaws dropped among the onlookers in response to his words. Strange expressions appeared, and many people even chuckled. At first, Bai Xiaochun’s words seemed to make sense, but after thinking about it, most cultivators in the audience realized how nonsensical they were….</p>
 <p>“What… what is that supposed to mean?”</p>
 <p>“He had a misunderstanding with Elder Chen, and therefore has to go beat up Elder Li?”</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, a stream of divine sense from the violet rainbow up above was focused on the events down below. It was the demigod patriarch, who earlier had been a bit irritated at Bai Xiaochun’s actions. However, the words he had spoken just now caused the patriarch to smile. All of the irritation he had felt earlier quickly melted away.</p>
 <p>The patriarch shook his head. He didn’t like it when his subordinates started throwing their weight around too much, which could easily get out of control. However, Bai Xiaochun’s words just now had revealed his true attitude!</p>
 <p>Perhaps he had planned all along to word things that way, which would just go to show that Bai Xiaochun was somewhat audacious. People like that were often easy to control. Perhaps he hadn’t planned the words out, but that would actually just make the situation more amusing.</p>
 <p>The truth was that the demigod patriarch was actually very curious about Bai Xiaochun. Furthermore, the reason why he had been so quick to confer him with a title had to do with Du Lingfei.</p>
 <p>In response to the words Bai Xiaochun had just uttered, Chen Hetian gasped.</p>
 <p>As for Li Xiandao, he gazed deeply at Bai Xiaochun, and suddenly felt more on guard than ever. At the same time, he abandoned any thoughts of going along with Chen Hetian’s plan.</p>
 <p>“This guy doesn’t just have incredible battle prowess, he’s also a profound schemer! Not only did he resolve the situation, he did it brilliantly!” A smile broke out on Li Xiandao’s face, and he clasped hands respectfully.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, Fellow Daoist Bai. Whatever misunderstanding you had with Fellow Daoist Chen has nothing to do with the two of us. Maybe this little conflict can be the start of a new friendship!”</p>
 <p>At the moment, Li Xiandao actually wasn’t very afraid of Bai Xiaochun; in fact, he actually felt no need to cause any problems for him.</p>
