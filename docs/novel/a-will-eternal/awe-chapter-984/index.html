<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Bai Xiaochun was so focused on fleeing for his life that he wasn’t paying any attention to how much faster he was than his pursuer. He was only thinking about getting away as quickly as possible.</p>
 <p>Whooshing and whistling sounds echoed out in all directions as he became a blur of afterimages that split the air. In fact, it was actually impossible to tell which one of them was his true form.</p>
 <p>The ghost face was going so crazy that he even used a trump card divine ability, causing the smoke which surrounded him to condense down into a sphere. However he simply couldn’t close the distance as Bai Xiaochun headed to… the wind valleys!</p>
 <p>“Noooo!!” he wailed. He pushed forward with a burst of cultivation base power, causing the black sphere to transform into numerous black arrows that shot toward Bai Xiaochun!</p>
 <p>There were so many of them that they were impossible to count, a sight which caused Bai Xiaochun to scream in fear when he noticed.</p>
 <p>He was using the Undying Hex, the Mountain Shaking Bash, and every other magical technique he could think of, even the Cloud Lightning Forefather Transformation!</p>
 <p>Even as the black arrows were about to hit him, he entered the wind valleys. At that point, the arrows exploded, creating a powerful attack that shot into the wind valleys after him.</p>
 <p>Blood sprayed out of Bai Xiaochun’s mouth, but he didn’t even look over his shoulder. He just shot deeper into the wind valleys, to immediately be assailed by the powerful, biting winds. However, as soon as any wind touched him, it transformed into a shocking energy of heaven and earth that entered his pores and began to flow through his body.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, Bai Xiaochun was in no mood to even notice that. He continued to speed along, coughing up blood over and over. Only when he was deep in the wind valleys did he finally stop, panting, and look around to make sure he was alone. At that point, he turned around and realized that the ghost face hadn't pursued him into the valleys. Finally, he sighed in relief.</p>
 <p>“Think you can kill Lord Bai, you old ghost? Stop dreaming!!” At this point, he looked around more closely, and realized that the screaming winds were doing exactly what the lightning had done: filling him with both spiritual power and life force.</p>
 <p>Immediately, he brightened up.</p>
 <p>“Hmph! A gentleman can wait for a decade to get revenge if he needs to. And since I, Bai Xiaochun, am a gentleman, I’ll just wait until I have my cultivation base breakthrough, and then I’ll go beat the crap out of that old ghost!” The mere thought of the scene which had just played out caused his heart to tremble in fear. And yet, there was also something odd about it.</p>
 <p>“Now that I think about it, that old ghost seemed weaker than before! He couldn’t even catch up to me.” Shaking his head, he thought back to how the baby girl had said that as she gained more control over the world, she would suppress the ghost face.</p>
 <p>“One factor must be that my improved cultivation base gives me greater speed. The other is that the ghost face is being suppressed!” Having reached this point in his train of thought, he started to get so excited that his eyes lit up.</p>
 <p>“Until the baby girl wakes up, there’s no way to get out of here. That means the old ghost is trapped just like me, and getting weaker constantly. Meanwhile, I'm getting stronger….” The more he thought about it, the more excited he got.</p>
 <p>Finally, he looked off into the distance and shouted, “You just wait, you old ghost! Once I break through, I’ll beat you so badly that Ghostmother won’t even recognize you! If I don’t, then my name’s not Bai Xiaochun!”</p>
 <p>He powered his voice with his cultivation base power so that it echoed out of the wind valleys and all the way to the livid ghost face.</p>
 <p>“Bai Xiaochun!!” he howled in frustration. After chasing Bai Xiaochun to the wind valleys and then seeing that the wind didn’t affect him, the ghost face truly felt himself descending into insanity. The winds seemed to almost treat Bai Xiaochun like their own ancestor!</p>
 <p>At this point, the ghost face decided to try to step into the winds himself, only to find that they almost tore his soul body to shreds, and also took away some of his life force. He immediately backed away.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun had fled as quickly as a mouse with its tail on fire, and was soon in the depths of the wind valleys, leaving the ghost face feeling completely helpless, and cursing heaven and earth for the vile way they treated him.</p>
 <p>He knew that if things kept going this way, then he was truly finished…. The mere thought of Bai Xiaochun experiencing a breakthrough in the wind valleys caused the ghost face’s expression to turn very grim.</p>
 <p>“This guy will seek revenge over the smallest grievance! If he breaks through….”</p>
 <p>The ghost face couldn’t have felt more regret. By now, he realized that he really shouldn’t have come into this damned magical item with Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>“How can this guy be so unreasonable?!?!?!” Turning around, he fled to yet again try to find a way out.</p>
 <p>If the ghost face had ever met any disciples from the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect or the Nine Heavens Cloud Lightning Sect, perhaps those disciples would have told him that what was truly terrifying about Bai Xiaochun wasn’t any so-called unreasonableness, but rather… his infinitely powerful ability to cause disasters!</p>
 <p>After all, both riversource sects had borne witness to the fact that, given the right circumstances and resources, he could very nearly destroy the world.</p>
 <p>Before long, half a year had gone by….</p>
 <p>During that time, the war preparations were completed, and the campaign that the Celestial wanted finally began!</p>
 <p>The forces of the Heavenspan River Region invaded the Wildlands on four fronts. The four massive armies were led by the riversource sects, and filled in with the forces of the Middle and Lower Reaches.</p>
 <p>The Wildlands fought back primarily with the armies of the four heavenly kings, each of whom faced one of the riversource sects. The war… had begun!!</p>
 <p>Neither Bai Xiaochun nor the ghost face were aware of this development. If Bai Xiaochun had known, he would have been profoundly nervous, and would likely have been incapable of focusing on cultivation. As for the ghost face, if he had known, he would have been filled with even more regret at having followed Bai Xiaochun into this desolate place.</p>
 <p>In the outside world, a war between the Wildlands and the Heavenspan forces would have been a goldmine for him. He could have consumed people left and right, and would have eventually reached a peak level of cultivation base power that would have enabled him to manipulate the war to his own benefit.</p>
 <p>Instead, the ghost face was hiding in a low-lying mountain, his heart filled with humiliation, viciousness, and terror.</p>
 <p>The reason for that was that during the past half year, his cultivation base had continued to drop. As of this point, he was no longer as strong as a demigod, but rather, in the great circle of the Deva Realm!</p>
 <p>It was like a living nightmare that he almost couldn’t believe was real. After dropping so far in his cultivation base, he finally reached the point where he didn't dare to go outside. Therefore, he had remained in hiding for a full three months.</p>
 <p>A while back, he had been wavering on whether or not to simply go into the wind valleys and try to find Bai Xiaochun. However, he would now be incapable of killing him even if he found him. Even worse was the aura he could sense in the wind valleys, which was now getting very close to the late Deva Realm.</p>
 <p>“Dammit, dammit, DAMMIT!!” Grief and indignation filled him as he thought about how powerful Bai Xiaochun was now. After all, his own power level was now equivalent to the great circle of the Deva Realm. If Bai Xiaochun broke through… the consequences would be unimaginable.</p>
 <p>“Why does it have to be this way?!?!” he moaned, grabbing the smoke that made up his hair and tugging on it viciously. In his fear, he could only cautiously focus on Bai Xiaochun’s aura and its progress.</p>
 <p>A few more months passed, and the ghost face's cultivation base dropped further. He was now in the late Deva Realm…. Worse, he could sense the raging aura in the wind valleys, and it caused him to shiver in fear.</p>
 <p>“Fail! Fail!! I curse you to fail!!” And thus the ghost sat there, nervously cursing Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately for him, Bai Xiaochun’s aura only continued to get more powerful. In the end, he achieved his breakthrough, and stepped into the late Deva Realm. At that point, the ghost face wailed in despair.</p>
 <p>It was also in that moment that a pleased voice erupted from within the wind valleys.</p>
 <p>“Alright, you old ghost. Lord Bai is coming for you!”</p>
