<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Hundreds of thousands of Dao clones rose up, radiating bright light. It was with shocking speed that they flew out… in the direction of the other parts of the starry sky where there was no light, only darkness!</p>
 <p>This was Bai Xiaochun’s plan. He knew that he wasn’t a match for the Mortal Renegade, and therefore, he would temporarily seal him, and use the bought time to try to struggle for an advantage!</p>
 <p>“Sixty percent. If I can control just sixty percent of the starry sky…. Then I would be on the same power level as the Mortal Renegade!”</p>
 <p>Under Bai Xiaochun’s control, his numerous Dao clones spread through the starry sky. As for the Mortal Renegade, although he was under massive pressure, he could sense what was happening. Looking over at Bai Xiaochun, he smiled.</p>
 <p>“First you used divine abilities backed by the Essence of time. And then you used my Master’s precious treasure. And now you want to gain the upper hand in terms of the battlefield. You’re not a bad opponent.” At that point, his aura suddenly shifted, and his eyes flashed. Then, countless streams of black smoke suddenly shot out from him!</p>
 <p>There were hundreds of thousands of them, too many to count, and it was without hesitation that they shot out into the starry sky. As they did, the Mortal Renegade slowly shrank down smaller and smaller, until he was the size of an ordinary human!</p>
 <p>Soon, the streams of black smoke appeared in the dark half of the starry sky, where they sank down into the hundreds of thousands of ruins, almost like seeds. Then, they began to absorb the death and nirvanic extermination around them, slowly becoming… Dao clones of the Mortal Renegade!</p>
 <p>They looked exactly like him, and as they opened their cold eyes, they flew out at top speed to meet Bai Xiaochun’s Dao clones. Their intention: to slaughter them all!</p>
 <p>From the moment Bai Xiaochun enacted his plan until the Mortal Renegade responded, only a short bit of time passed. Then, the two groups of Dao clones met out in the starry sky… and a massive battle unfolded!!</p>
 <p>As more than a million Dao clones clashed, the Eternal World shook, and massive rumbling sounds filled the starry sky.</p>
 <p>It was a shocking sight, and at the same time, was very bizarre. There were more than a million Dao clones, but only two versions. It was a type of war the likes of which had never been fought before, and which surpassed the imaginations of countless cultivators.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, back where the Eternal Immortal Domains had once been positioned, the Mortal Renegade was now normal size again. Breaking out of the crushing power of the hourglasses, he then blurred into motion, appearing in front of Bai Xiaochun and unleashing a fist strike.</p>
 <p>Shocked, Bai Xiaochun defended himself, then tumbled backward, blood spraying out of his mouth.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shaking his head, the Mortal Renegade then launched another punch!</p>
 <p>Booms rang out as, in a short period of time, the Mortal Renegade unleashed more than a hundred fist strikes onto Bai Xiaochun. At a certain point, Bai Xiaochun howled, smacking his bag of holding to produce a huge collection of medicinal pills.</p>
 <p>He was starting to get very anxious, as it was more than obvious that his fleshly body was not on the same level as the Mortal Renegade’s. Although he had been aware of that fact earlier, after experiencing it first hand in this exchange, it was even more obvious.</p>
 <p>In fact, he could tell that not even the Undying Codex’s powers of regeneration were enough to heal him. Worse, the Mortal Renegade’s powers of regeneration were also extraordinary!</p>
 <p>“I don’t have any other option than to use medicinal pills!” Feeling very anxious, he began throwing out pills. Many of them were mystery pills that he had never dared to experiment with himself. There were also Aphrodisiac Pills, Soul Convergence Pills, Fantasy Pills, and others that he was familiar with.</p>
 <p>In that moment of crisis, he didn’t really pay attention to what sort of pills they were. Without hesitation, he began to toss out his entire stock.</p>
 <p>“Detonate!”</p>
 <p>“Detonate!!”</p>
 <p>“Detonate!!!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Soon, a multicolored haze of smoke began to fill the area as one pill after another exploded.</p>
 <p>Even the immensely powerful Mortal Renegade couldn't avoid being affected. Expression flickering, he fell back.</p>
 <p>“What is all this stuff?!” He immediately sent out waves of energy to defend himself, and drive away the smoke. For some reason, he already felt a strange heat building up inside of him….</p>
 <p>Frowning, he looked over at Bai Xiaochun. Earlier, before being sealed, he had viewed him as simply a tough opponent. In fact, his desire to do battle had even been piqued. But now… he suddenly realized that he might have misjudged things.</p>
 <p>When Bai Xiaochun saw the Mortal Renegade backing up, he breathed a sigh of relief, and similarly fell back. Of course, he didn’t dare to come into contact with that medicinal cloud himself either. At the same time, he knew that the key to attaining victory in this fight was sealing the Mortal Renegade to buy time. And if he didn’t seize the upper hand, and his opponent started fighting with deadly techniques again, then he would be in a bad position.</p>
 <p>“Live Forever Lamp!” he shouted, quickly performing a double-handed incantation gesture. Instantly, countless Live Forever Lamps appeared in the starry sky, surrounding the Mortal Renegade.</p>
 <p>Without hesitating for even a moment, he then shouted, “Be destroyed!”</p>
 <p>Instantly, the Live Forever Lamps exploded, causing massive shockwaves to batter at the Mortal Renegade, giving rise to numerous vortexes.</p>
 <p>And then the Essence of time appeared. Shockingly, Bai Xiaochun was again trying to trap the Mortal Renegade.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Throwing his arms out, he said, “The starry sky is the furnace!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun was drawing fully on his sovereign powers to transform the starry sky in the area into a huge pill furnace!</p>
 <p>And the Mortal Renegade was right in the middle of it!</p>
 <p>This was his second idea of how to seal the Mortal Renegade; to refine him using pill concocting techniques!</p>
 <p>However, even as the starry sky furnace appeared, the Mortal Renegade frowned, and took a step toward the Live Forever Lamp vortexes. Before he could pass through them, Bai Xiaochun shouted, “Eternal Mother!!”</p>
 <p>The Eternal Immortal Domains were still floating away into the distance. There, at the end of the Eternal River, was a huge bell, within which was a glimmering sphere of light. Although it was much darker than before, it could still respond to Bai Xiaochun’s call, and began to shine dazzlingly.</p>
 <p>The light shot out of the Eternal Immortal Domains, through the void, and appeared right next to the Mortal Renegade. Then, it pierced into the vortexes, causing them to shine in spectacular fashion, and resist the attack of the Mortal Renegade.</p>
 <p>“If it weren’t for the fact that I need to refine you, Eternal Mother, I would have slaughtered you in the beginning. How dare you try resist me!” Snorting coldly, the Mortal Renegade unleashed a fist strike.</p>
 <p>The vortexes vibrated, and the will of the Eternal Mother seemed to tremble on the verge of collapse. In that critical moment, everyone back in the Eternal Immortal Domains, including the Saint-Emperor, Song Que, and all other living beings… suddenly heard the voice of the Eternal Mother speaking to them.</p>
 <p>“Children. I need… your strength….”</p>
 <p>In response, all living beings, from people to animals, and even the plants, shivered as their life force, and even their souls… responded to the voice, and began to give it power!</p>
 <p>Innumerable motes of light rose up from the Eternal Immortal Domains, and then shot toward the vortexes surrounding the Mortal Renegade, fusing into them, causing them to cast brilliant light out to combat the darkness.</p>
