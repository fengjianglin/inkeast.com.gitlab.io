 <p>“Arch-Emperor!!”</p> 
 <p>“Father!!”</p> 
 <p>“Xiaochun!!”</p> 
 <p>The people in the Eternal Immortal Domains saw that final blow, and it resulted in numerous gasps of despair as they watched Bai Xiaochun plummeting down toward the Eternal Sea!</p> 
 <p>Up in the starry sky, the Mortal Renegade hovered, trembling, completely drained by the fight. Never in his life had he faced anyone as powerful or as difficult to deal with as Bai Xiaochun.</p> 
 <p>It was only in this very moment that he managed to cut down all of Bai Xiaochun’s Dao clones, with himself having only eight left. Obviously, if Bai Xiaochun had time to recover, then it would be impossible to end the fight.</p> 
 <p>“I won’t give him that chance!” Eyes flashing, he reached out with his right hand, causing the starry sky to fill with rumbling sounds as his ancient battleship appeared once again!</p> 
 <p>The pitch black craft flew at top speed directly toward Bai Xiaochun, or more precisely… toward the Eternal Immortal Domains!</p> 
 <p>Clearly, the ship was set on a deadly collision course!</p> 
 <p>The Mortal Renegade knew that Bai Xiaochun had intentionally dragged the fight toward the Eternal Immortal Domains. And yet, the Mortal Renegade’s ultimate goal was the same location!</p> 
 <p>The shocking energy of the battleship became a black tempest that raged in all directions, filled with boundless darkness, nirvanic extermination, and endless death.</p> 
 <p>Everything had come full circle. The location of the beginning of the battle was now to be its end!</p> 
 <p>As the battleship neared, the Eternal Immortal Domains began to crumble and collapse. Bai Xiaochun’s vision swam, and his five yin organs and six yang organs were nearly destroyed, making him so weak that his powers of regeneration could do nothing to heal him at the moment.</p> 
 <p>His injuries were simply too severe. The Mortal Renegade’s final fist strike hadn’t been enough to kill him, but had hurt him so badly he could hardly keep his eyes open. However, he could definitely see the ancient battleship arrive and begin its deadly approach toward the Eternal Immortal Domains. And he knew that if the battleship struck, it would mean death for everyone.</p> 
 <p>“The reason I came back here… was so that I could either die with my family and friends, or… use the Essence of the Eternal to launch a fatal counter blow!!” As he wrestled to control his aura, as his eyes flickered with a scrap of hope, as the flame of his life force flickered on the verge of ultimate extinction, he could just barely sense something tugging at him…. It was as if his current state made his connection to the Essence of the Eternal stronger than it had ever been in his life!</p> 
 <p>“What exactly is Essence…?” he thought as he looked up into the sky at the black battleship, with the power of extermination radiating out from it. He could feel the Eternal Immortal Domains trembling on the verge of complete collapse, and could sense the flames of life force within all the living beings beneath him flickering unstably.</p> 
 <p>“Essence has no form or shape; it’s almost like it doesn’t even exist, but simultaneously, it creates and contains every form and shape.” In this moment, his eyes seemed to flicker like the starry sky as the Essence of the Eternal which existed in the Eternal Immortal Domains, in the form of that mysterious energy, suddenly began to thrum in resonance with him.</p> 
 <p>“Essence has no beginning or end,” he murmured, “but simultaneously, creates and contains the beginning and end of everything.” In response to his words, that mysterious energy exploded out, rushing to converge on him, swirling around him, creating an invisible windstorm!</p> 
 <p>“Essence takes up no space, but simultaneously, creates and contains all space.” In response to those three sentences, the mysterious energy went wild, creating a frenzied, invisible vortex that halted Bai Xiaochun’s fall, and left him hovering there in midair!</p> 
 <p>“Essence exists outside of time, but simultaneously, creates and contains all time.” In response to his fourth sentence, the vortex of mysterious energy began to push Bai Xiaochun back up toward the starry sky!!</p> 
 <p>The starry sky trembled as if from the resonance of a great Dao. And the more than 1,000,000 ruins, which had previously been frozen into darkness, began to tremble and crack.</p> 
 <p>In response to all of this, the Mortal Renegade’s eyes went wide, and his heart filled with tsunamis of shock.</p> 
 <p>“That’s the aura of the Eternal!!” he blurted.</p> 
 <p>Almost at the same time, Bai Xiaochun’s voice rose from the Eternal Immortal Domains into the starry sky, to fill the Eternal World!</p> 
 <p>“I still don’t fully understand Essence, and only know a bit about the Eternal….” &nbsp; He closed his eyes for a moment, and though he seemed very weak, when he opened them again, they shone with confidence!</p> 
 <p>“But… I know that our lives resonate with the great Dao, and life force resonates with the most mysterious of secrets. And that… is all I need to know to kill you, Mortal Renegade!”</p> 
 <p>In that instant, Bai Xiaochun began to burn a Dao flame, a fire of life and life force. Inside of him, shocking transformations began to occur, as though… he were beginning to break out of the Sovereign Realm! Around him, the mysterious energy that was the manifestation of the Essence of the Eternal began to boil.</p> 
 <p>As he sensed that, he extended his right hand toward the sky, and then… pointed directly at the black battleship of destruction!</p> 
 <p>There seemed to be little that was special about that gesture. It was no divine ability, and did not contain the fluctuations of a magical technique. However, it instantly caused the Mortal Renegade’s face to fall.</p> 
 <p>“You--!” he shouted, but was unable to say anything more. The black battleship became like an illustration that was then erased out of existence by a massive, invisible hand….</p> 
 <p>In the shortest of moments, it disappeared, starting from the prow and moving backward. As for its aura of death… it also vanished completely.</p> 
 <p>There was absolutely no clue to indicate that the ship had ever existed!</p> 
 <p>There were no ripples spreading out through the sky, or any other evidence. Bai Xiaochun’s face was a bit paler than before; he had used the Essence of the Eternal, not to shift time like he had in the past, nor to attack the Mortal Renegade by guiding the mysterious energy. At the cost of his own life force, he created a resonance with the starry sky and the Essence of the Eternal, to direct that mysterious energy!</p> 
 <p>Guiding and directing were two very different things!</p> 
 <p>Although he was physically weak, his eyes now shone even brighter than ever as he extended his finger again. Up in the starry sky, the Mortal Renegade’s heart was pounding. As for all of the other living beings present, they couldn’t possibly have been more flabbergasted by what was happening!!</p> 
 <p>Within the silence, the Mortal Renegade began to tremble, struck with the sensation that if he didn’t stop Bai Xiaochun right now, he would never be able to do so.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaochun seemed unsurpassably terrifying in this moment, to the point where the invisible Holy Extermination appeared behind the Mortal Renegade, equally stunned, memories of uncountable ancientness flickering in his eyes. Then, his lips moved, and although no sound came out, anyone who could have seen him would be able to see what he was saying.</p> 
 <p><em>Allheaven!</em></p> 
 <p>“Stop him!!” the Mortal Renegade shouted. The image of Holy Extermination screamed the same thing. And in almost the same instant, the two of them superimposed over one another, causing a third eye to open up on the Mortal Renegade’s forehead, in the exact spot where the wound mark had once existed. When that eye opened… his gaze was no longer that of the Mortal Renegade, but rather, the so-called… Holy Extermination!!</p> 
 <p>Radiating the most terrifying of fluctuations, he then shot toward Bai Xiaochun!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaochun was currently being propped up by the mysterious energy that was the Essence of the Eternal. Rising toward the starry sky, and away from the Eternal Immortal Domains, he prepared to meet the Mortal Renegade.</p> 
 <p>And as he did… he pointed out with his finger for a second time!</p>
