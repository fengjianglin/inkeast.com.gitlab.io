<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Bai Xiaochun was trembling in fear. It was obvious that Lei Shan was vastly more powerful than he had been in the past, although it had clearly come at incredible cost. However, whether or not he had been killed in the interchange just now, one thing was clear; he had already died in battle in the past.</p> 
 <p>“Can dead people… die again?” he thought, terrified as he looked over at Lei Shan’s corpse. However, Lei Shan wasn’t moving at all, whereas Mistress Red-Dust and Gongsun Wan’er were fighting more fiercely than ever.</p> 
 <p>By this point, Mistress Red-Dust realized that she was up against a formidable opponent, and was performing constant double-handed incantation gestures to send out beams of red light that seemed capable of slashing the air into bits.</p> 
 <p>The red lotus that was her magical item swirled around her, occasionally sending out bursts of flower petals. As a result, she was constantly surrounded by deva power that could exterminate anything it touched.</p> 
 <p>And yet, that was only secondary. Most important was her own deva cultivation base, which sent out pressure that could crush onto Nascent Soul cultivators like a mountain. Whether physically or mentally, that pressure would be difficult to bear. Most opponents who faced it would likely be destroyed in body and soul without even being able to fight back.</p> 
 <p>However, Gongsun Wan’er was no ordinary opponent. The magical technique she currently employed was bizarre; she launched rings of black light out into the air, each and every one of which was filled with destructive power that sucked away at Mistress Red-Dust’s life force.</p> 
 <p>One of the most shocking things was Gongsun Wan’er’s speed. She moved so indescribably quickly that she was little more than a blur that left a string of afterimages behind. As the battle progressed, more and more black rings began to build up around Mistress Red-Dust.</p> 
 <p>Rumbling sounds echoed out without cease. Clearly, Gongsun Wan’er’s cultivation base was not at the level of a deva’s, and yet, she didn’t seem to feel any pressure at all when fighting Mistress Red-Dust. Even more strange was that Bai Xiaochun could just barely make out a Dharma Idol behind the afterimages of Gongsun Wan’er. The Dharma Idol depicted a woman in a black robe, spectacularly beautiful, with a look of incredibly arrogant contempt in her eyes.</p> 
 <p>The fight was actually getting closer to Bai Xiaochun, and the magical techniques they were using made the area very dangerous. Shockwaves blasted out constantly, making it impossible for him or any of the other soldiers to even get close.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaochun actually had it better off than many of the other soldiers. Some of them were being affected by some sort of gravitational force that sucked away at their life force, turning their hair white.</p> 
 <p>If people nearby were having trouble, then there was little need to mention how badly things were going for Mistress Red-Dust. She had a very unsightly expression on her face, and yet, had no time to even speak. Every bit of her concentration was focused on the fighting.</p> 
 <p>This Bai Xiaochun that she was fighting was far more difficult to deal with than she had anticipated. He almost didn’t seem like the same person she had fought in the past. In fact, although he looked physically like Bai Xiaochun, when it came to his aura, he seemed like a different person.</p> 
 <p>He was definitely very different from anything she remembered.</p> 
 <p>Mistress Red-Dust's divine abilities didn’t seem capable of harming him at all. Furthermore, the black rings of light being sent against her actually affected her mentally.</p> 
 <p>“He’s definitely not in the Nascent Soul stage!!’ she thought, shocked. The entire time, a strange smile could be seen on Gongsun Wan’er’s face, and her eyes flickered with a strange light. She continuously licked her lips, as though she were thinking about how delicious Mistress Red-Dust was, and how wonderful it would be to consume her.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaochun was shocked by what he was seeing, and began to back up as quickly as possible. As he watched the women fight, he noticed that the Dharma Idol from before was now nowhere to be seen. He even wondered if he had actually been seeing things. By now, he had come to the realization that Mistress Red-Dust was not going to be able to keep the fight going for very long. Heart pounding, he began to consider how to convince her to flee.</p> 
 <p>However, it was at that point that the situation suddenly changed. Mistress Red-Dust’s eyes erupted with a murderous light, and she suddenly lurched backward. In response, Gongsun Wan’er smiled, and was about to charge after her, when her expression suddenly flickered, and she backed up.</p> 
 <p>As she did, Mistress Red-Dust’s chest heaved, and her eyes shone with a light of madness. Suddenly, deva fluctuations rolled out of her with explosive force and speed, merging with creation around her, making her seem like she was the overlord of all heaven and earth.</p> 
 <p>“You will be killed beyond the shadow of a doubt, Bai Xiaochun!” she shouted, seemingly filled with a sudden burst of determination. With that, she performed an incantation gesture, causing her face to turn pale as a drop of blood flew out from her index finger.</p> 
 <p>The blood glittered as brightly as a precious treasure, and as it appeared, all light in the area went dim. It was clearly no ordinary blood. In fact, this was a magical technique of Mistress Red-Dust’s, something that combined the power of her cultivation base and her life essence to create a drop of… magical blood!</p> 
 <p>It wasn’t soul blood. However, this magical blood contained elements of Mistress Red-Dust’s enlightenment regarding the great Daos of heaven and earth. As soon as it appeared in the open, it transformed into a blood-red spear!</p> 
 <p>At first glance, it was far more shocking that the spear she had just used to cut down Lei Shan. In fact, it even caused Gongsun Wan’er’s expression to flicker, which caused a bit of hope to rise in Bai Xiaochun’s heart. Without any hesitation, Mistress Red-Dust hefted the spear and then launched it at Gongsun Wan’er.</p> 
 <p>Sonic booms echoed out as the spear pierced through the air, appearing almost instantly right in front of Gongsun Wan’er. And yet, Gongsun Wan’er then erupted into a blur of speed, dodging out to the side so that the spear stabbed halfway into the ground behind her.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaochun gasped. The mere sight of the spear filled him with a sensation of danger, and he almost couldn’t believe it had failed to hit its mark.</p> 
 <p>Even as Gongsun Wan’er backed up from the spear, Mistress Red-Dust hovered in midair, her eyes shining with red light as another drop of blood appeared at the tip of her middle finger.</p> 
 <p>It was… a second drop of magical blood!</p> 
 <p>It immediately turned into a second spear, which shot forth in attack. Then blood emerged from her ring finger, pinky finger, and thumb. In the end, four more spears were flung out, and although Gongsun Wan’er managed to evade all of them, they ended up stabbing into the ground in a rough semi-circle!</p> 
 <p>They were like a barricade that caused Gongsun Wan’er’s expression to flicker. Just when she seemed inclined to flee, a sixth spear appeared, and then a seventh…. More spears of magical blood flew out, stabbing into the ground around Gongsun Wan’er until… they formed a complete circle!</p> 
 <p>By the time this was accomplished, Mistress Red-Dust was breathing heavily, and her face was virtually devoid of any color. Using magical blood to power such techniques was very draining, and wasn't something she could use in a protracted fight.</p> 
 <p>However, the results were shocking. Gongsun Wan’er was clearly in trouble, and wanted to flee, but as soon as she got near any of the spears, black mist would begin to rise up from her, almost as if she were beginning to melt, and she would be forced to back up.</p> 
 <p>The surrounding Giant Ghost Legion soldiers were enlivened, and began to edge forward to offer assistance, Bai Xiaochun among them.</p> 
 <p>However, that was when the trapped Gongsun Wan’er glared over at Mistress Red-Dust and let out a shrill scream that pierced into the minds of everyone present, filling them with pain.</p> 
 <p>As for the ten spears, they suddenly began to crack and splinter.</p> 
 <p>Mistress Red-Dust’s expression flickered, and yet, she didn’t seem alarmed. Phoenix-like eyes shining with murderous intent, she performed a double-handed incantation gesture and then waved her fingers toward the spears!</p> 
 <p>“Shatter and destroy!” she said. Blood-red light erupted from the ten spears as they ripped out of the ground and shot toward Gongsun Wan’er. Before she could do anything, they stabbed through her, and then circled back around for another attack!</p> 
 <p>From Bai Xiaochun’s perspective, it was like countless beams of red light forming a blood-colored net around and through Gongsun Wan’er! Obviously, she would soon be killed in body and soul!</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Gongsun Wan’er’s screams echoed across the battlefield.</p> 
 <p>It was a frightening sight to Bai Xiaochun, and suddenly he was struck by how powerful Mistress Red-Dust was. Clearly, she was about to win this fight, and it caused both her and everyone else present to sigh with relief….</p> 
 <p>And yet, for some reason, Bai Xiaochun felt like it was all a bit too ruthless.</p> 
 <p>“After all, Gongsun Wan’er never did anything to hurt me….”</p>
