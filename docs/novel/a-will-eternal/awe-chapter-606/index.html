 <p>“I refuse to accept this!! How can you possibly compare with me, Bai Hao? From the time we were kids, I was the strongest, I was the most important, and I had the highest cultivation base! I refuse to accept this!!” Bai Qi’s scream was one of utter despair, the most wild, raving scream that had ever escaped his lips in his entire life. It lasted for only the briefest of moments, a bright shining light that was cut off moments later in destruction!</p>
 <p>Rumbling sounds filled the sky of the ancestral land as Bai Xiaochun’s all-destroying palm made contact with Bai Qi, eradicating all of his divine abilities and magical techniques. Bai Qi was like a snowflake hit by a firestorm, and was completely incapable of providing even the slightest scrap of resistance!</p>
 <p>He was in the great circle of Core Formation, only a bit below Bai Xiaochun in terms of level. And yet, he couldn’t compare at all. After all, the person who wanted him dead wasn’t actually Bai Hao, it was a person he should never, ever have provoked. Bai Xiaochun!</p>
 <p>It was like the difference between heaven and earth, making the two of them virtually beyond compare with each other. Bai Xiaochun had reached Heaven-Dao Foundation Establishment, and the Heaven-Dao Gold Core stage. He had fused with three deva souls, giving him three deva soul clones. Although he hadn’t reached the ultimate level of his potential yet, he was strong enough already that he had been able to flee in the face of Mistress Red-Dust, a deva. Considering all of that... the great circle of Core Formation was like nothing to him!</p>
 <p>There was nothing Bai Qi could do about that, and therefore, the fact that he refused to accept the situation was mostly just a joke!</p>
 <p>Rumbling sounds echoed out as his divine abilities and magical techniques shattered. Then cracks spread out from his hands down his arms, which then erupted with blood and destroyed flesh. His bones were ripped to pieces, and his legs vanished as surely as if they had been devoured by a meat grinder.</p>
 <p>Even as pain and despair filled him, Bai Xiaochun’s hand completed its motion. Blood sprayed out of Bai Qi’s mouth as his chest collapsed. His head, neck, and all remaining parts of his body disappeared. He had been... completely and utterly eradicated!!</p>
 <p>Under the devastating force of that palm strike, he was crushed like a weed, with even his soul and his core completely destroyed!!</p>
 <p>Everyone on the ancestral mountain was left profoundly stunned, including Bai Lei and the fifth young lady. Members of the direct bloodline and the auxiliary bloodlines alike were flabbergasted, their minds left spinning and their bodies trembling as they watched Bai Qi transform into splatters of blood that floated through the air like flower petals!</p>
 <p>So stunned were the members of the Bai Clan that they forgot to breathe. They even forgot to cry out in shock.... As for everyone outside of the ancestral land, they were equally astonished, but because they weren’t physically present for what had occurred, they began to recover more quickly. Soon, cries of shock could be heard by the stone gate.</p>
 <p>“He... he really killed Bai Qi!!”</p>
 <p>“That was Bai Qi! He was the qilin son of our clan!!”</p>
 <p>“Heavens! What just happened? Is that really Bai Hao!?!?”</p>
 <p>Most people present didn’t dare to believe the incredulous scene they had just witnessed was real. It was as though everyone outside of the ancestral land had been struck by lightning.</p>
 <p>All scalps were tingling violently. From the moment the Bai Clan had been founded until now, nothing like this had ever happened!!</p>
 <p>Countless people shot to their feet, including the representatives from the two other great clans. As for the emissary from Giant Ghost City, to have personally witnessed what just occurred caused his expression to flicker with profound meaning.</p>
 <p>Despite the fact that everyone had been able to guess what was to come... to actually see Bai Qi killed left them completely bowled over.</p>
 <p>The clan chief looked almost completely insane as he threw his head back and roared, “Bai Hao!! If I don’t kill you, then I don’t deserve to live!!!”</p>
 <p>His entire body was trembling. His hands were shaking, and his eyes were crimson as he wept tears of blood. He had just witnessed his own son being killed, the qilin son of the clan, and its whole future!</p>
 <p>Now... all of that was no more.</p>
 <p>The spattering blood drove the clan chief into utter madness; he held nothing back as he battered at the stone gate in the hopes of opening it. However, the restrictive spells were strong, and could not be opened in a short time.</p>
 <p>The clan elders were panting, their minds simply incapable of processing what had just occurred. Even the grand elder from the Hall of Justice was deeply shaken, his eyes glinting with lamentation.</p>
 <p>However, no one, not even the clan chief, was driven to the same level of madness as... Madam Cai.</p>
 <p>“Bai Hao you son of a bitch, you’re going to die in pain! I’m going to kill you. <em>Kill you!!</em> Qi’er, oh, my Qi’er.... This can’t be happening. It’s not real! Bai Hao!!!” She sounded like a wild beast screaming in madness, and looked like an evil ghost as she stood there trembling.</p>
 <p>Although Bai Xiaochun couldn’t see what was happening outside, he could well imagine how Bai Qi’s death would shake the Bai Clan to the ultimate degree.</p>
 <p>At the moment, Bai Xiaochun seemed completely engulfed by killing intent, but the truth was that his heart was already pounding in anxiety. However, now was not the time to be wrapped up in nervousness. Suppressing his lingering fear, he focused on the main task at hand: buying the time to get out of the Bai Clan!</p>
 <p>He took a deep breath, and once again, his energy surged. Without the slightest hesitation, he waved his hand, causing Bai Qi’s bag of holding to fly to him, as well as some of his blood and flesh. Then Bai Xiaochun shot toward the restrictive spell at the summit of the mountain!</p>
 <p>The restrictive spell needed the blood of the Bai Clan to open; with the blood drop from the deva patriarch, and Bai Qi’s own flesh and blood, it could be unraveled with ease!</p>
 <p>When the cultivators on the mountain saw that he was using Bai Qi’s own flesh and blood to open the restrictive spell, their hearts filled with boundless coldness.</p>
 <p>It was the same outside the ancestral land. Madam Cai was screaming hoarsely, and the clan chief roared with anger.</p>
 <p>“I will never agree to live under the same sky as you, you unfilial bastard!!!”</p>
 <p>As Bai Qi’s flesh and blood spattered onto the spell formation, the unraveling process that Bai Qi himself had begun continued with shocking speed. In the blink of an eye, the restrictive spell began to fade away!</p>
 <p>At the same time, the final glowing halo that was left on the mountain faded into darkness. Cracking sounds rang out, and the bloodline restrictive spell... opened up!!</p>
 <p>Without the halo and the restrictive spell, the mountain summit was open. There on the altar was the deva soul, eye-catching to the extreme.</p>
 <p>Even as everyone looked on, Bai Xiaochun strode up to the altar!</p>
 <p>He moved quickly, and was soon right in front of the altar, where, without a moment of hesitation, he reached out toward the deva soul, his eyes flickering with strange light.</p>
 <p>Numerous afterimages of Bai Xiaochun’s right hand could be seen, and the heavens above rumbled loudly as... he grabbed the soul!!</p>
 <p>The entire ancestral land began to shake. Bai Xiaochun’s heart surged as he could sense the fluctuations of a deva from within the earth-type soul.</p>
 <p>“It really is a deva soul!” he murmured excitedly. He had been waiting for this day for a long time.</p>
