<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>As the Mortal Renegade woke up, causing rocks and rubble to rain down off of him, Bai Xiaochun remained cross-legged, seemingly unaffected.</p>
 <p>He was withered, his aura apparently dispersed, his eyes closed and his hair floating around him. It was impossible to tell whether he was alive or dead, although there was something profoundly mysterious about him.</p>
 <p>For some reason, it seemed that what was sitting there cross-legged was not a human body, but some sort of god!</p>
 <p>Out in the starry sky, the ruins where the dandelion seeds had settled were all undergoing shocking transformations.</p>
 <p>The glow rising up from them grew stronger, driving away the darkness, and causing life force to flourish, as well as radiance and light.</p>
 <p>Spots of light filled the void, seemingly awakening it, causing it to be reborn out of nirvanic extermination!</p>
 <p>Before, there had been a pitch-black void, but that was changing. Now, an astounding will seemed to thrum everywhere.</p>
 <p>That will caused the darkness to tremble, to begin fighting an epic battle with the radiance and light!</p>
 <p>If one could look at that starry sky from high above, it would actually look like an ordinary night sky.</p>
 <p>Countless points of light glittered, letting off glows that, while weak, grew powerful as they joined together!</p>
 <p>The darkness within the starry sky did not seem willing to be driven away, and tried to inundate the ruins with more darkness. However, that resistance was apparently instinctual, and was not driven by intelligence.</p>
 <p>Nirvanic extermination fought with life force in every nook and cranny of the starry sky.</p>
 <p>Even stranger, as the light in all of the ruins grew stronger, Bai Xiaochun seemed to become more and more abstruse, and seem more and more like a shocking god.</p>
 <p>Although the Mortal Renegade was waking up ahead of schedule, Bai Xiaochun had been at work for years, and had already built a very solid foundation. By now, more than half of the ruins in the starry sky were shining with bright light.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately… he had only accomplished that because the Mortal Renegade had been asleep, and unable to oppose him.</p>
 <p>Now, the Mortal Renegade was waking up, and while the darkness had only fought back instinctually before, it now seemed to come to life. The starry sky trembled as though it were aware, and the darkness began to resist Bai Xiaochun, and at the same time, attempt to overwhelm the ruins that were already shining with light.</p>
 <p>The ruins which had not already been lit up were now under assault, and were already teetering on the verge of failure. As for those which had been lit up already, they were now being battered at madly by the darkness, but still managed to hold their own.</p>
 <p>It almost seemed like a stalemate, with Bai Xiaochun preventing the darkness from taking over again, but unable to light up more ruins.</p>
 <p>No one could see what was happening, not even Bai Xiaochun. At the moment, he didn’t possess his senses, and was acting on instinct alone. Unfortunately, he was now stuck, and couldn’t continue his work. Meanwhile, in the ruins closest to the Immortal World, there existed a shining dandelion seed. Gradually, the light shining out of that dandelion seed twisted and distorted, transforming into the shape of a person.</p>
 <p>It was someone seated cross-legged in meditation, and soon, his facial features became clear. It was Bai Xiaochun!!</p>
 <p>It looked like a clone, but at the same time, not a clone. He contained a Dao, and life force, and even Essence power!</p>
 <p>No one could see him, but if anyone could, they would have no way to tell whether or not he was the real Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>And the truth was that he was actually… a Dao clone!</p>
 <p>It was something Bai Xiaochun was doing instinctively as he identified his Dao. Even as that happened, the Mortal Renegade woke up, making it impossible for Bai Xiaochun to continue illuminating the starry sky. Therefore, he shifted to a different tactic!</p>
 <p>Instead of spreading further, he would use the fifty percent control that he had… to become a sovereign!!</p>
 <p>As soon as his Dao clone appeared, the light shining from that set of ruins grew vastly more intense. The darkness in the area was driven away, provoking a howl of rage. However, there was nothing the darkness could do.</p>
 <p>In the same moment that Bai Xiaochun’s first Dao clone appeared, the Mortal Renegade’s eyes began to shine brightly, and his body trembled more violently. Vast swaths of rock and dirt fell off of him, becoming meteorites that rained down onto the Eternal Immortal Domains.</p>
 <p>Even the people in the Eternal Immortal Domains could sense how anxious the Mortal Renegade was in his moment.</p>
 <p>“He’s nervous?” Song Que said.</p>
 <p>The Saint-Emperor could sense the same thing. They exchanged an excited glance, and then looked down at the only person in the Eternal Immortal Domains who was calm and sitting there cross-legged…. Bai Xiaochun!</p>
 <p>As Bai Xiaochun’s Dao clone formed, the mysterious aura surrounding his true self expanded to fill the entire 300-meter area surrounding him!</p>
 <p>Within that area, the shattered lands began to form back together, and brim with life force. Even more shocking to Song Que and the Saint-Emperor was the fact that Bai Xiaochun was now radiating the sensation of Essence!</p>
 <p>Before long, the dandelions in a second set of nearby ruins, and then a third… began to shine brightly as two more Dao clones formed!</p>
 <p>As they did, they shone with such bright light that the starry sky was transformed, causing all the living beings in the Eternal Immortal Domains to look up!</p>
 <p>In that moment when the light blazed, the enormous Mortal Renegade looked up, and then spoke in a voice that shook the souls of everyone alive.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Well isn’t this interesting!”</p>
 <p>It was a cold, ancient voice, and as it spoke, his entire body suddenly moved!</p>
 <p>As a result, the heavens shook, and endless streams of rock and dirt exploded off of him!</p>
 <p>As of this moment, the Mortal Renegade was completely and utterly free from any sealing magics!</p>
 <p>He was a giant, floating in the starry sky, with the Eternal Immortal Domains in front of him, like a toy ball that a child might play with. As for the people upon it, they were nothing more than insects!</p>
 <p>Everyone in the Eternal Immortal Domains trembled in anxiety, their minds struck with fear and terror. Before, some of them had hoped that they would somehow be able to escape after the Mortal Renegade awoke. But now that he was actually awake, they all knew… that escape was impossible!</p>
 <p>All confidence left them as they stared up blankly at the Mortal Renegade, whose right hand was already moving toward the Eternal Immortal Domains as if to grab them!</p>
 <p>His hand alone was roughly as big as all of the Eternal Immortal Domains, and its mere movement seemed capable of collapsing the sky!</p>
 <p>“I brought nirvanic extermination to all 1,080,000 worlds, and thus gave birth to the Eternal Flower. And today… I will take that flower, and become Eternal!”</p>
