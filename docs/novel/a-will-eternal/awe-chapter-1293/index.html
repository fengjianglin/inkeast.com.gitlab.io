<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>The Mortal Renegade’s voice shook the starry sky. Apparently, it also contained his Dao, which was to exterminate anything and everything in existence!</p> 
 <p>The areas of the starry sky that Bai Xiaochun had occupied were also shaken, and at the same time, darkness spread out like floodwaters.</p> 
 <p>The Mortal Renegade’s hand seemed to fill the sky as it neared the seemingly doomed Eternal Immortal Domains. It was a critical moment in which all living beings could only look on in shock, trembling. Song Que and the Saint-Emperor were panting; although they were half-sovereigns who weren’t as badly affected as everyone else, they were still struggling simply to react.</p> 
 <p>Blue veins bulged out on Song Que’s face and neck as he looked up at the enormous, pitch-black hand that already threatened to destroy the sky. As the lands below shook, and as the Eternal Immortal Domains hovered on the verge of collapse, he let out a roar of rage. Throwing all caution to the wind, and ignoring the fact that the pressure was already threatening to destroy him, he once again ignited himself and shot up to meet the gigantic hand.</p> 
 <p>As for the Saint-Emperor, he chuckled bitterly, then ignited himself as well, and shot after Song Que with just as much determination.</p> 
 <p>They seemed like nothing when compared to the enormous hand, and yet, they still chose to fight back!</p> 
 <p>This tragic and moving scene was not visible to the living beings below. However, the Eternal Immortal Domains had a spirit, that being the Eternal Mother, and although she was weak, she could still see what was happening.</p> 
 <p>A sensation of grief spread out from all living things, even the plants and vegetation, as Song Que and the Saint-Emperor closed in on the hand of the Mortal Renegade!</p> 
 <p>Both of them were roaring at the tops of their lungs, dazzling light shining off of them in all directions. Unfortunately, even after igniting themselves… they still could not stop that hand.</p> 
 <p>They could attack with all the might they could muster, and yet… it would do nothing to delay the moment in which the Mortal Renegade’s hand arrived!</p> 
 <p>Rumbling booms could be heard as blood sprayed out of Song Que’s mouth. He tumbled down, body on the verge of collapsing…. It was the same with the Saint-Emperor, who was now covered with bloody wounds, half of his body crushed to a pulp, and barely conscious. Thankfully, the aura of the Eternal Mother had already extended a measure of protection to them; otherwise, they would have been killed instantly.</p> 
 <p>Song Que was still aware of what was happening, and he chuckled bitterly. He glanced up despairingly at the Mortal Renegade, and then over at Bai Xiaochun, who was still sitting there cross-legged. Unfortunately, Song Que was too weak to do anything other than stand by as the enormous hand grew larger and larger in the sky….</p> 
 <p>He could well imagine what would happen if the Mortal Renegade’s hand was not stopped. The people of the Eternal Immortal Domains would die, and then the lands would be shattered. In the end… the Mortal Renegade would absorb the ruins of the Eternal Immortal Domains, and then reach his goal of becoming Eternal!</p> 
 <p>“Is this the end of it all…?” Song Que murmured, grief welling up inside of him. At that point, he simply closed his eyes.</p> 
 <p>And yet, it was in that exact moment that Bai Xiaochun’s eyelids twitched, and a shocking aura erupted out from inside of him!</p> 
 <p>His aura had only spread out for 300 meters before, but now it extended to 30,000 meters. And without even a slight pause, it reached 300,000 meters, and then 3,000,000….</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s aura, as well as his Essence power, rippled out, joined by the fluctuations of a sovereign.</p> 
 <p>That sovereign aura was like a drop of water flung into a vat of boiling oil. Intense rumbling sounds echoed out, and even as the Mortal Renegade’s hand approached, Bai Xiaochun’s aura became like a glowing shield that spread out in the sky. It covered the living people, the Arch-Emperor Dynasty, the five immortal domains, and all creation! And then, it made contact with the Mortal Renegade’s hand.</p> 
 <p>As the deafening sound of the impact filled all creation, Song Que’s eyes snapped open. He had sensed how Bai Xiaochun had placed a protective covering over the living beings in the Eternal Immortal Domains, and could now see the bright light shining off of him.</p> 
 <p>“It’s the Arch-Emperor!!”</p> 
 <p>“The Arch-Emperor is out of seclusion!!”</p> 
 <p>“Xiaochun….”</p> 
 <p>“Daddy….”</p> 
 <p>Countless cries of shock and joy filled the lands. At the same time, Bai Xiaochun slowly rose to his feet, his withered state rapidly fading away.</p> 
 <p>Then, he lifted his head… and opened his eyes!</p> 
 <p>As he did, a droning sound filled the Eternal Immortal Domains and the starry sky, a sound that everyone could hear, but whose nature they could not determine. All of the ruins out in the starry sky also thrummed with it, almost as if they contained countless natural and magical laws!</p> 
 <p>The fifty percent of the ruins in the starry sky that Bai Xiaochun controlled shone with blinding light that soon combined, driving the darkness away from those areas. Even the Dao clones began to thrum with the same sound!</p> 
 <p>However, the origin of the sound was none other than Bai Xiaochun’s true self, standing there in the Eternal Immortal Domains!</p> 
 <p>His eyes no longer contained irises and pupils, but rather, shone with a brightness that could look down on anything and everything in existence. The aura of a sovereign swirled around him, causing winds to scream, and shaking half of the starry sky!</p> 
 <p>The Mortal Renegade’s Dao was one of ultimate destruction, of nirvanic extermination. He wished to extinguish all light in the starry sky, and cast everything into complete darkness.</p> 
 <p>A Dao like that did not require the approval of any world. And in fact, no world even qualified to approve of it. It was a Dao which could propel someone into being the most powerful type of sovereign!</p> 
 <p>It was the same with Bai Xiaochun. His Dao woke life. He had scattered Daoseeds throughout the lifeless void, and then formed Dao clones whose light slowly illuminated the starry sky!</p> 
 <p>His Dao did not require the approval of any world, and in fact… there was no world that could qualify to offer approval. This was… the most powerful type of Dao!</p> 
 <p>When he broke out of the Archaean Realm and entered the Sovereign Realm, he was destined to become just like the Mortal Renegade… the most powerful type of sovereign!</p> 
 <p>“Mortal Renegade!” Bai Xiaochun did not focus his gaze on the enormous hand being blocked by the shield he had created. Instead, he looked further out into the starry sky, at the Mortal Renegade himself, who was looking down on him with a strange gleam in his eyes.</p> 
 <p>Their gazes locked for a moment as Bai Xiaochun finished rising to his feet. Then, he erupted with explosive energy, and a shocking, powerful aura. At that point, the Mortal Renegade’s hand, which was still touching the shield he had created, was struck, and forced backward!</p>
