 <p>Deck 2 of the ghost galleon was as silent as death. As the rocking chair slowly began to rock back and forth, a sensation of dire creepiness immediately filled Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>He shivered from head to toe, and almost couldn’t hold back from screaming.</p>
 <p>There was obviously nobody sitting in the chair, and yet, it was acting as if there were. Furthermore, Bai Xiaochun was almost certain that he could see the shadowy image of an old woman there, face pale, staring at him with a ghastly smile.</p>
 <p>“A ghost!!” Bai Xiaochun shrieked. Heart pounding, he reached out, grabbed Song Que and Master God-Diviner, and pulled them away with him as he rushed away from the rocking chair.</p>
 <p>His two companions seemed completely bereft of their senses. Their eyes were blank and their bodies were stiff, and they did nothing to resist Bai Xiaochun as he pulled them away.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the rocking chair began to rock back and forth with increased urgency.</p>
 <p>Even more shocking, the two corpses began to quiver, and glow with both golden and crystalline light.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun was wailing inwardly. The sight of the rocking chair going back and forth caused his scalp to tingle madly. Tossing both Song Que and Master God-Diviner into his bag of holding, he fled back to the staircase and ran up to the deck above.</p>
 <p>He moved with blinding speed, and within the blink of an eye, was at the top of the staircase. Just as he lunged past the last step, his vision blurred, and before he could even breathe a sigh of relief, his eyes widened as much as a cat’s whose tail had been stamped on.</p>
 <p>Shockingly, he found himself looking at two corpses and a rocking chair. He… was still on deck 2!!</p>
 <p>The rocking chair was rocking back and forth rapidly, and this time, it was to Bai Xiaochun’s utter shock that he could hear a strange moaning howl coming from it.</p>
 <p>“How could this be happening!?!?” Spinning in place, he ran back down the stairs, drawing upon both his cultivation base and fleshly body power. However, at the bottom of the stairs, his vision blurred again, and when he could see clearly again, he was looking at the corpses and the rocking chair!</p>
 <p>It was still deck 2!!</p>
 <p>Clearly, he would end up back on the same deck no matter what he did. By now, the rocking chair was rocking back and forth so vigorously that it was edging forward, as if it were trying to catch him!</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun was so scared he was about to collapse. Letting out a shout, he waved his hand, sending out a blast of air toward the rocking chair.</p>
 <p>However, the air simply passed right through it. By this point, he was sure that he was in a moment of deadly crisis. There was no time for thought or planning. He needed to get out of here immediately, before the rocking chair got too close to him and ended his life!</p>
 <p>“Time to go for broke!!” Yet again, he burst into motion, leaving a trail of afterimages behind as he raced back up the stairs. This time, though, he didn’t go to the end of the stairs. Instead, he clenched his hand into a fist, which caused a black vortex to spring into being!</p>
 <p>The air around him immediately distorted. It didn’t matter that he was in a ghost galleon in the Deadmire, there was still some energy of heaven and earth present. Thanks to the gravitational force created by the black vortex, that energy was sucked in, along with the power of his cultivation base, his qi and blood, and even his soul!</p>
 <p>A shadowy image appeared behind him, wearing imperial robes and an imperial crown. At the same time, a domineering aura erupted out.</p>
 <p>This was none other than… the Undying Emperor’s Fist!</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun was already in the great circle of the Undying Bones, and therefore, his urgent unleashing of this fist strike contained, not just the previous double level of power… but five times!</p>
 <p>Five times his normal fleshly body power gave him terrifying battle prowess that even late Deva Realm experts would gasp at.</p>
 <p>“Open up!!” he shouted, slamming his fist into the stairs!</p>
 <p>As he punched out with his fist, the shadowy emperor joined him, their fists superimposing in a massive attack!</p>
 <p>BOOOOOOOOOOOOM!</p>
 <p>A huge blast of wind erupted out, along with a roaring sound like that of an enormous dragon. As his fist landed on the staircase, it shattered like a mirror, and he leapt through the resulting hole.</p>
 <p>His vision swam, and when it cleared, he was in an unfamiliar location!</p>
 <p>Seeing that he was no longer on deck 2, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>“What the hell kind of place is this? I shouldn’t have come here! I shouldn’t even have come to the Deadmire!!” His heart was filled with regret, and he was finally starting to think that the gravekeeper had actually screwed him over. If he had known that the Deadmire had a weird ghost galleon like this, he would never have come here!</p>
 <p>However, he had few options at hand. Song Que and Master God-Diviner had clearly lost their minds; if he hadn’t grabbed them and put them in his bag of holding, they would probably still be back on deck 2.</p>
 <p>“What am I supposed to do…?” he thought, scowling on the verge of tears. Using the Undying Emperor’s Fist had drained his fleshly body power; thankfully, now that he was in the great circle of the Undying Bones, he didn’t feel dangerously weak like he had been in the past.</p>
 <p>Although he had just breathed a sigh of relief, that only lasted for a moment before he started to tremble again. His eyes widened, and his mind reeled with even more terror than before at the fact that… he was not on deck 2, or even deck 1!</p>
 <p>He wasn’t on any specific deck at all, but rather, a private cabin. It was… a woman’s dressing room!!</p>
 <p>The room contained a dilapidated bed covered with dust and spiderwebs, next to which was a vanity!</p>
 <p>The vanity looked ancient, and was also covered with dust. It also had cracks on its surface, and one of the corners looked like it had been chopped or broken off. Furthermore, closer examination revealed that there was also black, dried-up blood on it!</p>
 <p>There was a mirror propped up on the vanity, which was also covered with countless cracks. The strangest thing of all was that… the mirror was the only thing in the room that didn’t have even a speck of dust on it!</p>
 <p>The dressing room had only a bed, a vanity, and a mirror, nothing else. However, as soon as Bai Xiaochun looked around, he started to tremble violently.</p>
 <p>And that was because, as soon as he laid eyes on the vanity… he heard singing!!</p>
 <p>It was that same song about the mother whose arm was eaten by her own child!!</p>
 <p>He could hear the song with absolute clarity, as though it were being sung in the very room in which he stood.</p>
 <p>“Whoever you are, stay put! My apprentice is the Hell-Emperor!!” He felt like he was about to cry, and quickly turned to leave. Apparently, after having left deck 2, he ended up in the very nucleus of the entire ghost galleon!!</p>
 <p>This dressing room was where the singing originated!</p>
 <p>In fact, it came from the vanity!</p>
