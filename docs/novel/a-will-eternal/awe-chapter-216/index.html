<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Off to the side were Beihan Lie and Lu Tianlei, who had taken responsibility for keeping an eye on Nightcrypt. Their pupils constricted from the pure shock they felt at seeing the power of his divination magic.</p>
 <p>The area went deathly quiet, and all eyes were riveted on Bai Xiaochun. Bai Xiaochun stuck his chin up proudly, reveling in the astonishment.</p>
 <p>Master God-Diviner seemed nearly shocked to death, and was trembling on the verge of collapse. His discomfort and incredulity was like music to Bai Xiaochun’s ears.</p>
 <p>“How dare you try to compete with me, puny Master Snortsnort!” he thought. “Hmph! In any other sect it would have been impossible, but the Spirit Stream Sect is my home! Don’t tell me you're going to try to get me to do some more divinations? I could walk around with my eyes closed and not get lost!” Bai Xiaochun felt more wonderful than ever. His dream of always being the center of attention was being realized now more than ever.</p>
 <p>Just when Bai Xiaochun was about to step down from his pedestal of triumph, Master God-Diviner’s face twisted into a vicious expression, and he shrieked, “Hold on a second! Nightcrypt got lucky just now! Anybody can see that the violet qi rising from this immortal’s cave is beyond ordinary. I refuse to believe that he found it by divination!” All of a sudden, Song Junwan frowned, and the group from the Spirit Stream Sect hesitated, and began to wonder if a divination had truly been performed.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun immediately stopped in place and glared at Master God-Diviner.</p>
 <p>“Don’t believe me, huh? Fine! I’ll just have to convince you!” Snorting coldly, Bai Xiaochun closed his eyes. This time, he took even longer than before, and even as people’s suspicions deepened, he suddenly opened his eyes, which overflowed with bizarre, swirling light. His expression seemed even more solemn than before, and he even radiated a deathly, somber aura.</p>
 <p>His gaze settled onto a nearby immortal's cave, which he pointed at and said, “That immortal's cave was struck by lightning in the past!”</p>
 <p>Zhou Xinqi’s pupils constricted; the immortal's cave that he was pointing at had been hers when she was in the Inner Sect, and had been destroyed by lightning because of Bai Xiaochun’s pill concocting.</p>
 <p>She wasn’t the only one that realized this. The other cultivators from Fragrant Cloud Peak all remembered what had occurred, and their expressions flickered. The Blood Stream Sect cultivators were once again shocked. They couldn’t see any signs that lightning had struck the area, and yet clearly, the Spirit Stream Sect cultivators’ silence spoke volumes. Shockingly, Nightcrypt had yet again performed a successful divination.</p>
 <p>Master God-Diviner gritted his teeth and was about to offer a response, but Bai Xiaochun wasn’t finished. Expression flickering with odd light, he looked more closely at the immortal's cave and then took a deep breath in through his nose.</p>
 <p>“I can sense the lingering aroma of makeup! If my divinations are correct, this immortal's cave was not only struck by lightning, it belonged to a female disciple!”</p>
 <p>He swished his sleeve proudly. Then, to the shock of the surrounding cultivators, he performed an incantation gesture with his right hand and declared, “Furthermore, my divinations reveal that the female disciple was a top beauty in the sect! Hold on. Let me divine her name! She… she was a young woman surnamed Zhou!” He abruptly spun in place to look at the shocked Zhou Xinqi. After examining her closely, he pointed at her.</p>
 <p>“You! This was your immortal's cave!”</p>
 <p>The Spirit Stream Sect cultivators immediately cried out in shock and disbelief. Beihan Lie and Lu Tianlei gasped, and Big Fatty Zhang trembled even harder than before.</p>
 <p>Xu Meixiang’s eyes flickered with cold light. She wasn’t sure whether this Blood Stream Sect cultivator had actually performed a divination, or whether he had access to inside information. Either option was shocking in its own way, and killing intent toward Nightcrypt suddenly rose up inside of her.</p>
 <p>After a moment of silence. Zhou Xinqi’s gaze turned icy, and she nodded.</p>
 <p>That nod caused the Blood Stream Sect cultivators’ eyes to widen even further. As for Master God-Diviner, he felt like his mind was being struck by lightning, to the point where he didn't know what to say.</p>
 <p>“How could this be possible...?” he thought, trembling, mind reeling. He still couldn’t believe that what he was seeing was the truth. After all, he hadn’t sensed even a trace of a divination aura, and yet, Nightcrypt had obviously divined the information correctly.</p>
 <p>Song Junwan looked more enlivened than ever. Her background check into Nightcrypt had revealed that he occasionally performed divinations as an Inner Sect disciple, and yet, she could never have imagined that he would be even more powerful than Master God-Diviner.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun felt more proud of himself than ever at the reactions he was getting. Enlivened, he stepped forward and took the initiative to lead the group through Fragrant Cloud Peak. That role should have been taken by Xu Meixiang or Zhou Xinqi, but now, Bai Xiaochun would close his eyes, take a few steps, then open them and explain matters that left the Spirit Stream Sect in shock. Of course, Bai Xiaochun was careful to only reveal appropriate information, and nothing confidential.</p>
 <p>Stopping near a crack in a boulder, his expression turned serious, and he said, “And here... Eee!? The cracks in these stones seem odd. Hold on, let me perform a divination. Hmm, yes. It seems that snakes once emerged from these rocks. Lots of them! Tons in fact!</p>
 <p>“This place over here was also struck by lightning. Heavens! How many areas on Fragrant Cloud Peak got hit by lightning!?” He led the group along, stopping here and there to point out various locations.</p>
 <p>Eventually he reached 10,000 Medicines Pavilion. Looking around with a sigh of admiration and utmost respect, he said, “I can sense a powerful aura here. Apparently, some consummately powerful individual once stood in this exact spot, looking down upon all creation! He must have been the number one master of plants and vegetation!”</p>
 <p>Soon, they were at the Missions Office, where Bai Xiaochun let out an exclamation of shock. “Aha! This must be the Missions Office. At some point in the near past, a domineering individual swept through the missions here!</p>
 <p>“Eee? I can sense the aura of a bird here, some sort of a huge bird!</p>
 <p>“Something seems very odd here. According to my divinations, many chickens went missing from this location!!”</p>
 <p>As he led the group through Fragrant Cloud Peak, offering commentary here and there, the group from the Spirit Stream Sect was left more and more stunned. Everything he said was correct, without even a single mistake. It was almost as if Nightcrypt had once lived in the Spirit Stream Sect.</p>
 <p>Zhou Xinqi was left panting. Lu Tianlei and Beihan Lie saw the expression on her face, and were more shocked than before. As for Xu Meixiang, the coldness in her eyes grew more intense.</p>
 <p>The old woman from Irispetal Peak was equally shaken. The things that Nightcrypt were describing were all trivial matters, and yet it was still shocking that he knew so much information. People began to guess how he was doing it, and some of them even speculated that he might have infiltrated the Spirit Stream Sect at some point in the past!</p>
 <p>However, the Blood Stream Sect cultivators were aware that Nightcrypt had never been to the Spirit Stream Sect, which left them all completely shaken. Master God-Diviner felt like he was being inundated by lightning; he was completely taken aback. He could tell that the Spirit Stream Sect’s grand spell formation was activated, and would prevent even the slightest bit of augury magic. Even when he tried to release a bit of it, he felt like he was being suffocated. And yet Nightcrypt was so powerful that he could walk along performing auguries the entire way. Furthermore, he was using some sort of magic that Master God-Diviner couldn’t even detect. The casual way he went about it was completely and utterly shocking.</p>
 <p>Master God-Diviner even started to doubt his own abilities. To the people from the Blood Stream Sect, there was only one explanation; Nightcrypt had skill in divination that could shake heaven and earth.</p>
 <p>After touring the length and breadth of Fragrant Cloud Peak, Bai Xiaochun felt more pleased than ever. Everyone else seemed to be in a daze, even unsettled. It was at that point that Big Fatty Zhang looked over at Xu Meixiang and noticed a certain look in her eyes. Without any further hesitation, he stepped forward and pointed at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>“Senior Nightcrypt,” he growled. “Since you're so good at divination, why don’t you reveal some information about me!?”</p>
 <p>Everything went completely silent. The Blood Stream Sect cultivators looked over at Bai Xiaochun, and Master God-Diviner’s eyes suddenly began to shine.</p>
 <p>“Divining information about inanimate objects is easy.” Master God-Diviner chuckled inwardly. “Divining information about people is much more difficult. I refuse to believe that Nightcrypt could be so ridiculously powerful when it comes to divining information about people!”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun looked at Big Fatty Zhang, a strange expression on his face. Realizing that he couldn’t just back down now, he closed his eyes, and his expression turned solemn.</p>
 <p>Big Fatty Zhang was inwardly very nervous. However, Xu Meixiang had clearly indicated that he needed to test out Nightcrypt. As he looked at Nightcrypt there with his eyes closed, Big Fatty Zhang’s heart began to pound.</p>
 <p>After about ten breaths of time passed, Bai Xiaochun opened his eyes, and looked over at Big Fatty Zhang. Voice cool, he said, “You have a good life, young man. You come from a rich family, and will have incredible good fortune in the future.”</p>
 <p>Big Fatty Zhang was a bit taken aback. Bai Xiaochun hadn’t said much, and actually, there was no way to refute any of his words. Big Fatty Zhang looked over anxiously at Xu Meixiang.</p>
 <p>Although Xu Meixiang seemed to be smiling, her wariness of Nightcrypt was only growing. Strange expressions could be seen on the faces of the Spirit Stream Sect cultivators. The words spoken by Nightcrypt just now had been pleasing to the ear, and were virtually impossible to criticize.</p>
 <p>Gritting his teeth, Big Fatty Zhang said, “Your divination is--”</p>
 <p>“You used to be fat,” Bai Xiaochun interrupted. “Very fat. You started out in the Ovens, and then by chance you became an Outer Sect disciple. Hmm. Let me divine some more information. Yes.... You faced many twists and turns along the way, and came to be an Outer Sect disciple because of matters pertaining to profit!”</p>
 <p>Big Fatty Zhang gasped, and his hair stood on end as he looked at Bai Xiaochun. Almost all of his secrets had been instantly seen through.</p>
 <p>Everyone else from the Spirit Stream Sect stood there in shocked silence.</p>
 <p>Seeing how Nightcrypt had single-handedly astonished all of the Spirit Stream Sect cultivators, Song Junwan covered her mouth and laughed charmingly.</p>
 <p>“Everyone says that Bai Xiaochun from the Spirit Stream Sect is breathtaking and peerless with his Heaven-Dao Foundation Establishment,” she said. “However, from what I can see, Nightcrypt from the Blood Stream Sect, with a mere Mortal-Dao Foundation Establishment cultivation base, seems a complete match. Regardless of whether it’s his shrewdness, his cultivation base, or his latent talent, he seems just as stunning as Bai Xiaochun. What a pity that Bai Xiaochun is in secluded meditation, otherwise they could have a bit of a competition to see who is more spectacular.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s heart immediately began to pound. How could he possibly have a competition with himself? Have his left hand fight his right hand...?</p>
 <p>Looking down at his hands, he blinked a few times....</p>
