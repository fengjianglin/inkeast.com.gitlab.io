<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>“Although the Undying Codex and the Live Forever Codex aren’t technically connected in any way,” Bai Xiaochun murmured, “they still conform to the same general idea. Therefore, my third codex….</p>
 <p>“My memories of the past will be <em>Former Will!</em></p>
 <p>“My current Dao will be <em>Present Will!</em></p>
 <p>“And my upcoming destiny will be <em>Future Will!”</em> As he uttered these words, the enlightenment in his eyes grew clearer, and the blankness faded. Clarity began to take over.</p>
 <p>His voice thrummed in strange fashion, as if with the power of natural law. It seemed as though his voice existed around him, beyond the heavens, in the past, and in the future.</p>
 <p>Rifts opened up in the area, as well as a series of spinning vortexes. It was almost like a tempest, and yet, it was only visible within the blessed land, and nowhere outside!</p>
 <p>Anyone who might have been able to cast their vision into the blessed land would have been able to sense time twisting and distorting, flowing in a different way than in the world outside!</p>
 <p>It was as if the past, the present, and the future were all fusing together within that blessed land!</p>
 <p>It was impossible to truly describe or understand, and was profoundly shocking!</p>
 <p>The truth was that this technique Bai Xiaochun was making surpassed anything that anyone else could imagine. And if anyone could have it described to them, they would be deeply shaken.</p>
 <p>After all, celestials could temporarily reverse time, but they could only do so by means of certain Daoist magics. And in some situations, it was only possible with the help of an archaean emperor. But Bai Xiaochun… was essentially probing the Dao of time!</p>
 <p>As the rifts filled his blessed land, and the tempest raged with increasing intensity, Bai Xiaochun murmured, “Former Will. Present Will. Future Will…. When I master those three types of Will, then I will break through from the Celestial Realm and reach the Archaean Realm!</p>
 <p>“This codex describes time immemorial. Therefore, it will be called the Time Immemorial Codex!” Bai Xiaochun’s eyes shone as brightly as if they brimmed with lightning. Rumbling sounds filled the blessed land as Bai Xiaochun became what appeared to be an enormous black hole!</p>
 <p>It was a black hole that existed in a different dimension than the Eternal Immortal Domains. As it spread out, it didn’t affect the blessed land in even the slightest aspect!</p>
 <p>“From here on out, I cultivate… the Undying Live Forever Time Immemorial Technique!” He waved his hand, and heavenly thunder rumbled as the previously calm sky suddenly filled with flashing colors. Whether it was court officials submitting requests in the imperial palace, the three celestials, or the Saint-Emperor, all of them suddenly looked up into the sky.</p>
 <p>The officials suddenly had very ill premonitions, and as for the celestials, they began to pant in shock.</p>
 <p>“That aura… what kind of technique is Bai Xiaochun making?!?!”</p>
 <p>The Saint-Emperor’s eyes shone with scintillating light, and although he managed to remain calm, a faint scrap of killing intent appeared within his heart.</p>
 <p>“The Dao of time….”</p>
 <p>Of course, Bai Xiaochun was unaware of all of that. He was wrapped up in creating his technique. Although he was now clear as to the nature of it, he still had much to do in the way of analysis and augury.</p>
 <p>“The Time Immemorial Codex has three Wills, which cannot be created simultaneously. For now, I will work on that which comes from my past. I will use the countless memories of my life to feed my Daoseed. When that process is complete, the true Former Will will appear!</p>
 <p>“When that happens, then even if I am killed, and cease to exist, my Daoseed will still remain, along with my memories and my obsessions.” A smile broke out onto his face.</p>
 <p>“If I don’t take some of my Daoseed and give it to the Saint-Emperor, then I would have no hope of being resurrected. But with my Former Will, perhaps… to some extent, I will have achieved my Dao, and reached the point of being able to exist for all eternity.</p>
 <p>“In the Heavenspan Realm, I experienced death, and thus, in some ways I also experienced reincarnation. Therefore, the divine ability associated with my Former Will shall be…</p>
 <p>“The Sutra of Former Reincarnation!” All of a sudden, the light of augury faded from his eyes as he saw everything, from Mount Hood all the way to the destruction of the Heavenspan Realm!</p>
 <p>“Spiritual power. Divine abilities. Willpower. My memories… they are all expressions of power!</p>
 <p>“Henceforth, anyone who hears this sutra spoken aloud will find the memories of their lives transformed into magical sealing symbols. Those with deeper and more ancient memories will find the power of the magical symbols shocking to the extreme!</p>
 <p>“The Sutra of Former Reincarnation can destroy memories and eradicate minds!!” Bai Xiaochun rose to his feet, and in that instant, the black hole that seemed to exist in another reality expanded. In the blink of an eye, his blessed land seemed to fade, as though a shocking power was about to wipe it out of existence. A moment later, the air distorted, and everything went back to normal.</p>
 <p>Rippling fluctuations spread out in all directions, causing both the living entities they passed, and even the inanimate objects like buildings, to flicker back and forth between being blurry and being clear.</p>
 <p>Gu Tianjun and the other two celestials were still in the area, and were touched by the fluctuations. They had originally thought to evade them, but then decided that it would be a good way to test out the divine abilities and techniques that Bai Xiaochun had created, and perhaps get a sense for his battle prowess.</p>
 <p>However, as soon as the fluctuations reached them, their expressions flickered dramatically, and they retreated at full speed. After they were out of the range of the fluctuations, it was impossible for them to conceal the shock they felt.</p>
 <p>“Ordinary in terms of might, but the Daoist magic involved is peculiar to the extreme. It’s almost like I was just looking at my own past….”</p>
 <p>“What did I just see? It was like my own memories, come to life in front of me!” The three celestials exchanged very serious glances.</p>
 <p>Throughout the rest of the city, numerous cultivators felt their hearts pounding in fear. As for the Saint-Emperor, he retracted his vision, spent a moment in thought, and then prepared to issue a proclamation.</p>
 <p>However, even as he did, a boundless energy suddenly descended onto the Eternal Immortal Domains.</p>
 <p>Expression flickering, the Saint-Emperor suddenly vanished, to reappear high in the sky. He didn’t just hover there, he continued to rise higher and higher!</p>
 <p>Something was happening now that was more shocking to him than Bai Xiaochun’s cultivation base breakthrough, or the technique he was creating that was based on the Dao of time. Although other people would only be able to sense some faint pressure, as an archaean, the Saint-Emperor could tell that a very oppressive energy was approaching from the starry sky!</p>
 <p>Outside of the Eternal Immortal Domains, behind the body of the gargantuan sovereign, out in the boundless void, the massive, damaged fan that had responded to the vortex that Bai Xiaochun created upon becoming a celestial was approaching with incredible speed.</p>
 <p>As of this moment… it had entered the borders of the region considered the edge of the Eternal Immortal Domains. As it closed in, it adjusted its trajectory again, almost as if the shapeless vortex created by Bai Xiaochun was drawing it in!</p>
 <p>After these adjustments, the fan was not going to just brush by the Eternal Immortal Domains… it was going to hit them!</p>
 <p>More precisely, it was actually going to hit… the gargantuan sovereign right above them!</p>
 <p>It moved with incredible speed, unleashing powerful fluctuations. Furthermore, it was moving so quickly that it trailed flames as it moved!</p>
 <p>With every moment that passed, the fan got closer and closer to the Eternal Immortal Domains!</p>
