<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>The ravine split the lands apart, including even a mountain range. Currently, the intense rumbling sounds created by the hewing out of the ravine still echoed in the air.</p> 
 <p>Even the sky distorted, seemingly on the verge of cracking just like the earth below. Meanwhile, the blue light of the sword filled the ravine, rising up high like an enormous wall separating Bai Xiaochun and Gongsun Wan’er!</p> 
 <p>Behind Gongsun Wan’er were the Vile-Emperor Dynasty troops who wished to enter the prefecture to come to the aid of their compatriots. Currently, they were all edging backwards, looks of fear on their faces as they watched events playing out. After all, the insignificant Mistysea Prefecture was definitely not worth giving up their lives for.</p> 
 <p>Besides, if they really wanted to enter the prefecture, they could simply go to another location to attempt do so. There was no need to enter it right here.</p> 
 <p>But as a celestial, Bai Xiaochun’s intentions were key to everything. Clearly, he wanted to keep everyone out of Mistysea Prefecture, and therefore… no matter how they tried to get in, the result would likely be the same.</p> 
 <p>The only chance they might get would come if Ghostmother kept him busy. Then they might be able to engage the forces of the Grand Heavenmaster and Giant Ghost King.</p> 
 <p>But this enormous blue shield of light, and the greatsword Bai Xiaochun held in his hand, were shocking to the extreme. After all, he was one of only twelve celestials in the Eternal Immortal Domains, and was already quite famous.</p> 
 <p>“Is he holding… a world treasure?!”</p> 
 <p>“I heard that it was forged from one of the continents of the Heavenspan Realm….”</p> 
 <p>“Not every celestial has a world treasure. This means that King Heavenspan’s battle prowess is thirty percent greater than before!”</p> 
 <p>As the buzz of conversation spread, Gongsun Wan’er hovered there looking at Bai Xiaochun. A moment passed, and she smiled. However, the mysterious light didn’t leave her eyes. Waving her hand, she sent sinister ghost qi roiling out everywhere.</p> 
 <p>“Very well, sweetie. Let’s see how strong you are now that you’re a celestial!” Chuckling, she stepped off of her battleship, her red gown fluttering in the wind, as well as her long, black hair. She was stunning to look at, but at the same time, terrifying. The effect was only more pronounced when she licked her lips, which somehow caused Bai Xiaochun to think back to their last encounter.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Gongsun Wan’er performed an incantation gesture with her right hand and waved her finger at him, causing intense rumbling sounds to fill heaven and earth as a mist sprang up. Howling sounds erupted from within that mist as numerous ghost hands reached out toward Bai Xiaochun.</p> 
 <p>Then, she performed another quick incantation gesture and opened her mouth. Instantly, a bizarre sound filled the air. It was like the sobbing of a ghost, which caused everything in the area to twist and distort, and sent invisible sound waves flying toward Bai Xiaochun!</p> 
 <p>And yet, things weren’t over. She also thrust her right hand out, which began to grow larger and larger, transforming into the clawed hand of a ghost that snatched at Bai Xiaochun.</p> 
 <p>All of this takes some time to describe, but actually happened in the shortest of moments. Shaken, Bai Xiaochun once again chopped out with his greatsword, causing rumbling sounds to fill the air. Simultaneously, he stepped forward and unleashed the Undying Emperor’s Fist with his left hand. The ghost mist was vanquished, and Bai Xiaochun accelerated, using the Mountain Shaking Bash for a burst of speed. He was like a mountain peak in bodily form, appearing directly in front of Gongsun Wan’er and sweeping his sword toward her.</p> 
 <p>Shockingly, Gongsun Wan’er didn’t dodge out of the way, but instead, opened her mouth wider. In bizarre fashion, her mouth grew impossibly wide, transforming into a black hole that began to drag Bai Xiaochun toward it.</p> 
 <p>To Bai Xiaochun’s surprise, he felt his life force being sucked out of him.</p> 
 <p>“Are we really doing this, Gongsun Wan’er?!” he said, drawing on the Cloud Lightning Forefather Transformation. In the blink of an eye, he was 300 meters tall, and using his formidable fleshly body power to fight against the gravitational force.</p> 
 <p>Just when he seemed about to break free, Gongsun Wan’er chuckled.</p> 
 <p>“You tell me, sweetie.” Even as her words floated through the air, she blurred into motion, moving so quickly it was almost impossible to see her. At the same time, her left hand became illusory, as though it were made from a mysterious mist. Anyone who could see it would see something like a viper, complete with fangs and forked tongue, that closed in on Bai Xiaochun’s chest with lightning speed.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s expression flickered as he fell back. From what he could tell, killing intent really did flicker in Gongsun Wan’er’s eyes. It was actually somewhat frustrating. All he wanted to do in this venture was take Mistysea Prefecture. Unfortunately, this area in the north had been a point of contention between the Vile-Emperor Dynasty and the Saint-Emperor Dynasty for many years.</p> 
 <p>“You’re forcing my hand, Gongsun Wan’er!” He quickly performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, sending out power that could distort time. All of the dust and debris in the area was shoved away from him in bizarre fashion as he waved his hand at Gongsun Wan’er.</p> 
 <p>“Sutra of Former Reincarnation!”</p> 
 <p>“Dammit!!” Gongsun Wan’er blurted, her face falling. What she feared most about Bai Xiaochun was not his world treasure greatsword, but rather, this divine ability!</p> 
 <p>She had ways of handling the greatsword, but this marvelous divine ability that was somehow connected to time itself was something she didn’t know how to deal with. That was why she had taken the initiative in the fight, in the hopes that she could prevent him from unleashing it.</p> 
 <p>But Bai Xiaochun’s progress in the Celestial Realm was shocking, to say the least. Only a short time had passed, and he was already very close to the peak of the early Celestial Realm. Therefore, she immediately fell back. Unfortunately for her, she didn’t understand how this particular Daoist magic worked. Once it was unleashed, it was almost impossible to evade!</p> 
 <p>In the shortest of moments, Bai Xiaochun finished waving his finger, and countless flickering magical symbols appeared around Gongsun Wan’er. Instantly, Gongsun Wan’er began to tremble, and a dazed look appeared in the depths of her eyes!</p> 
 <p>It was almost as if her memories were being extracted and transformed into magical symbols!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaochun could see that Gongsun Wan’er was trapped by the magical symbols, and that she was looking dazed. And he didn’t actually want to hurt her. After all, that could cause problems in the future, and he didn’t want to damage their relationship permanently.</p> 
 <p>“I guess it only took that one move!” he thought. Not bothering with the fact that there were a lot of people around to see, he flew over to Gongsun Wan’er, reached his hand up, and to the wide-eyed shock of the people from the Vile-Emperor Dynasty, he spanked her rear end.</p> 
 <p>The smacking sound echoed out in bizarre fashion, causing all onlookers’ minds to go completely blank.</p> 
 <p>Gongsun Wan’er shivered, and in her daze, tried to struggle.</p> 
 <p>“Bai Xiaochun!!” she screamed. Somewhat frightened, Bai Xiaochun spanked her again, causing her to spasm.</p> 
 <p>“Give me Mistysea Prefecture. Okay?” he yelled.</p> 
 <p>“You’re… completely shameless….” she began. With that, he spanked her again, leaving the Vile-Emperor Dynasty cultivators flabbergasted beyond belief.</p> 
 <p>Eventually, Gongsun Wan’er’s dazed expression turned into complete blankness. Seeing that, Bai Xiaochun let loose another flurry of spanks. It was at this point that Gongsun Wan’er apparently unleashed some sort of secret magic. A whoosh could be heard as her entire body transformed into black smoke, which shoved Bai Xiaochun away and then shot off into the distance.</p> 
 <p>“You just wait, Bai Xiaochun!!” she shrieked from within the smoke. However, she didn't dare to stick around any longer, and continued off into the distance.</p> 
 <p>Somewhat shocked, Bai Xiaochun cleared his throat, and then looked over at the cultivators from the Vile-Emperor Dynasty. After blinking a few times, he flew back to the mountain peak and sat down, as sober as ever. He even tried to look a bit cold and merciless.</p> 
 <p>The Vile-Emperor Dynasty people exchanged awkward glances, and then slowly retreated. They really had no other option. Ghostmother was gone, so their presence was irrelevant. Besides… all of them could see that apparently, Bai Xiaochun and Ghostmother… had a very strange relationship….</p>
