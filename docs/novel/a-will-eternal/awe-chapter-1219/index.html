 <p>As Bai Xiaochun made his breakthrough, the Arch-Emperor Dynasty was on high alert. Masses of cultivators stood guard outside of Arch-Emperor City, ready to fight to the death against any potential invaders!</p> 
 <p>It was a day of utmost importance to the citizens of the Arch-Emperor Dynasty. Today… the emperor’s children came into the world!</p> 
 <p>When the sound of a baby crying echoed out from the imperial palace, the large group of devas who were standing guard directly outside erupted into cheering. Soon, the cheering spread to the countless other citizens in the city at large.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaochun opened his eyes. Forgetting all about his newly developed technique, he rushed over to find Song Junwan’s midwife rushing out of that wing of the palace, flanked by a whole entourage of female cultivators, and holding a baby!</p> 
 <p>“Congratulations, Your Majesty,” she said, hurrying over. “May I present your daughter!” With that, she carefully handed the baby over to Bai Xiaochun.</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaochun couldn’t stop his hands from trembling as he gently accepted the baby. Moments ago, she had been crying, but as soon as she was in his arms, she looked at him, her little eyes sparkling like stars. Then she laughed.</p> 
 <p>It was a crisp, clear little laugh that seemed like the rising sun. As soon as Bai Xiaochun heard it, his heart melted!</p> 
 <p>“My daughter! This is my daughter! Bonuses! Everybody gets a bonus to their salary!” Laughing contentedly, he began to walk around randomly, staring at his daughter the entire time. He almost looked like a child. Then he hurried into Song Junwan’s wing of the palace, where he found her laying on her bed, her face a bit pale.</p> 
 <p>“Junwan, look! It’s our daughter!” Bursting with excitement, he began to pace back and forth. His daughter seemed a bit startled at first, but then started laughing again. She seemed excited, so much so that if her hands weren’t bound with swaddling, she might have started clapping.</p> 
 <p>To everyone present, her cute laughter sounded like the most natural thing in the world.</p> 
 <p>Song Junwan looked at the baby in Bai Xiaochun’s arms, a motherly smile on her face. Then she glared at Bai Xiaochun.</p> 
 <p>“Aren't you a bit old to be acting like a kid?!”</p> 
 <p>By this time, Li Qinghou, the Grand Heavenmaster, the Giant Ghost King, and many other familiar faces had gathered outside of the imperial palace. Soon, word spread that a little princess had been born. Li Qinghou threw his head back and laughed loudly, and the Grand Heavenmaster was visibly excited, as was everyone else. The Giant Ghost King seemed particularly pleased.</p> 
 <p>“A daughter!” he thought. “Good. That means Zimo’s standing will be a bit more secure!”</p> 
 <p>Word began to spread through the city, and eventually out of the city. Before long, everyone in the Arch-Emperor Dynasty was talking about the news.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, in another section of the palace, Zhou Zimo was being attended to by her midwife and a host of other female cultivators. Bai Xiaochun had not forgotten about her, but was too excited to leave Song Junwan and his daughter, whom he had already fallen in love playing with. Of course, Song Junwan knew that he had other important responsibilities to attend to, and in a rare show of warmth, eventually shooed him away.</p> 
 <p>Moved, he kissed the top of her head, and held his daughter in his arms as he headed toward Zhou Zimo’s wing of the palace.</p> 
 <p>Almost as soon as he reached his destination, he heard the crying of a baby, a cry that was even more sonorous than his daughter’s. It was almost like thunder! Even more startling, it caused all cultivators in the Arch-Emperor Dynasty who had the blood of the Heavenspan Realm within them to feel physically shaken!</p> 
 <p>It was a reaction from the blood itself, and even affected Bai Xiaochun. Shaken, he stopped in place, his eyes wide as he looked over at Zhou Zimo’s room. Shockingly, a pillar of crimson light could be seen from that direction, rising up into the heavens!</p> 
 <p>All the lands trembled, and the clouds seethed. At the same time, the aura of the Undying Codex spread out in all directions, causing numerous citizens to gasp, and then reflexively drop to their knees to kowtow.</p> 
 <p>“Damn… quite the showoff, huh…?” For some reason, Bai Xiaochun suddenly felt a bit jealous.</p> 
 <p>“You’ve just been born, and you’re already making such a big scene? Nothing like that ever happened for me…. And how come that aura seems to have surpassed the level of the Undying Skin? You’re already in the Undying Heavenly King level?” Even as these thoughts ran through his head, his daughter, seemingly startled, began to cry again. This time, her crying was different than before, and almost seemed defiant. It seemed to contain power that could pierce all the way to one’s soul, and represented something that could live forever. It was the type of power that could tug at the hearts and minds of countless individuals, and could sow chaos in heaven and earth!</p> 
 <p>Even more shocking was that, in addition to the crimson pillar of light shining up into the sky, the image of a Live Forever Lamp appeared in the sky above his daughter, which seemed to rival the pillar of light in terms of magnificence!</p> 
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s eyes nearly popped out of his skull, and he almost dropped his daughter. If he was jealous because of the aura of Zhou Zimo’s child, then he almost couldn’t breathe when he realized what kind of aura his daughter had.</p> 
 <p>“The Live Forever Codex!!” His mind was spinning with incredulity at the fact that his daughter innately possessed the aura of the Live Forever Codex.</p> 
 <p>“Are they kids, or monsters?!” he murmured. Meanwhile, the Grand Heavenmaster and other important figures were visibly stunned. But then, their shock turned into excitement!</p> 
 <p>“Your Majesty, with children like this, our Arch-Emperor Dynasty will last for all eternity!!”</p> 
 <p>Amidst the cheering, Bai Xiaochun looked down at his daughter, and then in the direction of Zhou Zimo’s room, and a smile broke out on his face.</p> 
 <p>“Ah, whatever. If these little buggers are awesome, then so be it! In fact, I hope they surpass me! That way I can eventually retire and spend my days having fun instead of being an emperor!” Already entranced with the thought, he hurried over to Zhou Zimo’s room. As he did, the door opened and the midwife emerged, baby in her arms.</p> 
 <p>“Congratulations, Your Majesty. May I present your son!”</p> 
 <p>“Bonuses! Salary bonuses for everyone!” Laughing, he held his daughter in one arm and his son in the other, and danced with joy. It was almost as if he had forgotten that he was in the imperial palace. Then, he hurried in to see Zhou Zimo, who looked weak, but in high spirits.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, his daughter was still crying, and now his son was crying even louder. It was nearly painful to the ears, and no matter how Bai Xiaochun tried to soothe them, they wouldn’t stop. Somewhat annoyed, Zhou Zimo waved at the midwife to intervene. However, Bai Xiaochun refused any help.</p> 
 <p>“If they want to cry, let them cry! What's wrong with crying? I love them whether they cry or not.” Zhou Zimo didn’t know what to say to that. Having placated her, Bai Xiaochun rushed out excitedly with his children in his arms to find Li Qinghou, the Grand Heavenmaster, and everyone else who was waiting outside of the palace.</p> 
 <p>“Uncle Li! Grand Heavenmaster! Look, my kids!” Bursting with enthusiasm, he proceeded to show off his children to the crowd.</p> 
 <p>“Eldest Brother, come take a look! Hey, Xu Baocai, Master God-Diviner! What do you think? Look, my kids!”</p> 
 <p>Everyone was laughing delightedly, especially the Giant Ghost King. Although he put on a show of looking at Bai Xiaochun’s daughter, his eyes were glued to his grandson, and he was clearly itching to hold him.</p> 
 <p>As for Li Qinghou, his heart was swelling with emotion. Bai Xiaochun had been like a child of his own, and therefore, these two children were like grandchildren to him. “Xiaochun, have you thought of names for the two of them?”</p> 
 <p>“Names?” Bai Xiaochun looked down first at his daughter, his eyes shining with pride. “Of course&nbsp;I came up with some. Alright, everyone. What do you think of the names I came up with?”</p>
