<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Li Feng really was extremely confident in himself. He could tell that Bai Xiaochun had an extraordinary cultivation base, but he didn’t care. The fact that he had the power of ten-colored flame on his side made him fully confident in being able to look down on almost anyone in the same cultivation level as himself.</p>
 <p>He was a necromancer who relied mostly on soul fire when it came to magical combat. As long as his opponent wasn’t a higher ranked necromancer than himself, and had a similar cultivation base, then he was confident in being able to secure victory.</p>
 <p>Li Feng looked down at Bai Xiaochun, chuckling coldly in his heart, completely confident that as long this opponent of his wasn’t completely foolish, he wouldn't dare to cause problems.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun frowned as he looked up at the openly aggressive Li Feng. At the same time, the words being spoken by the onlookers reached his ears. As far as Bai Xiaochun was concerned, Li Feng was being far too overbearing. Obviously, he was pulling out a ten-colored flame in an attempt to steal Bai Xiaochun’s thunder!</p>
 <p>Shaking his head inwardly, Bai Xiaochun couldn’t help but think that Li Feng didn’t match up to him at all. “This Li Feng has a Core Formation cultivation base, but his personality clearly doesn’t match. We cultivators should emphasize inner qualities, and should refrain from bombastic showboating. Even if you want to show off, you shouldn’t do it in such crude fashion.”</p>
 <p>At the same time, he was wondering whether he should just exterminate him with a single blow, or show him by example what it meant to make a big scene.</p>
 <p>As he tried to decide what to do, the two soul cultivators from the Blackmountain Tribe began to make vague requests of Bai Xiaochun to return the soulhoarding pagoda. Considering that he could only conjure seven-colored flame, whereas Li Feng could conjure ten-colored flame, it seemed obvious who was in the superior position.</p>
 <p>However, they kept their requests extremely vague, as they didn't want to offend Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun simply ignored them, prompting Zhou Yixing to clear his throat and whisper, “This is not the type of person you want to mess with, exalted one. Why don’t we just back off...?”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s glare intensified. More displeased than ever, he decided that it was indeed time to show, not only Li Feng, but everyone else present, what it meant to make a scene!</p>
 <p>“I hate it when people try to show off in front of me!” he thought. Sticking his chin up and looking around with disdain, he waved his hand to produce a tongue of seven-colored flame.</p>
 <p>The instant the seven-colored flame appeared, strange looks could be seen on the faces of the savages and the two soul cultivators. As for Li Feng, he chuckled softly and said, “I think you’ve bitten off a bit more than you can chew.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun snorted. “Li Feng, when you run into necromancers in the Wildlands, you would do well to hold back from saying things like that. You should really take this advice of mine to heart.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The words sounded very profound and meaningful, and coupled with the way his hair floated around him and his clothing rippled in the wind, it made him seem very elegant and beyond ordinary.</p>
 <p>There was something archaic to his voice, something that echoed about in heaven and earth. It almost seemed rueful, as though he were thinking back to memories of the past. The entire picture he presented was instantly etched deeply into the minds of those present.</p>
 <p>“Allow me to elaborate,” he continued. “You see, in a situation like this, you have no idea who exactly you are dealing with, and no clue as to what incredible individual you might be facing.” Shaking his head, he waved his left hand, causing a vast quantity of vengeful souls to pour out from the soulhoarding pagoda.</p>
 <p>As soon as the souls appeared, Bai Xiaochun threw the seven-colored flame out in front of him, causing it to spread out into a sea of fire. Then, he sent the vengeful souls pouring inside.</p>
 <p>It happened very quickly. In the blink of an eye, rumbling sounds could be heard as the sea of flames rushed back into Bai Xiaochun’s palm, transforming into a single entity. It was... a tongue of flame with an additional color!!</p>
 <p>It had become eight-colored flame!!</p>
 <p>All of the savages looked over with wide eyes.</p>
 <p>“Eight-colored flame! He... he just conjured flame!!”</p>
 <p>“The wave of a hand turned seven-colored flame into eight-colored flame. This... this....”</p>
 <p>The two soul cultivators were completely shaken. They had seen necromancers conjure flame in the past, but had never seen anyone do it as casually as Bai Xiaochun just had. He had moved with utmost fluidity, seemingly transforming seven-colored flame into eight-colored flame with almost no effort!</p>
 <p>They weren’t the only shocked ones. Up in midair, Li Feng was equally stunned. After all, when he conjured eight-colored flame, it was always a very difficult process. All of a sudden, he had a very bad feeling, and almost lost control of his facial expression. Chuckling coldly, he said, “You must have had a lot of practice with eight-colored flame, right? So what if you’ve been stuck at that level for a long time? You still don’t qualify to stand in front of me!”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun looked up at Li Feng, his expression placid as he said, “If eight-colored flame isn’t enough for you, how about nine-colored flame?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Casually waving his hand, he spread the eight-colored flame out into a sea of fire, then sent more vengeful souls pouring out of the soulhoarding pagoda. No time passed at all before the sea of flames began to swallow up the souls.</p>
 <p>Despite the speed with which it happened, there was obviously some pattern involved in the way that the souls were fed into the sea of flames. Then, Bai Xiaochun slowly closed his palm into a fist, causing the sea of fire to fall back in upon itself within his grasp. After the fire was all contained between his fingers, he opened his hand again, revealing a flame with... nine colors!!</p>
 <p>“Nine-colored flame!!” The savages were no longer stunned, but were left gasping in shock. The two soul cultivators' eyes were popping out of their heads, and they were panting, their minds reeling out of control.</p>
 <p>Li Feng was beginning to shake as he stared at the flame in Bai Xiaochun’s hand. The casual way that he had conjured the nine-colored flame was something that Li Feng had never seen before, and left him feeling as if unprecedented levels of pressure were weighing down on him. It seemed almost unimaginable that someone could conjure nine-colored flame with such ease.</p>
 <p>If he wanted to conjure nine-colored flame, he would have to go into secluded meditation and spend significant time clearing his thoughts before making an attempt. And even then, he wouldn’t succeed every time.</p>
 <p>“This is impossible....” he muttered, panting.</p>
 <p>“Nothing is impossible,” Bai Xiaochun said with a slight shake of his head. “Just because you think something is hard doesn’t mean that everyone will feel the same. I mean, it’s just nine-colored flame, that's all....” Looking as calm as ever, he sent more vengeful souls flying out of the soulhoarding pagoda, filling everything within a 300 meter area and forcing the crowd to back away as his nine-colored flame spread out into a raging sea.</p>
 <p>It was a shocking sight. The vengeful souls merged into the sea, a process which took a few breaths worth of time, after which Bai Xiaochun once again closed his palm into a fist.</p>
 <p>Within moments, the raging sea of fire had shrunk down and was hidden within his hand.</p>
 <p>Everyone was devolving into madness at Bai Xiaochun’s performance, which made him seem like the ultimate ruler of flame! It was as if all types of fire would capitulate and acknowledge allegiance to him!</p>
 <p>“Even ten-colored flame isn’t really a big deal!” Bai Xiaochun said, smiling faintly. When he opened his hands, all faces fell as scintillating light exploded out in all directions to reveal... ten-colored flame!</p>
 <p>Furthermore, this ten-colored flame seemed particularly vibrant and lively, its heat so intense that the air rippled, almost as though it were about to ignite!</p>
 <p>Everyone in the area was forced to back up again, expressions of profound shock on their faces as they looked at Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>Clearly, Li Feng’s ten-colored flame was much dimmer than Bai Xiaochun’s. Despite being of the same level, it was obviously weaker by far!</p>
 <p>Along with the appearance of the ten-colored flame came shocked exclamations from the savages, expressions of complete and utter astonishment.</p>
 <p>“The peak of the master necromancer rank!!”</p>
 <p>“Heavens, Grandmaster Bai... is actually at the peak of the master necromancer rank!”</p>
 <p>The two soul cultivators were completely stunned, and looked like they had seen a ghost. Never in their wildest imaginations could they have guessed that Bai Xiaochun would conjure a ten-colored flame, the quality of which clearly surpassed that of Li Feng’s.</p>
 <p>Li Feng was shaking visibly, and his hair was already disheveled. As he stared at the flame in Bai Xiaochun’s hand, his mind began to turn into a blank.</p>
 <p>“Impossible. This is just impossible....” Moments ago, he had been hovering there with a feeling of complete superiority, but now he suddenly found that there was someone present who was far superior to himself.</p>
 <p>Zhou Yixing was similarly shocked. He had known before that Bai Xiaochun could conjure ten-colored flame, and yet, the flame currently dancing in his palm caused Zhou Yixing’s heart to pound wildly.</p>
 <p>“Is... is that really ten-colored flame? I've never seen ten-colored flame that dazzling....” Zhou Yixing looked up at Bai Xiaochun’s face, terror written on his own.</p>
