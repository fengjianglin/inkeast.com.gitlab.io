<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Bai Xiaochun was certain that he had just looked over at that corner and seen nothing, but now, there was a rabbit standing there....</p>
 <p>Even more frightening was that the rabbit's ears were clearly pointed directly at Bai Xiaochun as if it had been listening to him just now. Most terrifying of all was that the rabbit was staring directly at him.</p>
 <p>From the look in its eyes, it was waiting for him to finish his sentence....</p>
 <p>He and the rabbit stared at each other for a moment, and then the rabbit burst into motion, speeding toward the main entrance of the immortal's cave. Bai Xiaochun shouted and leaped to block its path, but the rabbit was too fast.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun could only stare with wide eyes as it vanished out the door.</p>
 <p>By this point he felt like he was about to go crazy. He knew that he could very well lose his head over this. If the talking rabbit said the wrong thing, and people found out he was Bai Xiaochun, he would definitely be killed....</p>
 <p>Although he'd only spoken half of a sentence, that half sentence was very dangerous, and he didn’t even dare to think of what the consequences might be. Sweat began to drip down his face and neck. He almost considered staying inside and just letting the rabbit say what it wanted. He could scarcely believe that, despite how careful he had been, and how often he had checked his surroundings, the rabbit would manage to show up so unexpectedly. He wasn’t even sure how much of what he'd said it had heard.</p>
 <p>“I'm gonna kill you!!” he cried, bursting out of his immortal's cave. However, even as he emerged, he saw the talking rabbit standing on top of a nearby tree, speaking.</p>
 <p>“Nightcrypt, you two-timer. Did you forget our pledge of undying love? Did you forget our affection for each other? Why did you change so much…?”</p>
 <p>The talking rabbit’s voice was quite loud, and echoed out in all directions, causing quite a few Foundation Establishment cultivators to look over in shock.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s jaw dropped. He wasn’t sure who might have said such a thing, but he was now certain that the rabbit had been following him around for quite a while. Spine tingling in fear, he howled, throwing all caution to the wind. Instantly, his right hand flashed with an incantation gesture, and he pointed out, causing blood qi to transform into sword qi that sped toward the rabbit.</p>
 <p>It was no ordinary sword qi, it was Bai Xiaochun’s Undying Sword Qi, and as soon as he unleashed it, the blood qi in the area was thrown into chaos. At the same time, the sword qi sped through the air, slashing into the tree and completely destroying it. In the nick of time, the rabbit flew out of the tree and sped off in the opposite direction.</p>
 <p>“Outrageous!” the rabbit bellowed as it raced along. “It's just a bit of blood qi, isn’t it? I'm a Foundation Establishment cultivator of the Blood Stream Sect! I can’t believe you people are trying to kill me! Are you trying to get me to leave the sect!?”</p>
 <p>Bellowing, Bai Xiaochun flew after it, unleashing another blast of sword qi, which slammed into a blood cistern that the rabbit was passing, destroying it.</p>
 <p>“Hmmmphhh! If I absorb this blood qi secretly, nobody will ever realize it was me....</p>
 <p>“Eee? It looks like this immortal's cave is vacant....</p>
 <p>“They’re trying to kill me. They’re trying to kill me!!”</p>
 <p>The rabbit continued to spit out lines of dialogue as it ran along. At the same time, rumbling sounds echoed out as Bai Xiaochun chased after it, unleashing one blast of sword qi after another, destroying everything around the rabbit.</p>
 <p>The plants and trees were slashed to pieces, and even buildings were destroyed. Middle Peak was instantly thrown into chaos. Foundation Establishment Dharma protectors poured out, to find Bai Xiaochun chasing a rabbit and unleashing countless blasts of sword qi.</p>
 <p>Some of them were slow to react, and when the rabbit ran by them, were hit by the blasts, causing blood to spray from their mouths.</p>
 <p>“What are you doing, Nightcrypt?!?!”</p>
 <p>“Dammit! Do you have a death wish, Nightcrypt!?”</p>
 <p>“I let you get away alive all those months ago, and now you dare to show your face!?”</p>
 <p>The Foundation Establishment cultivators were enraged, and yet, so was Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>“Shut the hell up, all of you!” he bellowed, his eyes bloodshot. By this point, he had decided that he must kill the rabbit no matter what happened. Hands flashing in a double-handed incantation gesture, he unleashed more blasts of sword qi.</p>
 <p>The rabbit dodged back and forth, scurrying about in such a fashion that not a single bit of sword qi touched it. As for the Foundation Establishment cultivators, they flew up into the air to attack Bai Xiaochun. Master God-Diviner was in the crowd, smiling coldly. As far as he was concerned, Nightcrypt was obviously a fool to have gotten so worked up over a mere rabbit.</p>
 <p>“I like this rabbit,” he murmured to himself. “It’s very interesting. I wonder whose pet it is?”</p>
 <p>Some distance away, Song Que was in secluded meditation beneath the blood waterfall. Suddenly, his eyes opened, and he frowned. A moment later, though, he simply closed his eyes again and continued meditating.</p>
 <p>At this point, the rabbit suddenly stopped next to a random immortal’s cave and yelled out in a voice even louder than before.</p>
 <p>“I, Bai Xiaochun--” It almost seemed to roar the words at the top of its lungs. The surrounding Foundation Establishment cultivators looked on in shock, and their pupils constricted. Bai Xiaochun was quite famous in the Blood Stream Sect, and virtually anyone would try to kill him if they got the chance. Killing a Chosen from the Spirit Stream Sect, especially one who had reached Heaven-Dao Foundation Establishment, would count as a huge service to the sect.</p>
 <p>To hear this rabbit suddenly talking about Bai Xiaochun caused everyone to look at it eagerly, hoping to hear what it would say next about him.</p>
 <p>However, the rabbit simply stood there with a blank look on its face, not saying another word.</p>
 <p>Trembling inwardly, Bai Xiaochun bellowed, “I, Nightcrypt, cannot stand to live under the same sky as Bai Xiaochun. How dare you mention him in front of me! Tell me this instant where Bai Xiaochun is!!”</p>
 <p>With that, he waved his right hand, causing another blast of sword qi to shoot out. This one was even more powerful than before. As it closed in on the rabbit in a beam of bright light, the rabbit blurred into motion to dodge it. As a result, the immortal's cave behind it was struck by the sword qi and immediately began to collapse. Inside the immortal's cave was a blood bottle and a spell formation. Thanks to the massive blow, the blood bottle immediately shattered.</p>
 <p>Of course, that immortal's cave belonged to Xuemei, and was the location where everyone had recently attacked Bai Xiaochun. Afterward, Xuemei had stabilized the blood bottle to keep it safe, but now it had been destroyed.</p>
 <p>“I, Bai Xiaochun--” the rabbit bellowed. However, it didn’t say anything beyond those three words.</p>
 <p>Blinking, Bai Xiaochun’s mind raced to come up with an idea of what to do. Trying to look as furious as possible, he shouted, “Keep talking! What comes after that!?”</p>
 <p>Then he continued to chase the rabbit, unleashing sword qi that slashed into the ground, destroying immortal's caves, but not harming the rabbit.</p>
 <p>“I, Bai Xiaochun--” The rabbit was starting to get anxious, and yet, it had nothing else to say.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun was starting to relax.</p>
 <p>“Dammit! Why won’t you finish that sentence!” he shouted. All of a sudden, he realized that he had pulled a fast one on the rabbit, who was now unable to say anything other than the first three words of the sentence.</p>
 <p>“I, Bai Xiaochun--” howled the rabbit, its eyes bright red.</p>
 <p>“Tell me immediately!” Bai Xiaochun raged. “Is Bai Xiaochun in Blood Stream Sect territory!? My grudge with him goes all the way back to the Fallen Sword World! I can’t live under the same sky as him! Bai Xiaochun must die!”</p>
 <p>Inwardly, he was feeling very proud of himself, and he couldn’t help but be pleased at how smart he was. With that, he unleashed another blast of sword qi, destroying another immortal's cave.</p>
 <p>“Tell me! Tell me right now! What comes after the first part of that sentence!”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun had thrown all of Middle Peak into complete chaos. As for the rabbit, it was getting very anxious, and had even started trembling. Finally, it started to say more than the three words.</p>
 <p>“I, Bai Xiaochun.... Xuemei, I dreamed of you last night. One of these days, I, Master God-Diviner, will definitely make you mine!”</p>
 <p>“I, Bai Xiaochun.... Elder Fang, stop it! People might see us....”</p>
 <p>“I, Bai Xiaochun.... I, Song Que, am in charge here, aunt! The position of blood master belongs to <em>me</em>. And I’m in charge of you too, Xuemei!”</p>
 <p>The words being spoken by the rabbit caused all of Middle Peak to be rocked with astonishment. The Foundation Establishment Dharma protectors and elders looked on with odd expressions, and soon, everyone went completely quiet....</p>
 <p>Only the voice of the rabbit could be heard, echoing about.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun also looked shocked, and suddenly he worried that he had pushed the rabbit too far.</p>
 <p>Master God-Diviner was there in the crowd, and to him, it felt like a cold chill was running up his spine. Suddenly, he also wanted to exterminate the rabbit.</p>
 <p>“Shut up!! That’s complete nonsense!!”</p>
 <p>As soon as Master God-Diviner lunged forward, Bai Xiaochun looked over at him with a strange expression, surprised at the information that the rabbit had just revealed. Did Master God-Diviner really fancy the masked shrew Xuemei?</p>
 <p>“That’s right,” he cried, “this rabbit is full of crap!”</p>
 <p>Master God-Diviner wasn’t the only one to leap into action. Everyone who the rabbit mentioned began to tremble, and then flew out to kill it.</p>
 <p>Even Song Que came speeding out from the blood waterfall, howling at the top of his lungs, looking like a blood-colored god as he unleashed deadly power.</p>
 <p>“Shut up!!” When Song Que thought about the fact that everyone on Middle Peak had heard what the rabbit just said, he was filled with the desire to rip the thing to pieces.</p>
 <p>The rabbit actually took advantage of the frenzy to vanish. Even after searching for it for some time, Bai Xiaochun couldn’t find it. Although he was feeling much better than before, he made sure that his expression turned grimmer and grimmer.</p>
 <p>“That rabbit is an abomination!” he said loudly. “I can’t believe it never finished that sentence!” Relieved, he was just about to head back to his immortal’s cave when he suddenly got a very uneasy feeling. That was when he realized that all of the Foundation Establishment cultivators who had been chasing the rabbit were now staring at him.</p>
 <p>Song Que’s eyes brimmed with murderous intentions. Although he hated the mysterious rabbit, the person he hated more was the one who had obviously forced the rabbit into unleashing a torrent of dialogue: Nightcrypt!</p>
 <p>Master God-Diviner had a similar look on his face. Many of the other cultivators present had either been injured or had their immortal's caves destroyed by Bai Xiaochun’s sword qi. As of this moment, their desire to kill Nightcrypt was raging out of control.</p>
 <p>“Nightcrypt, you destroyed my immortal's cave! It’s about time we settle accounts.”</p>
 <p>“You escaped last time, but now, you’re gonna die!”</p>
 <p>“Nightcrypt!!”</p>
 <p>New grievances piled onto old ones. The surrounding Foundation Establishment cultivators unleashed the power of their cultivation bases and prepared to eradicate Bai Xiaochun.</p>
