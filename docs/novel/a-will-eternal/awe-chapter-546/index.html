 <p>Booms echoed back and forth in the tunnel as the true power of the Eternal Parasol was put on full display. Not a single one of the eighteen soul arrows harmed it in the least, and although Bai Xiaochun couldn’t see the bizarre face on the top of the parasol, Zhou Yixing could.</p>
 <p>To Zhou Yixing, the smiling face looked hair-raisingly terrifying, and even reminded him of the red hats from before.</p>
 <p>“What the hell kind of parasol is that!?” he thought, his scalp tingling. As for the frigid qi in the area, it was so cold that he felt himself shivering inside.</p>
 <p>It was a moment of deadly crisis in which Zhou Yixing’s eyes shone with madness as he flew backward. This time, instead of summoning soul arrows, he pulled a new type of arrow out of his bag of holding!</p>
 <p>It was bright red and emanated intense heat, which caused the frigid qi in the area to tremble on the verge of collapse. When Bai Xiaochun saw it, his expression flickered.</p>
 <p>“What... what is that...? Why does it feel so much like nine-colored flame?!? No, wait. Could that be a ten-colored flame...? Aiieee....” Bai Xiaochun was completely stunned that Zhou Yixing would have a precious object like this on him.</p>
 <p>What made Bai Xiaochun even more nervous was that at one glance it looked like an arrow, but a moment later, it actually looked like it was made from fire!!</p>
 <p>It was almost as if it existed in a state between corporeal and illusory! Even more extraordinary was that Bai Xiaochun spotted... a golden design on the surface of the arrow!!</p>
 <p>“Golden design....” Although he initially wasn’t certain what that golden design was, it sent his mind spinning, and within moments, he had reached a conclusion.</p>
 <p>“That’s... a precious treasure which has received an elevenfold spirit enhancement!!”</p>
 <p>A tenfold spirit enhancement led to ten silver designs, but the mark of an eleventh spirit enhancement was a single golden design!!</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s speculation was correct. That arrow... was none other than a fire soul arrow with an elevenfold spirit enhancement!</p>
 <p>Zhou Yixing felt that he had no other choice than to pull out this trump card of his that he had been hoping to save for some other occasion. It was a special item given to him by his clan to use as a last-ditch line of defense!!</p>
 <p>It was a precious treasure with an elevenfold spirit enhancement, which, in combination with his ninefold spirit enhanced greatbow, was capable of killing Nascent Soul cultivators!</p>
 <p>The fact that he was resorting to this arrow showed how much Zhou Yixing wanted to kill Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>“Time to die, Bai Xiaochun!” he roared as he knocked the arrow to the bow. Meanwhile, Bai Xiaochun’s hair was standing on end, and his pupils were constricted as a sensation of deadly crisis swept through him.</p>
 <p>As of this moment, he was convinced that this arrow... could most definitely kill him!!</p>
 <p>There was no time for thought or planning. As Zhou Yixing drew the bow, Bai Xiaochun let out a shout and opened his third eye. Instantly, Zhou Yixing shivered, and a confused expression appeared on his face as the hand he was using to draw the bowstring back suddenly stopped moving.</p>
 <p>In that same moment, rumbling sounds could be heard as Bai Xiaochun used the Living Mountain Incantation, and also stretched his hand out to call upon his Waterswamp Kingdom!</p>
 <p>As the area around him turned into a watery swamp, he pulled his frigid qi back in, causing a tempest to rage around him. And yet, things weren’t over yet. The power of the Undying Live Forever Technique surged around him, pushing his fleshly body power to the limit.</p>
 <p>All of these things take some time to describe, but actually happened in the briefest of moments. A moment later, the star sigil on Zhou Yixing’s forehead erupted with starlight, breaking him free from Bai Xiaochun’s control. As sweat began to drip down his face, he released the bowstring. Then, a thrumming sound could be heard... as a fire soul arrow with an elevenfold spirit enhancement flew forth!</p>
 <p>The instant it left the bow, it transformed into a huge fire dragon, extremely lifelike in appearance. As the dragon shot toward Bai Xiaochun, it ran into the frigid qi tempest, shattering it, and then continued forward until it ran into a huge spike that was rising up from the ground.</p>
 <p>As a deafening boom rocked the corridor, Bai Xiaochun leapt into the air, transforming into an enormous stone golem. Extending his right hand, he unleashed the Mountain Shaking Bash and then the Throat Crushing Grasp, using all the power of a living mountain and his fleshly body in one massive attack.</p>
 <p>After all, this arrow could kill a Nascent Soul cultivator, and therefore, he had no hope of being able to evade it!</p>
 <p>His only hope now... was to capture it!</p>
 <p>As his Gold Core spun rapidly, a black light suddenly flashed out from inside of him as his turtle-wok appeared to block the fire soul arrow.</p>
 <p>A huge boom echoed out as the two connected, and the fire soul arrow even let out something like a miserable shriek as a shockwave rolled out. However, because all of these things were happening so quickly, and because Bai Xiaochun’s current position blocked Zhou Yixing’s line of sight, he couldn’t see exactly what was happening.</p>
 <p>Just when the fire soul arrow was about to collapse into pieces, Bai Xiaochun used the power of his fleshly body and the strength of a living mountain, as well as the force of the Mountain Shaking Bash and the Throat Crushing Grasp, to reach out and grab the throat of the fire dragon. Then, the might of the Undying Hex surged out to prevent the arrow from exploding!</p>
 <p>Massive rumbling filled the tunnel, and the intense shockwave that spread out caused blood to spray out of the mouth of Zhou Yixing as he tumbled backward like a kite with its string cut, his expression a mix of disbelief and shock.</p>
 <p>How could he ever have guessed that his fire soul arrow, which could kill a Nascent Soul expert, would be grabbed by Bai Xiaochun!?</p>
 <p>As soon as Bai Xiaochun laid his hand on the fire soul arrow, his Waterswamp Kingdom spike collapsed, and his frigid qi faded away. His stone golem form shattered, and he was revealed, coughing up a cloud of blood.</p>
 <p>He was thrown backward, his layers of armor disintegrating into ash, and yet, his hand held fast onto the arrow. The struggling fire dragon roared and fought, but in the end... it shrank back down into an arrow!</p>
 <p>“Impossible!!” Zhou Yixing cried, his eyes nearly popping out of his skull. Panting as a sensation of deadly crisis filled him, he looked at the unbelievable scene playing out in front of him, his heart filled with terror. Finally, he drew upon the star sigil on his forehead, which began to pulse with the power of teleportation.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun slowly looked up, his eyes bloodshot, his killing intent burning as he took a step forward. “Time to die, Zhou Yixing!”</p>
 <p>That step almost seemed to land directly on Zhou Yixing’s heart. He trembled visibly, and let out an involuntary shriek. If his fire soul arrow couldn’t kill this opponent, then what could? Mind spinning and having no time to think, he pushed down onto his forehead, causing a massive burst of starlight to pour out of his star sigil, which wrapped around him and teleported him away.</p>
 <p>He didn’t dare to do anything other than flee. At the moment, the mere thought of Bai Xiaochun left him terrified.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun coughed up a mouthful of blood as Zhou Yixing was whisked away, after which his jaw dropped.</p>
 <p>“I can’t believe he ran away so quickly. I didn’t even get to finish coughing up that blood....” As soon as Bai Xiaochun had sensed the power of teleportation coming from Zhou Yixing’s star sigil, he had intentionally coughed up some blood to try to make himself look weak. His plan had been to trick Zhou Yixing into staying behind, and then show off how powerful he really was.</p>
 <p>Ideally, he would have ended up killing Zhou Yixing. However, in defiance of all his expectations, Zhou Yixing didn't even wait for him to cough up the blood before vanishing.</p>
 <p>Sighing, Bai Xiaochun pulled out a Godly Vestige Pill and consumed it. As he began to recover from the fight, he looked down at the arrow in his hand and then began to laugh merrily.</p>
 <p>“I probably shouldn’t kill this Zhou Yixing anyway. Every time we fight, he ends up giving me a precious item. Nine-colored flame. A soul arrow with an elevenfold spirit enhancement. Hahaha! Hmm... there’s also that bow of his.” Having reached this point in his train of thought, he excitedly thought back to the fight which had just played out.</p>
 <p>The arrow had been incredibly powerful, so much so that he had been terrified of it. If it wasn’t for his use of his Heavenspan Dharma Eye and the protection of the turtle-wok, he would either have been captured, or absolutely destroyed!</p>
