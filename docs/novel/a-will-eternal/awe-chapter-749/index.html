<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>When Little Wolfgod slammed into the ground, a huge boom echoed out, and cracks spread out in all directions. As Little Wolfgod lay there, soaked with blood and completely unmoving, all of the other chosen in the area gasped in astonishment.</p>
 <p>Before they could do anything, the enraged Bai Xiaochun vanished as surely as a ghost, to reappear in front of two other soul cultivators.</p>
 <p>“You two get down there too!” he shouted angrily. The two soul cultivators prepared to fight back, but instantly realized that their Nascent Souls had been destabilized, and their cultivation base power was weakened. Even as they shouted out in alarm, booms rang out as Bai Xiaochun struck their shoulders with his fist. Cracking sounds could be heard as numerous bones were broken, and they were sent down screaming to slam into the ground next to Little Wolfgod.</p>
 <p>Things weren’t over yet, though. Bai Xiaochun’s fury was now fully ablaze. It would be the same with anyone who watched the shop they had toiled tirelessly over be reduced to rubble. Besides, now that he had been given the go-ahead by the Giant Ghost King, he wasn’t scared of anything.</p>
 <p>Obviously, he wasn’t even close to being done. He next appeared in front of a middle-aged chosen from one of the aristocratic clans, whose face immediately drained of blood as he began to back up.</p>
 <p>“Do you truly dare to kill me, Bai Hao?!”</p>
 <p>“No, I don’t!” Bai Xiaochun replied in an enraged shout. Of course, the words he spoke caused the middle-aged man’s jaw to drop. Then, Bai Xiaochun was on top of him, his right hand moving with lightning speed to grab the man by the neck and hurl him down to the ground.</p>
 <p>A boom rang out as blood sprayed from the man’s mouth. His Nascent Soul had almost been crushed, and immediately tumbled out from inside of him. At the same time, his five yin organs and six yang organs were shattered, and he lapsed into unconsciousness.</p>
 <p>“You think I'm an idiot or something? Killing you would be a waste of plenty of nice life force!” Bai Xiaochun was of the impression that his words were particularly impressive and went to show how incredibly mighty he was. Just when he was about to make another move, the dozens of people in the area finally started to recover from their initial shock at Bai Xiaochun’s terrifying actions so far.</p>
 <p>All of these people had impressive cultivation bases. Although some of them were only in the Core Formation stage, they were top chosen from their clans, people who surpassed ordinary people at the same cultivation level. Although Bai Xiaochun was clearly mighty, it only took a moment before people started to cry out.</p>
 <p>“Attack together!”</p>
 <p>“Even if this Bai Hao was more powerful than he already is, it’s not like he’s superhuman!”</p>
 <p>“He’s aroused public wrath, so we definitely have to make him pay the price!”</p>
 <p>Dozens of people rotated their cultivation bases and performed incantation gestures to unleash divine abilities. Multi-colored light formed something like a huge wave that surged toward Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>Within those magical techniques were three soul dragons, as well as numerous tornadoes. There were streams of blade light and sword projections, and even something like a huge peacock, whose tail turned into streams of glowing swords that shot through the air toward Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>Further off in the distance were forty or fifty people who had not yet arrived at the scene of the fight, who were using magical items to shoot at top speed toward Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>Behind them were even more people, all rushing in the same direction. Clearly, Bai Xiaochun was thoroughly surrounded.</p>
 <p>It was a deadly trap!</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun was fully aware of the situation, and it caused his eyes to turn even more bloodshot than before. There was no time for thought or planning. Even if he tried to flee from the situation, he would be blocked by the crowd surrounding him.</p>
 <p>There was only one option. And that was… to fight!!</p>
 <p>He was now relying on his Tempered Bones and powerful defensive powers to fight against a virtual army of chosen cultivators!</p>
 <p>Taking a deep breath, he reached out with his right hand, revealing the Eternal Parasol. Of course, because of the powers of his mask, it looked like something completely different.</p>
 <p>Without any hesitation, he opened the parasol and thrust it forward to meet the wave of magical techniques and divine abilities. Whether it was the dragons, the tornados, the blade light, the sword projections, or anything else, they were all blocked by the power of the Eternal Parasol.</p>
 <p>A tremor ran through Bai Xiaochun, and his eyes turned more bloodshot as he was shoved back a few paces, placing him right next to Little Wolfgod and the other three cultivators he had knocked down out of the air. Without pausing for a moment, he stabbed the Eternal Parasol into them, one after another.</p>
 <p>Miserable shrieks rang out from their mouths as they regained consciousness to find their fleshly bodies withering up, and their life force pouring into the Eternal Parasol. After the life force was then passed into Bai Xiaochun, his place within the eighth stratum of the Tempered Bones grew higher.</p>
 <p>Little Wolfgod had experienced this same thing before, but the other cultivators had not. They had only heard of Bai Hao’s vicious methods.</p>
 <p>As for Little Wolfgod, he had it a bit better off considering that this was his second time. After the incident in the Necromancer Kettle, his clan had used numerous methods to help him recover the lost life force. But now that the entire thing was happening again, the bitterness and regret in his heart reached indescribable levels.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s method of using the Eternal Parasol to defend against the attacking magical techniques, and then absorb life force from Little Wolfgod and the others, worked perfectly. He took the life force in one smooth move, and then burst into action again.</p>
 <p>The Mountain Shaking Bash exploded out, turning him into a series of afterimages and sonic booms. Then he slammed into a Nascent Soul cultivator, who coughed up a mouthful of blood as he was thrown backward. It was at this point that a particularly reckless and foolish Core Formation cultivator off to the side waved his finger in Bai Xiaochun’s direction. Instantly, a green, fist-sized pearl shot into the air toward Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s expression flickered; the sudden appearance of this pearl caused a strange feeling to rise up within him. Obviously, this pearl was no ordinary item. As it neared, he performed an incantation gesture with his left hand and then waved his finger, causing control power to wrap around the pearl and fling it back in the direction it had come from.</p>
 <p>The Core Formation cultivator’s face fell as he realized that it was too late to try to flee. When the pearl slammed into him, it shattered, creating a green toxic gas of a sinister nature that immediately caused the entire area around the cultivator to twist and distort. Miserable screams rang out for the space of two breaths of time, after which the cultivator… had been reduced to nothing but blood and gore!</p>
 <p>He had been destroyed in body and soul!</p>
 <p>The surrounding cultivators gasped, and down below, Little Wolfgod’s eyes began to shine brightly!</p>
 <p>“He's started killing people, huh…?”</p>
 <p>An unsightly expression could be seen on Bai Xiaochun’s face as well. He hadn’t set out to kill anyone. Although the explosion of the seventeen-colored flame had resulted in a few deaths, this mob was the one coming after him. He couldn’t truly be held accountable for either of those situations. However, he also knew that the clans of the people he had killed would not accept such an explanation.</p>
 <p>His current situation was different from the Necromancer Kettle. Back then, he had been able to flee into the mists if he wanted. Furthermore, no soul cultivators from the elder generation had been present to interfere.</p>
 <p>Now, he was in Arch-Emperor City, and everything was different. There was nowhere to hide, and furthermore, it wouldn’t be long before people from the elder generation showed up. That was why he had sent his message to the Giant Ghost King, and also why he had tried hard not to kill anyone.</p>
 <p>But now… he was out of options.</p>
 <p>“Fine, killing it is. So what?!?! You think that just because the tiger doesn't roar, it means it’s a fluffy kitten or something? I didn’t want to kill anybody, but you’re leaving me no choice!” This group of cultivators had destroyed his home, and because of that, killing intent finally appeared in his eyes. He was like a celestial warrior, or a primeval beast as he… unleashed killing moves!</p>
 <p>More rumbling sounds could be heard as numerous magical techniques and divine abilities closed in. As they did, Bai Xiaochun clenched his hand into a fist, unleashing a fist strike that sent a sound wave out in all directions. Then, he was in front of another soul cultivator, whom he stabbed with the Eternal Parasol and sucked dry of life force!</p>
 <p>He didn’t pause for a moment. Flashing into motion, he began to absorb more life force. Not a one of the dozens of soul cultivators in the area were a match for him at all. No amount of magical techniques or divine abilities seemed capable of doing anything to him, nor of piercing the defenses of the Eternal Parasol.</p>
 <p>Wherever he went, he cut through his enemies like a hot knife through butter!</p>
 <p>The glow of blood and fire illuminated all heaven and earth!</p>
