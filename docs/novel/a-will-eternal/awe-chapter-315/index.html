<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>The grand ceremony to commemorate the founding of the River-Defying Sect was now over. However, the events which had just occurred became a daily topic of conversation among the countless people who inhabited the eastern Lower Reaches of the cultivation world.</p>
 <p>Whether it was the Dharmic decree of the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect, or the fact that Bai Xiaochun had been conferred the title of junior patriarch, it all left an indelible impression upon the minds of the people regarding the power of the River-Defying Sect.</p>
 <p>Soon, the bustle in the temporary headquarters began to die down as the cultivators of the River-Defying Sect departed.</p>
 <p>The Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect’s response to the River-Defying Sect’s request indicated that a new war was on the horizon. The four divisions of the River-Defying Sect took that war very seriously, and for many people in those sects, it was the culmination of their life’s work!</p>
 <p>They would be fighting to establish a new sect headquarters, to rise from the Lower Reaches into the Middle Reaches. It was a war of utmost importance!</p>
 <p>There were many preparations to be made, and all of the various patriarchs agreed that they needed to go all out, to hold nothing back!</p>
 <p>The Pill Stream Division and the Profound Stream Division returned to their former territories to prepare everything for departure, including their reserve powers....</p>
 <p>According to the agreement that had been reached by the patriarchs, they would head to the Blood Stream Division in two months’ time. From there, they would set out onto the Heavenspan River, and head upstream toward the Sky River Court!</p>
 <p>As the divisions left their temporary headquarters, Bai Xiaochun had various sect matters to attend to due to his status as the junior patriarch. On one particular evening, the founding patriarch of the Spirit Stream Division had a long discussion with him.</p>
 <p>The discussion was held in a grand hall, along with Patriarch Ironwood and the other Nascent Soul patriarchs. Also present were Zheng Yuandong and Li Qinghou.</p>
 <p>Before beginning to speak, the founding patriarch waved his hand, sealing the entire area so that their words would remain private. Even more surprising to Bai Xiaochun was that the other patriarchs all lent their power to the sealing. Clearly, they were being very cautious.</p>
 <p>In a final display of caution, the founding patriarch produced a Feng Shui compass, which, upon activation, sent black and white light streaming out to form yet another sealing layer.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun could sense terrifying pressure coming from that Feng Shui compass. Although it looked ordinary, and even a bit worn, he could tell that it contained a level of power similar to the reserve powers of the sects.</p>
 <p>However, the compass was so dilapidated that it apparently only had the strength left to seal down an area, and nothing more.</p>
 <p>When the sealing was done, the founding patriarch sighed and looked over at Bai Xiaochun, a very serious expression on his face. “This Immortal-Executing Compass was passed down by the ancestors. With it here, not even a Deva Realm expert would be able to eavesdrop on us, at least not without expending significant effort.</p>
 <p>“Xiaochun, the information I’m about to tell you must be kept completely confidential. If word spread, it could lead to a complete and utter disaster!”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun was already starting to get anxious, and was actually wondering if it would be better to not hear this information. After all, it meant that in the future, the mere slip of the tongue on his part could result in him losing his poor little life. Even as he hesitated over the matter, the founding patriarch continued.</p>
 <p>“We didn't originally intend to reveal these matters to you, but since you are now the junior patriarch of the River-Defying Sect, there are some things that can’t be kept secret. If certain events played out in the future, and you weren’t aware of the truth, it could cause problems for you.”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun could only focus, take a deep breath, and look intently at the founding patriarch.</p>
 <p>“Our Spirit Stream Division's origins do not lie in the eastern cultivation world!” Not even paying attention to Bai Xiaochun’s reaction, the founding patriarch looked up, a gleam of reminiscence flickering in his eyes. “We come from the northern cultivation world, from a riversource sect that was called the Frigid School!”</p>
 <p>“What?” Bai Xiaochun said, immediately shaken. Never could he have imagined that the founding patriarch would have something like this to say. To find out such information about the origins of the Spirit Stream Sect came completely out of the blue, leaving Bai Xiaochun a bit taken aback. Furthermore, when the founding patriarch mentioned the Frigid School, it instantly caused him to think about the Frigid School Medicine Manual.</p>
 <p>“Long ago, the Frigid School was the dominant sect at the mouth of the river in the north. It was just as prominent as the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect. However, because of an unexpected rebellion, the Frigid School collapsed and was supplanted. The survivors had no other choice but to swallow their humiliation and flee for their lives. Eventually, they came to the eastern cultivation world, where they set down new roots!</p>
 <p>“Only two survivors actually made it here. One of them was my Master, and the other was the true spirit of the Frigid School!</p>
 <p>“My Master secretly helped the Spirit Stream Sect become one of the four major sects in the Lower Reaches. As for that true spirit, she is the true reserve power within the Spirit Stream Division!” The other patriarchs in the hall maintained silence. As for Zheng Yuandong and Li Qinghou, both of them had looks of solemnity and shock; apparently, this was also their first time hearing this information.</p>
 <p>“However, the true spirit was gravely injured, and could do little more than sleep in the form of a frigid corpse. In all the years that have passed, she has never awakened. The only method to awaken her is to use something called the River-Defying Pill. With that medicinal pill, the true spirit can be temporarily awakened to resolve virtually any crisis.</p>
 <p>“The truth is that back when we were about to go to war with the Blood Stream Sect, our final hope rested in the true spirit. Unfortunately, we only have one River-Defying Pill, and can use it only in the absolutely direst of circumstances!” As the founding patriarch spoke, his words seemed to contain a profound level of ancientness.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s heart was already reeling from the waves of shock that pounded against it. He could hardly even breathe steadily.</p>
 <p>“Over the years, we have tried every possible method to concoct another River-Defying Pill. Unfortunately, all such efforts have failed. After we get back to the headquarters, I need you to go offer formal greetings to the true spirit, and also, think of a way to concoct a River-Defying Pill, <em>before&nbsp;</em>we get to the Middle Reaches!</p>
 <p>“If you can, then the Spirit Stream Division will be able to provide crucial assistance to the River-Defying Sect as a whole!!” Anticipation shone in the eyes of the founding patriarch as he looked at Bai Xiaochun. As for Bai Xiaochun, he took a deep breath; his mind was spinning, and he almost couldn’t believe what he was hearing. After a moment, he thought back to the formula for the River-Defying Pill.</p>
 <p>His research into the pill had led him to the conclusion that it was very, very strange. It was only now that he realized that it was specifically intended to help a true spirit.</p>
 <p>“The River-Defying Pill and the Frigid School Medicine Manual,” he murmured.</p>
 <p>The founding patriarch nodded. “A Senior member of the sect gave those two items to you.”</p>
 <p>“It was that monkey, wasn’t it?” Bai Xiaochun asked suddenly.</p>
 <p>After a moment of hesitation, the founding patriarch nodded. Suddenly, numerous puzzle pieces clicked into place in Bai Xiaochun’s mind.</p>
 <p>The matter at hand was a weighty one, and he needed more time to digest all the information. After leaving the hall, he returned to his spirit abode, still marveling in disbelief at everything he’d heard. Settling down, he pulled out the Frigid School Medicine Manual, as well as the formula for the River-Defying Pill, which he began to study closely.</p>
 <p>“River-Defying Pill....” he murmured softly. He was suddenly extremely curious about the true spirit the patriarch had mentioned, and very much wanted to see what she looked like.</p>
 <p>The following day, the last of the Profound and Pill Stream Divisions left. As for the Blood Stream Division cultivators, they were still making preparations for departure. They had something very important to do back in the former location of their sect.</p>
 <p>Before leaving, the arch-patriarch came to find Bai Xiaochun, who was still ruminating over the information about the origin of the Spirit Stream Division. As Bai Xiaochun would soon find out, the information the arch-patriarch had to share was just as shocking as the information he had learned from the Spirit Stream Division.</p>
 <p>The arch-patriarch quickly set up a spell formation seal, then looked over at Bai Xiaochun, his expression very serious as he said, “Xiaochun, do you know where our Blood Ancestor came from?”</p>
 <p>“Huh? Where the Blood Ancestor came from?” Bai Xiaochun was taken aback, and couldn’t help but wonder why these two sects had so many secrets. Both of them had impressive backgrounds, the truth of which left him reeling.... He was almost in a daze as he looked at the arch-patriarch.</p>
 <p>The arch-patriarch sighed disappointedly. “Oh, so you don’t know. I’d assumed you would have learned something when you accepted the legacy....”</p>
 <p>All Bai Xiaochun could do was smile wryly in response.</p>
 <p>“Well, the truth is that none of us know the true origins of the Blood Ancestor, so let’s not worry about that for now. The Blood Stream Sect researched the Blood Ancestor for many years. Eventually, that research led to our theory regarding the legacy of the Blood Lord. Now we know that we were correct. All of those years of research paid off.</p>
 <p>“However, there was more to the theory. Based on all of the research, we are fairly certain that the body of the Blood Ancestor can still move!!”</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s eyes were getting wider and wider. Never could he have imagined that the body of the Blood Ancestor could be controlled and moved. Then he thought back to how he had temporarily felt himself take over the body of the Blood Ancestor back when he had received the legacy, and he began to pant.</p>
 <p>“The body of the Blood Ancestor is enormous, and exists mostly beneath the surface of the Heavenspan River. You are aware of the grand spell formation set up on the five mountain peaks that are the five fingers of the Blood Ancestor, correct? The true function of that spell formation is to allow the Blood Stream Division to control the body of the Blood Ancestor!” Bai Xiaochun immediately thought back to when Patriarch Limitless and Xuemei had tapped into the spell formation on Middle Peak to influence the blood qi in the area.</p>
 <p>After becoming a blood master, Bai Xiaochun had been able to directly sense the spell formation; it almost seemed like a set of clothing that existed on the surface of the Blood Ancestor.</p>
 <p>By this point, he was starting to understand what the Blood Stream Division was planning to do.</p>
 <p>“Succeeding at such a task will be extremely difficult, and the Blood Stream Sect prepared years to do just that. We have even set up spell formations inside of the Blood Ancestor’s body. However, up til now, we have been missing a core element!</p>
 <p>“We need someone who can take all of the blood qi from all of the cultivators of the Blood Stream Division and focus it together. That is the power that can be used to control the body of the Blood Ancestor. According to our research and speculations, only the Blood Lord can do such a thing!</p>
 <p>“My hope is that you will return to our headquarters, enter the body of the Blood Ancestor with us, and take control of it! Then we will head up the river and launch our assault on the Sky River Court!</p>
 <p>“With the help of the Blood Ancestor, the River-Defying Sect’s chances of successfully defeating the Sky River Court will be greatly increased!” The arch-patriarch’s eyes were glowing with a profound light; after all, this was everything he had worked toward throughout his entire life.</p>
 <p>After a long moment of silence, Bai Xiaochun nodded. He was also filled with anticipation at the thought of controlling the body of the Blood Ancestor. The arch-patriarch smiled, then made arrangements for exactly when to take Bai Xiaochun inside the Blood Ancestor. Afterward, he left with the rest of the Blood Stream Division to go back and make the necessary preparations.</p>
 <p>A few days later, the Spirit Stream Division forces began to depart. Bai Xiaochun joined them as they left the city, and it was only then that he was certain that no one else was going to come reveal more secrets to him.</p>
 <p>“So many secrets....” he thought, sighing. He was a bit proud of himself. Obviously, he was the type of person who people trusted enough to share secrets with.</p>
