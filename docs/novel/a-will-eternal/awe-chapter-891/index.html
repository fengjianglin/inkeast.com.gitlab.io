 <p>“How is this even possible!?” Chen Hetian gasped, his mind spinning. The three divine abilities which had just been unleashed were powerful trump cards, any one of which should have been fully capable of inflicting grievous injuries on someone in the early Deva Realm.</p>
 <p>Because of how seriously they viewed Bai Xiaochun, they hadn’t hesitated to join forces and unleash such high-level techniques. The fact that Bai Xiaochun had killed Patriarch Starry River was only secondary as far as they were concerned. What was more shocking was how afterward, he used one magical technique after another to fight back against them!</p>
 <p>Bai Zhentian was flabbergasted, and at the same time, had a very bad feeling. Li Xiandao was reacting similarly, and realized that, although he had accepted from the beginning that this enemy was powerful, he had actually completely underestimated him.</p>
 <p>“Dammit! This guy isn’t an Earth-Dao deva!!” That was what all three devas were thinking. However, there was no time for thought or planning; the enormous face of Bai Xiaochun which filled the heavens had already driven away their will, and was now causing immense pressure to weigh down on them!</p>
 <p>They began to fall back, madness gripping their hearts. By this point, Bai Xiaochun had come to realize that his will had driven away the wills of the other devas, and was causing pressure to weigh down on them.</p>
 <p>After his breakthrough, he had sensed himself fusing with heaven and earth. However, in the urgency of the moment, he had been able to do little more than fight back against his opponents.</p>
 <p>But now, as his energy surged, and his face filled the sky, he finally felt… what it was like to be a deva!</p>
 <p>Devas could completely fuse with heaven and earth, whereupon their every action would draw upon the power that existed in creation around them. A single breath could absorb spiritual power from vast distances. In fact, it would be very difficult for someone in the Deva Realm to actually run out of spiritual power under ordinary circumstances.</p>
 <p>It was for that reason that some trump cards which required vast amounts of spiritual power could actually be used over and over again in quick succession by devas. For example, Bai Xiaochun’s Waterswamp Kingdom. In the past, it had been difficult for him to use that technique twice in a row, but now, things were very different.</p>
 <p>And yet, that was of secondary importance. More importantly, he could fuse with heaven and earth, effectively becoming the will of the heavens. His thoughts became the thoughts of the heavens! If he wished to punish his enemies, then the heavens wished to punish them as well!</p>
 <p>That was the highest realm that devas could reach… Deva Shapes Heavenly Will!</p>
 <p>Rumbling sounds echoed out as Bai Xiaochun’s face grew larger, thunder rumbled, and the ground quaked in all directions.</p>
 <p>The faces of the three devas’ flickered as sensations of profound crisis filled their hearts. Yet again, they fell back. However, they were in the mid Deva Realm, and had been devas for many years. They had extensive experience in combat, and thus were able to suppress their fear, and use their moment of retreat to perform incantation gestures, unleashing divine abilities with incredible speed.</p>
 <p>Blood qi erupted from Chen Hetian, transforming into an enormous blood-colored giant, who wielded a long, blood-red spear. Howling, the giant charged straight toward Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>Bai Zhentian was just as fast in his actions. Clouds roiled out from his hands, becoming a nine-story pagoda that crushed downward toward Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>The strangest technique of all belonged to Li Xiandao. When he extended his right hand, a sword appeared in it, and at the same time, his eyes suddenly went blank, as if he were unconscious. However, he suddenly accelerated with blinding speed, becoming a beam of sword light that stabbed toward Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>The attacks of the three devas shook heaven and earth, and left everyone in the River-Defying Sect reeling in fear and anxiety. Many of them even began to pray in their hearts.</p>
 <p>It was almost too much for many people to process mentally. However, only enough time had passed for a spark to fly off of a piece of flint. Meanwhile, Bai Xiaochun’s eyes flashed, and his energy surged. He took a step forward, simultaneously clenching his hand into a fist!</p>
 <p>All creation shook as a black hole appeared! That black hole seemed to suck in all of Bai Xiaochun’s fleshly body power, and all of his life force. Although he didn’t look any different physically, he felt like he was being torn apart inside. In the blink of an eye, everything about him was gone. At the same time, the enormous face up in the sky grew dim and difficult to see.</p>
 <p>The only thing of him left behind… was the fist inside of that vortex!</p>
 <p>As soon as the fist appeared, the faces of the three devas fell, and a sensation of imminent peril rose up in them that surpassed anything from before.</p>
 <p>“What divine ability is that!?!?”</p>
 <p>“What terrifying pressure!!”</p>
 <p>Despite their terror, they hadn’t reached the point where they felt helpless. In fact, their abundant experience in battle was telling them that they absolutely could not flee. If they did, they would be crushed out of existence!</p>
 <p>The only chance they had was to break this attack, and thus, their enemy’s momentum. If they didn’t, his will would grow stronger.</p>
 <p>“Die!” Chen Hetian shouted. Unexpectedly, he merged into the blood-colored giant, hefted the spear in its hand, and stabbed it with more urgency toward Bai Xiaochun.</p>
 <p>The nine-story cloud pagoda accelerated, and as for Li Xiandao, he appeared right in front of Bai Xiaochun, his sword stabbing directly toward his forehead!</p>
 <p>However, even as the three counter attacks closed in, Bai Xiaochun looked up, and an enormous, shadowy being materialized behind him.</p>
 <p>It was a man in imperial robes, with an imperial crown, face completely expressionless, and yet, resembling Bai Xiaochun in every way!</p>
 <p>There was an incomparably domineering air to him. This was none other than the manifestation of… the Undying Emperor’s Fist!</p>
 <p>When that domineering, shadowy emperor appeared, Bai Xiaochun… unleashed his fist strike!!</p>
 <p>Heaven shook and the earth trembled. Furthermore, since Bai Xiaochun was merged with all creation, becoming the will of the heavens, the pressure of a destructive heavenly punishment appeared!!</p>
 <p>Now that he had mastered his Undying Bones, he was able to easily unleash this peak level of fleshly body power!</p>
 <p>It was… a quintuple power Undying Emperor’s Fist!!</p>
 <p>It was a supreme level of destructive power, causing the air to ripple and distort. The gigantic, shadowy emperor fused into Bai Xiaochun’s fist, which, despite not growing any larger, shot toward the three devas, accompanied by intense rumbling sounds!</p>
 <p>“We can’t stand up to this!!” Chen Hetian blurted. That was what his instincts were telling him. And that was when Bai Xiaochun’s Undying Emperor’s Fist slammed into Li Xiandao.</p>
 <p>The sky shuddered, and a tremor passed through Li Xiandao. Then, a massive stream of blood sprayed out of his mouth. His sword shattered, and he was sent tumbling backward like a kite with its string cut, as surely as if a huge mountain had slammed into him. In fact, he couldn’t even stop the blood from erupting from inside of him.</p>
 <p>Terror consumed him. His fleshly body was on the verge of falling apart, and his cultivation base was being dramatically destabilized as roughly thirty percent of the qi passageways inside of him were destroyed!!</p>
 <p>“Impossible!!” he shrieked. And yet, even as he fell back, the Undying Emperor’s Fist continued on without pause toward Chen Hetian, who was embodied as an enormous blood-colored giant.</p>
 <p>First, the blood-red spear shattered, and then the giant's body exploded. Chen Hetian himself appeared, blood spraying out of his mouth as he was flung backward, a look of blank shock on his face.</p>
 <p>Last was Bai Zhentian. As soon as his nine-story cloud pagoda was hit by the Undying Emperor’s Fist, it shattered layer by layer. Bai Zhentian himself escaped narrowly, and yet, still ended up coughing up blood. Face ashen and filled with disbelief and alarm, he staggered backward, aura in shambles.</p>
