 <p>“This game is now over!”</p>
 <p>The voice which rang out was as cold as ice. He spoke five simple words, and yet, he was a heavenly king and demigod expert. His energy was the type that heaven and earth could not support, and it even caused black clouds to roil in the sky above. The three patriarchs immediately began to shake under the pressure; the Giant Ghost King didn’t even need to draw upon the power of his cultivation base. His mere threatening gaze was enough to cause the three patriarchs to tremble in place.</p>
 <p>This was the Giant Ghost King!!</p>
 <p>As of this moment, he seemed to make all colors in heaven and earth fade away. It was as if all creation could do nothing but tremble and bow to him.</p>
 <p>That was because he... was a demigod expert!</p>
 <p>That was because he... was one of the four heavenly kings of the Wildlands!</p>
 <p>That was because he... was the Giant Ghost King!!</p>
 <p>As he stood there in front of Bai Xiaochun, he slowly extended his right hand, a hand that seemed powerful enough to hold up the heavens. Instantly, the Bai Clan patriarch’s divine ability was nullified; the 300-meter area surrounding the Giant Ghost King was completely unaffected by it!</p>
 <p>The Giant Ghost King’s body was rapidly reverting from that of an old man to a younger one. His white hair became black, and the wrinkles on his face vanished. His withered frame filled in, and in the blink of an eye, a somber expression could be seen on his face.</p>
 <p>A royal crown appeared on his head, and he now wore a violet robe with a serpentine dragon embroidered on it. As of this moment, he seemed more noble than anything else in the world!</p>
 <p>The Bai Clan patriarch was trembling, and his eyes were bulging out of his head so violently they seemed like they might explode. At the same time, an icy coldness filled his heart that seemed cold enough to freeze the world.</p>
 <p>The Chen Clan patriarch had a similar reaction. Panting in terror, he felt as if he were drowning at the bottom of the sea, a sea so powerful that it could crush him and his clan out of existence!</p>
 <p>The Cai Clan patriarch only existed as a nascent divinity now. He was just as shocked, and because he didn’t have a physical body to sustain some of the crushing pressure he felt, it all weighed down on his nascent divinity, causing it to twist and distort. Inside, he was screaming in terror at the realization that he and the other two patriarchs... had completely misjudged the Giant Ghost King!</p>
 <p>He had not needed three months to recover, or even one. In fact, he hadn't even required half a month. He... had recovered in five days!!</p>
 <p>Only five days had passed since the rebellion began, and during that time, the Giant Ghost King had already recovered. The Cai Clan patriarch understood everything now, and couldn’t help but think back to the sight of the Giant Ghost King’s clone, hovering there above the ruins of the royal palace, a look of complete disdain and contempt in his eyes as he had uttered a very simple sentence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>This has all been nothing more than a game....</em></p>
 <p>The Bai and Chen Clan patriarchs also recalled those words, and suddenly, the entire world around them seemed to go as still and quiet as death....</p>
 <p>They hovered there in the air, people who could normally look down condescendingly upon all heaven and earth. And yet, as of this moment, they felt as if they were looking up in awe and fear at the person in front of Bai Xiaochun!!</p>
 <p>As for Bai Xiaochun, he stood there, jaw agape, almost incapable of believing that he was still alive. It seemed almost like a dream that the Giant Ghost King really was awake, with his cultivation base restored, leaving the three deva patriarchs shaken to the core.</p>
 <p>Of course, he was also deeply nervous about what was to come.</p>
 <p>“I hope the Giant Ghost King... has a good impression of me, and forgets about everything that happened before.... He absolutely, positively had better not be holding a grudge!” As Bai Xiaochun stood there, his heart trembling with anxiety, the three patriarchs looked down with flickering expressions. Then, the Cai Clan patriarch let out an ear-piercing shriek as he spun and began to flee!</p>
 <p>There was no other option for him. Even if it meant his clan ended up being wiped out, he had no alternative other than to try to escape. He could always establish a new clan, but if he died... then everything would definitely be over.</p>
 <p>However, he was the only one to make such a choice. The Bai and Chen Clan patriarchs, in their bitterness, chose instead to power up their cultivation bases and attack the Giant Ghost King.</p>
 <p>The rebellion had been a huge gamble. If they had won in the end, they could have achieved a meteoric rise. Now that they had clearly lost... they knew that there would be a price to pay, and that they would never be able to escape.</p>
 <p>“The two of you really do have some courage,” the Giant Ghost King said coolly. Although his words were spoken with calm, they contained indescribable pressure, the type that could rebuke all of heaven and earth.</p>
 <p>Instead of lowering his right hand, he clenched it into a fist, then stood tall and straight before unleashing a fist strike at the incoming devas.</p>
 <p>It almost seemed like a casual motion, without any hints of containing a magical technique or divine ability. And yet, because of it, everything in the area seemed to grow dark. It was as if the entire world were spinning as a huge vortex opened up, a gaping, sinister mouth ready to gobble up the two patriarchs.</p>
 <p>Incredible rumbling sounds could be heard as blood sprayed from the mouth of the Bai Clan patriarch. A scream rang out as his body teetered on the verge of collapsing. Then, he was sucked into the huge mouth. The Chen Clan patriarch laughed in bitter defiance before he too vanished into the vortex.</p>
 <p>One fist... had completely overwhelmed two devas. They vanished without a trace remaining, sucked into a black hole, possibly dead, possibly alive.</p>
 <p>The sight of it caused beads of sweat to break out on Bai Xiaochun’s forehead. He had never seen a demigod fighting before, and although he had experienced the terrifying power of that level because of the soul-blood earlier, to witness it in full measure was completely different.</p>
 <p>It only served to increase his nervousness. He couldn’t help but think back to everything that had happened, and how he had brazenly slapped the Giant Ghost King, not just once, but seven or eight times, until the man's face was completely swollen.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun was wailing inwardly, and wondered what mystical foodstuffs he might have accidentally eaten to give him such gall. He had actually slapped a demigod expert across the face, over and over....</p>
 <p>Even as Bai Xiaochun sat there in misery, the Giant Ghost King looked over at the fleeing Cai Clan patriarch. Snorting coldly, he opened his fist and then made a grasping gesture.</p>
 <p>Instantly, rumbling sounds echoed out, and the entire world seemed to turn upside down. Even time seemed to flow in reverse, as though the Giant Ghost King now controlled all natural law with the movement of his hand.</p>
 <p>To Bai Xiaochun’s astonishment, he saw the fleeing Cai Clan patriarch’s nascent divinity suddenly flying backward at top speed, a look of utter terror on his face.</p>
 <p>“No! Nooooo! I beg for mercy, Your Highness, please....” The Cai Clan patriarch trembled as he seemingly moved backward through time until he appeared in front of the Giant Ghost King, who reached out and grabbed him by the neck!</p>
 <p>Before the man could say anything else, the Giant Ghost King causally twisted his fingers. A scream echoed out as the Cai Clan patriarch’s entire nascent divinity collapsed into pieces.</p>
 <p>However, things weren't over yet. As the nascent divinity began to disperse, a shadowy soul could suddenly be seen. It was none other than... a deva soul!</p>
 <p>As soon as it appeared, an intangible vortex sprang up in the sky. Closer inspection revealed that within that vortex was a flowing river filled with countless vengeful souls. It was none other than... the Underworld River!</p>
 <p>As the river and vortex appeared, a gravitational force sprang up that contained natural law. It grabbed ahold of the deva soul and began to tug it up. At that point, though, the Giant Ghost King snorted coldly and reached out with his right hand. Instantly, wild colors flashed in heaven and earth, and the gravitational force began to fade away. Apparently, the vortex and the Underworld River didn’t wish to fight with a demigod. Gradually, they faded away, and the deva soul floated down into the Giant Ghost King’s hand.</p>
 <p>Within that soul, it was possible to detect a metal-type aura, as well as a bit of heterogeneous lightning power!!</p>
 <p>And thus, matters ended. In the briefest of moments, the Giant Ghost King killed one of the three devas, and dispatched the other two, although whether that was into death or not was impossible to tell at the moment.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun’s scalp was tingling so hard it felt like it might explode, and he was shaking visibly. Sweat poured down him as a feeling of profound disquiet rose up. As he glanced at the Giant Ghost King out of the corner of his eye, the man turned and looked at him, his vision as sharp as a blaze as it pierced into Bai Xiaochun’s mind. Clearly, he could kill him with a mere thought if he wanted to!</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun was panting, his mind spinning as he sensed the destructive power of the Giant Ghost King. He almost felt like a mortal staring into the gaping maw of a fierce tiger!</p>
 <p>The pressure was impossible to describe, the type which could overturn heaven and earth with no effort!</p>
 <p>“Bai Hao, give me one good reason not to kill you!”</p>
