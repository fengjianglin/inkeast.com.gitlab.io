<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>The two arcane guards only had the wherewithal to let out cries of alarm before instinctively retreating.</p>
 <p>They knew that they couldn’t possibly fight back against the power of Bai Xiaochun’s shout!</p>
 <p>The destructive power contained in his voice surpassed anything they could imagine, and left them overwhelmed with horror!</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, no matter how fast they reacted, it wasn't fast enough. Expressions of unimaginable terror and despair filled their faces as they were overwhelmed by the deadly soundwave!</p>
 <p>They were simply too weak to stand up to it…. They exploded, their bodies turning into ash… and their nascent divinities unable to escape. Being trapped within their fleshly bodies, their nascent divinities… were also wiped out of existence!!</p>
 <p>It happened too quickly for anyone to process. Two proud arcane guards were exterminated in the blink of an eye…. The old man with the horn almost couldn't believe what he was seeing.</p>
 <p>“He’s… he’s not a deva!!” In his estimation, there was simply no deva who could exterminate two other late Deva Realm experts simply by shouting…. Only a demigod could do that!!</p>
 <p>So terrified that he was instantly bereft of courage, the old man with the horn unhesitatingly backed up. His level of speed was too slow when it came to Bai Xiaochun, but thankfully for him, Bai Xiaochun wasn’t in the mood to pay him even a bit of attention. He was only concerned with getting to the battlefield as quickly as possible!</p>
 <p>As he shot head-first toward the golden life-severing grand spell formation, the old man with the horn looked on in complete shock. However, it was also in that moment that a spark of hope appeared in his heart.</p>
 <p>“So, he’s going to break through…. However, even a demigod who gets inside will still be suppressed. He’s definitely courting death!!” The old man stopped retreating, and his eyes began to shine with killing intent. After all, he was in the great circle of the Deva Realm, and an arcane guard from Heavenspan Island. He was a shrewd schemer, the type who could kill others without hesitation. Suddenly more confident than before, he flew toward Bai Xiaochun as if to block his way.</p>
 <p>However, even as he closed in, Bai Xiaochun used his Undying Hex, enabling him to shoot forward as though the spell formation didn't even exist.</p>
 <p>The old man with the horn couldn’t react in time. Face filling with far more terror than before, he tried to back away. Unfortunately for him, it was now too late to start retreating again….</p>
 <p>Bai Xiaochun used the Undying Hex and the Mountain Shaking Bash without even thinking about it. In the briefest of moments, he slammed into the horned old man.</p>
 <p>A boom rang out as the man felt something like an infinitude of heavenly mountains slamming into him. Screaming miserably, he exploded. His nascent divinity had no time to flee before it was also sucked into the blast of power, and was completely destroyed.</p>
 <p>This was Bai Xiaochun at his peak!!</p>
 <p>After piercing through the spell formation, Bai Xiaochun didn't so much as look back to see what happened to the horned old man. The man had blocked his path, and had thus rushed to his own death. Furthermore, the encounter didn’t slow Bai Xiaochun down at all.</p>
 <p>With his Undying Hex, the life-severing grand spell formation might as well have not existed. Without the slightest pause, Bai Xiaochun appeared… 25,000 kilometers away from Giant Ghost City!</p>
 <p>His ears could already detect the sounds of shouting and fighting far off in the distance. Furthermore, it was possible for him… to see the battlefield!!</p>
 <p>Immediately, he was shaken to the core!</p>
 <p>Countless cultivators from the eastern Heavenspan region were there, eyes bloodshot as they fought with madness. Savage giants and soul cultivators were present in abundance. Everyone seemed to have been pushed to their limit, and were fighting with the understanding that one side would come out alive, and the other would be dead.</p>
 <p>Some would resort to self-detonation before being killed, taking their opponent with them into death!</p>
 <p>The explosions on the battlefield were deafening, and yet, that didn’t matter…. Hearing was not required to kill the enemy!</p>
 <p>Virtually the entire area from his current location to Giant Ghost City, a stretch of 25,000 kilometers, was all a huge battlefield. Bai Xiaochun had never seen any sort of fighting on this scale before.</p>
 <p>Shouts, screams, wild laughter, and a cacophony of other sounds melded together into a symphony of death. It was as if the will of heaven and earth was simply holding back and watching… as the mountains of corpses built up!</p>
 <p>It was already hard to find intact corpses. The enemies tore each other apart… and blood flowed in rivers….</p>
 <p>There were hundreds of thousands of cultivators fighting madly, making the battlefield like a giant millstone that was constantly crushing life out of existence.</p>
 <p>There were no troop formations, nor any officers issuing orders. Everyone was simply fighting like wild animals.</p>
 <p>Nascent Soul experts almost didn't count for anything in this type of fighting, much less Core Formation cultivators, who could be exterminated in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>War chariots and other precious treasures of war were visible, most tattered and damaged, but still capable of unleashing destructive power!</p>
 <p>The most terrifying fighting went on high in the air, where the demigods were locked in combat. The Giant Ghost King’s enormous frame was covered with wounds and scars. In one place, a spear had stabbed right through him, which currently belched out black smoke that formed nine black dragons that stabbed at him constantly. Despite the grievous nature of his injuries, the Giant Ghost King continued to fight with bitter madness against the demigod patriarch from the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect!</p>
 <p>The demigod patriarch was in equally bad shape. His chest was partly caved in, and one of his arms was missing. He was rife with an aura of death, and yet, his killing intent continued to rage as brightly as ever.</p>
 <p>Every time the demigods came back around for another volley, their fighting would cause rifts to spread out in the sky, and would cause all the lands to tremble.</p>
 <p>The mere shockwaves spreading out from their attacks were like tempests that could destroy everything in their path</p>
 <p>Below the level of the demigod fighting were the devas from Giant Ghost City and the eastern Heavenspan region. Their deadly battle caused thunderous booms to fill heaven and earth at every moment.</p>
 <p>Mistress Red-Dust was there, as were Patriarch Spirit Stream, Bai Zhentian, Chen Hetian, and the child deva!</p>
 <p>Patriarch Steel Veins was nowhere to be seen, nor was Duke Netherworld!</p>
 <p>There were four devas from the Heavenspan side, and only two on the Wildlands side: Mistress Red-Dust, and a heavenly duke that Bai Xiaochun remembered from Arch-Emperor City.</p>
 <p>The fighting between the six devas had reached a deadly crossroads, and was actually the focus of much attention within the life-severing grand spell formation.</p>
 <p>In the moment that Bai Xiaochun arrived, a deafening explosion filled the air. The source was the heavenly duke, who, in the face of death, chuckled bitterly and chose to self-detonate. As the destructive power of his death swept out, the child deva from the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect was too slow to escape… and was killed in body and soul!</p>
 <p>As the two devas met their end, Mistress Red-Dust coughed up a mouthful of blood under the combined attack of Chen Hetian and Bai Zhentian. Injuries worsening, she laughed sadly and tried to back up.</p>
 <p>Gasping for breath, Chen Hetian shouted, “Frigidsect, if you keep holding back like this, then after the fighting is over I’ll exterminate your River-Defying Sect!!”</p>
 <p>With that, he and Bai Zhentian began to chase Mistress Red-Dust. Clearly, their goal was to cut down the daughter of the Giant Ghost King, the sergeant-major and leader of the Giant Ghost Legion!</p>
 <p>“Killing her will distract the Giant Ghost King! That will give the patriarch the chance he needs to kill him!!”</p>
 <p>Patriarch Spirit Stream looked on bitterly as Chen Hetian and Bai Zhentian began to chase down Mistress Red-Dust. The River-Defying Sect had suffered the least casualties of all thanks to her mercy, although the patriarch wasn’t sure why that was. However, at this moment, he was on the side of the lands of Heavenspan, and as such, his hands were tied. Sighing, he took a step forward.</p>
 <p>As the three Heavenspan devas began to make their move, and as Mistress Red-Dust sighed and prepared to use her most powerful divine ability. However….</p>
 <p>That was when a howl of rage split heaven and earth, shattering the air.</p>
 <p>“Stay your hand!!”</p>
 <p>Along with these words came a bright beam of light that shot across the battlefield, bursting with energy that could shake heaven and earth.</p>
 <p>It was only moments away!</p>
