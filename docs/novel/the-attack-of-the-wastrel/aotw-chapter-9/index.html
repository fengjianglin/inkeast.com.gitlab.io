 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">After returning to Gu Rong's side, Gu Lingzhi was interrogated by Gu Rong as she had expected. Gu Rong definitely had trouble believing how she had suddenly attained magical aptitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi lowered her head and tried to mask the hate in her eyes. Instead, she plastered a timid and surprised look on her face and answered, "Father, I am not sure why I have an aptitude for martial arts all of a sudden as well."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Really? Did you eat anything different these past few days?" Lin Yue-er could not help but to interrupt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Now they start to worry</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">, Gu Lingzhi thought. But, at the same time, she knew that she was not strong enough to challenge Lin Yue-er just yet and had no choice but to play along. She pretended to think hard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"My meals for the past few days have not changed. They have been the same."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Really?" Lin Yue-er smiled kindly, but deep down she already decided to talk and interrogate Cui Lian afterwards. "No matter what, Lingzhi is able to practice martial arts and possesses roots for wood and fire-based magic, this is cause for a big celebration! You should treasure your magical aptitude. In order to not let the Heaven down and waste your powers, you must become an outstanding Medicinal Cultivator!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Rong nodded in agreement. "That's right, to be able to awaken your magical abilities at fifteen years of age, you are indeed blessed by Heaven. In the future, you must strive to cultivate medicine well."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Yes, I will." Gu Lingzhi obediently replied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Heaven had indeed blessed her to let her live again; naturally, she would work hard to cultivate her magical abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">At this moment, Gu Linglong returned and did not bother to hide the hatred in her expression. She could not understand how a bully target like Lingzhi could suddenly become a Martial Artist like her and even possess better aptitude than her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Seeing the jealousy in Linglong's eyes, Gu Lingzhi smiled slightly and suddenly turned towards Gu Rong, "Father, earlier you said that if I passed the test to possess Spiritual Roots and aptitude, you would give me an Eclipse Horse. When can I see it?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Why should my father give you an Eclipse Horse? Even if you had the horse, a wastrel like you wouldn't know how to ride it." Gu Linglong could not help but retort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Linglong was the one who wanted the Eclipse Horse all along. Why should Gu Lingzhi be able to get one too? She had just realised her Spiritual roots and this made Linglong indignant!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Linglong, how can you say such things to your sister?" Lin Yue-er hurriedly reprimanded Linglong and observed Gu Rong's expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi is now different from who she was in the past and is no longer the wastrel whom they could embarrass and scold as and when they liked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Hm? Did I say something wrong?" Linglong said, not noticing the glare Yue-er was giving her. Gu Linglong continued to express her unhappiness, "Who knows whether she is able to cultivate magic, maybe her wood and fire-based magic is only for show. She may possess such good Spiritual Roots, but with such an ordinary aptitude, she could never reach the level of a Martial Teacher her entire life, just like everyone else. The way I see it, her Spiritual Roots have only awakened now, precisely because her aptitude was simply too lousy!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">In one breath, Gu Linglong expressed her unhappiness so outwardly and thus immediately felt better. Sticking out her chin proudly, she wanted to see Gu Lingzhi shrink with shame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">However, her hopes were fruitless as Gu Lingzhi was not affected at all. Instead, she furrowed her brows and disagreed, "Little sister, how can you say that? If I become a Medicinal Cultivator, I can contribute to the Gu Family, do you not wish for this too? From what I know, the Gu Family spends a huge amount of resources to train Medicinal Cultivators. If our family can have a Medicinal Pill Cultivator of our own, we would be able to save lots of our resources."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Rong looked at Gu Lingzhi with pride - she spared much thought for the family, the years of effort spent raising her were not in vain. He nodded, "Linglong was not being sensible, since you're the elder sister, you should try to tolerate her. I will arrange an Eclipse Horse to be sent to you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Father!" Linglong indignantly exclaimed, "How could you really give the Eclipse Horse to her! When I first awakened my Spiritual Roots, you still refused to buy one for me."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Lin Yue-er harboured the thought of sewing her own daughter's lips shut. Gu Linglong was pampered by Lin Yue-er since she was young, and therefore did not understand her father. Gu Linglong thought she could get her way as Gu Rong had always agreed to her requests. However, as his wife, Lin Yue-er could read Gu Rong's mind and thoughts entirely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The reason why Gu Rong pampered Gu Linglong was because she had possessed better Spiritual aptitude than others and could bring benefits to the Gu family. Now, however, things have changed. If Gu Lingzhi became a Medicinal Cultivator, no matter how much Gu Rong had neglected Lingzhi in the past, he would still put in great amounts of effort to cultivate her abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">As expected, after hearing what Gu Linglong said to Gu Lingzhi, Gu Rong wrinkled his forehead and softly reprimanded Linglong, "Nonsense! I am your father and I make the decisions, do I still have to listen to you?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Linglong had never seen Gu Rong being so fierce towards her, so she shivered and her eyes reddened at his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Father… don't you love me anymore?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Ha, interesting." Without waiting for Gu Rong to lecture her daughter again, Rong Yuan chuckled out loud from a distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"I didn't think that the leader of the Gu Clan had to listen to his daughter's opinions when making a decision. You must be a really good father who dotes on his daughter very much."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Rong Yuan was smiling and looked sincere when he said this, so Gu Rong could not distinguish whether Rong Yuan truly meant what he said or was just being sarcastic. Gu Rong was embarrassed and stiffened for a few seconds, after which he tried to end the awkward conversation. "My little daughter is not sensible, I have made a joke out of myself, Your Highness."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Rong Yuan waved his hand dismissively.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"That's alright, I'm not the one who is embarrassed anyway."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"….Haha, Your Highness loves to joke around." Gu Rong laughed dryly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Yuan Zheng could not help it but turn his head and laughed silently to himself.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">&nbsp;His master, as always, liked to mock people discreetly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">However…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">This eldest daughter of the Gu Family really possessed magical aptitude. Does this mean that he had to give up his&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Spiritual</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">&nbsp;green stone after all?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Thinking of this, Yuan Zheng was hurt. As expected, his master was not one that suffered losses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi also could not help but glanced at Rong Yuan curiously.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">So this is the famed Third Prince who became a Martial Lord at just 25 years old?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Word has it that in this Kingdom, Rong Yuan was the most likely martial artist to become a True God. She did not think he would be such a polished prince. Compared to the rumors where Rong Yuan was described as a war god, the reality was far from it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">If Yuan Zheng could know what Gu Lingzhi was thinking, he would tell her that she was too naïve. Does she not know that the further lies spread, the more truth is distorted?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">However, Yuan Zheng thought, whenever his master is angered, he does resemble a killing machine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The news of Gu Family's wastrel daughter Gu Lingzhi having magical aptitude, as well as fire and wood-based Spiritual Roots quickly spread.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Overnight, many youths who had previously tested for Spiritual aptitude were filled with hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">If this could happen to Gu Lingzhi, perhaps it could it happen to me too?</span></p>
