 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">At last, just as Lin Yue-er began to suspect something was amiss, beside her, Gu Rong surged forward towards Bi Lingcan with his dominating presence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Bastard! Is what Xiao Tao saying true?" Although he was asking a question, Gu Rong already had the answer based on his experience.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Since Bi Lingcan was only a Martial Artist of the Martial Instructor Level, he could not withstand Gu Rong's menacing aura and fell to his knees. A trail of blood dribbled from the corner of his mouth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Dear husband, please calm down. Lingcan is the only offspring of the Bi Family!" Lin Yue-er cried out and jumped in front of Bi Lingcan as she saw Gu Rong moving as if to hit him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"This situation is still unconfirmed, you cannot damage the relationship we have with the Bi Family because of some mere words from a servant!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Rong hesitated. Although his eyes filled with fiery anger, he stopped himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi grew slightly disappointed. In her previous lifetime, Lin Yue-er used this same sentence to hold Gu Rong back. It resulted in Bi Lingcan only receiving about ten strokes of the cane while damning&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">her&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">for life. In this lifetime, this sentence was still useful. It certainly suited this father of hers to be a leader - no matter what, he always considered the bigger picture first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">As things seemed to be approaching the end, Gu Lingzhi did something unexpected and fell to the ground with a plop. On her face, the familiar timid look appeared. However, her eyes held a determination never seen before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Father, Xiao Tao has suffered in my stead. She has taken such good care of me for so many years. And yet because of me, she has suffered like this. I feel very troubled because of this matter. Father, please uphold justice for Xiao Tao and do not neglect the servants of our Gu Family."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi’s actions not only shocked Gu Rong but everyone else. Everyone's impression of Gu Lingzhi was that she was very submissive as she agreed to everything.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">When did the First Mistress become so brave all of a sudden? She actually dared to speak up in front of her angry father</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Shut up Lingzhi! Don't you know that your father is still too angry to discuss this now? A mere servant like Xiao Tao should be more than happy to even receive any pity at all! What is there to complain about?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Mother, your words are simply too harsh. Being a virgin is the most important thing to a girl, now that was stolen from her, how can Xiao Tao face anyone in the future? I hope Father will take pity on her and to prevent outsiders from gossiping!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Rong looked at Gu Lingzhi as if he was seeing his daughter for the first time. In the past, he had neglected this daughter because of her birth mother. As she grew up, her submissive personality was not to his liking, and he never once thought she had a fiery side to her. Suddenly, he wanted to know how she thought he should handle this situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Oh? Then how about you tell me, how would you handle this matter?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi was flabbergasted by Gu Rong’s question. In her memory, Gu Rong had never once asked her what&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">she&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">thought. Previously, the only interactions they had were when he gave her orders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"I believe… since Xiao Tao is already Cousin Bi's woman, it would be difficult to marry her off to anyone else. How about giving Xiao Tao to cousin as a concubine? To outsiders, the both of them already seem to have affection for each other and this would also help account for Xiao Tao’s current state."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Bi Lingcan rejected the proposal, "Who does she think she is!?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">She&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">is not worthy of entering my family!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi glanced at him, "Xiao Tao has suffered in my place. If I was the one that had endured this, would cousin still think the same?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"I…"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"I shall handle this matter as Lingzhi has suggested." Bi Lingcan's mouth opened as if he wanted to say more but was quickly cut off by Gu Rong. His eyes swept over him coldly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"The Bi Family is also a reputable family. Tomorrow, I will go to the Bi Family home to explain the situation."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Bi Lingcan could do nothing but to accept it as he looked at Xiao Tao with a malicious gaze. Similar to Lin Yue-er, he also felt that the whole situation that happened today was set up by Xiao Tao. After all, Xiao Tao's affection for him was no secret. If not for her affection, Lin Yue-er would also not have thought of using Xiao Tao to plot against Gu Lingzhi. But he never thought Xiao Tao would have such guts to pay lip service but oppose in secret. This made his heart unable to accept her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Feeling Bi Lingcan's malicious gaze on her, Xiao Tao shrank even more as she started to doubt whether or not it was a mistake to have feelings for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The chaotic situation ended there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">No one noticed a luxuriously dressed man hiding in the corner of Gu Lingzhi’s garden. Amusement was written all over his face as he stood half-leaning against the wall.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Who would have thought the first mistress of the Gu Family, who is rumored to be weak, timid, and a wastrel, has such a depth to her.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">He had a feeling that this trip of his would be interesting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Once everybody had left, Gu Lingzhi frowned sinisterly and ordered Xiao Tao to clean up her messy bed tomorrow. Then, she went to the adjoining study room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Although it was the middle of the night, Gu Lingzhi had no intention of sleeping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The incident today may seem like it had been handled easily but it was not without risks. Since everything happened so suddenly, no one had time to properly analyze the situation. But once things settled down, Lin Yue-er might start to suspect her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">It will soon be the clan’s festival day. Once she gets tested for her aptitude, she will no longer be so easily bullied.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The Gu Family was one of the five major families in the Xia Kingdom. On the fifth of August each year, a clan festival was held. On this day, any child above the age of ten would be eligible to join.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The whole of Tianyuan Continent held its military force in high esteem and the Gu Family was not one to break the customs. Thus, every year, the clan festival day has also become a day to test for the aptitude among the clan's disciples.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi has always been weak and struck with illness since young, resulting in her always having to consume medicine. When she was ten, she was deemed a wastrel when not an ounce of magical power could be tested from her. In the past, this had created an uproar among the clan members as it was said that her late mother was once an extremely talented Martial Artist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">From that day onwards, Gu Lingzhi became increasingly more neglected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">But was she really a wastrel?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi laughed coldly, in her past life when she came to the Bi family, she no longer had to consume her daily dose of medicine to nurse her body and finally realised that the medicine she had been taking daily was actually a poison to suppress the magic power in her. Once she had realised this, Gu Lingzhi began to practice in secret, hoping to have some form of protective power before she left the Bi Family. But who would have known that just as she was leaving, she would accidentally overhear the conversation between Lin Yue-er and cousin Bi Lingcan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">It turned out that her birth mother was not the fickle person that she was rumored to be, but was actually set up by Lin Yue-er to commit adultery. Following that, her birth mother then committed suicide out of shame. What she had used was, in fact, the exact same medicine that caused Gu Lingzhi to be unconscious. Who would have thought that both mother and daughter would fall for the exact same evil plot?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">At the time, she was too bewildered and forgot to remain in hiding, resulting in her being caught. From then on, she had completely lost her freedom. Once Bi Lingcan lost interest in her, he crippled her four limbs then gave her to the servants to play with. Not long after that, filled with indigence and hatred, she used a wooden thorn to end her own life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Thinking back on her tragic past, Gu Lingzhi closed her eyes in pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">She would no longer tolerate the feeling of being played with in the palms of others like in her past life. In this life, she was going to change her destiny and decide her own fate!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">And what she would rely on was the Legacy Inheritance that now appeared in her mind.</span></p>
