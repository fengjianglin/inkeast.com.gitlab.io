<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Once again the subject of a huge wave of resentment, Gu Lingzhi thought that she would be attacked or provoked by many unidentifiable people but realized that she had been worried for nothing. The people who had been popping up occasionally to find trouble with her had all disappeared, not to mention those who wanted revenge for the previous issue.</p>
 <p>With harboured suspicions, Gu Lingzhi looked towards Rong Yuan, who followed her around ever since that day.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi frowned, “Were you the one who did it?”</p>
 <p>“What did I do?” Rong Yuan did not understand.</p>
 <p>“Those people who wanted to find trouble with me.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, you were talking about them.” Rong Yuan shrugged nonchalantly, “They felt that it wasn’t fun to always find trouble with you, so they gave up.”</p>
 <p>“What?” Gu Lingzhi narrowed her eyes and wanted to see through Rong Yuan’s façade.</p>
 <p>However, Rong Yuan’s skin was too thick. She could not detect anything even after staring at him. Instead, she was struck speechless by Rong Yuan when he chuckled at her, “Why? Have you finally realized how good it is to be with me and have finally been mesmerized?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi just knew that she should not have held any expectations for Rong Yuan’s words.</p>
 <p>“Tsk, I never expected the famous War God of the Xia Kingdom to be a rascal with such a slick tongue.” A figure in green appeared and smiled at Gu Lingzhi, “Is Ye Fei around? I am looking for her.”</p>
 <p>“No, she’s not. She has probably gone to the Town of the Brave.” Gu Lingzhi replied. She had quite a good impression of this senior who had been appearing frequently. It would have been even better if this senior was not so pretty, even Gu Lingzhi felt jealous.</p>
 <p>“She actually went out already? What a pity, the lotus seed soup that I had personally boiled is going to become cold.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi’s mouth twitched as she finally noticed the two-feet wide lunchbox.</p>
 <p>Di Huan’s hobby turned out to be cooking. Although the food he cooked tasted like poison, he still felt good about his cooking and went around promoting it. As a result, Ye Fei, whom he had been chasing, ran away every time she saw him. She was deeply afraid that she would one day be taken in by his flowery words and be poisoned to death.</p>
 <p>“If you are afraid of it going cold, you can hand it over to me. I can put it in my Storage Ring and pass it to Ye Fei for you when she comes back.”</p>
 <p>“That won’t do,” Di Huan rejected Gu Lingzhi’s suggestion without even considering, “This soup was made personally by me with all my love, I want to see her drink it with my own eyes.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi silently watched as Di Huan came and went. In her heart, she had already lit a candle to pray for Ye Fei, whose stomach would undergo a disaster. Then, she saw the thoughtful expression on Rong Yuan’s face.</p>
 <p>“Actually… My cooking skills are quite decent.” Rong Yuan mentioned. He looked at Di Huan’s departing figure and added on another sentence, “It is the complete opposite of Di Huan’s cooking.”</p>
 <p>“Is that so?” Gu Lingzhi was sceptical, “The Third Prince’s future wife is fortunate indeed.”</p>
 <p>“Aren’t you my wife?” Rong Yuan chuckled, his face was handsome beyond belief. Gu Lingzhi was dazzled, and her breath caught for a moment.</p>
 <p>The Third Prince really knew how to use his body to his advantage. He knew how handsome he was and constantly used this tactic against her.</p>
 <p>“Third Prince, I have said before not to talk about your feelings while we’re in the Royal School. You had better not waste your time here with me anymore.”</p>
 <p>“How could spending time with my future wife be a waste of time?” Rong Yuan was not bothered in the least as he looked deeply at Gu Lingzhi in the eye.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi immediately stepped back vigilantly to increase the distance between the two of them. This was the result of her having suffered losses the past few days.</p>
 <p>Ever since that day when she had been kissed in public by the Third Prince, he had tried to kiss her twice again.</p>
 <p><em>What a pity, he was unable to kiss her.</em> Rong Yuan sighed. He looked at the dormitory’s staircase, where two figures had appeared.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi’s dormitory had become a gathering place for these few pursuers. Every day, once class ended, they would all gather here in order to gain Gu Lingzhi’s favour.</p>
 <p><em>So what if they were so enthusiastic? Gu Lingzhi was already his.</em> Rong Yuan laughed.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi may not be aware, but ever since that day when she had returned from the Royal Palace, he had used three days of time to send out people to give a warning to all the girls who had been hostile towards her. If something were to happen to Gu Lingzhi and he was unable to find the perpetrator, he would take revenge on all of them regardless if they were involved or not.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Consort Rong revealed her approval of Gu Lingzhi at a gathering with the other consorts, even going to the extent to say that if anyone were to act against Gu Lingzhi, she would not let them off. With the Principal being partial to Gu Lingzhi as well, everyone could not help but start to believe that the Third Prince was being serious this time.</p>
 <p>The difference in attention and concern given to Gu Lingzhi and Tianfeng Wei was like the difference between heaven and earth.</p>
 <p>Tianfeng Wei who had also received the news was so furious that she started smashing the items in her house. Beside her, there was a thin figure who raised his eyebrows and smiled ambiguously, as a trace of bloodlust flashed in his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Get them to speed up the plan. I don’t want to hear any more of this news!” he instructed.</p>
 <p>“Yes, young master!” A voice responded from within the darkness. Following that, a few dark figures flashed past, disappearing. Even the tightly guarded Royal School did not seem to pose any obstacle towards these people.</p>
 <p>In the Principal’s office, Rong Zhisheng frowned as he watched the scene within the Recording Crystal. He muttered, “What is this fellow from the North Qiu Kingdom up to? I hope he doesn’t do something stupid and offend someone important, I don’t want any trouble.”</p>
 <p>Shaking his head, Rong Zhisheng went out to pass down some instructions to the guards before returning back in.</p>
 <p>As for Gu Lingzhi, right now, she was extremely regretful that she did not heed Ye Fei’s advice and came to the Town of the Brave.</p>
 <p>Not long later, Yan Liang and Lu Feng entered the hall. Yan Liang still had a neutral expression, but he stared meaningfully at Gu Lingzhi. On the other hand, like a megaphone, Lu Feng loudly greeted, “Long time no see! Gu Lingzhi, it seems like you became prettier!”</p>
 <p>“… Thanks?” Gu Lingzhi replied awkwardly.</p>
 <p>“Don’t mention it, I’m just helping Yan Liang say what’s on his mind,” Lu Feng shrugged. Meanwhile, he casually sat himself down on a bench as he pulled Yan Liang along, encouraging him to say his own piece.</p>
 <p>“Mmm, Lu Feng said what I wanted to say,” Yan Liang said seriously. His stony expression however made it seem like he was not complimenting Gu Lingzhi, but rather, making an evaluation of a battlefield like a military commander might do.</p>
