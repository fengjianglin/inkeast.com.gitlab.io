<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>“Inside here, there is something equivalent to the Yuli Snow Lotus.” Ye Rong gripped the jade bottle. His eyes were fired up, a direct contrast to the calm tone of his voice.</p>
 <p>“Second uncle, you have already looked at it for an hour. Can you please return the medicine to us?” Ye Fei stared at Ye Rong. From the moment he had stepped into the guest hall and smelled the medicinal fragrance coming from the opened jade bottle, he had abused his seniority to get hold of the jade bottle. Ostensibly, he had come to help them appraise the items they picked out. However, his conflicted look and undisguised obsession with the contents of the jade bottle seemed to suggest otherwise.</p>
 <p>Ye Rong’s face reddened as he heard Ye Fei’s ridicule, he knew that he had “appraised” the item for far too long. He handed the jade bottle back unwillingly, and couldn’t help but sigh, “If only I could have had a Spiritual Medicine like this Spirit Cleansing Pill back when I was still a Martial Student, then my cultivation would not have stopped at the Martial Lord level.”</p>
 <p>Ye Fei patted his shoulder and lamented, “Second uncle, even if the Spirit Cleansing Pill existed back then, it would never have been given to you anyway.”</p>
 <p>Ye Rong almost spat blood at Ye Fei’s comment and glared at her, “You little lass, you actually dare to tease your second uncle?”</p>
 <p>Ye Fei giggled, “What I said was the truth. Ever since I was young, weren’t you always teaching me that businessmen must take care of their reputation and do business honestly to win the credibility of the customers?”</p>
 <p>“That doesn’t mean that you have to reveal my painful points.” Ye Rong grumbled, then looked towards Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>“This lady, do you still possess more Spiritual Medicines like this? Regardless of how many you have, our Jubao Pavilion will wholeheartedly buy them all. You don’t have to worry about the price. With Little Fei here, I will not let you suffer any losses!”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi laughed and withdrew another jade bottle from her Storage Ring, “I trust both of you. The ingredients required to refine the Spirit Cleansing Pills are relatively rare, I can only sell two pills now. Can I leave it here with you to sell it?”</p>
 <p>“Of course, you can!” Ye Rong exclaimed immediately. He was intuitive enough to not ask about the required ingredients for the Spirit Cleansing Pill and instead introduced enthusiastically, “My Jubao Pavilion holds an auction on the fifteenth of every month. It’s just nice that it is in two days. These two pills can be the final items of the auction! I am sure that the elders of many clans will fight over these two Spiritual Medicines for the development of their younger generation!”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi knew that Ye Rong was describing to her the value of her Spirit Cleansing Pill and that she could earn a large profit from the auction. She nodded her head and asked, “What will the starting bid price of the Spirit Cleansing Pills be?”</p>
 <p><em>What a crafty fellow!</em></p>
 <p>Ye Rong understood that Gu Lingzhi was afraid that the price would be unsuitable and affect the sale of the Spirit Cleansing Pills during the auction. He held out one finger with a mysterious smile on his face.</p>
 <p>“Ten thousand spirit stones? Isn’t that too cheap?” Ye Fei knitted her brows, “Second uncle, the Black Thorn is my friend, you’d better not let her suffer any losses.”</p>
 <p>Ye Rong replied, “When did I ever say that the Spirit Cleansing Pill will be worth only ten thousand spirit stones? Even if she wasn’t your friend, for the sake of Jubao Pavilion’s profits, I cannot give such a price.”</p>
 <p>“That’s better.” Ye Fei agreed, then badgered excitedly, “Then is it a hundred thousand? At this price, one can already buy a middle grade Black-Level Spiritual Medicine!”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi nodded her head satisfactorily, the price stated by Ye Rong was the price in her heart. However, Ye Rong shook his head. He faced Ye Fei’s and Gu Lingzhi’s confused gazes and looked at Ye Fei in disdain, “How could it be a hundred thousand? I think it should be one million spirit stones!”</p>
 <p>“One million?” Ye Fei was stunned as she did not expect such a price. With one million spirit stones, one could buy an Earth-Level Spiritual Medicine. No matter how she looked at it, the Spirit Cleansing Pill was at best, only an upper grade Yellow-Level Spiritual Medicine. <em>How could it command such a high price?</em></p>
 <p>However, Ye Rong was famous in the industry for his foresight. If he said that the Spirit Cleansing Pill’s base price was a million spirit stones, then it was definitely worth this price. Ye Fei suddenly felt the weight of the jade bottle that she had kept in her Storage Ring. One million spirit stones were equivalent to the entire fortune of most Martial Lords. <em>Yet, Gu Lingzhi had taken out four pills and gave it to them so casually, how could she accept it with a peace of mind?</em></p>
 <p>She shared a glance with an equally shocked Tianfeng Jin. The two of them nodded their heads at the same time, reaching a consensus.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was also stunned and hurriedly uttered, “Manager Ye, isn’t this price too high? I think one hundred thousand is enough.”</p>
 <p>“No, it’s not high, not at all.” Ye Rong’s expression was completely like that of a profiteer, “Actually, I consider the price of one million to be on the low side. Spirit stones can be earned, but a person’s qualifications are for life. When there is no certainty regarding the supply of more Spirit Cleansing Pills, those old fellows will definitely not let go of this chance easily.”</p>
 <p>Under the persuasion of Ye Rong, Gu Lingzhi gave in to his suggestion and set the starting bid price of the Spirit Cleansing Pill at one million.</p>
 <p>“Black Thorn, we can’t accept these Spirit Cleansing Pills.” Ye Fei took out the jade bottle containing the pills after Gu Lingzhi had concluded her negotiation with Ye Rong. This was the decision that Ye Fei and Tianfeng Jin had come to together. Although the Spirit Cleansing Pills were very important to them, it was too precious and expensive. Their skins were not thick enough to accept it without being uneasy just because they were friends.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi had guessed the reason for their refusal and laughed. Under the mask, she had a sly expression, “Where is the logic in taking something back after it has been given out? Anyway, these Spirit Cleansing Pills… there was originally already a share for all of you. If you don’t want it, then throw it away.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi did not give them any more chances to refuse. She turned around and asked Ye Rong about the treasures that would be appearing in the auction this round.</p>
 <p>If the auction goes well, she would also be considered as a tycoon. She could now afford to buy many medicinal herbs and weapon forging materials that were previously too expensive for her.</p>
 <p>At night, Gu Lingzhi resumed her normal identity and returned to her dormitory. Unexpectedly, she saw Ye Fei and Tianfeng Jin in the hall with huge smiles on their faces. Gu Lingzhi thought it was interesting that Tianfeng Jin who had always looked cold and different, could actually have such an excited expression. Although she already knew the reason why, Gu Lingzhi still asked anyway, “What happened today? Even your most precious sabre hasn’t been wiped and cleaned.”</p>
 <p>Tianfeng Jin tried to regain her composure and uphold her image of indifference. However, she could not squash the joy in her eyes and with a trembling voice, she said, “Lingzhi, the Black Thorn has given each of us a Spirit Cleansing Pill. Take it, let’s all consume it together.”</p>
