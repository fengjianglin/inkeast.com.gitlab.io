 <p>On the other side, Rong Yuan and Lord Fashen were resisting all of the Demigods’ attacks.</p>
 <p>Lord Fashen already knew how to break the array as it was his second time being trapped by it. He had deliberately attacked the weakest area when the array was still being formed.</p>
 <p>Based on his calculations, the array could be eliminated within an hour at most. He could then escape with Rong Yuan and the others.</p>
 <p>However, the people who besieged Gu Lingzhi exceeded Lord Fashen’s expectations. When he felt the power of several Demigods expelled onto Gu Lingzhi, it was already too late for them to go over and rescue her. They could only watch anxiously as Gu Lingzhi handed Rong Huashang and Pan Yue over to the stoneman for protection while she used some unknown power to break through the various arrays and escape the attacks of the Demigods.</p>
 <p>But in the territories of Pan Luming, how could she hide so easily?</p>
 <p>Those Demigods were just a little slower than Gu Lingzhi in passing through the arrays. After passing through, they then continued their chase. From their line of sight, they could only see Gu Lingzhi dashing into the distance with Pan Yue’er following closely behind. Both of them soon disappeared from their sight.</p>
 <p>“Pan Luming!” Rong Yuan howled as he waved an attack containing the power of space towards Pan Luming. The attack made by Rong Yuan disappeared suddenly before reappearing right in front of Pan Luming.</p>
 <p><em>Tsk</em>–</p>
 <p>Pan Luming was not quick enough to avoid the attack and was smacked right in the face. Instantly, a scar stretching from his eyebrows to chin appeared on his face. The scar seemed to be alive as it shone twice on Pan Luming’s face before settling into a fixed shape.</p>
 <p>It was not until the scar was fixed that a mist of blood spewed out of the wound. Pan Luming raised his hand and touched the scar, the warmth of his hand reminded him that he was just hit by a junior. Furthermore, he was hit at a place that was very important.</p>
 <p>Along with the anger, there was also fear in which he was not willing to admit.</p>
 <p>The blow that Rong Yuan dealt out of anger was the legendary Space Reduction technique. It encompassed the power of space control, whereby the attack could reach the opponent in an instant through reducing the space between him and his opponent, delivering a fatal blow to its opponent silently.</p>
 <p>After an Martial Artist ascended into a Demigod, the ability of their realm which they had gained during their time as a Martial Sage could be exerted without expanding as it could officially become a part of their own attack.</p>
 <p>Space-dimension techniques were the hardest rules to gain enlightenment on, and thus it had the most offensive power. The most alarming one, known as the Space Reduction technique, was the hardest to grasp amongst all space-dimension techniques. In order to master it, one must possess a deeper understanding of space-dimension techniques and also be extremely lucky.</p>
 <p>According to Pan Luming’s knowledge, the last Demigod to have mastered the Space Reduction technique existed more than a hundred thousand years ago. It was said that this Demigod had beat all the invincible players in the world. Even if a dozen Demigods were to besiege him, he would be able to kill all of them. It was one of the North Qiu’s Chief Duke that had sent someone to besiege this Demigod which was why he had heard of this matter. He did not expect to encounter such a fearsome figure himself.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, Rong Yuan had just ascended into a Demigod and his grasp of space-dimension techniques was still not so overbearing. If he had a higher cultivation, it would have been able to split his head into two.</p>
 <p>“Kill him!” Pan Luming commanded while using one of his hands to cover his face to transfer some spiritual power over. This kind of terror should be eliminated while he was still weak.</p>
 <p>“Pan Luming, have you already forgotten about my presence?” Lord Fashen shouted and was happy that the Alliance had produced such a promising Demigod.</p>
 <p>There were only a handful of Demigods that could master space-dimension techniques and even fewer Demigods that could master the Space Reduction technique. Although the blow dealt by Rong Yuan earlier had contained insufficient space-dimension control, it required the usage of the Space Reduction technique in order to deal that strike.</p>
 <p>Even after learning the legendary fearsome move, Rong Yuan did not feel happy at all. His whole mind was focused on following after the footsteps of Gu Lingzhi. He wanted to shred the golden flag in the hands of Pan Luming so as to better support Gu Lingzhi. <em>How could she escape with so many Demigods besieging her? Was she injured?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>The anxiety had made him lose his composure as he began to deal with the enemies in a way where he would also suffer severe losses. All he wished was to be able to break out of the array as soon as possible. Within a quarter of an hour, Rong Yuan had suffered dozens of injuries all over his body.</p>
 <p>Lord Fashen had tried to persuade him several times but to no avail. He had also aggravated his attacks so as to shorten the time needed to break the array.</p>
 <p>But how could the array, formed by the Sacred Weapon, be so easy to break? Especially in a situation where there were many people interfering.</p>
 <p>After several minutes had elapsed, Rong Yuan and Lord Fashen were both covered in blood but had only managed to break through two of the barriers. There were still seven more barriers waiting for them in the Ninety-Nine to One formation. Rong Yuan’s eyes were dyed red due to anxiety, the blood strands in it seemed to be enchanted.</p>
 <p>The longer the delay, the greater the possibility of Gu Lingzhi being caught…</p>
 <p>On the other side, the wound on Pan Luming’s face was beginning to heal. He looked at the two of them victoriously and grinned, “After catching Gu Lingzhi, do you think I should break her legs first or strip off her entire cultivation? If it's the first one, I would be a little reluctant to take those long legs. After bestowing her to my subordinantes, it wouldn’t be that fun with her being unable to move.”</p>
 <p>“You are shameless!” Lord Fashen scolded and looked towards Rong Yuan subconsciously. Sure enough, he was stagnant for a moment before being kicked in the left rib by an opponent. His body flew for a few meters before stopping.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be distracted. Protect yourself first before saving Gu Lingzhi.”</p>
 <p>Rong Huashang was panic stricken as she watched everything unfold, her entire face was covered with tears. It was due to her carelessness that they were captured by the North Qiu Kingdom. If not for her, Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan would not have fallen into such a plight.</p>
 <p><em>If Lingzhi was really caught, she would not forgive herself this entire life, if…</em></p>
 <p>Rong Huashang suddenly opened her eyes widely, thinking that she was seeing things. The group rushing towards them... <em>Was it Mei Ying and the others?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Thinking that she had seen wrongly, Rong Huashang rubbed her eyes. When she reopened them, those figures got closer such that she was able to see them clearer. Isn’t the couple leading the pack Mei Ying and Su Ruo? Just behind them was Hua Qingcheng, Zhong Xiru and a few other Alliance’s Demigods. With a quick scan, there were roughly a dozen of them!</p>
 <p>“That’s great!” For a moment, Rong Huashang could only utter such a statement.</p>
 <p>Before Mei Ying and the others had arrived, a voice could be heard from a distance. “You bastard, Pan Luming! Aren’t you ashamed of having so many people besieging a few people? Be sensible and just surrender, I will leave your corpse intact.”</p>
 <p>Listening to this crazy tone, one could immediately tell that it was Mei Ying who had shouted.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing this, Rong Yuan turned his head and saw the group’s arrival. There were even more blood strands in his eyes now. He shouted fiercely, “Go and save Lingzhi!”</p>
 <p>“Lingzhi? Isn’t she with you? I…” Halfway through, Mei Ying suddenly realised that Gu Lingzhi was indeed not in the array. There was no more playfulness in his voice as he asked, “Where is she?”</p>
 <p>Before Rong Yuan could answer, Rong Huashang, who was still in the hands of the stoneman, raised her hand and pointed towards the direction in which Gu Lingzhi had left in. “She was chased by several Demigods. Quick, if not it might be too late.”</p>
 <p>Mei Ying and Su Ruo turned towards the direction pointed by Rong Huashang immediately. There was someone who was even faster than them. Just as Rong Huashang had lifted her arm, that person had already accelerated into that direction.</p>
 <p>The remaining Demigods looked at the situation in front of them and split up. Two of them had followed after while the remaining began to cooperate with Lord Fashen and Rong Yuan on breaking the array. Even though the surrounding North Qiu’s troops had no intentions of stopping, under the attack of several Demigods, they could only retreat and escape in the end.</p>
 <p>The array was completely destroyed after half an hour due to the combination of internal and external attacks. As the aperture of the last array disappeared, Rong Yuan, who was covered in blood, dashed towards the direction in which Gu Lingzhi had left.</p>
 <p>Lord Fashen froze for a moment before turning around to look at the frustrated Pan Luming, “Now, it’s time for us to settle this once and for all…”</p>
 <p>It was said that Rong Yuan had galloped into the direction of Gu Lingzhi’s departure. After running for a short distance, he encountered a group of people who were fighting. He felt a sense of relief as he dashed into the crowd. However, he was not able to see the familiar figure he was searching for. After looking around, he then found Gu Lingzhi, who was being defended by Hua Qingcheng, being forced to retreat to the edge of the Endless Sea Realm by Pan Yue’er and another Demigod.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Gu Lingzhi was slightly injured but alright overall, Rong Yuan felt relieved and rushed towards her with a gentle smile.</p>
 <p>Pan Yue’er whispered a curse and was deeply regretful. Originally, she had already caught up with Gu Lingzhi and was confident in capturing her. But the thought of Gu Lingzhi making her lose face in front of Chief Duke and her subordinates made her want to torture Gu Lingzhi instead. Upon seeing those who had arrived to capture Gu Lingzhi were all male, disgusting thoughts began to rise from her mind.</p>
 <p>The people who had followed along clapped upon hearing her suggestion. They surrounded her immediately and began to tease her by pulling on her clothing and squeezing her cheeks. Dirty words then exited their mouths.</p>
 <p>Hua Qingcheng arrived just when they were amused by their own actions and were ready to press themselves onto Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>Mei Ying and the others arrived one after another, putting their situation at a disadvantage. They no longer had the opportunity to torture Gu Lingzhi, especially after Rong Yuan’s arrival.</p>
 <p>Not only was Pan Yue’er deeply regretful, but the people who had come with her were also feeling the same. If they had known that reinforcements would arrive, they would not have wasted their time and would have brought Gu Lingzhi directly to a discreet place before raping her.</p>
 <p>Seeing that another person had reached, Pan Yue’er gritted her teeth and unleashed a strong attack, forcing Hua Qingcheng to take a few steps back. With a swing of her arm, a long whip emerged from her sleeve and struck towards Gu Lingzhi. She had planned to restrain Gu Lingzhi before Rong Yuan’s arrival.</p>
