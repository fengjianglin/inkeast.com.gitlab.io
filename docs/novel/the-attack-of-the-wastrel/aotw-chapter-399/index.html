 <p>The situation at the Wasteland City was much more severe than they expected.</p>
 <p>When Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan had rushed over to the Wasteland City, the underground shelter was already broken into by the beasts and the whole city was engaged in a fierce battle. The two appeared like Gods and banished the beasts. Not long later, the herd had lost their leader such that they were scattered around.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan had already found the trick to kill the Female Worm that were clones of the Mother Worm. It was to attract the Female Worm’s attention before locating and dealing a fatal blow to it. The series of movements were as smooth as flowing water, without any form of delay. When the beasts had lost their previous fierceness and were beginning to kill each other, the people of the Wasteland City were still unable to digest the situation. They could only stare at the both of them, who had turned the tides around in an instant, with a stunned look.</p>
 <p><em>Were they Martial Artists? They were so powerful!</em></p>
 <p>After the Wasteland City crisis was resolved, Yuan Sheng, the Governor of the Wasteland City, was determined to move to the Spirit City. Within a month’s time, the citizens of the Wasteland City had all moved into the Spirit City. In an instant, the Spirit City had never been more lively. The beasts seemed to have some scruples about the union of the five cities as they had disappeared from the scene. The people, who hunted outside the Spirit City as their livelihood, could no longer find a single beast. If not for hearing one or two cries of the beasts occasionally, everyone had thought that the beasts had completely disappeared from the Lost Lands.</p>
 <p>Another two months of peace had passed by. Just when everyone thought that the beasts had finally understood how powerful human beings were, such that they did not dare to launch anymore attacks, the scout responsible for investigating the situation returned with a pale face after reconnoitring. It was discovered that a large number of beasts had congregated about 300 miles southeast of the Spirit City. The total number was the sum of all the previous attacks on the four cities.</p>
 <p>The moment when everybody had received the news, they thought silently that this moment was “finally here”. <em>It was always quiet before a storm</em>. The beasts’ invasion was more aggressive than expected.</p>
 <p>Within half a day, countless beasts had besieged the Spirit City from all four directions. Even in the sky, beasts that could fly could be seen blotting out the sky. They were led by the Bat Beasts who swooped down and attacked the people on the ground.</p>
 <p>Tens of thousands of people immediately stood out in the Spirit City. They united their spiritual power skillfully and unfolded a large net cast by gold spiritual energy to firmly block out the flying beasts. The remaining people who did not participate in the construction of the golden net began to wave their spiritual weapons and attacked the beasts through the net.</p>
 <p>The others from the four cities watched as the citizens of the Spirit City battled and were shocked and speechless.</p>
 <p>This method of fighting could only be done by the Martial Artists from the Spirit City. If others were to replace them, they could only fight with their bare hands when the flying Beasts swoop down.</p>
 <p>As both Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan had the skills and guts, they flew directly into the herd of beasts from the city wall and began slaughtering them at a close range. Before the Giant Insect Beasts could approach the city walls, they were massacred by the two of them.</p>
 <p>Lin Rong, who was standing on the city wall while watching excitedly, also wanted to head down and fight. However, she was rejected by Lin Chongyuan.</p>
 <p>“Only when you reach the cultivation of a Martial Sage can you master the techniques of walking on air. You have only cultivated to the level of a Martial Lord while your physique is only comparable to a Gold Class Warrior. It would be suicide if you went to fight alongside them.”</p>
 <p>Lin Rong stuck her tongue out, “I will just fight below the city wall. I won’t die as I don’t have to go into the herd of beasts.”</p>
 <p>“No.” Lin Chongyuan replied mercilessly. He was getting a headache from the willfulness of his younger daughter, “Go accompany your mother if you are bored. It is very dangerous for her to be alone in the Manor.”</p>
 <p>Lin Rong pouted, “Mother is not alone in the Manor, she has many people to protect her.”</p>
 <p>Tang Yan’s body was weak and could not participate in the battle. Before Lin Chongyuan left, he had sent quite a number of bodyguards to be stationed outside the house. There were also two maids serving her in the room. It was the safest place in the entire Spirit City.</p>
 <p>“Second Mistress, if you are really idle and bored, you can deal with the flying beasts with the citizens in the city. It is not easy to deal with the Bat Beasts and their mind attacks. It is good to use them and train your skills.” Chu Jiang suggested while smiling upon seeing the dispute between the father and daughter.</p>
 <p>Lin Rong detested, “But the Bat Beasts are so ugly.”</p>
 <p>Chu Jiang could not hold back his laughter and laughed, “Aren’t the other beasts ugly as well?” With that, he pointed at an ordinary sized Insect Beast at the bottom of the city wall, “Look at it. Do you want it to be crawling around your body?”</p>
 <p>After that, he pointed to a python with grey and brown stripes, “Or would you rather be entangled by that?”</p>
 <p>Chu Jiang proceeded to point and introduce several sinister looking beasts with hideous looks. Lastly, he pointed to a Bat Beast in the air and said, “Don’t judge the Bat Beast by its dark skin. It may look grubby due to its colour but if you were to take a good look at its face, isn’t it quite cute looking? If it were to be pink in colour, it would definitely become the most popular pet in the Lost Lands.”</p>
 <p>After seeing several ugly beasts one after another before looking at the Bat Beast above, Lin Rong really had the illusion that the Bat Beast was quite cute under the enlightenment of Chu Jiang.</p>
 <p>Lin Rong flattened her lips and admitted that she was persuaded by Chu Jiang after looking at the beasts outside the city wall he had pointed out before looking at the Bat Beasts. She lightly jumped down from the city wall and joined the team that was killing the flying beasts.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan swiftly manoeuvred through the herd of beasts and specifically attacked the powerful ones. Not long after, they managed to find the Female Worm that was hidden amongst the herd of beasts and killed it.</p>
 <p>But there were simply too many beasts around. Even though they were no longer under the influence of the Female Worm, they would still create trouble for the Spirit City. It took an entire day and night to frighten off the beasts.</p>
 <p>At the end of the day, more than two hundred people were sacrificed in this battle. Of which, a dozen of them were from the other four cities. This result had surprised those from the other four cities.</p>
 <p>“The Spirit City has really proved themselves. They managed to fight off the beasts so easily,” Yuan Sheng, the Chancellor of the Wasteland City, exclaimed.</p>
 <p>Only one that had experienced beasts attacking the city would know how difficult it was to protect the city. The Spirit City was able to do it by paying only such a small sacrifice. This led Yuan Sheng to be deeply admirable. It was quite hilarious to think that he had almost wanted to hide in the underground shelter and avoid this battle with the beasts.</p>
 <p>Chu Jiang clenched his fists and said modestly, “Chancellor Yuan is too courteous. This is mainly because our Little Chancellor’s husband is too powerful. If not for Rong Yuan killing the Female Worm, we would not have won so easily.”</p>
 <p>“No, it’s different.” Yuan Sheng shook his head and smiled bitterly, “Other than Demigod Rong’s credits, the Spirit City itself had strong abilities. When faced with the flying Beasts, my Wasteland City was unable to seal the skies and stop the flying Beasts from landing.”</p>
 <p>In fact, before the city was invaded, most of the losses occurred in the city where they were killed by the flying Beasts. The strategy used by the Spirit City on sealing off the skies had directly eliminated unnecessary sacrifices. This was also the reason as to why there were so few sacrifices in this battle.</p>
 <p>Chu Jiang heard and laughed twice, “Of course. Sealing off the Spirit City was our Little Chancellor’s idea.”</p>
 <p>“Little Chancellor?” Guan Yue heard this statement and sighed secretly. If he had thought of making friends with Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan on their first encounter instead of making use of them, they would not have headed to the Spirit City and inquired about the news. He would also be the one enjoying all these now.</p>
 <p>It was uncertain if the beasts had known that the Spirit City was not one to be provoked. They had since disappeared after launching the large-scale attack.</p>
 <p>When news of them was heard once again, it was obtained from those fleeing to the Spirit City from elsewhere.</p>
 <p>The Lost Lands that laid beneath the Tianyuan Continent was vast - bigger than the Tianyuan Continent itself. The population within it could not live in the five largest cities alone.</p>
 <p>Previously, the beasts had their target on attacking the five largest cities and had turned a blind eye to the scattered settlements around it. Now that they were unsuccessful in dealing with the Spirit City, they then targeted the people who lived outside the city and did not have the time to escape.</p>
 <p>Lin Chongyuan had since issued a notice on this and ordered the fastest scouts to spread the news. No matter where they lived, they could take refuge in the Spirit City as long as they were from the Lost Lands. After that, he selected a few fast-moving and powerful people from the Spirit City to form a search and rescue team. They were to go around the outskirts of the Spirit City in search of those with intentions on coming here and escort them over. Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan were both top-notch in terms of speed and strength. They had joined the search and rescue team and had left the Spirit City in the wee hours of the morning.</p>
 <p>The places in the Lost Lands that were raped by the beasts were terribly quiet.</p>
 <p>At the speed of Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan, both of them had rushed for two days before seeing anybody.</p>
 <p>It was a group of not more than twenty people. They were led by a man who was tall and dark-skinned.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi burst with joy and called Rong Yuan over before dashing towards the team.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing something charging towards him suddenly, Chen Dong was tense and shouted for the team to prepare for the battle. He clenched his long knife and looked nervously towards the sky.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be afraid. There’s only two beasts, we can handle them.” Chen Dong licked his dry lips and answered.</p>
 <p>“So what if there’s only two of them? In the end, we’ll just end up getting eaten by them.” Qi Mengjia replied while feeling dispirited. Upon seeing the two figures approaching, she actually felt a sense of relief.</p>
 <p>These days, they encountered three attacks by the beasts. Initially, the team had more than a hundred people but was now reduced to less than twenty of them. This led them to become desperate as they were uncertain of when they would become prey to the beasts.</p>
 <p>“Since this will be the result sooner or later, it is better to give up resisting so as to not live in fear constantly.”</p>
 <p>“Mengjia, how can you have such thoughts?” Ban Yue disagreed, “It’s not the end yet, who will know what would be the outcome? We will reach the Spirit City in a few days’ time. We’ll definitely survive this!”</p>
 <p>“Is that so?” Qi Mengjia lifted her head and looked at the shadow that was getting closer and closer, “So what if we are able to reach the Spirit City? Will they be able to resist the beasts’ attack?”</p>
 <p>With that, the entire team fell silent.</p>
 <p>They were originally citizens of the Burnt City. On the day where the Burnt City was attacked, they had followed the crowd and escaped from the city. Were humans really able to handle such ferocious Giant Insect Beasts and a sky full of flying Beasts?</p>
 <p>“Huh, wait, that’s…a person?”</p>
 <p>Chen Dong, who was staring at the two shadows the whole time, spoke suddenly.</p>
