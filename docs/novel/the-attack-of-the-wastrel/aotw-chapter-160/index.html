<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>“So, what happened? Speak!” Rong Yuan ordered, running out of patience to deal with Gu Linglong’s pretentious behaviour. His heart was pounding in his chest.</p>
 <p>Shocked by Rong Yuan’s attitude, Gu Linglong did not dare to continue acting and blurted out whatever she had to say, “I was going to find a physician for my sister as she wasn’t feeling well. However, on my way there, I bumped into Senior Yan and brought him instead. Who knew…who knew that once he entered the room, he wouldn’t come out. Later on, I heard suspicious noises from the room. I knew I wouldn’t be able to fight him and thought of coming to find you…”</p>
 <p>“Where are they?” Rong Yuan immediately demanded to know where Gu Lingzhi was as he started to wonder how much he could trust what Gu Linglong said. When he knew that Gu Lingzhi was at Bright Silk Eating House, Rong Yuan’s face turned extremely black as he ordered Yuan Zheng to grab a hold of Gu Linglong.</p>
 <p>“Your...Your Highness,what is the meaning of this? I came here with good intentions to ask for your help. Why are you holding me?” Gu Linglong panicked.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan ignored her. He did not believe what Gu Linglong had said. <em>Why would Gu Lingzhi fall sick for no reason?</em></p>
 <p>It was rare for Martial Artists to fall sick unless it was from an infection from an injury or poison. Since Gu Lingzhi was not injured, then it was clear that she was ill from the latter. Given that Gu Linglong was with Gu Lingzhi, she was undoubtedly the one that was most likely to have poisoned her.</p>
 <p>Moving the fastest he had ever moved in his entire life, Rong Yuan rushed to Bright Silk Eating House. Completely ignoring the servers’ attempt to stop him, he rushed towards the backyard of the Eating House where the guest houses were located. As he saw Tao Qian guarding the door, Rong Yuan paused for a moment before lifting his leg and aiming for the door.</p>
 <p><em>Bang!</em></p>
 <p>With a loud crash, the room’s door was torn off its hinges and laid pathetically on the floor in pieces. The sight in the room caused everyone to reflect.</p>
 <p>“How can this be?” Exclaimed Gu Linglong, who was still in Yuan Zheng’s grasp.</p>
 <p>In the beautifully decorated guest room, Gu Lingzhi and Yan Liang each sat at opposite corners. The scene she had imagined was completely non-existent. It just looked like two friends of opposite genders having a meet up, secretive yet courteous.</p>
 <p>As his eyes did a quick sweep over Gu Lingzhi, Rong Yuan could finally relax as he reassured himself that she was alright and completely dressed.</p>
 <p>Although he had seemed composed during the entire trip there, he had been extremely fearful of the possibility of Gu Linglong telling the truth. He trusted Yan Liang’s personality but still had that sliver of doubt. As a guy, he knew the immense amount of willpower needed to reject the woman he liked. He was thankful that it was just a false alarm and the worst did not happen.</p>
 <p>Taking big steps, he pulled Gu Lingzhi into his embrace as he lowered his head and breathed in Gu Lingzhi’s scent. Her scent had a calming effect on him.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan hugged her so hard that Gu Lingzhi had to struggle against him so that he would loosen his hold and allow her to breathe normally.</p>
 <p>From the corner of her eye, Gu Lingzhi registered the people around them as she failed to push Rong Yuan away. Switching topics she said, “I was wondering with Senior Yan when you would arrive. I didn’t think you would come so fast.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan ignored her as he lowered his head to match his lips to hers. It was as if only skin to skin contact would soothe the anxiety he had.</p>
 <p><em>This shameless person!</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi wanted to cough up blood from the anger she felt. <em>Wasn’t she the one that was set up? Why does Rong Yuan behave as if he was more wronged?</em> However, she felt the slight tremble of his hand that was holding her arm and it made her heart tremble slightly too.</p>
 <p><em>This person…cared a lot about her.</em></p>
 <p>“Your Highness, I think the most important thing now is how to deal with these two people, right?”</p>
 <p>The intimacy between the two of them was like a stab to Yan Liang. He could not help but mock and pull out his sword and gesture for the Third Prince to let go of Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>Having his kiss interrupted certainly did not feel good.</p>
 <p>However, remembering how Yan Liang did not take advantage of Gu Lingzhi, Rong Yuan forced down his irritancy and turned to Gu Linglong, “Now, please tell me exactly what was going on here?”</p>
 <p>“What… what is there to say?” Gu Linglong stood frozen under Rong Yuan harsh glare, words unable to form.</p>
 <p>Looking down, Rong Yuan pulled Gu Lingzhi even closer to her. He ruffled her hair affectionately as he said to Gu Linglong, “You can talk about how you tried to set Lingzhi up. What is your motive for doing this?”</p>
 <p>Although he asked it courteously, his tone was murderous. It was like he was ready to take her life at any time, should Gu Linglong not answer properly.</p>
 <p>Similarly, Yan Liang directed a pressuring aura onto Gu Linglong, forcing her to answer.</p>
 <p>“I… I don’t… don’t know anything!” Even though she was not the smartest person, she knew that at this point, it was best not to admit to anything.</p>
 <p>“You don’t know? Alright then.” Rong Yuan did not force Gu Linglong to answer but instead turned to face Yuan Zheng.</p>
 <p>“Go and get two strong fantasy drugs for both of them. After they have taken them, strip them and throw them on the streets for everyone to see.”</p>
 <p><em>Tit-for-tat.</em> Rong Yuan felt like ever since he met Gu Lingzhi, he has become much more benevolent.</p>
 <p>“No! No, you can’t do that!” Gu Linglong shrieked. She could not imagine herself ending up naked on the streets, “I am the Second Mistress of the Gu Clan, you can’t do that to me!”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan sneered, “In the Xia Kingdom, is there anything I can’t do?”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan then held Gu Lingzhi and prepared to leave. A slight disapproval flashed in Yan Liang’s eyes. However, as he thought of how Gu Lingzhi might have ended up like them, should she not have discovered anything amiss, the disapproval disappeared.</p>
 <p>Just as the three of them were about to leave the room, Tao Qian blocked their way. Before Rong Yuan could question her, she blurted out, “I know what is going on. Yesterday night, a masked woman came to find us and handed us the medicine, telling us what to do. She even said that after all these, Gu Lingzhi would definitely be disowned by the Gu Clan. Linglong will then be the only daughter of the Gu Family. When that happens, the threat to Madam Lin’s position in the clan will then be removed.”</p>
 <p>Tao Qian blurted out the entire truth. Unlike Gu Linglong, she knew what it meant to protect herself first. This was not the time to throw her status around.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan’s expression lifted slightly, “Oh? A masked woman? You didn’t know the other person’s identity and you dared to follow her orders. Aren’t you afraid of creating trouble for yourself?”</p>
 <p>Tao Qian composed herself as she mustered the courage to speak clearly under Rong Yuan’s imposing aura, “I know who the person is/”</p>
 <p>“Who is it?” Yan Liang intercepted.</p>
 <p>Although Gu Linglong and Tao Qian’s actions were despicable, the mastermind behind them was the one that was truly evil.</p>
 <p>Tao Qian did not reply as she stared at Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>Guessing her intentions, Rong Yuan sneered, “You tried to harm my future wife and you think you can get away scot-free?”</p>
 <p>Tao Qian shook her head, “I am asking that you punish us differently. I am willing to atone for my sins by helping you.”</p>
