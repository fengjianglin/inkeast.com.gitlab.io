 <p>Anyone would know that Rong Yuan was referring to Jia Haiye. Jia Haiye’s face turned extremely black and the killing intent boiled in his eyes. Just as he was about to start an outburst, a soft cough by a middle-aged man beside him held him back.</p>
 <p>“My friend, I am the vice-captain of the Tanlang Troop, Tao Yi. With utmost sincerity, I would like to invite you to join our Expedition Troop. I can guarantee that we can give you twice what the Langya Troop offered you.” Tao Yi smiled. His soft facial features made him a pretty man.</p>
 <p>However, one would be wrong to judge based on appearance. Everyone who looked down on him because of his appearance had turned into corpses in Forgotten City.</p>
 <p>“Oh? Is that so? Can you give us twice what the Langya Troop offered us?” Rong Yuan cocked his head to the side and stared at Tao Yi. A playful expression crossed Rong Yuan’s face and he smirked slightly. Beside him, Lu Heng was breaking out into cold sweat, he quickly added, “Don’t believe him. All of Forgotten City knows that the Tanlang Club is greedy. If you join them, you will certainly be taken advantage of. Previously, a Gold Class Warrior arrived from Crescent Moon City. He was made to participate in all the dangerous missions and forced to be their slave. You might end up like him!”</p>
 <p>“Nonsense! He’s useless for not being able to defeat a third-order demon beast, it’s not my fault he died. Furthermore, are we supposed to let his belongings rot when we can share them with our members? Does the Langya Troop dare to say that they do not distribute their dead members’ belongings to the rest of the troop?” Jia Haiye pointed accusingly at Lu Heng.</p>
 <p>“How is that the same?” Lu Heng frowned. “I knew that the Gold Class Warrior had sustained a serious injury but you still forced him to face the demonic beasts!”</p>
 <p>“Stop spouting nonsense here. The truth is that he just wasn’t strong enough!” Jia Haiye refused to let Lu Heng rebut.</p>
 <p>As this unfolded, Rong Yuan watched the two people arguing in amusement and he formed an impression about the relationship between the Tanlang and Langya Troops.</p>
 <p>Tao Yi calmly pushed aside his fringe as the argument continued and he seemed to be calm and collected as he said, “If you are strong enough to protect your own assets, why would you be scared of others? Compared to petty schemes, there is much more for you to gain if you join us.”</p>
 <p>“Oh? Please elaborate on this.” Rong Yuan asked, seemingly interested in the offer.</p>
 <p>Tao Yi smirked inwardly. Things were according to plan and Rong Yuan was lured in by his comment. Did he think he was still in the outside world? A Martial Artist who only relied on his spiritual energy would become crippled after the lack of spiritual energy for a month. Would he still be the powerful man he was, even if he was a Demigod before? The Langya Troop was dumb, why let the two people live if they were going to be useless here? They should have acted according to circumstances.</p>
 <p>Tao Yi maintained a smile on his face as he calmly said, “I doubt you know this. As the first-ranked club in the Forgotten City, we have the priority in taking on missions given by the Chancellor and other senior officials. If we complete them properly, we will obtain a large number of rewards. This is a privilege that other troops will not have. If we are lucky, a single mission can be given to more than ten people and there is also plenty of time for us to have fun and play. This means your time will be spent more fruitfully. This is also something that other troops will not be able to offer you.”</p>
 <p><em>Interesting…</em> Rong Yuan rubbed his chin in contemplation. As expected of the vice-captain of the Tanlang Troop, he chose his words wisely. If Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan did not have access to the Inheritance Space, he might have been swayed by the promises Tao Yi gave. After all, they were in an unfamiliar place and they had to take any opportunity given to them seriously.</p>
 <p>However, it was a pity that with the Inheritance Space, Tao Yi had wasted his breath trying to convince them.</p>
 <p>As Rong Yuan pretended to ponder to himself, the group of members from the Langya Troop looked nervously at him. Suddenly, Rong Yuan shrugged and concluded, “You are very convincing. However, I don’t like the fact that you go against your words. Unfortunately, I will have to turn you down.”</p>
 <p>Tao Yi’s face instantly turned dark. He had explained so thoroughly and presented all the opportunities. Why was Rong Yuan so stubborn? He had managed to convince many talented men to join the Tanlang Troop through this paragraph of words.</p>
 <p>“Are you sure that you don’t want to think about it a second time? Many people in Forgotten City wish to enter the Tanlang Troop.”</p>
 <p>Without waiting for Rong Yuan to reply, Lu Heng happily chased Tao Yi away, “Do you not understand his words? Brother Rong does not want to go to Tanlang Troop. Stop being a stubborn brat and get lost. We still need to train, get lost.”</p>
 <p>“You really do not want to join us?” Tao Yi frowned.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan reached down for Gu Lingzhi’s hand and caressed it softly, completely ignoring Tao Yi.</p>
 <p>“Good, good, good!” Tao Yi hissed and all of a sudden, his neck turned a golden color and shone brightly as if it was made of gold. This was a characteristic of a Gold Class Warrior.</p>
 <p>“Since you do not know how to discipline your man, I will help you with it.” The golden-colored hand from Tao Yi swished through the air in the blink of an eye and it was aimed for Lu Heng. If Lu Heng was hit, he would be disfigured forever.</p>
 <p>At that point, Lu Heng was standing behind Tao Yi. He would not be able to defend himself against the slap based on his current strength. Lu Yuan quickly rushed over to block the slap. However, he was too far away and there was no time for him to do anything. Lu Heng shut his eyes, anticipating the worst.</p>
 <p><em>Bam!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>The stinging feeling of a slap on his face did not come but a loud metallic clang rang through the air.</p>
 <p>Lu Heng opened his eyes nervously and focused on what happened.</p>
 <p>A long sword that was made of a special material smashed against Tao Yi’s arm. Just as Lu Heng took a closer look at the sword, the arrogant Tao Yi retracted his arm in shock and pain.</p>
 <p>“I don’t like it when others bully my comrades in front of me,” Rong Yuan calmly kept the sword and declared.</p>
 <p>Everyone present could hear the warning tone behind Rong Yuan’s voice. Rong Yuan had helped Lu Heng, the blow that he gave a second before was strong enough to defend against Tao Yi and even injure him. It was a weapon that was more valuable than gold and it was more powerful than the Wheel of Fire that the captain of Tanlang Troop, Shi Hongtian, possessed. If only they could get it…</p>
 <p>In an instant, all eyes turned towards Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>If Rong Yuan could whip out such a valuable item casually, how many more items would they have in their Storage Rings? The men from Lost Lands were familiar with Storage Rings even though they could not use spiritual energy.</p>
 <p>However, the men also knew that because Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi just arrived at the Lost Lands, they had plenty of spiritual energy in their body. From how Rong Yuan defended Tao Yi’s blow, they could tell that he was a high-ranked Martial Artist who they could not defeat temporarily.</p>
 <p><em>Once the two exhausted the spiritual energy in their bodies…</em></p>
 <p>“Are you trying to make enemies with us?” Through the excruciating pain that shot through his palm, Tao Yi coldly asked.</p>
 <p>Even though he knew that he was not a match for Rong Yuan, he was not afraid of him. The Lost Lands were the cemetery for Martial Artists using spiritual energy. Once Rong Yuan’s spiritual energy was fully exhausted, he could easily overpower him.</p>
 <p>“If that is what you think, then so be it,” Rong Yuan shrugged nonchalantly.</p>
 <p>Tao Yi fumed with rage. However, he could not do anything knowing that Rong Yuan still had spiritual energy in him. Gritting his teeth, he led his troop away with frustration. He threw a cold glare at Rong Yuan before he left, indicating that he was not going to let the matter rest.</p>
 <p><em>Interesting, the Gold Class Warrior’s body would turn a yellow gold color when he fought. How about Amethyst and Glaze Class Warriors?</em></p>
 <p>Rong Yuan pondered to himself and he made a mental note to make a small bet with Gu Lingzhi about the color of the fighters. The loser would grant a request from the winner. Gu Lingzhi’s curiosity was also piqued and she was also interested to know the color of the bodies of the fighter.</p>
 <p>If there were only six men who were on the rank of the Demigods in the Lost Lands, there should not be anyone who would be a threat to them.</p>
 <p>“Brother Rong, if there is no need for it in the future, you should try not to use the spiritual energy in your body,” Lu Yuan suggested to Rong Yuan just as he was about to speak.</p>
 <p>There had been much pressure on him during the confrontation then.</p>
 <p>“Thank you for the reminder but I know what I am doing.” Rong Yuan reassured.</p>
 <p>Observing Rong Yuan’s behaviour, Lu Yuan pursed his lips and said, “You should not have allowed Tao Yi to leave. Tao Yi would definitely inform Shi Hongtian about the day’s events. Shi Hongtian has always been greedy and he will think of many ways to get their sword of yours. You should control your strength and not let him know the full extent of it.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan thought to himself. However, he maintained a kind expression on his face and nodded. Thereafter, he turned to Lu Heng and inquired for places to check out in the area. Lu Heng shook his head in shock but replied.</p>
 <p>“There is nothing much in the area. The two of you should stay in the base camp and wait. Once we are done collecting the items, we can return to the Forgotten City.”</p>
