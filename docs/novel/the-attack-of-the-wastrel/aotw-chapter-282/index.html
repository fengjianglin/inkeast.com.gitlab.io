 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Lingzhi was surprised as she looked confusedly at Rong Yuan. She only knew that Rong Yuan got Su Nian to act as him, but she thought that after the last day at the Sacred Lands, they would have nothing to do with Ding Rou anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So, what did Ding Wei mean?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She…” Rong Yuan squeezed Gu Lingzhi with his hand that was resting on her waist to tell her to stop overthinking, laughing blandly he said, “Maybe she is busy going out with Su Nian in some beautiful place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bastard!” Ding Wei scolded as his eyes turned red. “To think that my sister had loved you since she was young. How dare you treat her like this?” Following this, a golden-based spiritual energy in the shape of a sword flashed in front of Rong Yuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rong Yuan did not even budge as he held Gu Lingzhi. Hua Qingcheng who was sitting on a wildebeest behind them jerked. A wind gale formed as he blocked the attack and it continued to fly towards Ding Wei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ding Wei immediately retracted and flew backwards to retreat. The Martial Sage that was in charge of protecting him immediately drew out his sword. He summoned a fire streak to counter the wind gale that was headed towards them. Standing in front of Ding Wei, he stared unfriendly at Hua Qingcheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“If liking someone means that you try to force a breakup between him and the one he loves, as well as plotting to ruin his country, I’d rather not have an admirer like this.” As Rong Yuan said this, he hugged Gu Lingzhi even closer to him, showing Ding Wei who he loved. He then looked at the Silver-Armored Troops and ordered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Attack them with everything we’ve got! Wipe them out completely!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes!” Gleeful replies could be heard from Silver-Armored Troops all around them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had thought that with Rong Yuan and Ding Wei’s past relationship, they would hold back slightly in this first clash out of mutual respect. It seems like their master was different from others. He did not care about past relationships and was bent on winning. They liked his straightforward way of handling things!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The air around Rong Yuan’s body changed and everyone within a hundred-meter range of him was momentarily blinded as they suddenly appeared in an empty space. The entire space was white. It was very similar to when Gu Lingzhi first entered Liu Yiyan’s domain, except that it was not as big and it was also emptier. It was as if the earth had abandoned these people and thrown them into a small area and left them to survive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The ability to create a space-dimension realm? The rumors are true and the Third Prince is indeed very talented. No wonder people admire him,” one of Ding Wei’s guards, Chu Chao stated. His eyes filled with alarm as he similarly activated his space-dimension realm that was overcast and filled with mud and stones. Together with Rong Yuan’s dimension, both of them were now in partial control of the space around them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Traditionally, every Martial Sage would be the master of their own realm and they would have complete control of the cover of their realm only when they have reached the middle level Martial Sage stage as it required a lot of spiritual power. However, Rong Yuan was only a low level Martial Sage, yet he was already able to control the cover of his realm like a peak middle level Martial Sage. He was definitely a prodigy among prodigies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the two of them released their realms, Hua Qingcheng and another Martial Sage, similarly activated their own realms.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hua Qingcheng’s realm was a gigantic lotus. It was a reflection of the lotus at the end of his Lotus Flower Flute. Everyone knew who this realm belonged to without even trying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The realm of the other person was not as glamorous. Dark green ‘rain’ appeared from midair and fell onto everyone under it. Wherever this dark green ‘rain’ fell, it would corrode clothes causing a hole the size of a thumbnail to appear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is this? It can actually corrode the skin!” Someone from the Silver-Armored Troops shouted as the ‘rain’ fell on him. He quickly created a protective shelter with his spiritual energy over his head, keeping the rain outside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Lingzhi was stunned as she did not think that Ding Wei would have someone so powerful with him. The creation of Chu Chao’s realm could only restrict a person’s movement but would not be able to cause much direct damage. This kind of realm, on the other hand, where the ‘rain’ was corrosive was rarely seen. As long as the person activating this realm had enough spiritual energy to sustain it, then his opponent would have to constantly be on guard to prevent getting hurt. It was what Rong Yuan was doing now. He had created a completely independent space above their heads, sending the ‘rain’ to another area. Although this did not take up a lot of his spiritual energy, sustaining it for a long period would deplete his energy. In a one to one battle, it would be extremely troublesome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was not the end. When the dark green ‘rain’ droplets fell onto the floor, they did not disappear. Instead, it corroded the mud on the floor. Before long, numerous bubbles started to appear on the floor. Everyone who accidentally stepped on them could not help but jump as if they had been scalded. The mud bubbles were corrosive as well. The combination of the two realms by Chu Chao and Pang Huan was perfect, it greatly increased their enemy’s advantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Interesting…” Rong Yua stared at the bubbles on the ground and chuckled. He knew that the person that was creating this corrosive ‘rain’ was called Pang Huan. He was a Martial Sage that was looked upon highly by the king of the Dayin Kingdom. The fact that he was sent here showed that the king believed that the battle between them and the Xia Kingdom was very important.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The intention to fight weighed heavily in Rong Yuan’s eyes. It was obvious that his interest had been piqued by Pang Huan’s unusual dimension. After creating a vacuum space that did not allow the ‘rain’ to enter beside Gu Lingzhi, he hopped onto the wildebeest ready to fight Pang Huan. Gu Lingzhi suddenly grabbed his shirt determinedly and said, “I’m going too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since she was already here, she could not just stand and do nothing as others fought around her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rong Yuan only hesitated for a second before he broke the vacuum space, leaving only a small portion above Gu Lingzhi’s head for her safety. He then patted Gu Lingzhi’s head and warned, “Don’t stray too far from me and be careful.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I will,” Gu Lingzhi laughed lightly as she jumped off the wildebeest back and rushed towards a group of soldiers that were fighting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to the corrosive ‘rain’ and the muddy ground, the combined effect of the four Martial Sages made it more difficult for the soldiers from the Xia Kingdom. The power advantage that they had after the addition of the Silver-Armored Troops was now changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under Pang Huan’s control, the corrosive ‘rain’ was like normal water when it fell onto the Dayin Kingdom’s soldiers and did not hurt them. Whereas for the Xia Kingdom’s soldiers, it caused indescribable pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On one hand, they had to fight the enemy. On the other, they had to create protective layers above them and below their feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not only did this hinder the Xia Kingdom’s soldiers, it also caused a problem for Hua Qingcheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The large lotus that lay open in his dimension gave out sizzling sounds as the ‘rain’ fell. The sounds were similar to when water is thrown into hot oil and the loud sizzles were frightening.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Rong Yuan fought Pang Huan, he controlled the giant lotus and wrapped Chu Chao in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Hua Qingcheng’s realm was not as powerful as Rong Yuan’s or as damaging as Pang Huan’s rain, it had the most annoying ability – to bind people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once someone was binded in the lotus, it was like they entered a maze. The layers of lotus petals would keep the person confused and trapped. They will not be able to tell the direction. With Hua Qingcheng also hidden in the flower, he would appear occasionally and sneak an attack on Chu Chao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On Rong Yuan’s side, after instructing Yuan Zheng to protect Gu Lingzhi, he appeared abruptly in front of Pang Huan. In his space-dimension realm, all he needed was a single thought and he would be able to teleport anywhere in it. It was also the reason why he dared to allow Gu Lingzhi to leave his side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I have long ago heard that the Third Prince of the Xia Kingdom has talent that surpasses anyone. I never thought that it would actually be true.” Pang Huan was a small and skinny middle-aged man. He was so skinny that his face was sunken in and carried an air of death. He looked at Rong Yuan extremely seriously. He could not be careless around someone that was able to activate a realm of such great offensive power when he was only at the initial Martial Sage rank.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You flatter me. It is just baseless rumors,” Rong Yuan humbled. His eyes however, shone with confidence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two of them ended their polite greetings here as Pang Huan pounced towards Rong Yuan just as he finished talking. As he flew towards Rong Yuan, he caused bubbles of mud to fly towards Rong Yuan. However, they were all blocked by the small protective barrier in front of Rong Yuan. Rong Yuan moved at the same time as he suddenly appeared behind Pang Huan. His huge hand raised slightly and a black line as thick as a palm suddenly appeared out of thin air and was about to strike Pang Huan’s back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pang Huan jumped as he hurriedly dodged. He narrowly escaped the repeated attacks from Rong Yuan’s space-dimension realm. A water ball, the same colour as the ‘rain’ appeared in front of him. The black line cut into the water ball as easily as cutting into tofu as the ball exploded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The liquid in the water ball became airborne as it fell onto the ground, causing the colour of the bubbles to turn green. It was obvious that the patch of ground was more corrosive than anywhere else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After entering the Martial Sage rank, the attacks that a Martial Artist could have were not simply confined to the five spiritual energies. Instead, they were able to combine and use derivatives of the five spiritual energies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For example, Pang Huan’s corrosive rainwater was created by water based spiritual energy and beautifully incorporated into his dimension. On the other hand, Rong Yuan’s space-dimension realm was a special ability apart from the five types of spiritual energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Pang, our Xia Kingdom has always looked out for worthy people and treats those with real talent with respect. I wonder if you are interested in visiting the Xia Kingdom’s Royal Palace? My Father will be very happy to meet you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After exchanging over ten blows, Rong Yuan suddenly solicited. It surprised Pang Huan so much that he almost hurt himself by his own corrosive ‘rain’.</span></p>
