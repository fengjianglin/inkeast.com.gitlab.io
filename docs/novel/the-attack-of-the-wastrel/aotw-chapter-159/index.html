<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>In the guest room located at the back of Bright Silk Eating House, Gu Lingzhi lay on the large decorated bed. Her face had a red flush as her hands pulled at her clothes. Tiny beads of sweat decorated her forehead. One look and anyone would be able to tell there was something wrong with her.</p>
 <p>Tao Qian stood by her bedside and took a moment to appreciate the sight of Gu Lingzhi being tortured by the medicine. After she was satisfied, she walked out and closed the door behind her.</p>
 <p>A short while later, Gu Linglong hurried back. Behind her followed a serious and stern looking man.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing who Gu Linglong brought back with her, Tao Qian’s expression immediately hardened as she cursed at the way Gu Linglong handled things. <em>It was no wonder she seldom succeeded in anything. How could she have brought Yan Liang?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Linglong did not stop to register the disapproving look Tao Qian was giving her as she looked on anxiously. As she stepped into the guest room, she faced Yan Liang and said, “Senior Yan, my sister is inside, could you please help to take a look and see what is wrong?”</p>
 <p>Without waiting for her to complete her sentence, Yan Liang burst into the room impatiently.</p>
 <p>Just fifteen minutes ago, he was shopping on the streets hoping that he would be able to chance upon Gu Lingzhi. It was then when he happened to bump into Gu Linglong who was looking for a man for Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>Gu Linglong had wanted to randomly grab a man off the streets for Gu Lingzhi. However, upon seeing Yan Liang, she changed her mind. She was confident of her new idea.</p>
 <p><em>How would any random man she grabbed off the streets have a bigger impact than Yan Liang?</em></p>
 <p>If Gu Lingzhi was caught with a random man, she could easily explain that she was framed. However, if the man she was caught with was Yan Liang, things would be very different. Gu Linglong could easily call for the Third Prince, claiming to report adultery. When that happens, even if the Third Prince believes that Gu Lingzhi was innocent, Yan Liang would not let Gu Lingzhi go easily.</p>
 <p>As for whether Yan Liang would play along and take advantage of Gu Lingzhi, Gu Linglong was confident that he would. When the person he liked was under the influence of a fantasy drug, how would Yan Liang be able to resist?</p>
 <p><em>The truth?</em></p>
 <p>As he saw Gu Lingzhi lying vulnerably on the bed, Yan Liang was shaken and his breathing suddenly got a lot heavier.</p>
 <p>Seeing this, Gu Linglong smirked and closed the door carefully.</p>
 <p>Standing outside, Tao Qian could only pray that Yan Liang would not stick to his old-fashioned ways and take advantage of the beauty in front of him. If he passed up this chance, it would not be easy to lure Gu Lingzhi in the future.</p>
 <p>As Gu Lingzhi heard the sound of the door being shut, she rolled around as her breathing steadied. Her gaze was steady as she looked directly at Yan Liang.</p>
 <p>Although she did not know what happened outside, she was surprised to see Yan Liang enter the room. <em>What has Yan Liang got to do with what happened today?</em></p>
 <p>Her suspicions were dispelled within the next minute. Face filled with fury, Yan Liang leaned over and quickly grabbed the blanket beside Gu Lingzhi, pulling it over her. He sounded distressed as he said, “Don’t worry Lingzhi, I will bring you to a physician.”</p>
 <p>Yan Liang then bent over and carried Gu Lingzhi into his arms.</p>
 <p>“Stop!” Gu Lingzhi breathed out lowly, not sounding as delusional as Yan Liang had imagined.</p>
 <p>“I’m okay. I’m acting like this to find out who is the one instructing Gu Linglong to do all these.”</p>
 <p>Yan Liang froze as he heard this but quickly regained his composure. The look he gave became icy, “Are you saying that someone ordered Gu Linglong to do this?”</p>
 <p>“I am not sure,” Gu Lingzhi shook her head, “But I don’t think Gu Linglong would have thought of this herself.”</p>
 <p>Gu Linglong was too clumsy to plan something like this. It was also because Gu Linglong had suddenly become so kind to Gu Lingzhi that made her suspect something was off.</p>
 <p>“What do you want me to do?” It is no wonder he was someone on the Golden List. Although Yan Liang was slightly inflexible, he was not stupid. The minute he heard what Gu Lingzhi said, he knew she had a plan and he was willing to help her out.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi pursed her lips and smiled. This, along with the flush on her face and the tiny beads of sweat on her forehead, made her look extremely stunning. Yan Liang inhaled sharply as he felt heat rising from an area below his waist. He thought of the distressed expression Gu Lingzhi wore when he first entered the room. <em>It seems like…if he had taken her for himself, there was nothing that the Third Prince could do to get her back.</em></p>
 <p>That dangerous thought flashed through his mind as he quickly forced it to the back of his mind.</p>
 <p><em>No, he couldn’t hurt the first girl he actually liked!</em></p>
 <p>Not noticing the difference in Yan Liang’s behaviour, Gu Lingzhi went up to him and whispered her plan into his ear.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi’s warm breath blew into his ear causing Yan Liang to once again become aroused. With all these thoughts flowing through his mind, he completely missed what Gu Lingzhi said. It was only when he heard a soft knock at the door, did he realise where he was.</p>
 <p>“Senior Yan, how is my sister? Do you need me to call for a physician?”</p>
 <p>Gu Linglong’s pretentious voice floated through the door. If it was not for Gu Lingzhi’s plan, Yan Liang would rush out of the room and Gu Linglong her up. <em>To think that she would even harm her biological sister. It was such a waste of resources to keep someone like her alive.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>“Don’t be rash, follow the plan.”</p>
 <p>Yan Liang nodded as he made his voice hoarse, as if he had been doing something to Gu Lingzhi, “Leave, there is nothing wrong with Lingzhi. I can take care of her.”</p>
 <p>Gu Linglong exchanged a sly look with Tao Qian.</p>
 <p>“I told you he wouldn’t be able to resist her,” Gu Linglong sniggered, “The woman he likes is lying in front of him. Only an idiot would pass up on a chance like that.”</p>
 <p>Tao Qian refrained from replying but felt a little uneasy. She felt that Yan Liang was not someone who would take advantage of others. However, nothing was clear cut when it came to feelings. <em>Wasn’t the fact that it was hard to control your feelings the reason why love could make someone crazy? Who knew? Maybe Yan Liang would also have fallen for it and betrayed his morals.</em></p>
 <p>She hesitated for a while before she was distracted once again by movement in the room.</p>
 <p>Low moans and groans could be heard from the room as the two girls who had yet to do anything of that sort, immediately blushed.</p>
 <p>At this point, Gu Linglong had no more suspicions and let Tao Qian look after the room, making sure no one entered. She then rushed out to call for the Third Prince.</p>
 <p><em>She could not wait to see the look on the Third Prince’s face. It would definitely be interesting.</em></p>
 <p>In the Royal School, Rong Yuan had just finished discussing with the school principal, Rong Zhisheng regarding Gu Lingzhi transferring to a new class. He was just about to ask Yuan Zheng where Gu Lingzhi was when he saw Gu Linglong rushing towards him with a panicked look. She looked at him as if he was her saviour and jumped onto him, “Your Highness, quick, rescue my sister, she looks as if she is about to die!”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan had initially wanted to dodge out of her way but was stunned into staying still as Gu Linglong jumped on him, “What did you say?”</p>
 <p>His deep and constrained voice was ice cold.</p>
 <p>Gu Linglong shivered as she blurted out what she had planned to say.</p>
 <p>“I had wanted to invite my sister to eat with me at Bright Silk Eating House today. However, she suddenly told me she wasn’t feeling well and I requested a guest room for her. I never thought, never thought…”</p>
