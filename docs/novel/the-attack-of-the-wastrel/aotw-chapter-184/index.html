 <p>The final conclusion on Cangwu Realm was the Third Prince and Qin Yue wanting to completely obliterate both the Tianfeng and Beicheng Clans. However, Gu Lingzhi and Qin Xinran considered their relationship with Beicheng Haoyue and held them back. Eventually they decided to end the luck of the clans and stop them from having any peak Martial Artists.</p>
 <p>She would always remember this favor. One was a huge grace while the other was a smaller grace. Tianfeng Jin very naturally leaned towards Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>“Third Prince, take out your sword.”</p>
 <p>Seeing her sword pointed at Rong Yuan, Gu Lingzhi looked at Tianfeng Jin coldly as she felt fear creeping over her.</p>
 <p>From Tianfeng Jin’s expression, she had thought that she was the one that was going to be attacked and never thought that Tianfeng Jin’s target would be Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>Seeing Gu Lingzhi’s confusion, Tianfeng Jin tilted her head slightly and looked at her sternly, “You are injured and cannot fight properly.”</p>
 <p>“…” <em>Did Tianfeng Jin mean that once she recovered, Tianfeng Jin would challenge her?</em></p>
 <p>“You are not my match.” Rong Yuan looked at Tianfeng Jin and said simply. He placed the bowl on a small side table.</p>
 <p>Tianfeng Jin did not budge but instead, took a step forward, “I thought you knew what a gentleman should and should not do. Once you have made a promise, you should keep it for life.”</p>
 <p>When Rong Yuan was persistent in demanding that Gu Lingzhi stayed with him, he had made a promise to Tianfeng Jin to not neglect Gu Lingzhi and will only look at her for his entire life. To think that in just two months, he would already have another woman in his room. The woman was also one of their good friends. <em>How was she to accept this? What was Lingzhi to do?</em></p>
 <p>All of a sudden, Tianfeng Jin looked around her and did not find any signs of Lingzhi. The sword in her hand trembled as she placed it near Rong Yuan’s throat, “Where’s Lingzhi? Did she run away in anger?”</p>
 <p>This was the first time Rong Yuan felt that Tianfeng Jin’s brain was actually quite capable. From just a simple scene, she could think of so many things.</p>
 <p>“Lingzhi had something on so she left for a while, I…”</p>
 <p>“There is no need to argue, you sly bastard! I knew you could not be trusted but yet I still stupidly let you have Lingzhi. It hasn’t been long since you made that promise and you are already playing around? Why would Lingzhi go out at this time? She must have stormed out!”</p>
 <p>Before letting Rong Yuan say the excuse that he had prepared beforehand, Ye Fei cut him off angrily. The look that she gave Rong Yuan was as if she wanted to eat him up. She could not bear to scold the Black Thorn, but with regard to Rong Yuan, she was already used to scolding him.</p>
 <p>Although Rong Yuan’s face seemed indifferent, Gu Lingzhi knew he was trying his best to tolerate Tianfeng Jin’s and Ye Fei’s scolding. This made Gu Lingzhi slightly pleased. The displeasure that she felt when Rong Yuan forced medicine and soup on her had dissipated and she actually felt slightly sorry.</p>
 <p>The reason why she did not tell Tianfeng Jin and Ye Fei about her secret identity was because she wanted to protect herself.</p>
 <p>In her past life, no one had treated her well, causing her to not be able to trust anyone. However, they were different. Maybe at the start, everyone had their own thoughts and intentions. But over the past two years, they had been sincere and truthful to each other, becoming good friends. She had always been looking for an appropriate time to tell them the truth regarding her identity. However, because of the Deity King it was not possible for her to hide any longer.</p>
 <p>However, when she tells them the truth now, it would unintentionally cause them to face the consequence of the Deity King with her. She could not be so selfish…</p>
 <p>“This is a misunderstanding.” Seeing as Tianfeng Jin and Ye Fei was about to attack Rong Yuan, Gu Lingzhi had to explain, “Lingzhi was the one that asked me to stay here and requested for His Highness to take care of me.”</p>
 <p>Seeing the doubt on their faces, Gu Lingzhi tried to be more persuasive as she pulled open the clothes that she had just put on and exposed a newly-wrapped injury on her arm, “I was injured and had difficulty moving about, so His Highness had to take care of me. Also…I am currently being chased by enemies and will only be safe here in the His Highness’ house.”</p>
 <p>“Chased by enemies? Who are your enemies?” Hearing this made Ye Fei remember the reason she came. It was precisely because she had heard that the Black Thorn was under the protection of the Royal Family and would thus be staying with Rong Yuan. They had rushed over upon hearing the rumor but never expected to be met with such a scene.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know.” Gu Lingzhi laughed bitterly as she looked apologetic under her mask, “I seemed to have unintentionally made some enemies. Thankfully, His Highness has made me swear allegiance to the Royal Family and thus, I am under their protection now. This time, I was saved by him. Therefore, I decided to be loyal to him. Once my injury heals, I will leave and both of you do not need to worry.”</p>
 <p>“Is that so?” Ye Fei only half believed her. However, the injuries on Gu Lingzhi’s body were real. Although it was still slightly suspicious, her worry for the Black Thorn overtook her and she dropped the matter. Whether it was true or not, she would confirm with Gu Lingzhi when she got back.</p>
 <p>Tianfeng Jin pursed his lips and proceeded to keep her sword. Her eyes drifted to the door as she hoped that Gu Lingzhi would appear and explain the situation. But her hopes were most certainly dashed as until night fell, Gu Lingzhi did not appear.</p>
 <p>Under the Black Thorn’s promise that Gu Lingzhi really did not leave out of anger and would return the next day, Tianfeng Jin and Ye Fei finally left with doubts and worry still lingering over them.</p>
 <p>After the two of them left, Gu Lingzhi vented all her frustration on Rong Yuan and rolled her eyes multiple times through the night. This made Rong Yuan worried that her eyeballs would fall out. He then promised that he would behave properly in front of Tianfeng Jin and the others to prevent them from suspecting them. This finally appeased Gu Lingzhi and stopped her from rolling her eyes.</p>
 <p>She remembered how he tolerated and pampered her and could not help but snigger. Although this life has been tough, Gu Lingzhi felt like if she had someone with her, no matter how difficult it was going to be, it would just be a test for them.</p>
 <p>The following day, in order to stop Tianfeng Jin and Ye Fei from being suspicious, Gu Lingzhi was waiting for them in the living room before they even arrived.</p>
 <p>Alas, before long the two of them appeared. Upon seeing Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan sitting in the living room and eating breakfast, Ye Fei’s eyes narrowed as she thought of an excuse. Tianfeng Jin did not bother going in circles and brought up the situation directly.</p>
 <p>“Lingzhi, did you let the Black Thorn stay here?”</p>
 <p>“Yes,” Gu Lingzhi nodded her head and smiled slightly, “Her injury is quite serious, so I asked Rong Yuan to take care of her. I did not know that this would result in misunderstandings. It is my fault for not being considerate and telling you guys beforehand.”</p>
 <p>Tianfeng Jin finally rest assured after hearing Gu Lingzhi’s explanation. The look she gave Rong Yuan was still ugly, “I shall believe you this once, but if you ever do anything wrong towards Lingzhi, I will not forgive you!”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan raised his eyebrows disapprovingly, “That day will never come.”</p>
 <p>“I hope so.”</p>
 <p>Seeing how Tianfeng Jin was still not satisfied, Gu Lingzhi stretched out her hand and pulled Tianfeng Jin to sit beside her. She pushed a bowl of porridge in front of her, “Both of you came so early, I bet you haven’t eaten breakfast, right? Ye Fei, come and eat too.”</p>
 <p>“Okay.” Ye Fei immediately found a seat to sit. Gu Lingzhi knew she was right. The minute the two of them woke, they got dressed and rushed to her without eating breakfast.</p>
 <p>“Right, Lingzhi, how is the Black Thorn doing? I want to see her.” After eating, Ye Fei wiped her mouth and asked.</p>
 <p>“She hasn’t woken yet and needs more rest. Let’s not disturb her and go to school.”</p>
 <p>“That’s right, with that teacher who never ever starts class on time, it is better to go early to class.” Upon knowing that it was not convenient to meet the Black Thorn now, Ye Fei dropped trying to visit her and looked pointedly at Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan pretended not to hear as he continued to eat his porridge. With regard to Ye Fei’s occasional mocking, Rong Yuan was already used to it and had an automatic filter for her words.</p>
 <p>The three of them were classmates and Rong Yuan was their teacher. After breakfast, they headed to class together.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, in Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan’s dorm, a girl was currently wearing the Black Thorn’s mask and lying down, pretending to be the Black Thorn. In order not to raise suspicions, while the Black Thorn was recovering, this girl that was Rong Yuan’s subordinate would pretend to be the Black Thorn.</p>
 <p>Maybe it was upon hearing Rong Yuan’s name that stopped the men from the North Qiu Kingdom, but when the Black Thorn entered the Royal School, there were no more attacks on her. Using the Black Thorn’s identity, Gu Lingzhi brought this up with Pan Yue.</p>
 <p>Under the potion that changed his appearance to a common man, he looked wordlessly at her before saying, “Have you forgotten that you still had a partner?” He then used his hands and gestured at himself.</p>
 <p>“You are saying… that you were the one that chased those people away?” Gu Lingzhi’s eyes widened as she looked at him in disbelief.</p>
 <p>“Not really.” Pan Yue coughed awkwardly, “I just created some trouble for them making it difficult for them to bother you.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi remained speechless as her eyes reflected disdain.</p>
 <p>“What kind of look is that?” Pan Yue looked discontented. “If it wasn’t for me, how would you have so much time to recover?”</p>
 <p>This was true and Gu Lingzhi retracted her disdainful gaze.</p>
 <p>“However, treating the symptoms is not as good as treating the root cause. You can’t delay them forever. They will eventually find another time to assassinate you and what should we do then?” From what they had discussed, Pan Yue will do everything that he can to protect Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>“As long as you don’t get caught by any of them in the Inter-school Competition. When the time comes, I have a plan to get them to drop their suspicions on you.”</p>
 <p>“Inter-school Competition?” <em>What was that?</em></p>
 <p>This time, the person that looked disdainful was Pan Yue, “Don’t tell me you don’t even know about this. In the entire Tianyuan Continent, there will be an Inter-school Competition held every five years. Every student is eligible to participate. This year’s Inter-school Competition will be held by the First School in North Qiu Kingdom. Don’t tell me that as a descendant of the Spirit Tribe, you can’t even qualify to attend.”</p>
 <p>“…” She had truly never heard about such an event before.</p>
