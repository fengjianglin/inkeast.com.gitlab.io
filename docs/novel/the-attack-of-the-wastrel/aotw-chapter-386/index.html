 <p>After some discussions, it was decided that the people to be sent to support the Burnt City would be Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>Of these two people, one was a top Martial Artist with both the cultivation and physique at the level of a Demigod, while the other possessed the Inheritance Space. When they faced any dangers, they could hide inside the Inheritance Space. Hence, there was no one else more suitable to go than the two of them. It was decided just like that. Before they left, Tang Yan held onto Gu Lingzhi reluctantly and blamed Lin Chongyuan for sending her precious granddaughter to such a dangerous place. It was only after Gu Lingzhi had assured her repeatedly, did she finally release her hold and let Gu Lingzhi leave.</p>
 <p>The two of them rushed for three days without sleep and finally arrived at the Burnt City on the fourth day. From far away, then could already see countless beasts surrounding the Burnt City. Gu Lingzhi sucked in her breath in shock. <em>Were all the beasts in the Heavenly Lands gathered here?&nbsp;</em>The Burnt City was surrounded by a swarm of black dots. If their guide had not confirmed that it was the Burnt City, Gu Lingzhi would have thought that it was a huge beast nest. The city could not be seen at all.</p>
 <p>“Esteemed guests, this way please.” The guide said anxiously as he brought the two of them to the entrance of an underground passage.</p>
 <p>The entrance of the secret passageway was hidden in a small bush. The unassuming location would reduce the chances of being discovered. After the vegetation was pushed away, the stone slab hidden underneath was revealed. To prove the safety of the passageway, the guide lifted the stone slab and entered before them.</p>
 <p>This passageway led directly to the Burnt City’s Chancellor’s Manor.. The founder of the Burnt City had constructed this passage to be used as an escape route in cases of emergencies. Unexpectedly, it turned out to be useful in this situation.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan nodded his head and held onto Gu Lingzhi as he followed the guide and entered the secret passageway. The entrance was very short, requiring an adult to bend over in order to go through. The guide explained, “In order to hide the entrance better, it was designed and constructed to be smaller and narrower. It will be better once you go in.”</p>
 <p>Indeed, as they walked deeper in, the tunnel continued to widen until it could fit over ten people walking side by side. This resembled the typical scale of a secret escape route.</p>
 <p>As the three of them shuttled through the tunnel, they could occasionally feel the tremors coming from the ground above. They sighed in appreciation at the foresight of the person who built the tunnel, for building it deep enough such that it did not collapse even when there were so many beasts above them. Otherwise, they have been exposed and trampled a long time ago.</p>
 <p>They advanced for about half an hour before they finally saw the end of the tunnel. When they exited the secret passageway, the strong, pungent smell of blood almost overwhelmed Gu Lingzhi. Luckily, she held her breath in time and did not pass out from the stench. She looked at her surroundings vigilantly.</p>
 <p>The exit of the secret passageway was located inside a training room. The roars of the beasts outside could be heard. A soldier had been assigned to wait there. When he saw that there were people coming out from the tunnel, his eyes lit up. However, when he realised that there were only three people, one of whom was even the guide, his face hardened and he quietly cursed the Spirit City for being petty. <em>How could they send this pair of young master and mistress who looked like they had never suffered any hardships before? Were they here just for fun?</em></p>
 <p>When the guide saw how the soldier’s expression dimmed, he knew that he had gotten the wrong idea. To prevent Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan from being offended and leaving, he hurriedly smiled and introduced, “Soldier, are you still not going to greet these two esteemed guests? Out of goodwill, the Spirit City’s Chancellor actually sent his granddaughter and her husband over to help.”</p>
 <p><em>Spirit City’s Chancellor’s granddaughter and her husband? Aren’t they the Martial Artists who came from the outside world? Rumors had it that both his physique and cultivation had reached the level of a Demigod, and that he was the undisputed top Martial Artist in the Lost Lands. His wife was extraordinary too. Her physique and cultivation were both at the level of a Martial Sage. The Spirit City actually sent these two top Martial Artists here, they really gave it their all.</em></p>
 <p>As he thought of this, the soldier’s expression lifted once more, and his eyes shone brightly. He eagerly welcomed them, “I never expected these two esteemed guests to come. The Chancellor has been waiting for your arrival, please follow me to the front.”</p>
 <p>The environment in the room was actually pretty good, there were still walls to block and the situation outside could not be seen. However, once out of the training room, Gu Lingzhi immediately saw the cruel scenes of people fighting the beasts.</p>
 <p>Le Yan’s mobilization was quite good. He guarded Burnt City’s outer perimeter strictly and firmly controlled the grounded beasts outside without letting them enter Burnt City at all. However, he was unable to manage the beasts who could fly. Hence, what Gu Lingzhi saw was actually the residents of Burnt City fighting against the beasts who had flown over the city walls and entered the city.</p>
 <p>The countless flying beasts above Burnt City resembled a small rain cloud. Many of the beasts had already descended into the city and were fighting the citizens. The floor was littered with the corpses of both humans and beasts, and the strong stench of blood permeated the air. Without even looking, one could already tell how violent the situation was.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi could not bear looking at it. Rong Yuan hugged and comforted her as he followed behind the soldier, rushing towards the Burnt City’s gates. Loud screams rang endlessly in their ears as they travelled from the Chancellor’s Manor to the city gates. This stretch alone took them a full hour to complete.</p>
 <p>Le Yan was exhausted as he stood on the city walls and looked down at the beasts. Seven days had already passed from when he had sent out the request for aid. In these seven days, the beasts had gone from simply surrounding the city at the start, to utilising several sieging tactics and starting a two-pronged battle – one on the ground and one in the air. As the Burnt City had no aerial defences in place, the skies had become a playground for the flying beasts.</p>
 <p>There had been innumerable deaths in the past few days and the number of beast corpses also increased endlessly. It was as though the beasts had already discussed amongst themselves and had come to a consensus not to cannibalize on their corpses. In fact, they left the bodies lying on the ground and started to use it as stepping stones. The bodies below the city walls started to pile up higher and higher. In just a few more days, the pile of corpses would be level with the city walls. At that time, the city walls which were currently repressing the beasts, would become nothing more than mere decoration.</p>
 <p><em>Was he supposed to give up just like this?</em> Le Yan clenched his fists unwillingly.</p>
 <p>If he lost the Burnt City, it would not be an easy matter to rebuild another city even if he wanted to. Furthermore, nobody knew when the beasts would retreat. If their intention was the same as what Le Yan had claimed to threaten the other cities, which was to take over all the human cities, then there would definitely be no hope in rebuilding the city anymore. He could only hole up in one of the other cities, becoming someone else’s henchmen. When the beasts started their attacks, he might even be sent to the frontlines as cannon fodder.</p>
 <p><em>No, he absolutely would not allow that to happen!</em></p>
 <p>“Pass down the orders to toss out oil barrels and burn the corpses.”</p>
 <p>Le Yan had just sent out the order when he saw the soldier who was in charge of waiting for the reinforcements. Le Yan’s eyes immediately lit up when he saw the two figures following behind.</p>
 <p>He was not like those other ignorant people who were unaware of their capabilities. He had already seen the portraits of them long ago. He was so delighted they were the reinforcements sent from the Spirit City that he even felt like laughing and thanking the heavens.</p>
 <p>With these two people here, the possibility of protecting the Burnt City increased by several margins.</p>
 <p>After a simple introduction, Gu Lingzhi turned her head to look outside the city. When she saw the mountains of corpses that were soon to be level with the city walls, she also had the same worry as Le Yan.</p>
 <p>Once the mountain of corpses was level with the city walls, the Burnt City would officially be under attack. Gu Lingzhi immediately raised her hand and summoned large swathes of flames. Although the beasts could have retreated to safety, they stubbornly stood their ground and took the hit from the flames. Gu Lingzhi took the opportunity to increase the strength of her flames and controlled the flames to incinerate the bodies below.</p>
 <p>Not long later, the pile of bodies below the wall that Gu Lingzhi was standing on, had been burnt by a substantial amount, lowering its height.</p>
 <p>However, there were simply too many corpses surrounding the city. Even if Gu Lingzhi went around burning the bodies like this, it would only be a temporary measure. In no time at all, the bodies would fill it back up to its previous levels again.</p>
 <p>Le Yan asked anxiously, “Little Chancellor, is there no way for us to get rid of these corpses quickly?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi stared at him silently. Le Yan’s information network appeared to be very extensive and updated, he was even aware of the nickname that people called her in Spirit City. <em>Had a spy from Burnt City infiltrated the Spirit City’s Chancellor’s Manor?</em></p>
 <p>However, she had no time to pursue these matters now. Gu Lingzhi motioned for Le Yan to retreat a few steps then retrieved a dark green bottle from her Storage Ring. The bottle was decorated strangely, with purplish-black swirls all over. It was the Corpse Disintegration Liquid. As its name suggests, it was used to disintegrate corpses, commonly used when killing people.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi removed the stopper and poured out a few drops on the surrounding corpses. The mountains of bodies started to melt at a visible speed and the air was saturated with the stench of rotting corpses.</p>
 <p>All the brave people fighting on the city walls cheered loudly when they saw this scene. Without the mounds of bodies as a stepping stone, the beasts would not be able to climb the city walls so easily, and they would thus find it much easier to defend the city.</p>
 <p>The liquid disintegrated corpses, but it could also burn any living things that come into contact with it. A few beasts had been contaminated by the liquid and they let out loud wails as they retreated in fear. Gu Lingzhi observed that the liquid was effective and immediately separated out a small portion and split it into three smaller bottles that she handed over to Le Yan, “Let the people use this in the other areas.”</p>
 <p>Le Yan excitedly found three soldiers to do the job. Before they left, Gu Lingzhi reminded them, “I only have this one bottle of liquid that I brought in from the outside world, once it’s finished, there’s no more.”</p>
 <p>After they heard that sentence, the three guards who were originally very eager to act, suddenly felt the immense importance and weight of the bottle of the Corpse Disintegrating Liquid that they were holding. They had wanted to put on a good show in front of the others, but now they had no choice but to be extremely careful. There was only this one bottle of this liquid, if they wanted to prevent the beasts from using the mountains of bodies to climb the city walls, they would have to be very prudent in their usage!</p>
 <p>With this liquid, the beasts suffered a huge loss. Many beasts were affected by the Corpse Disintegration Liquid and were melted alive into pus. In less than two hours, the beasts who had been attacking the Burnt City, roared loudly and retreated.</p>
