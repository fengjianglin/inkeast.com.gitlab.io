 <p>The Inter-school Competition was something that was organized for all schools in the Tianyuan Continent. On the surface, it was for students to meet and exchange knowledge. However, in actual fact it was done by North Qiu Kingdom to intimidate and show off to other Kingdoms.</p>
 <p>The top three places in the competition were always attained by North Qiu students, with most of them coming from the publicly-funded First School. The First School also lives up to its name, producing the greatest number of experts which is just slightly more than the number of experts the Royal School produces. The other schools in the country were hardly comparable to even the Royal School and it was also the reason why the North Qiu Kingdom was much stronger than any other Kingdom.</p>
 <p>In the past hundred years, Rong Yuan was the only student that ranked first in the competition ten years ago. This was a surprise to everyone. However, most of the time the top positions were hogged by students from the North Qiu Kingdom, causing them to be complacent and ambitious at the same time.</p>
 <p>“But this year, the North Qiu Kingdom will have no chance to show off,” Rong Yuan looked at Gu Lingzhi as he raised his eyebrows proudly, “With you and Nie Sang, no matter how good the teaching is at the North Qiu Kingdom, they will lose to both of you.”</p>
 <p>“Me?” Gu Lingzhi blinked. “Didn’t you say that there were only three places for every rank? Isn’t there a selection?”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan snorted, “What is there to choose?”</p>
 <p><em>Oh well, it seemed that being with Rong Yuan came with its benefits. There were some advantages when it came to having an influential fiancé.</em></p>
 <p>Before she knew about this, Gu Lingzhi did not realise that almost the entire school was talking about the Inter-school Competition. In two days, the selection process for students to attend the Inter-school Competition started.</p>
 <p>After seven days of intense selection, Tianfeng Jin and Xin Yi became the other two Martial Practitioners representing the Royal School in the Inter-school Competition.</p>
 <p>On the day that the selection ended, Gu Lingzhi went to the Training Tower that she had neglected for months. In six hours, she completed all the training available for Martial Practitioners and placed first on the Stone Tablet for Martial Practitioners. This made all those that were against her having a place in the Inter-school Competition without going through the selection no reason to protest.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi recognized several other names on the list of participants for the Inter-school Competition.</p>
 <p>In the Martial Student’s list, she saw Su Nian’s name. While on the Martial Teacher’s list, Nie Sang, Yan Liang and Lang Jingchen were all on it.</p>
 <p>It certainly was a small world. Seeing these familiar names, Gu Lingzhi wiped her nonexistent cold sweat. She thought about Rong Yuan who volunteered to lead them and started to worry. <em>Would there be… internal conflicts even before the competition began?</em></p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, they wouldn’t dare to try anything.” Seeing Gu Lingzhi fall silent, Rong Yuan commented. “This concerns the honor of Xia Kingdom and if they dare to create trouble during the competition, it would mean betraying their country.”</p>
 <p>Now, Gu Lingzhi truly broke out in cold sweat. <em>Since when did internal conflicts suddenly become an issue of betraying the country? Could his personal agenda be any more obvious?</em></p>
 <p>As for the assassins sent after her from the North Qiu Kingdom, she managed to escape quite a few attacks with the protection of the Third Prince’s men. They had found someone to act as the Black Thorn and stay in the dorm while she moved around as Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>After the last attack, Rong Yuan told her that they were unable to obtain anything concrete from her attackers and this made Gu Lingzhi slightly afraid. <em>If it was not for Pan Yue’s warning, would she have thought that the attack was just an incident and continued to move around as Black Thorn? Would she have continued until she was completely exposed as a descendant of the Spirit Tribe or maybe even until she was killed?</em></p>
 <p>“The one month of exchange program has ended right? Shouldn’t Xiao Wu return too?”</p>
 <p>From their numerous interactions, Gu Lingzhi has now gotten used to calling Pan Yue by his nickname, Xiao Wu, whenever she was not in public.</p>
 <p>The corners of Rong Yuan’s eyes suddenly twitched as his expression suddenly became wary.</p>
 <p>“…Why? What has he done now?” With regard to Pan Yue’s mischievous behavior, Gu Lingzhi had already seen pretty much everything.</p>
 <p>“I was about to tell you that the Second Prince from the North Qiu Kingdom is here as well. On the surface, the reason for his visit is to escort Xiao Wu back.”</p>
 <p>“The Second Prince of the North Qiu Kingdom?” Gu Lingzhi was mildly surprised, “Is Xiao Wu so important that the Second Prince has to come and escort him back?”</p>
 <p>“That is why I said it is only on the surface.” Rong Yuan’s face became serious. “I suspect the real reason for his visit is you.”</p>
 <p>“For me?” Gu Lingzhi hesitated for a moment before understanding, “Are you saying that the Second Prince is the one that sent assassins after me?”</p>
 <p>“That’s right, from what I have investigated, the Second Prince of North Qiu Kingdom, Pan En, has been in the capital city for over half a month but only showed himself today. He was the one that arranged the attack on you that time.” Rong Yuan’s eyes glazed over as he said this.</p>
 <p>Before the assassins dressed in black had committed suicide, he had already known that Pan En was in the city. His subordinates that investigated Pan En confirmed his suspicions. If they were not targeting her, why would his men always coincidentally be in the area whenever Gu Lingzhi was attacked?</p>
 <p>What a pity… he could not kill him yet. At least, nothing could be done to Pan En in the Xia Kingdom. If not, it would just confirm that there was a connection to Gu Lingzhi and that she was a descendant of the Spirit Tribe. Now, their only advantage was that the other party could not confirm Gu Lingzhi’s identity and are holding back on a full-on chase to prevent chasing the wrong person.</p>
 <p>If something happens to Pan En in the Xia Kingdom, it would not matter if he died or was simply injured, things would get messy. It was rumored that Pan En was the next in line to the throne.</p>
 <p>Sensing the change in Rong Yuan’s attitude, Gu Lingzhi squeezed his hand comfortingly and changed the topic, “I have people protecting me, nothing will happen to me. On the other hand, what did Pan Yue do to cause this reaction in you?”</p>
 <p>Returning the gesture, Rong Yuan held Gu Lingzhi’s hand, surprised by this rare gesture of hers. He momentarily brushed the issue with Pan Yue to one side. Thinking of the image earlier, the corners of his mouth twitched.</p>
 <p>“This happened while you were in the Training Tower. Today, in order to not go back with Pan En, Pan Yue literally abandoned whatever image he had left. He hugged Pan En’s leg and sat down on the floor in the Royal School and threw a tantrum begging Pan En to let him stay for a few more days. He said that he would go back along with the participants heading to the North Qiu Kingdom.”</p>
 <p>“…” Gu Lingzhi was completely speechless, no words could describe what she was currently feeling.</p>
 <p>But alas, this method was very effective. Pan En was highly favoured by the North Qiu Kingdom’s Emperor and was next in line to the throne. He could not bear to embarrass himself in public and grudgingly agreed to his request after Pan Yue continued crying for over an hour. He then went and stayed in a neighboring dormitory. This dormitory was not far from the Third Prince’s dorm.</p>
 <p>“I hope that he will use this chance and plan an attack while staying in the Royal School. This way, I can openly teach him a lesson,” Rong Yuan said darkly.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi tilted her head to the ceiling silently. Who would be so stupid to mount an attack in the Royal School? This place was under the supervision of numerous Demigods. Even if it was the Second Prince of the North Qiu Kingdom, he would have to ask these Demigods for permission if he dared to do anything.</p>
 <p>Time flew and soon, it was time to leave for the North Qiu Kingdom.</p>
 <p>The night before they left, Pan Yue met up with Gu Lingzhi who was in disguise as the Black Thorn and asked her solemnly, “Why are you not in the list of participants going to North Qiu?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi took her time to answer as she found a place to sit. Speaking slowly, she said, “Didn’t you say that as long as I reach the North Qiu Kingdom, you would have a way to make them not suspect me? Since that is the case, why does it matter whether I compete or not? Don’t I just have to go there?”</p>
 <p>Pan Yue paused, “Are you saying that the Third Prince will bring you to attend the competition?”</p>
 <p>With regard to the Black Thorn’s loyalty to Rong Yuan after the attack, the excuse Gu Lingzhi gave to Pan Yue was that the Black Thorn had once given Gu Lingzhi a Spirit Cleansing Pill and thus, Gu Lingzhi was indebted to the Black Thorn.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Rong Yuan agreed to protect the Black Thorn.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi did not intend to go into the details and Pan Yue did not press for more information. After all, the two of them were not that close and did not have the right to ask certain questions. In addition, with Rong Yuan’s protection it would be easier on Pan Yue.</p>
 <p>“Naturally, I would then have to pledge my loyalty to him.” Gu Lingzhi said neutrally, “On the other hand, I heard that you sacrificed quite a bit in order to stay in the Xia Kingdom.”</p>
 <p>It did not escape her that in the past month, a handsome-looking gentleman suddenly appeared in the city and started chasing Qin Xinran. He has been pursuing her fervently and even coincidentally met with her a few times. Whenever that man appeared, Pan Yue would simultaneously disappear from his dorm. What a coincidence.</p>
 <p>Pan Yue’s face immediately hardened as a red flush quickly made his way to his ears, reddening the tips of his ears and eventually his neck as well.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi did not hold back her laughter.</p>
 <p>Pan Yue turned his embarrassment into anger as he glared at her, “Don’t think that I don’t know what is going on between you and the Third Prince. If Lady Gu knows about this, aren’t you afraid she won’t let you stay anymore?”</p>
 <p>“Want to bet?” Gu Lingzhi stuck out her pinky, “If I am still allowed to stay with them even after Gu Lingzhi knows, you will dance in front of Xinran. How about that?”</p>
 <p><em>What a threat!</em></p>
 <p>Pan Yue paused. He knew that she had found out about him hiding his identity in order to pursue Qin Xinran. He gritted his teeth in anger.</p>
 <p>“Hopefully, you are still able to smile when you lose!”</p>
 <p>Afterwhich, Pan Yue stormed off without turning back. It seemed like what he did with his true identity would forever be a stain that he could not get rid of.</p>
 <p>The following day, at the mountains behind the Royal School, a group of students climbed onto the Griffins who were three meters tall under Rong Yuan’s orders. The destination -- the North Qiu Kingdom’s First School.</p>
