<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>The news of the Third Prince announcing that he was going to make Gu Lingzhi his fiancée had spread around the campus in under an hour. Though different people had reacted differently, their initial reaction was the same – shock and disbelief. Even then, there was no way that anyone would be more shocked than Yan Liang who had witnessed this with his own eyes.</p>
 <p>“Has their engagement… been confirmed?” Yan Liang stammered as he walked back to his hostel absent-mindedly.</p>
 <p>As his father was a Demigod, Yan Liang was frequently under pressure to perform. This also meant that he did not have as much freedom as others his age. Everyday, he did not do much other than train his cultivation, in hopes of succeeding his father to become the next Demigod General of the Kingdom. After some time, it had become part of his personality to be overly serious and unable to relax.</p>
 <p>Falling for Gu Lingzhi was unpredictable for him – so unpredictable that he did not even know that this was what it felt like to like someone. He could only follow his intuition by silently helping Gu Lingzhi to solve some of her problems and inconveniences. When he had heard that the Third Prince was wooing Gu Lingzhi as well, he had a sour feeling in his heart that was almost suffocating, and that was when he learnt that that was what jealousy felt like.</p>
 <p>Yan Liang, who was not good at expressing himself using words or getting a girl to like him, could only ask his sister to put a bouquet that he had meticulously prepared at Gu Lingzhi’s hostel every day at dawn in hopes of making her happy. When he saw that Gu Lingzhi had put every bouquet into a vase in front of her door, his heart was full and happy.</p>
 <p>Just when he had summed up his courage to confess to a girl, just like any other normal boy when they had fallen for a girl, he was met with the scene of Rong Yuan kissing Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>The Third Prince had said that… he had already sent people to propose marriage to Gu Lingzhi. Needless to say, he could already guess what was going to happen. When the Kingdom’s War God proposed marriage to someone, it would be dumb to say no.</p>
 <p>“I guess… I was still too late after all,” Yan Liang said remorsefully. If he had known earlier that he had liked Gu Lingzhi, he would have begun wooing her the moment he saw her and not stare at her from a distance like a fool.</p>
 <p>“What are you late for?” Lu Feng asked, knowing that something was wrong the moment Yan Liang had returned. There was always calmness in Yan Liang’s eyes, but now it was replaced by frustration.</p>
 <p>Yan Liang turned around to face him, his eyes full of pain. It was hard for him to say and he was almost grimacing, “She is going to become the Third Prince’s fiancée.”</p>
 <p>“What has that got to do with you?” Lu Feng asked.</p>
 <p><em>The Third Prince’s fiancée? That must be a woman. What did it mean for a man to be so upset when he hears that a woman is going to be someone else’s fiancée?</em></p>
 <p>“You… you have fallen for Tianfeng Wei?” <em>Didn’t the Third Prince cancel his engagement with her some time ago?</em></p>
 <p>“Do not compare her to Tianfeng Wei,” Yan Liang said with disdain. <em>Tianfeng Wei was only capable of using her clan’s reputation to show off, how could she be compared with Gu Lingzhi in the slightest?</em></p>
 <p>“Who could it be if not Tianfeng Wei?” Lu Feng asked confusedly, before a name suddenly appeared in his head. “Unless… you’re talking about the eldest daughter from the Gu Clan?”</p>
 <p>Yan Liang nodded his head, a bitter look on his face. “The Third Prince had announced earlier that he had sent people to the Gu Clan to propose marriage. It will not be long before there’s news that they are engaged.”</p>
 <p>Lu Feng was at a loss – he did not know how to comfort Yan Liang. He could only pat Yan Liang’s shoulder, “There are plenty of other fish in the sea. Given your qualities, you can definitely find someone better.”</p>
 <p>“I will not,” Yan Liang shook his head, “Even if there was someone better for me, it would not be the same.”</p>
 <p><em>Lu Feng did not think that Yan Liang would be such a fool in love.</em></p>
 <p>Lu Feng accompanied Yan Liang in drinking wine to drown his sorrows the entire day. He suddenly thought of an important question when he was drunk.</p>
 <p>“Yan Liang, when did you start to like Gu Lingzhi?” <em>He spent time almost every day with Yan Liang, how could he not have found this out?</em></p>
 <p>“I don’t know when too,” Yan Liang said drunkenly, his words slurred. “Maybe the first time I saw her? When I finally found out that I liked her and wanted to woo her, it was too late, she was already someone else’s…”</p>
 <p>Looking at the state that Yan Liang was in, Lu Feng had realized something – it was scary to not have any common sense.</p>
 <p>Though he felt that it was inappropriate to laugh at his situation now, he could not help but laugh anyway. <em>How can someone not know that they liked someone?&nbsp;</em>According to what Yan Liang had said, when he had first set his eyes on Gu Lingzhi, the Third Prince had not even started wooing her yet. If he knew that he liked her from the beginning, there was a possibility that she would be his fiancée now.</p>
 <p>Lu Feng could not stop laughing, but he managed to say a few words of encouragement, “Do not grieve over this.”</p>
 <p>There was no point in regretting something that had already been missed out on. It made more sense to Lu Feng that Yan Liang seized this opportunity to start getting to know more girls. Who knew? He might start fancying some other girl and forget that Gu Lingzhi ever existed. If this could happen then Lu Feng would have fulfilled the task that General Yan had entrusted to him. General Yan knew that his son was only preoccupied with training, and had no other interests in anything else. He was starting to worry that if this went on, the Yan Clan’s family line would not be continued.</p>
 <p>“Why would I grieve? Lingzhi isn’t even dead, she is alive and kicking,” Yan Liang replied. He was so drunk that he was no longer thinking clearly.</p>
 <p>“Yes, okay, she isn’t dead, she’s still alive,” Lu Feng could only helplessly play along. He was not about to explain to a drunkard what he meant when he told Yan Liang not to grieve.</p>
 <p>“She’s fine, why should I grieve?” a drunk Yan Liang repeated unconsciously. He was upset with the choice of words that Lu Feng had used. “I’m a nobody to her. No, that’s not right! Even if she’s engaged to the Third Prince, as long as they are not married yet, they can always cancel the engagement, just like how he cancelled his engagement with Tianfeng Wei!”</p>
 <p>Not being able to think straight, Yan Liang suddenly stood up and stumbled on his feet.</p>
 <p>“As long as they are not married, I’ll have a chance!”</p>
 <p>With that, Yan Liang hurriedly went outside. Lu Feng was stunned for a moment but went to keep up with Yan Liang.</p>
 <p>“Yan Liang, what are you doing?”</p>
 <p>Yan Liang did not even turn his head as he shouted, “I’m going to make a confession!”</p>
