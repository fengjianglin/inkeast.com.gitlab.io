<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>In the end, in order to prove that he was a real man, Rong Yuan left Gu Lingzhi’s dormitory unwillingly. Before he left, he worriedly asked about the reason behind their increase cultivation levels. After he confirmed that they had consumed some special Spiritual Medicines bought by the Ye Family and that it would not have any negative impacts on their future cultivations, he was relieved.</p>
 <p>After Rong Yuan left, the remaining three people looked at Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>“Lingzhi, how come your cultivation level hasn’t changed? Have you not consumed the Spirit Cleansing Pill?”</p>
 <p>“Yes. Before, when I was about to take the Spirit Cleansing Pill, I noticed intense spiritual fluctuations coming from your rooms. I decided to protect you all instead, in case the abnormal spiritual fluctuations get discovered by others and result in some trouble.”</p>
 <p>They dispelled their suspicions after hearing Gu Lingzhi’s explanation. Delighted, they expressed that it was now their turn to protect her and rushed Gu Lingzhi to consume the Spirit Cleansing Pill. Gu Lingzhi had no choice but to waste a few good Spiritual Medicines by crushing them and pairing them with the Spirit Essence Bath to create a result similar to using the Spirit Cleansing Pill.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi estimated the time and when it was right, she exited her room. Her cultivation had increased to that of a Level Eight Martial Student. The other three felt envious about her frightening rate of improvement and lamented not having had the Spirit Cleansing Pill earlier.</p>
 <p>If Gu Lingzhi had appeared before that crowd earlier, they would have been equally surprised. Even if they had expected Gu Lingzhi’s cultivation to skyrocket after witnessing the improvement of Ye Fei’s and the others, they would not have expected Gu Lingzhi to improve so quickly.</p>
 <p><em>It had not even been a year, but she had already become a Level Eight Martial Student. How was it possible?</em></p>
 <p>Regardless of the surprised and envious discussions all around, time passed very quickly, and soon enough, it was the day of the auction.</p>
 <p>This one day, Gu Lingzhi realised that Rong Yuan and Yan Liang who had been stuck tightly to her, had disappeared. There was only Su Nian, who was weak in battle and driven off by her after a few words. She happily headed towards Jubao Pavilion with Ye Fei and the others.</p>
 <p>When Gu Lingzhi and the others arrived at Jubao Pavilion, there were already many people.</p>
 <p>“Strange, why don’t I see the Black Thorn? Today is the day that her Spirit Cleansing Pills will be auctioned, is there anything else more important than seeing the furor caused by her pills?” Ye Fei was puzzled. If Black Thorn hadn’t requested them to keep the fact that she was the alchemist behind the Spirit Cleansing Pill a secret, she would have used the improvement in her cultivation to publicise the Spirit Cleansing Pill.</p>
 <p>Although she had never consumed the Yuli Snow Lotus before, she could guarantee on the Ye Store’s honour that the effects of the Spirit Cleansing Pill were better than that of the Yuli Snow Lotus by several times. Just based on the fact that it could allow one’s cultivation to skyrocket without any hidden danger, it was already superior to the Yuli Snow Lotus. Not to mention, after consuming the Spirit Cleansing Pill, one’s Spiritual Roots would become so pure they were almost transparent. The speed at which she could move her spiritual power now was at least ten times faster than before, and the recovery rate of her spiritual power was also much faster.</p>
 <p>If they had previously thought that their cultivation would have stopped at the level of a Martial Sage, they would now say with confidence that they could now aim to become a Demigod. No wonder Xin Yi would be able to become first place in the Training Tower after consuming a Yuli Snow Lotus. Now, they could also do the same!</p>
 <p>What a pity that they could not share about such big changes in such a short period of time! They could only hope that the Spirit Cleansing Pill would be able to sell for a good price. Such a good item, it better not be bought at a cheap price by those unable to recognise the goods.</p>
 <p>“Didn’t you say that she is very mysterious? Maybe she just got held up by something?” Gu Lingzhi suggested calmly, “If she gave us such a precious thing like this Spirit Cleansing Pill, it means that she already treats us as her friend. If she did not come here because she was held up by something else, it could also be showing her trust in Jubao Pavilion, that she believes it will be able to sell the pill at a suitable price.”</p>
 <p>“That’s true.” Ye Fei had complete confidence in her family’s business, “Then let us wait and see if the Spirit Cleansing Pill will be able to sell for a sky-high price, so that we can give Little Black a surprise!”</p>
 <p>Qin Xinran knitted her brows and looked at Gu Lingzhi with some grievances, “It was our Store of Many Treasures that first had any dealings with the Black Thorn. So why would she send the Spirit Cleansing Pills to Jubao Pavilion to auction instead of the Store of Many Treasures? The reputation of our Store of Many Treasures is also as good as that of Jubao Pavilion!”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi looked away guiltily, somehow, she felt like Qin Xinran was also trying to say something else with those words, “Maybe it was just convenient? Didn’t Ye Fei say that it was her who suggested going to the nearby Jubao Pavilion that day? That’s why Little Black would pass the Spirit Cleansing Pill to Jubao Pavilion to auction, right? Who knows, perhaps next time, it will be the Store of Many Treasures that will be selling the Spirit Cleansing Pill instead.”</p>
 <p>“Really, will it?” Qin Xinran stared at Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>“Maybe?” Gu Lingzhi replied with uncertainty in her voice. She had used countless treasures and only managed to cultivate one strain of the Palm Lotus, which she had already used to refine the Spirit Cleansing Pill. Now, she was only left with a seed in her Spiritual Essence Spring. Without a huge number of treasures, she wasn’t sure when it would mature and flower again.</p>
 <p>Qin Xinran took her uncertain words as encouragement and smiled sweetly with her dimples showing, “Since Lingzhi said it will happen, then it definitely will. Since you are so similar to the Black Thorn, she must be thinking the same way too.”</p>
 <p>“Hey, I’m still here. It isn’t good to be undermining my business right in front of me.” Ye Fei interjected just as Gu Lingzhi started to feel so guilty that she almost wanted to confess. She crossed her arms fiercely, “All is fair in business. It is because of Jubao Pavilion’s capability that we can work with the Black Thorn. It is utterly shameless to try and pull relationship strings!”</p>
 <p>Qin Xinran laughed, “Since you already said that all is fair in business, then if I successfully manage to win the Black Thorn over, that also means that it’s my capability. What’s so shameful about that?”</p>
 <p>“Xinran is right. With how much better the Spirit Cleansing Pill is compared to the Yuli Snow Lotus, if it wasn’t for me not having any authority in my Tianfeng Clan’s business, I would also have found someone to try and pull her over as well,” Tianfeng Jin commented. It was rare for her to say such a long sentence to tease Ye Fei.</p>
 <p>“You guys can’t be like this! Weren’t we good friends? Our friendship won’t be broken up so easily!”</p>
 <p>Tianfeng Jin chuckled coldly, “You said it, all is fair in business.”</p>
 <p>Ye Fei was speechless.</p>
 <p>“The auction is going to start soon; shouldn’t we be going in?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi could not help but remind them as she saw the three of them teasing each other and forgetting the time. Ye Fei then hurriedly brought the three of them into an exclusive box for the auction.</p>
 <p>Shortly later, the auction started.</p>
 <p>The opening item for the auction was a rare material used for forging weapons for Martial Artists at the Martial Sage level, the Star-Devouring Rock. It captivated the attention of the crowd, raising the atmosphere.</p>
