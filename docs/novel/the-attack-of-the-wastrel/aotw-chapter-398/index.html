 <p>Le Yan broke out in a cold sweat and pondered as to why a junior, who had merely lived for a hundred plus years, would have such a frightening demeanor? He pretended to be ignorant and asked, “What beasts? We have not encountered any beasts. Is it because of the large numbers such that they are coming here?”</p>
 <p>Guan Yue's face was pale, “We have not seen any beasts within the past few days.”</p>
 <p>He would not believe that their encounter with the beasts just as they were about to reach the Spirit City had nothing to do with Le Yan. He really wanted to toss Le Yan away at this moment.</p>
 <p>“This…who would have known what the beasts are plotting?”</p>
 <p>“Ridiculous!” Guan Yue scolded, “You are after all, the Chancellor of a city. Don’t you have any sense of responsibility?”</p>
 <p>After saying this, Guan Yue turned around and ordered his men to prepare to face the beasts. Furious, Rong Yuan cast Le Yan a death stare before dropping a sentence, “Continue the journey. I’ll handle the Female Worm.” He then took off immediately.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was flying through the air when she spotted the direction in which Rong Yuan was heading to. Just behind the citizens of the Forgotten City at the end of her vision, a herd of beasts could be seen charging towards them with momentum. It could be observed that there were at least twenty thousand of them.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan’s figure was miniscule and worthless as compared to the beasts. With a blink of the eye, his figure was engulfed in the herd of beasts.</p>
 <p>After a quarter of an hour, there was a commotion among the beasts which caused them to stop chasing. A black dot, the size of a sesame seed, could be seen escaping from the herd of beasts and was heading towards the direction of the Forgotten City’s citizens.</p>
 <p>The herd of beasts was all messed up just as the sesame seed grew larger in size and gradually revealed to be the figure of a human. The uniform team was now split up and dispersing gradually. They no longer had any interest in chasing after the citizens of the Forgotten City.</p>
 <p>When Rong Yuan returned, the herd of Beasts had almost dispersed completely. Only a handful of beasts were still rushing towards this direction. This was no longer a threat to the citizens of the Forgotten City.</p>
 <p>“Why are you so fast this time?” Gu Lingzhi smiled.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan raised an eyebrow, “Do you think I would make the same mistake twice?”</p>
 <p>Previously, he had accidentally let the Female Worm off which caused many people to die in vain. This time, he attracted the attention of the Female Worm and dealt a fatal blow when the Female Worm attacked him. He did not give it any chance to escape.</p>
 <p>The herd of beasts fell apart the same as before without the Female Worm’s control.</p>
 <p>Le Yan’s eyes flashed with jealousy upon seeing how easily Rong Yuan handled the herd of beasts which caused him to flee for his life. If he could cultivate his spiritual power, would he have such abilities too? No, he was already talented when he was still a child, he would be even stronger than Rong Yuan!</p>
 <p>It was a pity that there was no spiritual energy for him to cultivate…</p>
 <p>Le Yan bowed his head to hide the jealousy in his eyes before exclaiming with joy, “Demigod Rong has such great abilities that he can resolve the herd of beasts so quickly. It is really a huge blessing to the Lost Lands.”</p>
 <p>Guan Yue agreed with this sentence, “That’s right. Without Demigod Rong, I’m afraid that we can only let them do what they want if the herd of beasts were to besiege us.”</p>
 <p>The Spirit City might be able to deal with the Giant Insect Beasts, but the other four cities have no clue on how to deal with it.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan said modestly, “It just happened to restrain them.”</p>
 <p>The shell of the Giant Insect Beast was rather hard and could be comparable to the physique of a Glaze Class Warrior. However, Martial Artists could combine their spiritual power with Spiritual Weapons to make them even more powerful. Moreover, the two of them were using the Heaven-Level Spiritual Weapons crafted by Gu Lingzhi. The combination of two strengths caused the shell of the Giant Insect Beasts to break effortlessly. It might not be as easy to handle the Insect Beasts if it were another Martial Sage and Demigod from the Tianyuan Continent. Any Martial Artist other than Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan would have exhausted all their spiritual energy by now.</p>
 <p>However, the outsiders were unaware of this and thought that all the Martial Artists of the entire Tianyuan Continent were very powerful. This caused those who arrived at the Tianyuan Continent later on to be unable to read their opponents’ abilities and became a laughing matter for quite a while.</p>
 <p>The remaining journey was smooth after that. On the morning of the third day, they had arrived at the Spirit City.</p>
 <p>Looking at the Spirit City which Gu Lingzhi had been away for a month’s time, she felt overwhelmed.</p>
 <p>It was no wonder that she felt as if she had known this place when she first came to the Spirit City. At that time, she thought that the buildings were largely identical except for some slight differences. Now it seemed that the Spirit City was very similar to the Sacred Lands of the Spirit Tribe?</p>
 <p>However, due to the deficiency in spiritual power, the buildings in the Spirit City were cast using ordinary manpower, so the appearances of the buildings were not exactly the same. But with Gu Lingzhi’s Inheritance Space, the people in the Spirit City no longer needed to keep tabs on their spiritual energy usage. With the addition of the beasts’ attack, the city had to be modified. The walls of the city were made with ordinary huge stones and mud before being reinforced with golden- and earth-based spiritual energy on the exterior. Numerous spiritual weapons were added to the upward side of the city wall for protection. The entire Spirit City had completely acquired a new look and seemed like a second Sacred Lands for the Spirit Tribe.</p>
 <p>The soldiers guarding the gate had long been informed of the arrival of a group of people. They opened the gates directly upon seeing the long line approaching. They sent a team composed of Amethyst and Gold Class Warriors to welcome them.</p>
 <p>This was not only a sign of respect for Guan Yue and Le Yan, but also a display of their strength.</p>
 <p>It was moral for the Spirit City to accept them. But if anyone had any whimsical plans of overtaking the city, they would not be able to withstand the counterattacks of the Spirit Tribe.</p>
 <p>Both Guan Yue and Le Yan were smart people and were able to understand the whole situation at a glance. When they had arrived at the Chancellor’s Manor, they immediately expressed his gratitude to Lin Chongyuan, who was standing and waiting in front of the hall. They offered to leave the Spirit City and rebuild the other cities once the threat was over.</p>
 <p>Lin Chongyuan said with satisfaction, “Both Chancellors are guests from afar. It’s a rare visit to the Spirit City, there’s no harm staying for a few more days.”</p>
 <p>Guan Yue laughed bitterly. Instead, he replied, “Since that’s the case, I would be shameless and stay a few more days.”</p>
 <p>“No problem.”</p>
 <p>Lin Chongyuan was not good at diplomacy and its related matters. After making a few conventional remarks, he shifted the topic to Gu Lingzhi instead. He did not care about what others thought and pulled Gu Lingzhi aside before asking a series of questions as to what happened on her way here. He was afraid that she had felt aggrieved. This led Guan Yue and Le Yan, who were standing beside them while watching everything unfold, to be stunned.</p>
 <p>They had never seen Lin Chongyuan like this. The Lin Chongyuan in front of them was smiling affectionately unlike the man in their impression who was always silent and taciturn. Was this the same Chancellor of the Spirit City whom they knew?</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this, Chu Jiang explained to the both of them with a smile, “Little Chancellor is clever and kind. The Chancellor felt familiar with her at first sight. As he has no grandchildren, it is inevitable that he’ll dote on her more.”</p>
 <p>How was this doting on her more? Seeing how much attention Lin Chongyuan devoted to Gu Linzhi, it was the same as how he treated Lin Rong.</p>
 <p>Taking a glance at Rong Yuan who was aside, there was no sign of jealousy on his face upon seeing Gu Lingzhi being held by another man. Rather, there was even a smile on his face!</p>
 <p><em>What happened to his jealousy that can occur at any moment? What happened to the looks that could kill when someone stared at Gu Lingzhi? Why was he not as magnanimous to the Langya Troop? Just because Lin Chongyuan was the Chancellor, Rong Yuan would allow something like this?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Le Yan secretly despised Rong Yuan as he was certain that Rong Yuan was hypocritical.</p>
 <p>Chu Jiang was not concerned about how Lin Chongyuan’s attitude towards Gu Lingzhi would impact Le Yan and Guan Yue. He skillfully took over the diplomatic work and drew both of their attention, “Feel free to stay here, Chancellors. Before the crisis is resolved, do treat this as your own home. The Chancellor has already vacated the west side of the city a few days ago. I will be bringing you over in a moment, feel free to voice out any concerns.”</p>
 <p>Even though Chu Jiang was courteous, how could Guan Yue and Le Yan voice out any opinions? They were just glad to have a roof over their heads. After exchanging a few more words politely, Chu Jiang personally led Guan Yue and Le Yan to take a look at the residence assigned to them.</p>
 <p>Although Le Yan and his party were added in abruptly, it was fortunate that the space reserved for the citizens of the Forgotten City was large enough such that they could divide an area to accommodate all of them. On the right side of the area allocated to Burnt City was the place where the residents of Crescent Moon City were temporarily residing.</p>
 <p>This way, the entire west side of the Spirit City was filled.</p>
 <p>After Chu Jiang had led the people away, Gu Lingzhi then told Lin Chongyuan in detail of the events that occured on their way here. After learning that they had actually figured out a way to kill the beasts and cause them to be unable to gather, Lin Chongyuan happily patted Rong Yuan and praised him for being a good child.</p>
 <p>Poor Rong Yuan had never been exaggerated and praised as a child by his elders in his life. He stood rooted for a while as he did not know how to react to the situation.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi laughed non-stop upon seeing the scenario. She was almost softened into a bunch of mud after being pinched in the back by Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>Lin Chongyuan saw the both of them laughing and shook his head, “You two aren’t behaving like strong Martial Artists.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi made a grimace, “Looks are made for outsiders to see. There’s no outsiders here so there’s no need to be pretentious.”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing the rare sight of Gu Lingzhi’s playful look, Rong Yuan sincerely thanked Pan Luming for letting them arrive at the Lost Lands.</p>
 <p>If not for his persecution, how would Gu Lingzhi and him arrive at the Lost Lands? If not for arriving at the Lost Lands, how would Gu Lingzhi reunite with her grandfather? He wondered how Pan Luming would react if he knew that Gu Lingzhi had reunited with her family, rekindling the Spirit Tribe’s hope of reappearing on the Continent? That expression would be an exciting one, right?</p>
 <p>“By the way, you said that you have also gone to the Wasteland City after leaving the Forgotten City?” Lin Chongyuan suddenly asked while looking at the two of them playing around.</p>
 <p>“Yes, the Chancellor of the Wasteland City was not willing to migrate to the Spirit City.”</p>
 <p>“But he regrets it now.”</p>
 <p>“Huh?” Gu Lingzhi raised her head.</p>
 <p>Lin Chongyuan laughed and rubbed her head, “Initially when the Wasteland City was built, the first Chancellor had prepared and built a shelter underground in advance that was wide enough to accommodate all its citizens. But not long after everybody hid in the shelter, the beasts had found their hideout after a few people went out to source for food, causing them to be in a difficult position.”</p>
