 <p><em>What could they do now? How could they escape?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi scrambled to think of a solution. Around her stood members from her clan as well as Qin Xinran and Tianfeng Jin. She could always hide into her Inheritance Space to escape but the others could not. With her current cultivation level, she was not yet able to open the space for others to enter.</p>
 <p><em>Could she stand to see Qin Xinran and the others vanish before her eyes?</em></p>
 <p><em>No, there was nothing that meant certain death in this world. There was definitely a way for them to escape!</em></p>
 <p>As Gu Lingzhi was thinking, a myriad of golden arrows fell from the sky once again, causing the torturous space to become even more dangerous.</p>
 <p>“First Mistress… I can’t hold on anymore!” Gu Hongyan called out. He had been guarding her from the start till now.</p>
 <p>Although he was under Gu Rong’s orders to protect her, his loyalty had warmed her heart.</p>
 <p>“Rest for a moment if you are tired, I can do it.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi then retrieved a few items that she had made to protect herself from attacks and threw it at him. She then helped him block off a few arrows. Gu Lingzhi utilised her quick movements to protect herself from the life-threatening objects falling from the sky.</p>
 <p>At the same time, she held a quick-recovery medicine in her hands. Whenever she felt her spiritual energy dwindling, she would eat one pill to maintain her energy.</p>
 <p>Although Qin Xinran and Tianfeng Jin were better able to deal with the danger, they were also only able to help themselves. If this continued, there would also face the issue of their energy dwindling.</p>
 <p>Seeing the situation become more and more dangerous, Qin Xinran narrowed her eyes and pursed her lips as if having made a decision. She was then all smiles as she took a few steps towards Gu Lingzhi and handed a jade pendant over to her.</p>
 <p>“Lingzhi, I have a Teleportation Jade Pendant with me. It can teleport us to the entrance of the Cangwu Realm. You should activate it.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi paused.</p>
 <p><em>Did Qin Xinran not know the meaning of handing the Teleportation Jade Pendant to her?</em></p>
 <p><em>By passing it to her, did it mean that she wanted to pass her only living chance over to Gu Lingzhi? Was it worth it?</em></p>
 <p>“You can use it.” Gu Lingzhi pushed the jade pendant back to her, “If things become worse… you should go.”</p>
 <p>“I am not leaving,” Qin Xinran looked on determined. “No matter what, I won’t leave you here to die!”</p>
 <p>“Then what about you?” Gu Lingzhi looked at her, “Do you think if I left you behind, I would be able to live with myself?”</p>
 <p>Qin Xinran went silent before she replied, her voice hoarse, “I don’t want him to be upset.”</p>
 <p>“Him?”</p>
 <p>“…His Highness.”</p>
 <p><em>She suddenly understood everything!</em> Gu Lingzhi realised why Qin Xinran was so interested in her in the beginning and even plotted to get her killed. It was only after she failed that she persisted in becoming friends and even followed her around like a leech. She only stopped pestering her after Rong Yuan appeared. It was all because of Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>“You’re so silly…” Other than these two words, Gu Lingzhi really did not know how to describe what she was feeling.</p>
 <p>She had never thought that Qin Xinran would love anyone to this extent.</p>
 <p>“I think so too,” Qin Xinran laughed bitterly.</p>
 <p>Who would have guessed that the nonchalant attitude that the Third Prince showed her would actually cause her to like him? Her crazy personality made her worship strong people more than others. Her worship for the Third Prince had unknowingly turned into an infatuation.</p>
 <p>When she first heard rumours about Gu Lingzhi, she was curious about this girl who was able to make the Third Prince interested.</p>
 <p>Her initial approach towards Gu Lingzhi was just to see if she was worth the attention that the Third Prince was giving her. However, Gu Lingzhi’s attitude towards her, whereby she did not leave her behind even when in danger, made her realise that Gu Lingzhi was someone that she wanted to be friends with.</p>
 <p>Later on, she found out the involvement of the Third Prince whenever Tianfeng Wei tried to deal with Gu Lingzhi. She then realised how different the Third Prince treated Gu Lingzhi. When the Third Prince outright declared that he was going to woo Gu Lingzhi at the start of the semester, it was then that she realised that the Third Prince was serious about Gu Lingzhi. While she was bitter about it, at the same time she was relieved that the man that she liked had good taste when it came to girls.</p>
 <p>She had originally planned to keep this secret with her to the end. However, in a desperate situation like this, she could not help but blurt it out in hopes that Gu Lingzhi would understand where she was coming from and save herself.</p>
 <p>However, the reply that Gu Lingzhi gave her was to grind her teeth in anger, “Since you know it is silly, then keep this well! I never asked you to give up your life for me. I can…” <em>Save myself.</em></p>
 <p>Before she could complete her sentence, a black shadow flashed in front of her as Gu Lingzhi dodged aside, avoiding an attack.</p>
 <p>Staring straight ahead, she realised that it was someone from the Tianfeng Clan that was looking crazily and desperately at the jade pendant in Gu Lingzhi’s hand. He had obviously overheard the two of them and knew that the jade pendant was able to teleport people.</p>
 <p>“Since you both do not want it, give it to me. I will help you all take your revenge.”</p>
 <p>“Who are you to eye my things?” Qin Xinran bellowed viciously as she dashed forwards.</p>
 <p>With a few violent and large attacks, she utterly defeated the guy.</p>
 <p>“Oi! You have a teleportation charm that you are not using and you don’t even allow others to use it. What kind of rationale is that? Do you want everyone to die with you?”</p>
 <p>“No, he is doing it on purpose!” Gu Lingzhi cursed under her breath.</p>
 <p>Alas, hearing his shouts, everyone around them turned to look at Qin Xinran with bloodshot eyes.</p>
 <p>“Teleportation charm? Someone has a teleportation charm?”</p>
 <p>“The Teleportation Jade Pendant is mine!”</p>
 <p>“Give me the jade pendant or I will kill you!”</p>
 <p>In that situation of despair, the appearance of the Teleportation Jade Pendant was like an array of hope shining from above. As long as they obtained the Teleportation Jade Pendant, they would be able to escape.</p>
 <p>Knowing that he was not Qin Xinran’s match alone, the guy had aroused the attention of the crowd to help him, increasing his chances of obtaining it.</p>
 <p>In a matter of seconds, both Gu Lingzhi and Qin Xinran were engulfed in a crowd. Everyone looked at them as if they wanted to eat them both.</p>
 <p>“Whoever dares to hurt Lingzhi or Xinran? I will make sure even your bones cannot be found!” Although this vicious threat sounded somewhat funny, everyone who saw the person who said it could not laugh.</p>
 <p>“Spiritual Talisman? You want to use the Spiritual Talisman in the Five Calamities Formation, are you crazy? Do you think the Five Calamities Formation won’t be enough to kill us?” someone shouted at Gu Chengze as he involuntarily took a few steps backwards, standing out of the attack range of the Spiritual Talisman.</p>
 <p>“Ha, we are doomed anyway. As long as I die after you, it will be worth it!”</p>
 <p>Gu Chengze stood beside Qin Xinran and claimed.</p>
 <p>Although he did not look very muscular, the posture at which he was standing gave off an imposing aura. The determination in his eyes showed everyone that he was not joking and would risk his life to do what he said.</p>
 <p>The members from the Gu and Qin Clan formed a circle around them, facing the members from the other two clans that wanted to steal the jade pendant.</p>
 <p>Danger lurked in every corner of the formation. Outside the formation, the Tianfeng and Beicheng family stood staring into the chaos in it with a satisfied smile.</p>
 <p>“I heard that a young lady prodigy of the Tianfeng Clan, Tianfeng Jin is trapped inside. If she just dies like this, won’t it be a loss to your clan?” Beicheng Haotian lounged and attempted to entertain himself by asking Tianfeng Wei.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, she is just a traitor who sides with others more. What is there to lose?”</p>
 <p>Tianfeng Jin was not someone that the Tianfeng Clan had originally planned on sacrificing, but no one could stop her and Tianfeng Wei could not be blamed.</p>
 <p>“You are really heartless,” Beicheng Haotian put on an act as he sighed. Looking at Beicheng Haoyue who had gone silent behind him, he felt glad that she was able to accept this quickly.</p>
 <p>However, he failed to realise the silence from Beicheng Haoyue was not because she had accepted his actions but she was actually concentrating all her spiritual energy for one last attempt.</p>
 <p>Just as the two families were watching the hellish formation and waiting for the massacre to complete, a huge life force built up next to them. A green array then shot towards the Five Calamities Formation. All of a sudden, the momentum of the Formation paused and the people within it could finally see what was happening on the outside. They saw the flabbergasted faces of the two clans on the outside as well as Beicheng Haoyue who was concentrating on keeping her attack constant.</p>
 <p><em>With this, what more was there to understand?</em></p>
 <p>A few people who were near the opening immediately saw their chance and escaped from the gap.</p>
 <p>“Haoyue, what are you doing!” Beicheng Haotian jumped up in extreme horror and rage. He immediately ordered people to mend the gap and the Five Calamities Formation was reactivated.</p>
 <p><em>Gu Lingzhi…had failed to escape.</em></p>
 <p>Seeing the small group of people that managed to escape from the gap she made, Beicheng Haoyue gave a bitter smile, “Brother, I am simply helping you to make up for your mistake and prevent you from ruining what the Beicheng Family has built over the past centuries.”</p>
 <p>“Kill everyone that has escaped, do not let anyone live. Haoyue, I will report whatever you have done to the elders back home. You are such a disappointment!”</p>
 <p>Beicheng Haotian quickly ordered a few men to follow him to kill those that had escaped.</p>
 <p>His first target was a man that was wearing the Beicheng clan’s attire.</p>
 <p>“Young... young master?” Just before he died, the man stammered out in disbelief. He could not believe that the one behind all these was the young master that he had respected.</p>
 <p>Pulling out his sword from the man’s body, his lips curved up sinisterly as he said, “For our clan’s glory, rest in peace. When I get back, I will inform the clan of your contribution and be sure to compensate your family.”</p>
 <p>On the other side, the Tianfeng Family also did not hesitate to act as they received similar orders from Tianfeng Wei to kill all those that escaped.</p>
 <p>“First Mistress… it looks like there are a few of our clan members that have escaped.”</p>
 <p>Looking at the person that spoke, Tianfeng Wei laughed coldly, “Did you see wrongly? Everyone that participated from the Tianfeng Clan is here with us. Those are clearly members from other clans trying to pass off as members of our clan.”</p>
