 <p>The Demigod, Tang Feng, seemed to have noticed that the situation was not that disastrous. With a wave of his long sharpened sword containing golden spiritual energy, he yelled, “Trap them! It doesn’t matter if they were to vanish, the ancestors said that they will reappear in the same place!”</p>
 <p>This statement was like thunder on a clear blue day, instantly revealing the flaws of the Inheritance Space. This led Gu Lingzhi, who was unable to win the fight and had thoughts of fleeing into the Inheritance Space, to quiver in fear. This was the first time she has ever felt that her life was being threatened.</p>
 <p>Scanning around the Martial Sages that were eyeing her tightly, as well as the menacing Demigods, Gu Lingzhi glanced at Rong Yuan just as he had also looked at her and understood the meaning behind each other’s gazes. They vigorously summoned the energy within themselves and expanded the forces of their realm to the strongest.</p>
 <p>When Gu Lingzhi ascended to a Martial Sage, she had attained a legendary space-dimension realm. It was completely vacuum-like and was an exact opposite of her own five elements. Whoever was in the radius of her realm would lose all their elemental spiritual energy, and would have to fight with Gu Lingzhi using only the spiritual energy within their bodies.</p>
 <p>The power of Rong Yuan’s realm exceeded that of every spiritual root. It could alter both space and time. In this way, when the various domains are superimposed, the forces generated are strong enough to make a powerful Demigod fall and stagnate for a moment. This moment was enough for Gu Lingzhi to turn the situation around.</p>
 <p>The forces of space and time formed by the realm fluctuated vigorously, perfectly dividing the attack that was about to strike the both of them into another space. Upon finishing this task, Rong Yuan slammed the surface and forced back the taste of blood that was flowing in his throat. For a moment, he repeatedly urged the mental forces to compress the space and time surrounding Tang Feng’s body.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi also took the opportunity to remove the five elements from Tang Feng’s body such that he could not manipulate his spiritual power for a short time. Concurrently being attacked by two powerful domains has caused Tang Feng’s body to form a stagnation involuntarily while he momentarily fell into a trance. He was now unable to distinguish and identify his opponents. The both of them were apparently in front of him, but somehow his attacks were unable to reach them as if the three of them were in different spaces. All his attacks were futile. Even though the attacks seemed to be within reach, in reality, they were totally heading for a wrong direction.</p>
 <p>The terrible illusion only lasted for a brief moment as he began to return to his original state. He was frightened by how the realms formed by two Martial Sages could actually cause him to have such a chilling phantasm. The scenery in front of him had suddenly changed to a complete foreign place.</p>
 <p>Tang Feng’s sudden disappearance made those who had besieged the two Martial Sages to be stunned. All of a sudden, someone burst out laughing and asked everyone not to be alarmed, “Turns out the mysterious ‘Black Thorn’ was actually the Third Princess Consort of the Xia Kingdom! Don’t let them get away, the Chief Duke will arrive soon!”</p>
 <p>They were still a little confused when they saw the Alliance’s people earlier. It was said that the Black Thorn has rescued Lord Fashen and a few others? Why did Rong Yuan and his wife appear instead? All the answers were now revealed.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan heard the words and scoffed coldly, “That also requires you to have the ability to.”</p>
 <p>After speaking, Rong Yuan once again strengthened his control of the domain. The space around him was immediately divided into countless small spaces. Using the senses and the miniscule gap between the flow of time, he was able to shift away most of the attacks. Despite the fact that the both of them were standing in the middle, they seemed to be in a different space-time from everyone else. No matter how many attacks were launched, it could never hit them.</p>
 <p>“Huh…This is…” Some of them gasped while the others could not believe what they saw. They knew that Rong Yuan was strong but did not expect him to be of this magnitude. Having the dual capabilities of both space and time was completely unrivalled. It was already difficult enough to find their true forms while hiding in the gap between space and time, how could they still possibly fight them?</p>
 <p>“What’s there to be afraid of?” The person leading spat and looked coldly at the two of them in the middle, “No matter how capable he is, it is not possible to divert every single attack. We have so many of us here, it’s just a matter of time he will be hit.”</p>
 <p>His words gave everyone hope as they launched a series of attacks instantaneously towards the both of them.</p>
 <p>“I can’t hold him for long, go!” Gu Lingzhi spoke in a volume that could only be heard among the both of them.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan nodded his head and held Gu Lingzhi in his arms. He blocked all the attacks that could possibly hit them and fought through the direction in which they had come from.</p>
 <p>As for Lord Fashen’s side, Rong Huachang’s heart tightened upon seeing Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan gradually leaving their sight. She wanted to chase them but her opponent would not give her the opportunity to. A long sword spat forward and simply stopped her path. Lord Fashen also sensed and noticed that something was not right. He felt that the North Qiu was not only targeting the Life Whip that he possessed. However, other than this Sacred Weapon, what else would be worthy enough to cause the North Qiu Kingdom to plan so deliberately?</p>
 <p>Knowing that he could not delay any longer otherwise Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan might be in danger, Lord Fashen glanced worryingly and apologetically at Pan Yue before taking out his Sacred Weapon. He used the Life Whip to float over to the three good quality spirit stones that he had prepared in advance. Suddenly, three stonemen possessing the cultivation of Demigods had appeared. Just as they had made their appearances, they headed directly towards Mao Dingling and Pan Yue.</p>
 <p>“Stop! You don’t want his life anymore?” Mao Dingling snapped in horror while also retreating speedily.</p>
 <p>Two of the three Demigods who had fought with Lord Fashen also quickly withdrew towards this side. They also wanted to help and block the attacks of the three stonemen. When faced with the stonemen’s attacks, Mao Dingling learned and followed the three men’s approach of using Pan Yue as a shield to block off the attacks that were cast in his direction.</p>
 <p>Ultimately, the stonemen were not humans and obeyed the simplest commands of their owners in which they were tasked to attack Mao Dingling without consideration of who was in his hands. Seeing that Pan Yue, whom Mao Dingling had lifted in front of him, had no intentions of condensing his strength, this was equivalent to the strength of a Demigod being howled and smashed towards Mao Dingling.</p>
 <p>Upon witnessing this scene, Rong Huachang, who was nearby, could not bear but to close her eyes.</p>
 <p><em>Boom</em><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); color: rgba(60, 64, 67, 1)">—</span> No sign of the expected bone breaking was heard. Instead, there was a sound of an evenly matched rumble before being accompanied by a green light blast that had exploded from Mao Dingling.</p>
 <p>To be precise, the explosion was from Mao Dingling grabbing onto Pan Yue.</p>
 <p>In the midst of the wood spiritual energy unleashed by Lord Fashen, Pan Yue was paralyzed and held in the air with his eyes closed. Just at that critical moment, the Protective Jade Amulet given by Lord Fashen had displayed its effectiveness. Upon sensing its master’s crisis, it has been activated to protect him. But the Demigod’s attack was too strong. Even though the amulet had blocked the attack, Pan Yue was still injured by the excess forces. Fresh blood spilled from his eyes, nose and ears. His internal organs were damaged.</p>
 <p>While everyone was surprised by this sudden change, Lord Fashen quickly changed his commands and used his consciousness to instruct a stoneman to grab Pan Yue.</p>
 <p>By the time Mao Dingling had come to his senses, Pan Yue was already in the hands of the stoneman and was being respectfully transported to Lord Fashen’s side.</p>
 <p>“The strongest expert of the Tianyuan Continent actually had to resort to conspiracy and deceit. How despicable is that!” A Demigod of the North Qiu yelled.</p>
 <p>“Is standing still and letting you slaughter at your will considered noble instead?” Lord Fashen replied in a funny manner. He felt ashamed of the North Qiu’s ideology of double rules. After advancing two steps to check on Pan Yue, whom the stoneman has rescued, he found that he had only suffered some internal injuries and fed him a Spiritual Medicine for healing before focusing on dealing with his opponent.</p>
 <p>Previously, these people already had a hard time warding off the blows. Now with the help of three stonemen, they were quickly beaten to a hideous mess.</p>
 <p>After mercilessly ending the lives of several Demigods who begged to be spared, Lord Fashen knocked out Mao Dingling and also sealed his cultivation. He followed Rong Huashang hurriedly to the place where Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan had disappeared.</p>
 <p>Before arriving, they could already feel several powerful breaths. It turned out that they were all cultivations of various Demigods. Upon looking at the Demigod in the center that were besieged by numerous breaths, who else could that be other than Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan?</p>
 <p>“How shameful is this! They actually dared to exhaust their abilities on two juniors!” Lord Fashen scolded furiously and handed Pan Yue over to Rong Huashang before rushing over with the three stonemen.</p>
 <p>The originally battered and exhausted Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan upon being surrounded by a few Demigods, were now refreshed after seeing the appearance of Lord Fashen.</p>
 <p>Before, they were surrounded by more than a dozen of Martial Sages. They thought that would be all the people who had come to obstruct them. Who knew that after breaking through the encirclement, what greeted them turned out to be a few Demigods headed by Pan Luming to deal a frontal attack?</p>
 <p>In a panic, Gu Lingzhi subconsciously wanted to bring Rong Yuan into the Inheritance Space to take shelter temporarily. Instead, she found out that she was unable to enter the Inheritance Space that was linked to her soul? This has never been the case ever since she has gotten the Inheritance Space!</p>
 <p>Upon seeing the confusion and horror on Gu Lingzhi’s face, Pan Luming lightly flashed out a small golden flag out of “goodwill”. He sang satisfactorily, “This was specifically given by the Grandmaster to counter and restrain the Inheritance Space. How could it possibly let you enter so easily? I didn’t expect that the mysterious ‘Black Thorn’ that had been circulating around the Alliance would turn out to be the Third Princess Consort. What a surprise.”</p>
 <p>Ever since she rescued Lord Fashen and Rong Huashang from the North Qiu Palace, Gu Lingzhi had thoughts of the Pan Family recognising the Inheritance Space. It was not predicted that this day would arrive so fast. Before they could escape from the boundaries of the Empire, the North Qiu had already obtained the method of restraint.</p>
 <p>Since there is no way to conceal it, Gu Lingzhi did not bother to cover further and laughed mockingly, “Grandmaster? It seems that you have gotten used to being a slave such that you have developed a sense of accomplishment. You are truly a loyal dog of Pan Luo.”</p>
 <p>“Presumptuous!” Pan Luming howled. Being a slave was a pain he was unwilling to admit. However, the benefits he obtained from Pan Luo was sufficient enough to let him forget his dissatisfaction and self-esteem.</p>
 <p>“You are about to die at my hands, yet you still have such a sharp-tongue. I’ll see if you can continue to act this way once I hand you over to the Grandmaster!”</p>
 <p>After Pan Luming had spoken, he charged his palm towards Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was never strong enough to face Pan Luming alone. Moreover, she had exhausted quite an amount of spiritual power when fighting off the Martial Sages from before. At this moment when faced with Pan Luming’s attack, she felt unparalleled and that her body had become heavier than ever. She could not even move a centimeter to avoid Pan Luming’s attack…</p>
