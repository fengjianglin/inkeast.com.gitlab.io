 <p>The first round of duels in the final rounds for the Martial Practitioner category was over. What everyone was talking about was not the bloody scene involving Xin Yi, nor the feud between Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi, nor was it Song Ze’s bloody combat. They were all talking about the Black Thorn.</p>
 <p>When Gu Lingzhi was competing, it was only at the very last minute that she showed the power of her Earth-Level Spiritual Weapon. At that time, everyone was just slightly suspicious. However, later on when Tianfeng Jin competed, the entire arena buzzed.</p>
 <p><em>An Earth-Level Spiritual Weapon!</em></p>
 <p>It was the second Earth-Level Spiritual Weapon that appeared during the competition today. But that was not the important part, what was important was the weird and awkward shape of Tianfeng Jin’s long sword that was unique to the Black Thorn’s work.</p>
 <p>In the past two years, everyone knew about the uncommon Weapon Forger in the Xia Kingdom. Every Spiritual Weapon made was different and each was weirder than the next. However, they would contain unique properties that other Spiritual Weapons did not have. It caused lower-ranked Martial Artists to have a love-hate relationship with the weapons she made.</p>
 <p>Today, they once again saw weirdly shaped Earth-Level Spiritual Weapons. Did this mean that… the Black Thorn had become an Earth-Level Weapon Forger?</p>
 <p>Someone then confirmed this with a student from the Royal School.</p>
 <p>Quickly, numerous Martial Lords and Martial Sages were interested. In the past, the Black Thorn’s weapons were only Black-Level ones and were thus not of concern to them. Now, the Black Thorn could make Earth-Level Spiritual Weapons that they needed.</p>
 <p>After all, every Martial Artist seeked a weapon that could make them stronger.</p>
 <p>When the news of the Black Thorn becoming an Earth-Level Weapon Forger spread through the entire First School and into the Yan City, Zhang Kuihan boiled with anger.</p>
 <p><em>Why? It was an Earth-Level Spiritual Weapon that they worked on together. He had spent so many days working on it but had yet to see an improvement. Yet the Black Thorn was able to advance before him? How could someone from a weaker country than him be stronger than him? He had to become an Earth-Level Weapon Forger as quickly as possible. Otherwise, he would become the laughing stock of his entire school!</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi, who had a restful sleep, never expected the weapons she made for her and Tianfeng Jin to create such an uproar. The next morning, as she was about to watch Yan Liang and Nie Sang compete, she was stopped at the door.</p>
 <p>“Is this Lady Black Thorn?” a robust and healthy-looking man wearing a mud yellow robe hurriedly asked as they stepped out of the door.</p>
 <p>Wei Hanzi was mildly stunned as confusion flashed across her face under her mask, “That’s me, can I help you?”</p>
 <p>“Haha, Lady Black Thorn, I’ve heard of you and heard that you are already an Earth-Level Weapon Forger. I wonder if you could make a Spiritual Weapon for me? As long as the quality of the Spiritual Weapon is good, money is not an issue.”</p>
 <p>He came to ask for weapons. Wei Hanzi tilted her head as she looked towards Gu Lingzhi, asking for her opinion. After receiving a negative reply, she proceeded to reject him, “I’m sorry, I currently do not have time to make weapons. I am afraid I can’t help you.”</p>
 <p>“Wait, hear me out.” The yellow-robed Martial Artist misunderstood that Wei Hanzi rejected him because she was afraid of failing as she was a new Earth-Level Weapon Forger. If not, she would also not have made Earth-Level Spiritual Weapons for lower-ranked Martial Artists to test out.</p>
 <p>“You don’t have to make a Spiritual Weapon for me now, you can contact me when you are more confident,” the man then passed Wei Hanzi a slip of paper with his contact information. It was obvious that he had expected this beforehand.</p>
 <p>“I think you’ve misunderstood.” Impatience flashed across Wei Hanzi’s face, “I won’t be helping anyone forge weapons and will not forge any weapons in the North Qiu Kingdom. If you are interested, you can find me in the Chiyang City of the Xia Kingdom when this competition ends. When the time comes, you can look for weapons that I made in the Store of Many Treasures and buy them from there.”</p>
 <p>The man’s expression changed after hearing Wei Hanzi speak. It was obvious that Wei Hanzi was not willing to give him a chance at all. He was about to burst out in anger but was cut off by Gu Lingzhi, “The Black Thorn only personally customises Spiritual Weapons for people that are close to her. The rest of the Spiritual Weapons are still made carefully. If you still need a weapon, you can try the visiting the Store of Many Treasures in about two months. Maybe you will find a suitable weapon.”</p>
 <p>After her explanation, Gu Lingzhi then took Wei Hanzi’s hand and quickly left the area.</p>
 <p>She still had to rush to pass the two Spiritual Weapons that she made the night before to Yan Liang and Nie Sang.</p>
 <p>A day later, the news that another two students from the Xia Kingdom’s Royal School possessing Earth-Level Spiritual Weapons once again shocked the public. This time, even those that were suspicious of the standard of Black Thorn’s Weapon Forging skills could not no longer attribute it to luck.</p>
 <p>One or two successes could be counted as luck. However, with four successes it was clear that she had the abilities to do so.</p>
 <p>In a flash, it was time for the second round of duels.</p>
 <p>In the first round, Su Nian was unlucky and met with one of the Martial Students with very high potential to win the championship. He lost the first round as a result.</p>
 <p>Although he lost, Su Nian was still very cheerful. This was because Gu Lingzhi had given him a middle grade Black-Level Spiritual Weapon before the competition and this was the highest possible grade of weapon that could be used by Martial Students.</p>
 <p>“Lingzhi, I really love this sword. I want to engrave my name on it so that if I lose it, others will know it is mine and return it to me.”</p>
 <p><em>If you lose it, won’t it most likely be sold or used by whoever found it?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi swallowed what she really wanted to say and instead smiled as she said, “No worries, all I did was provide the materials. The one who actually made the weapon is the Black Thorn.”</p>
 <p>Su Nian immediately turned to thank Wei Hanzi and looked at Gu Lingzhi expectantly, “Lingzhi, I want to treat you to a meal as a way of expressing my thanks.”</p>
 <p>“Sure.” If she did not let him treat her, he would not feel comfortable using the weapon and hence Gu Lingzhi agreed.</p>
 <p>Su Nian lit up with joy, happy that he got what he wished for, “Then let’s do it today. It is about time for lunch and I know a good place to eat near the Yan Capital. We can go there.”</p>
 <p>Su Nian was done with his fight and there was no one else from the Royal School that was competing today, hence Gu Lingzhi did not object. Under Su Nian’s warm hospitality, she sat with him and Wei Hanzi in a rented carriage.</p>
 <p>“Is the restaurant very far away? Why do we need a carriage?” Looking at the passing scenery, Gu Lingzhi casually asked.</p>
 <p>“It is not that far. After exiting the Yan Capital, it takes about half an hour to get there. If you are bored, you can rest first. I’ll wake you up later”</p>
 <p>The carriage they rented was extremely spacious and both sides of the carriage would allow a person to lie completely.</p>
 <p>“No, thank you. It is nice to look at the scenery.”</p>
 <p>The scenery in the Yan Capital was rather impressive. The minute they exited the gates, the scenery was mesmerising. Vibrant green fields stretched on and anywhere would be good to have a picnic.</p>
 <p>When the Inter-school Competition ended, she could come again with Rong Yuan to appreciate the scenery.</p>
 <p>Just as she thought of this, Wei Hanzi grabbed the hand by her side.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi turned over to look and saw the serious look on Wei Hanzi’s face.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Hei, what is the matter?”</p>
 <p>“I have lost contact with the Secret Guards,” Wei Hanzi breathed out quietly.</p>
 <p>Whenever Gu Lingzhi left the city, there would be a group of guards secretly guarding her. If not, Wei Hanzi would not allow Gu Lingzhi to leave the boundaries of the Yan Capital. But a while ago, she suddenly realised that she could no longer sense the guards that were following them.</p>
 <p>“Su Nian, stop the carriage!” Gu Lingzhi immediately understood what Wei Hanzi was worried about.</p>
 <p>There was only one explanation for this… the guards had been hindered by someone.</p>
 <p>Su Nian did not immediately stop the carriage but smiled as he asked, “Why? We haven’t reached yet.”</p>
 <p>“It is dangerous, we have to quickly get back, if not…” Gu Lingzhi suddenly halted as she looked at Su Nian warily.</p>
 <p>He still looked the same, but usually he always looked extremely joyful. However, now the corners of his mouth slightly changed and there was a hint of gloominess and something seemed strange.</p>
 <p>“We can’t. I’ve said that we haven’t reached yet. If we get off early, my Master will not be happy.”</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Wei Hanzi did not hesitate to draw out her sword. Recovering from her shock, Gu Lingzhi realised that someone had sent Su Nian to harm her! No wonder he had pretended to be infatuated with her for so long. It was to the point that his infatuation with her was slightly weird.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi drew out her Fengwu Sword and surrounded Su Nian on his left and right side with Wei Hanzi.</p>
 <p>“Tsk, you are really cruel. You would take action on someone that has liked you for so long, what a waste of my affection for you.” As he said this, Su Nian did not show any mercy in his actions as he aimed his sword at Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>“Master, Su Nian’s cultivation level is not of a Martial Student. He’s a low grade Martial Lord!” After exchanging a few blows, Wei Hanzi was appalled to realise Su Nian’s true cultivation level. He had managed to hide it for so long! He had suppressed his cultivation level to that of a Martial Student and hid amongst the Royal School for so long without being detected.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was also shocked as she quickly left the carriage. If she was hit by someone of the Martial Lord level, she would be severely injured. She looked at the wildebeest which was still running and whipped it, causing it to run even faster.</p>
 <p>She then stood at the fringe of the carriage and shot a few spiritual energy balls towards Su Nian to distract him.</p>
 <p>“Ah…” Suddenly, Wei Hanzi’s body flew and hit the hall at the back of the carriage, a trickle of blood flowing from the corner of her mouth.</p>
 <p>“You’re overestimating yourself!” Su Nian scolded. He stopped attacking Wei Hanzi and went for Gu Lingzhi who was standing at the edge of the carriage.</p>
 <p>His target was Gu Lingzhi. Once he finished her off, his mission would be completed!</p>
