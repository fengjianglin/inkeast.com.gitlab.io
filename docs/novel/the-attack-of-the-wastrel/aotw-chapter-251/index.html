 <p>At the same time, there were many people and their carriages that were converging in the direction of the main palace. Through Liu Yiyan’s guiding words, many began to have doubts about the North Qiu Kingdom.</p>
 <p>The main palace’s entrance in the Sacred Lands had become a temporary residence for the North Qiu Royal Family because of Gu Lingzhi. Pan En, who was unable to wait for Gu Lingzhi, brought his men and rushed here straight. Before he could report to Pan Wuyang about the strange disappearance of Gu Lingzhi, he heard Liu Yiyan’s explosive words.</p>
 <p>When the sky recovered its calmness, he could clearly feel the stares of doubt from Martial Artists surrounding him..</p>
 <p>“Nonsense! Don’t listen to the Spiritual Being’s gibberish. He only said this so that we wouldn’t join forces and obtain the treasures in the main palace!”</p>
 <p>While shouting this sentence, Pan En’s body began to retreat involuntarily. If the Godly Spiritual Being was able to cause such a huge uproar and attack the Martial Artists in the Sacred Lands through the main palace, would it end up taking his life?</p>
 <p>“As a Spiritual Being, I have no reason to lie. Besides…I have never said you were the one secretly causing mischief, why are you so flustered?” Liu Yiyan finished the sentence while smiling seemingly. He did not take notice of Pan En afterwards. As immersed as before, his actions caused others to think that his ability could only be unleashed in the main palace. No one expected that his powers could actually spread across half of the Sacred Lands.</p>
 <p>“Pan Wuyang, you owe us an explanation.” Just when Pan En and the rest saw that something was not right about the situation and wanted to leave, Mei Ying arrived with the others and blocked their escape path. They looked at them with antagonism.</p>
 <p>“What does Brother Mei want me to confess? I don’t understand what you’re talking about.” Unlike Pan En who was flustered, Pan Wuyang calmed down after the initial shock.</p>
 <p>No matter how powerful Liu Yiyan was, he was after all, just a Spiritual Being. If he was that strong, he would already have come out of the main palace and killed all of them. But now, he was only giving them a verbal warning, deliberately provoking others to doubt them. Apparently, Liu Yiyan had his own doubts about them.</p>
 <p>In this case, as long as he stuck to his statement of being uncertain about the whole matter, he doubted that Liu Yiyan could get hold of any evidence.</p>
 <p>Pan Wuyang was right. Although Liu Yiyan looked tough and powerful such that no one in the main palace dared to touch him slightly, it was nevertheless, only within the main palace. Beyond the main palace’s boundary, he could only control a portion of the Sacred Lands. When dealing with the lower-ranking monks, this was more than enough. As for top-ranking Martial Artists that were above the level of a Martial Sage, it could only count as a form of harassment. The wave of lightning strikes released from before was already the limit he could currently achieve. Within three days after the lightning strike, he was unable to unleash the same power as before.</p>
 <p>Yet, such a result was already sufficient for Liu Yiyan.</p>
 <p>Seeing how the Martial Artists from all over had come to find Pan Wuyang for an explanation, Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan did not stay idle. When Liu Yiyan caused such an uproar, both of them had already begun to discuss their next action.</p>
 <p>Originally, they thought that they could eliminate everyone from the North Qiu Royal Family simply by using the Sacred Lands. Although their suspicions were raised earlier than planned, it was a surprise that they could destroy five Demigods.</p>
 <p>Liu Yiyan had helped them by continuing to give them momentum for their plan and led everyone to shift their focus onto the North Qiu Royal Family. They no longer had to waste their time and could now announce to the world what the North Qiu Royal Family had intended to do. This was the best opportunity to do so whilst everyone’s emotions were still heightened.</p>
 <p>With this in mind, they both exchanged a glance. Gu Lingzhi made a move and in the next second, transported both of them within a hundred meters from the main palace. They followed the crowd and approached the main palace.</p>
 <p>In front of the main palace at this moment, Pan Wuyang was calmly explaining to the crowd, “My Pan Family is already the most noble family in the Tianyuan Continent. Why would we take the risk and scheme against all of you? Unless, you’re all trying to imply that we’re seeking trouble because we’re too bored? Rather, the Spiritual Being in the main palace is the odd one. Not only are the conditions for entering the palace extremely harsh, but also holds the ability to attack others. If we believe his provocations and kill each other, it would be even more difficult to obtain the contents inside.”</p>
 <p>After hearing such a well-founded analysis by Pan Wuyang, some of those who were angry began to waver. At the same time, the men sent from the North Qiu Kingdom to hide amidst the crowd took the opportunity and said, “Pan Wuyang is right. Previously, so many people have disappeared for no reason, maybe it was all his doing. He set the rules to enter the palace so harshly so as to prevent people from attaining the treasures inside.”</p>
 <p>These words reminded many of the strange encounters during this period. Indeed there were many explorers who came for the treasure hunt but many of them had disappeared for no reason. Not even their bones remained. If all these were the actions of the North Qiu Royal Family, what motive could they possibly have? The North Qiu Kingdom was strong, but could they be stronger than the entire continent?</p>
 <p>Seeing how most people had wavered, Pan Wuyang persisted, “Everyone has already entered for many days. I believe you are all aware that this was once the Spirit Tribe’s land. Have you never doubted the sudden disappearance of the Spirit Tribe? Maybe their tribe vanished mysteriously as they have committed many sins and were punished by the heavens so…”</p>
 <p>“Whoo!” A ball of white flames silently appeared above Pan Wuyang’s head. Just when it was about to fall onto Pan Wuyang, he dodged swiftly to avoid being hit. A two-meter square pit appeared in the ground in front of him instantly.</p>
 <p><em>That was Divine Fire!</em> While looking at the white flames remaining in the pit, Pan Wuyang was so shocked that he broke out in a cold sweat. If he had not been alert to his surroundings when he spoke, he would have been hit. Having such a close brush with death, he no longer dared to play with fate and immediately set up a ball of defense for cover. This was the power of his realm. With this layer of protection, it would not be easy for Gu Lingzhi to sneak an attack on him.</p>
 <p>“What a pity…” Gu Lingzhi sighed. Divine Fire was the most powerful kind of energy that the Restrictive Shield could emit. However, it could only be generated once every three days. As this strike failed to claim the life of Pan Wuyang, they would have to wait for another three days before attacking again.</p>
 <p>“As to how the Spirit Tribe has disappeared, your Pan Family is the least qualified to comment on this!” Liu Yiyan’s voice turned cold instantly. An unparalleled power began to spread throughout the main palace causing the people nearby to feel breathless.</p>
 <p>“I may be just a Spiritual Being but I was once an auxiliary for the Spirit Tribe. This strike was just a warning. If I were to hear anyone speaking insolently again, it would not be as simple as a ball of Divine Fire next time.”</p>
 <p>“You’re right, I’ve…spoken too rashly.” Amid the spiritual pressure exerted by Liu Yiyan, Pan Wuyang struggled. In his eyes was resentment towards Liu Yiyan. Ever since he became a Demigod, he had never lowered his head and voice before. Upon thinking of the Divine Fire from before, he had no choice but to swallow this.</p>
 <p>Liu Yiyan was just a Spiritual Being that had lost its body and was imprisoned here by the Spirit Tribe. When Pan Wuyang’s ancestors found a way to deal with him, they would definitely make him pay! But after this fright, he did not dare to say anything about the Spirit Tribe. When Mei Ying questioned him once again about the pursuit, he could only pretend not to know and make a painful expression, “When Brother Mei was chased, he came to our Pan family for an explanation. Who should we seek then for the loss of half of our family’s Demigods?”</p>
 <p>Pan Wuyang’s words successfully made Mei Ying stunned, “Even your men were besieged and killed?”</p>
 <p>“Yes!” Pan Wuyang nodded painfully while glancing guiltily across the direction of the main palace, “This is a long story. If Brother Mei still trusts me, let’s go find a place where we can talk about this. I… ”</p>
 <p>“Then you’ll find a chance to stab Senior Mei in the back?” Rong Yuan, who had long appeared behind Mei Ying, spoke suddenly. As soon as he spoke, everyone’s attention was focused on him.</p>
 <p>His appearance stunned Pan Wuyang instantly. His gaze caught a glimpse of Pan En who looked equally as surprised. If their informant was correct, the Xia Kingdom’s Third Prince should be dragged by Ding Rou around the Yan City just half an hour ago. <em>How did he suddenly appear here? And Ding Rou? Why was it Gu Lingzhi by his side instead?</em></p>
 <p>“Lingzhi, what are you doing there? Aren’t you going to come over?” After receiving stares of blame from Pan Wuyang, Pan En commanded Gu Lingzhi who was standing opposite.</p>
 <p>The once obedient Gu Lingzhi did not follow his words. Instead, she leaned closer to Rong Yuan who was beside her. Her smile was gentle as usual but the words from her mouth led him to change his expression instantly.</p>
 <p>“Your Highness, my fiance is right by my side, why should I go over to you?”</p>
 <p>“You … ” Pan En was dumbfounded. He was so angry at her words that he squinted his eyes, “You’re betraying me?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi shook her head, “If there was never obedience from the very beginning, how could there be betrayal?”</p>
 <p>As soon as she finished speaking, she felt a tight grip around her waist and was carried into Rong Yuan’s arms. He then planted a kiss on her forehead.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Lingzhi was mine all along, how could there be any form of betrayal? I have to thank Your Highness instead for taking such good care of Lingzhi during this period so that I could make time to handle other matters.”</p>
 <p>The trio’s conversation left everyone in confusion for a while. Their eyes glanced back and forth at the three of them but was still unable to figure out what exactly had happened. Even Pan En was glaring at Gu Lingzhi peculiarly as if he had caught his wife being unfaithful, a face of desolation.</p>
 <p>Without paying attention to Pan En’s feelings, Rong Yuan secretly released his grip on Gu Lingzhi upon seeing how everyone’s attention was on him. He retrieved a stack of letters from the Storage Ring and swayed them in front of Pan Wuyang whose face changed instantly. He chuckled, “Lord Pan, do you recognise these letters?”</p>
 <p>Pan Wuyang narrowed his eyes immediately when he saw Rong Yuan fish out the stack of letters from the Storage Ring. Now that he heard what Rong Yuan asked, his scalp tingled as he cursed under his breath.</p>
 <p>Those were the letters used to discuss with the Dayin Kingdom on how to join forces and annihilate the other kingdoms. Inside the letters contained top secrets, how could it possibly fall into the hands of Rong Yuan? If he were to announce them, the Pan Family’s schemes would all be futile after so many years of planning.</p>
 <p>Thinking of this, Pan Wuyang moved his body and before anybody could react, rushed towards Rong Yuan. He grabbed the letters before Rong Yuan could pull back his hand. With a gentle flick of his palm, a gulf of orange flames engulfed the letters. In less than two breaths, the letters turned into a pile of ashes, seemingly laughing at Rong Yuan’s recklessness.</p>
