 <p>It was exactly as Rong Yuan had guessed. This peculiar young girl who had killed so many people, had the cultivation of a Demigod. However, there was a significant difference between her and Demigod Martial Artists who were human beings. It was that this girl did not know any techniques. All her attacks were either physical or spiritual attacks.</p>
 <p>While he was fighting her, Rong Yuan discovered that the blue light rays she had used to attack them earlier would directly affect their spirit. Each time he was hit by the light ray, there would be a piercing pain in his brain. If even a Demigod like him felt so much pain, there was no need to mention what it would have been like for those Gold Class Warriors.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi observed the fight for a while, but upon realising that Rong Yuan could handle the situation by himself without any help, she turned around and went out.</p>
 <p>Outside the house, Lin Chongyuan and Chu Jiang were standing on the right and left sides of Jin Hao.</p>
 <p>“Why?” Gu Lingzhi heard Chu Jiang ask, “Hasn’t Spirit City treated you well?” <em>To actually collaborate with such a strange creature and murder so many Martial Artists in the Spirit City.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Jin Hao bit on his lips as he struggled internally. After a long moment, he raised his head and looked at Chu Jiang, “Xiao Bai needs nutrients.”</p>
 <p>“What nutrients?” Jin Hao continued to question. However, it was only after he asked the question that he realised the nutrients Jin Hao was referring to, were very likely those people that had been killed.</p>
 <p>As expected, Jin Hao replied, “Xiao Bai is carrying my child. She needs large amounts of internal organs and brains to nourish her so that she can have a smooth delivery.”</p>
 <p>“Ridiculous!” Chu Jiang rebuked, “She needs the nutrients, so you let her harm people? If one day she needs the entirety of Spirit City, are you going to help her slaughter the whole city too?”</p>
 <p>Jin Hao refused to reply. However, his answer was evident from his attitude. He would really betray Spirit City if Xiao Bai had such an intention. Chu Jiang was so angry that his whole body trembled. He could not understand how such a cheerful boy like him could change so much. He was obviously bewitched by the monster and could not differentiate right from wrong anymore!</p>
 <p>“Good, good!” Chu Jiang said, “Since it is like that, I am also left with no other option. I will kill you first to pay for the lives of all the innocent martial artists.”</p>
 <p>Chu Jiang raised his hand and pressed down against Jin Hao.</p>
 <p>Jin Hao suddenly raised his head. It was unknown when his eyes had changed to become the same silvery-white colour as Little White’s. He moved quickly and evaded Chu Jiang’s attack.</p>
 <p>“You dare to resist?” Chu Liang raged and attacked Jin Hao once more.</p>
 <p>However, in this short period of time, Jin Hao’s strength had somehow increased by two levels. In a moment, he had gone from being a Gold Class Warrior to a Glaze Class Warrior. He was now stronger than Chu Jiang and as strong as Lin Chongyuan.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi sighed. Luckily, when they had decided to impersonate the husband and wife pair, Rong Yuan had requested Lin Chongyuan and Chu Jiang to hide in the area as well. Gu Lingzhi would not have been able to keep Jin Hao here if she had to deal with him alone.</p>
 <p>Lin Chongyuan turned serious and stopped Jin Hao from escaping. He suppressed Jin Hao with the pressure of a Glaze Class Warrior and a Martial Teacher. Under the dual suppression, Jin Hao’s movements slowed a little.</p>
 <p>At this moment, a miserable cry rang out from within the house. Jin Hao paused and looked towards the house worriedly.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi took the opportunity to release a fire arrow. The flames danced over Jin Hao’s chest, but strangely, there was not a single drop of blood.</p>
 <p>“You… I…” Jin Hao looked at Gu Lingzhi then at his wound, he could not understand why there was no blood. Furthermore, he could not feel any pain at all. However, Gu Lingzhi was so terrified that she almost dropped her Fengwu Sword.</p>
 <p>Jin Hao himself could not see it, but Gu Lingzhi, Lin Chongyuan and Chu Jiang could see everything clearly. Many small, translucent, white bugs the size of a fingernail, were crawling out from the hole in Jin Hao’s chest. It was terrifying, especially when they were crawling out from a human in such large quantities.</p>
 <p>“It is the larvae of the Insect Beast. When did all these parasitic Insect Beast larvae start infesting his body?” Chu Jiang questioned.</p>
 <p>However, there was no time for time to be shocked.</p>
 <p>When the first larvae crawled out of Jin Hao’s body, his eyes immediately lost all signs of life and he collapsed onto the floor. His whole body was rippling violently, and suddenly countless numbers of Insect Beast larvae dug out of his skin as they scrambled to climb out first. Instantly, there was only his skin left. All his internal organs and bones had disappeared.</p>
 <p>“Burn them, quickly!” Chu Jiang cried out and shot a stream of fire at the Insect Beast larvae.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi also reacted. If these Insect Beast larvae got away, there was no telling how much trouble it would create for the Spirit City. She swung her Fengwu Sword and created walls of fire, trapping the Insect Beast larvae within it.</p>
 <p>However, although it was still larvae, their defences were frighteningly high. It took half an hour of being burned continuously to finally kill them. With the large numbers of Insect Beast larvae, some of them managed to spread out and escape, giving no chance to be incinerated at all.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi rushed to create some walls with her earth-based spiritual power when she saw that the Insect Beast larvae were about to escape.</p>
 <p>However, the walls could only block the Insect Beast Larvae for a short while. Even with Lin Chongyuan and Chu Jiang’s help, they had only managed to kill a small portion of the Insect Beast larvae. A large proportion of them had already scattered around.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Rong Yuan stepped out of the house with a cold expression as he held his Dragon Sword. He was taken aback by the four huge walls that had appeared and created an encirclement around the Insect Beast larvae.</p>
 <p>Countless numbers of fireballs descended from the skies and crashed onto the Insect Beast larvae. Instantly, he realised the urgency of the situation.</p>
 <p>“This is not going to work. The Insect Beast larvae are not going to stay still on the floor and wait for us to incinerate them. Furthermore, our spiritual power cannot sustain such large consumptions.” Chu Jiang commented as his expression turned ugly.</p>
 <p>His cultivation level was only at the rank of a Martial Teacher, he simply could not sustain a continuous consumption of his spiritual power. Furthermore, over the years, he had honed the habit of blocking off his body’s senses in battle. This was to prevent himself from absorbing spiritual power so that there would be more left behind for young children. This was the unspoken rule for all adults in Spirit City.</p>
 <p>Spiritual power was something that should be left for those children who were gifted in cultivation. As for the rest of them, they only required a little bit of spiritual power for defence.</p>
 <p>Hence, after this short period of time, Chu Jiang had insufficient spiritual power and could only resort to using physical attacks to kill the Insect Beast Larvae. Lin Chongyuan’s situation was not much better, except that he had better control over his spiritual power and could thus hold on for a longer period of time.</p>
 <p><em>How could she have forgotten how stingy people from Spirit City were about spiritual power?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi sighed and took out the Fenlan Painting as she saw how Chu Jiang was still unwilling to absorb spiritual power from the air even in the current situation. The whole area lit up as the bright colours poured out from the Fenlan Painting and all the Insect Beast Larvae that had been scrambling to escape were all sucked into it.</p>
 <p>Chu Jiang praised, “What powerful spiritual treasure is this? It can hold so many things?”</p>
 <p>“Fenlan Painting.” Gu Lingzhi replied and released a small batch of the Insect Beast Larvae, “Kill them. The Fenlan Painting can only hold them, it cannot kill them. We still have to kill them all by ourselves.”</p>
 <p>Then, she controlled some flames towards the small patch of Insect Beast larvae to burn them. Rong Yuan had also acted at the same time and killed off another group of Insect Beast larvae. Chu Jiang kept his sabre into his Storage Ring and took out a pair of huge sledgehammers that he used to slam onto the ground, slowly but surely killing the Insect Beast larvae. Only Lin Chongyuan seemed to be absentminded after he heard Gu Lingzhi say “Fenlan Painting”, as though he had something else on his mind. The expression that he had looked at Gu Lingzhi with was also very complicated and was full of other emotions.</p>
 <p>While they were killing the Insect Beast larvae that Gu Lingzhi had been releasing in batches, several people nearby had noticed that something was wrong. They flew over the walls and saw the situation. When they saw that Lin Chongyuan was also there, they called their friends and also participated in killing off the Insect Beast Larvae. With such large moments, Wei Lingshu, who had been patrolling nearby had also noticed something and brought a group of people over.</p>
 <p>When he saw the Fenlan Painting hanging above the heads of the people, he immediately joined them in killing the Insect Beast larvae.</p>
 <p>In less than half an hour, the Insect Beast larvae had all been killed. It was only at this time that Wei Lingshu inquired about what had happened and learned about the flow of events and about the Insect Beast larvae that had crawled out of Jin Hao’s body. He also found out that Rong Yuan had fought the real murderer.</p>
 <p>Wei Lingshu knew that Spirit City had a traitor, but Gu Lingshi did not tell him who it was. Now that he knew it was Le Yao who had framed Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan, and that Jin Hao had harmed countless citizens of Spirit City, it was too much for him to digest. He could not believe that such a sunny youth would actually do such crazy things.</p>
 <p>“Only a female Insect Beast can breed larvae, how could they have crawled out of Jin Hao’s body?” Wei Lingshu was confused, “When did Jin Hao ever come into contact with a female Demon Beast? They only exist in the Heavenly Lands and we didn’t see any during our journey back at all.”</p>
 <p>“That may not be the case.” Rong Yuan said solemnly, “Did you forget? The last day that we had spent in the Heavenly Lands had been scarily smooth?”</p>
 <p>Wei Lingshu kept silent. If Jin Hao had already been with the female Insect Beasts then, there was no surprise as to why they had not met any demon beasts along the way.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, here I was wondering since when Jin Hao developed a liking for bugs. I suppose the little worm that he was taking care of then was the female Insect Beast then,” Qiao Yeshu said regretfully.</p>
