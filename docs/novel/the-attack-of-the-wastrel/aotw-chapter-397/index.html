 <p>Without the Female Worm, the beasts completely restored its cruel and brainless nature and threw themselves at anything nearby that they could feed on. The beasts were partners in one second and had become enemies in the next second. Majority of the beasts outside the base camp circled a few rounds before leaving.</p>
 <p>The citizens of the Forgotten City were the opposite of the beasts and were instead, aroused by the boundless war intentions. Their ray of hope on being able to reach the Spirit City alive had pushed them to give their all and kill the beasts. The reduced number of beasts coupled with those that were killing each other, soon put the beasts at a disadvantageous position in this battle. When the blue sky became dark blue, the invading beasts were either dead or had fled the scene, putting an end to this battle.</p>
 <p>Those in victory laughed wildly as they did not expect that they would really succeed and survived the attacks of the countless beasts.</p>
 <p>The deafening cheers outside could be heard in Guan Yue’s tent. Rong Yuan expressed that they were temporarily safe. Without the Female Worm’s control, the herd of Beasts were extremely uncoordinated and was not a cause for concern. They were to set off quickly the next day so as to reach the Spirit City as soon as possible.</p>
 <p>Guan Yue heard and replied, “I also thought so. Based on the spies’ report, the herd of beasts has been divided into three groups. The other two groups have gone to the Wasteland City and Burnt City. Now that this group was already taken care of, they would no longer pose a threat to us. As long as we are to be careful during the journey, the majority can still reach Spirit City alive.”</p>
 <p>As for this result, Guan Yue did not dare to think of it before this. He was absolutely at his wits’ end such that he would decide to go to Spirit City with Gu Lingzhi and the rest. Initially when they were attacked by the beasts, he even foresaw how he would flee to the Spirit City with Jiang Qing and the other confidants like how the Chancellors of the Crescent Moon City had. Who would have thought that they were to discover the key to deal with the beasts instead?</p>
 <p>It was an absolute surprise for him to be able to take most of the citizens of the Forgotten City to seek refuge in the Spirit City.</p>
 <p>In the next few days, it was the same as what they had predicted. The scattered beasts did little damage to them. Even if occasionally, there were a few foolish beasts that attacked the citizens of the Forgotten City out of hunger, they would be subdued and killed quickly. More so, they had become their ration for the day. After walking for more than ten days, they were almost reaching the Spirit City.</p>
 <p>Just as the journey to Spirit City was within two to three days’ time, the scout responsible for investigating the situation reported that a few thousand people were spotted in the northeast direction.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan frowned, “Are they from the Spirit City?”</p>
 <p>“This...I do not know.” The scout answered awkwardly.</p>
 <p>He had simply seen the group from afar and hurried back to report it. He did not dare to get too close to the other party as their status was not known.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan nodded his head, expressing that he understood. He pondered for a while before speaking, “Lingzhi, let’s go take a look.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan had completely regarded Spirit City, which was Gu Lingzhi’s hometown, as his second home. They were very near to the Spirit City and thus, someone living nearby might have heard the news and had prepared for their arrival. If Lingzhi and him were to go over, they might be able to obtain some help from them.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was also thinking of the same thing and agreed immediately as soon as he proposed. Guan Yue frowned and asked, “Do I need to allocate some men to go with you all?”</p>
 <p>“No, there are merely a few thousands of soldiers. Even if they turned out to be enemies, they would not be able to hurt us.” Rong Yuan answered confidently and pulled Gu Lingzhi away. In less than half an hour, they could see the few thousands mentioned by the scout.</p>
 <p><em>It was a very battered-looking group!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Their state was worse than when the Chancellor of the Crescent Moon City who had surrendered just a month ago. Gu Lingzhi felt more relieved after getting closer. Other than the few leaders, the remaining thousands of them were barely clothed and a small number of them had to rely on holding branches to assist them in advancing forward. Their faces were covered with dirt and they were practically a group of refugees.</p>
 <p>“Little Chancellor? Demigod Rong?” The leader shouted as he saw the both of them flew over.</p>
 <p><em>That voice.</em> <em>This alluring woman who was dressed such that only the key parts were covered with beast skin and was followed by a man who was scantily clad, wasn’t she Le Yao?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>After recognising them, Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan could guess the purpose of their journey.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, as soon as the two landed in front of them, Le Yao came forward excitedly, “Little Chancellor, I didn’t expect to be able to see the both of you again! I’ve heard that the Chancellor of the Crescent Moon City had just sought asylum at the Spirit City. It is due to my incompetence such that we were unable to safeguard the Burnt City and are finding the Spirit City now to have a safe place to settle down. Will you mind?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi’s eyes flashed and she smiled before replying, “The Spirit City belongs to my grandfather. It’s up to his decision as to who he will allow in. Besides, you all have already reached here, how could I possibly mind?”</p>
 <p>Her words implied that she had no other options since they had already reached here.</p>
 <p>Anyway, the Spirit City was large enough to hold everybody. It was fine for them to stay at the Spirit City until the herd of beasts had dispersed as long as they did not cause any trouble. It was just that Gu Lingzhi did not really like Le Yan.</p>
 <p>It was only a month ago when the people from the Crescent Moon City had fled to the Spirit City. The distance between the four cities and the Spirit City were almost the same. The Spirit City had just accepted the people from the Crescent Moon City before rushing to the Forgotten City. Le Yan and his party had actually come here and had departed at a time that was about the same as them. Just half a month ago, the scout had reported that a group of beasts was heading towards the Burnt City. How did they arrive so quickly within ten days?</p>
 <p>After listening to Gu Lingzhi, Le Yan had no special response. Rather, Le Yao frowned and asked, “Little Chancellor, I’ve heard that you and Demigod Rong had personally gone to escort the citizens of the Forgotten City and were moving towards the Spirit City. Why was it that you had only helped us safeguard the city for a few days then?”</p>
 <p>Was Le Yao questioning her?</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi laughed gently but her words contained no amusement when she spoke, “The Chancellor of the Forgotten City was my old friend. My friends are also in the Forgotten City. Isn’t it normal to escort them?”</p>
 <p>Le Yao twitched her eyebrows and wanted to say that only Guan Yue and the members of the Langya Troop were her friends. The other citizens of the Forgotten City are not, thus, Gu Lingzhi had no need to escort all of them personally. But after seeing the expression on Gu Lingzhi’s face, she swallowed her sentence back.</p>
 <p>Their current situation was more important. They still had to rely on the strength of the Spirit City to keep them safe. Hence, it was not appropriate to incur Gu Lingzhi’s hatred now. She laughed explicitly as she twisted her long hair with her fingers, “I have forgotten that Little Chancellor and the Forgotten City had such a relationship. Little Chancellor has such a kind heart, can you also escort us? The beasts are really annoying.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi did not answer her words but looked at the group of people behind her. She could tell that these thousands of people did not have a good time during this period. Almost everyone was slightly or severely wounded. Even Le Yao and Le Yan had several scratches on their bodies.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Gu Lingzhi did not answer, Le Yan spoke anxiously, “Little Chancellor, are you unwilling to do so? Don’t judge the people behind me for their battered looks. Since they are able to follow me here, they are all skillful and will not be a burden to you all.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi did not speak and felt that there was something off with Le Yan’s emotions but she could not figure out what was wrong. She glanced at the thousands of people behind him and said lightly, “The Spirit City is only a two to three days journey from here. If Mayor Le is in a hurry, it can be reached within one and a half days. There is really no need for us to go together.”</p>
 <p>“We aren’t in a hurry.” Le Yan spoke immediately. As the words left his mouth, he felt that he had responded too quickly. He laughed embarrassingly, “Judging by how you two have reached here, it could only mean that Guan Yue and the rest are nearby. How about merging the two teams and advancing forward together?”</p>
 <p>After an hour, the Forgotten City team was increased by more than two thousand people. Le Yan looked enviously at the long line from the Forgotten City. He deeply regretted not having the cheek to ask Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan to escort them to the Spirit City when Gu Lingzhi was going to the Burnt City. He had heard from his men that the group of beasts besieging the Forgotten City was eliminated by Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan within a few days. Thus, the Forgotten City managed to retain more than half of its horses.</p>
 <p>“It’s really a blessing for Brother Guan.” Le Yan praised heartily. If only he had such a strong acquaintance.</p>
 <p>Guan Yue laughed twice, “It’s all thanks to the Little Chancellor’s righteousness.”</p>
 <p>The two of them exchanged a few words politely before Guan Yue asked inadvertently, “As far as I know, the Burnt City was still alright just less than half a month ago. Why did Brother Le appear here instead?”</p>
 <p>Le Yan let out a long sigh after hearing, “Isn’t it all because of the herd of beasts?”</p>
 <p>It turned out that not long after the beasts had retreated and turned their target towards the Crescent Moon City, they attacked the Burnt City again.</p>
 <p>Only this time, there were far fewer beasts attacking the city than before. Perhaps the beasts had also discovered that they need not have to come out of their lair in order to deal with a city. The beasts then divided themselves into three groups and dealt with them individually.</p>
 <p>Initially, under the command of Le Yan, the Burnt City was still able to handle the beasts. But after the emergence of the Giant Insect Beasts, the Burnt City could only retreat gradually. After the Burnt City was defeated, he brought some of the citizens into a secret tunnel such that their lives could be saved. After hearing that the Forgotten City was moving to the Spirit City, he then travelled with his remaining citizens to rush here. They had finally managed to encounter them.</p>
 <p>“Then you all had really moved quickly.” Rong Yuan spoke abruptly after he had finished speaking.</p>
 <p>Le Yan laughed wryly, “Don’t we have to move quickly in order to escape?”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan nodded, “That’s true.”</p>
 <p>Just as he had finished speaking, the scout was seen running towards them panicky. He shouted urgently before arriving, “Oh no, the beasts are here again!”</p>
 <p>With that, the entire team entered a defensive state in a reflexive manner. Rong Yuan enquired the direction at which the beasts were arriving from before disappearing.</p>
 <p>When Rong Yuan reappeared in front of everybody, his face was terrible. He stared at Le Yan, “Why didn’t you say that there were beasts chasing after you all?”</p>
 <p>He was pondering as to why Le Yan seemed so happy upon seeing Gu Lingzhi and himself as if they had just seen a savior. It turned out that they were being chased after by a herd of beasts despite nearing the Spirit City.</p>
