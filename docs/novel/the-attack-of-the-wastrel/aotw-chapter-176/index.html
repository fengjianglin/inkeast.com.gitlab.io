 <p>“I’m sorry, I like it here very much,” Gu Lingzhi interrupted Pan Yue’s invitation. This made Rong Yuan feel extremely gratified. He immediately turned to address the class, instructing, “Once you’ve rested enough, get ready for the next round. Amongst all of you, only Gu Lingzhi managed to avoid getting hit. Do any of you even want to graduate?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi went back to her own group.</p>
 <p>Seeing her leave, Pan Yue shrugged helplessly and flashed an innocent smile at Rong Yuan before returning to his own group. He did not forget to incite his group members’ fury, “Remember to consider it carefully, if you beg me, I can consider going easy on you so you don’t look too bad.”</p>
 <p>“No need for your concern, Fifth Prince, the students in my Royal School do not need to resort to cheating like this.”</p>
 <p>This time, the one who was doing the training was called Bai Xi. Bai Xi was relatively famous amongst the Martial Practitioner rank students in the Royal School. Like his name, he had a fair complexion with skin as white as snow, bright eyes and a set of white teeth. When he smiled, he seemed to have dimples. Many of the female students were jealous of his complexion.</p>
 <p>However, if one were to judge Bai Xi as a pushover just because of his gentle looking appearance, they would find themselves sorely mistaken. Perhaps because he was conscious of his appearance, Bai Xi had placed a lot of emphasis on training his body. If Bai Xi were to remove his clothes, one would notice that his slim figure was actually completely packed with muscles.</p>
 <p>In fact, his physical strength was even comparable to Qin Xinran, earning them both a reputation of being ferocious killing machines.</p>
 <p>Pan Yue obviously did not believe what Bai Xi said. Looking at Bai Xi’s slim figure, Pan Yue sighed, “Little brother, didn’t your mother tell you not to overestimate yourself? Wouldn’t it be a pity if your beautiful skin was marred by scars from receiving these attacks?”</p>
 <p>Even as he said this, Pan Yue reached out his hand to stroke Bai Xi’s face, creating a scene that could only be described as obscene.</p>
 <p><em>Slap!</em></p>
 <p>His hand was slapped aside by Bai Xi, who solemnly said, “Fifth Prince, please have some self-respect.”</p>
 <p>“<em>Whoa</em>, feisty!” Pan Yue laughed, amused. “I’ve taken a liking to you. How about it, would you like to come with me back to North Qiu Kingdom? Over there…”</p>
 <p>“Next round of training begins… now.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan announced the start of the next round without bothering to wait for Pan Yue to finish talking. His voice contained the spiritual pressure of a Martial Lord, and this made Pan Yue who was still a Martial Practitioner immediately shut his mouth and go along with Rong Yuan’s pace.</p>
 <p>The rest of the class also began the next half an hour of painful training.</p>
 <p>Pan Yue had thoroughly infuriated the rest of the class, but due to his status as a prince of the North Qiu Kingdom, many did not dare to voice their anger. They could only vent their anger through the training.</p>
 <p>However, compared to the previous rounds, this time, the students responsible for attacking surreptitiously reduced the speed and accuracy of their attacks. The ones dodging were also in a state of high alert because of the mocking words from Pan Yue earlier.</p>
 <p>Even after a few minutes had passed, not a single student had gotten hit.</p>
 <p>Seeing what was going on, Rong Yuan’s eyebrow twitched but he did not say anything.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan was not going to change the class curriculum merely because of Pan Yue’s presence, no matter what Pan Yue did. Still, how the lesson was conducted was not fixed but depended on his mood. Because he was in a “good” mood, he was turning a blind eye to the students’ obvious actions.</p>
 <p>“Impossible! Not even a single hit?”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Pan Yue shouted.</p>
 <p>The students diverted some of their attention to observe what was going on. Currently, Pan Yue’s face was flushed and he was panting even as he released one attack after another. Yet, although Bai Xi looked a little ragged dodging the attacks, he managed to narrowly dodge each attack that came his way.</p>
 <p>This was partly due to Pan Yue’s skill as well as the fact that the other students were going easy on him.</p>
 <p>“Damn it, he’s cheating! He’s definitely cheating…<em>argh</em>!”</p>
 <p>Pan Yue was raging about how Bai Xi managed to dodge several attacks that looked like they were certain to hit, when a ball of water collided into his face and cut him off. Immediately, his face was flushed red and dripping wet.</p>
 <p>“My apologies, I lost control and accidentally hit you,” Gu Lingzhi’s voice sounded from the next group.</p>
 <p>Apparently, Gu Lingzhi could not stand to listen to Pan Yue’s condescending words any longer, and under the guise of losing control, had decided to help Pan Yue rinse his mouth.</p>
 <p>“Swords and fists have no eyes, it’s normal to misfire once in a while. I’m sure the Fifth Prince won’t blame you,” Rong Yuan said, not giving Pan Yue a chance to speak.</p>
 <p>Immediately, Gu Lingzhi smiled apologetically, saying innocently, “I knew the prince of the great North Qiu Kingdom wouldn’t be too petty. Thank you for your magnanimity.”</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Pan Yue could only swallow the words of anger back into his stomach.</p>
 <p>Faced with Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan’s cooperation, for him to say anything would only be inviting ridicule by proving that he was being petty. He helplessly waved his hand and said, “Forget it, since Lady Gu was the one responsible, how can I be petty about it?”</p>
 <p>Since he could not openly blame Gu Lingzhi, he could only do so by playing word games. Annoyance flashed in Rong Yuan’s eyes. <em>How could he watch as someone insulted his fiancée? He decided that in the one month that Pan Yue was here, he would take “good” care of him.</em></p>
 <p>With Gu Lingzhi taking the lead, in the remaining time, a number of other attacks found their way to Pan Yue’s body by “accident”. Those who were responsible for “accidentally” attacking Pan Yue all apologized sincerely, making it such that even if Pan Yue wanted to find fault with them, he could not.</p>
 <p>Finally, when Pan Yue was once again hit by a ball of dirt the size of a fist, he could not take it any longer.</p>
 <p>“Don’t push your luck!” he screamed. Turning to look where the dirt ball came from, he saw Qin Xinran looking apologetic, with tears in her eyes. She immediately apologized, “Fifth Prince, I’m really sorry, it wasn’t intentional.”</p>
 <p>“…” Seeing Qin Xinran’s appearance, Pan Yue did not say anything. He was extremely weak towards beautiful girls.</p>
 <p>Taking a deep breath, Pan Yue’s anger quickly subsided and was replaced by a smile. “It seems that although the students in the Royal School are nothing spectacular, there really are quite a number of beauties. My dear, how would you like to accompany me back to the North Qiu Kingdom? I promise you that there are all sorts of interesting things there.”</p>
 <p>Qin Xinran immediately blinked, her eyes tearing up again. Looking slightly panicked, she stammered, “Hmm, no, thank you, Your Highness. I think the Xia Kingdom is pretty nice already.”</p>
 <p>Those who knew Qin Xinran’s true personality immediately began to feel sympathetic for the North Qiu Prince.</p>
 <p>“Oh, no need to be shy dear! I’ll definitely treat you well, I promise!”</p>
 <p>With his attention completely captured by the innocent-looking Qin Xinran, Pan Yue did not detect the odd change around him.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be scared, my dear, you have really beautiful eyes. My palace is lacking precisely someone like you!” As he said this, he reached out his lecherous hand once again.</p>
 <p>Just like with Bai Xi, before his hand even reached Qin Xinran’s face, it was slapped aside by Qin Xinran, who shrieked, “Your Highness, please have some self-respect!”</p>
 <p>This time however, everyone could hear the pain just purely from the sound of the slap. As expected, Pan Yue’s hand was red and swollen, and it was still swelling even further.</p>
 <p>Pan Yue lost it and shrieked, “Damn it, you slut! How dare you take advantage of my kindness? It is your honor to be noticed by me! How dare you hit me? I’ll #@$%&amp;^!&amp;...”</p>
 <p>Following Pan Yue’s loud swearing, his guards who were keeping watch outside the classroom immediately charged in. One of them stood in front of Qin Xinran with his sword drawn. Yet, although the guard looked angry, he was actually laughing at Pan Yue’s misfortune secretly.</p>
 <p>In fact, none of them liked the Fifth Prince. Because he was doted on by the Emperor of the North Qiu Kingdom, he would throw his weight around. Many of these guards had been abused by him before, and were quite happy to see him be on the losing end for once. Therefore, when Pan Yue was being bullied earlier, they had happily watched on. This time was different, however.</p>
 <p>Ultimately, Pan Yue was still the favorite son of the North Qiu Kingdom’s Emperor. No matter how detestable his character was, he was still a prince. Earlier, when he was being harassed by those attacks, they could still pretend that it was an accident. This time, it was clear that Pan Yue was directly and deliberately slapped by Qin Xinran, and his hand was still swollen where it had been slapped. If they just stood aside and did nothing, they would definitely be punished for it later on.</p>
 <p>“It was his fault! He was going to molest me, I only hit him in self-defense!” Qin Xinran began crying before the guard even had a chance to question her.</p>
 <p>In the first place, Qin Xinran looked extremely loveable and cute. Even with tears in her eyes, she looked attractive, making the guard unwilling to take any action. <em>How could he bear to hit such an innocent-looking girl? Even the freckles on her face made her look more attractive.</em></p>
 <p>Once Qin Xinran started “crying”, Rong Yuan had the opportunity to step in to mediate.</p>
 <p>“Fifth Prince, look, don’t you think we should just drop the matter? Xinran is the only daughter of the Qin Clan of our Kingdom’s Four Great Clans. It’ll also be hard for me to explain your actions towards her to them.”</p>
 <p>With this, Rong Yuan immediately threw the blame towards Pan Yue.</p>
 <p>It was obvious that Pan Yue was shocked silly by Qin Xinran’s sudden outburst, because he immediately jumped into Rong Yuan’s trap without thinking too much about it. In fact, he could not resist saying, “Little beauty, don’t cry. If you promise to bring me around the Royal School later tonight, I’ll let the matter go.”</p>
 <p>He truly did not learn his lesson.</p>
 <p>Even as the rest of the class looked on sympathetically, Qin Xinran nervously replied, “Hmm, well, I can agree to that. But, but, I’m kinda strong, and I’m also scared easily. I’m worried I may hit you again…”</p>
 <p>“No problem at all. I’m a magnanimous person, don’t worry, I won’t hold it against you!”</p>
