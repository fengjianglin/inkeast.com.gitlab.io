 <p>In the men’s dormitory of the Royal School, Lang Jingchen packed his belongings indifferently. As soon as he had finished packing them, he could formally say goodbye to the Royal School.</p>
 <p>Thinking of how he would no longer be a student of the Royal School, he was still a little unadjusted. Although a few people and situations have made him few vexed in his final year, it did not mean that the good memories of the previous years had been erased. They had actually become more and more beautiful, particularly at parting moments like these.</p>
 <p>“That’s good too, I will not need to be separated from Xiao Wei from now on.” Thinking of the person that made him unlike himself, Lang Jingchen’s heart was sweet yet bitter and complicated at the same time.</p>
 <p>Just as he had packed his belongings and was about to leave the place he had lived for a few years, an unknown object that was the size of a palm was thrown right in front of him. He subconsciously grabbed onto it with his hands due to his instincts as a Martial Artist. His gaze was then met with Rong Yuan’s who had appeared out of nowhere.</p>
 <p>“Your Highness, what is the meaning of this?” Lang Jingchen did not think that his friendship with Rong Yuan was strong enough for him to say goodbye personally.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan looked at him coldly and pointed at the thing that was grasped by Lang Jingchen, “You will know it once you take a look.”</p>
 <p>“What’s there to see?” Lang Jingchen mocked before realising that he was holding onto a Recording Crystal. Seeing the item, he intuitively felt that there would be nothing in it that was of his interest. Before he could get rid of it, the Recording Crystal began playing on its own.</p>
 <p>With one glance, he was not able to take his eyes off it for the Recording Crystal showed an image of Tianfeng Wei!</p>
 <p>“This… ” Lang Jingchen was taken aback, but what truly shocked him was still behind.</p>
 <p>As the image changed, it showed Gu Lingzhi first followed by what seemed like an endless escape. At this point, Lang Jingchen was still uncertain as to why Rong Yuan gave him the Recording Crystal.</p>
 <p><em>It was clear that he wanted to get revenge!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Seeing how Tianfeng Wei tried to hurt Gu Lingzhi several times, despite being injured herself, it made Lang Jingchen clench his fist tightly. What made him even more heartbroken was Shao Weiming’s attitude towards Tianfeng Wei. The person he loved dearly was actually being ordered around by others…</p>
 <p>When he watched to the end where Tianfeng Wei’s figure disappeared into a sea of fire, Lang Jingchen was beginning to be in a trance.</p>
 <p>If he had seen correctly, there were at least a hundred capuchin monkeys chasing Gu Lingzhi and the rest. Putting Gu Lingzhi’s escape aside, Tianfeng Wei barely stood a chance in surviving such a situation.</p>
 <p>“Where is Xiao Wei! What have you done to her?” Lang Jingchen stared at Rong Yuan fiercely. He expected Rong Yuan to give him the Recording Crystal as Tianfeng Wei was already caught. He could at least ensure that Tianfeng Wei was safe. As for how Rong Yuan would like to settle his collusion with the Wei Family on attacking Gu Lingzhi, he could still think of a way to resolve it.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan’s answer was to look at him with a little pity, “How would I know where she is now? Perhaps… She has already fallen into the belly of a capuchin monkey?” After he finished speaking, Rong Yuan frowned and exclaimed suddenly, “No, it has already been so long. It should have already turned into a nourishment for a tree in the Valley of Beasts. After all, the capuchin monkeys also excrete.”</p>
 <p>“Nonsense!” Lang Jingchen roared and proceeded to punch Rong Yuan but was easily blocked by Yuan Zheng who was behind him. He lowered his glare and looked at him warningly, “Lang Jingchen, are you trying to rebel?”</p>
 <p>At this juncture, he did not mind giving Lang Jingchen a charge of conspiracy with the Empress. After all that Tianfeng Wei has done, he can even implicate the whole Lang Family.</p>
 <p>Seeing how Lang Jingchen was restrained by Yuan Zheng with bloodshot eyes, Rong Yuan began to feel a little sympathy in his heart.</p>
 <p>If we were to dig up the past, before Lang Jingchen got together with Tianfeng Wei, he was considered to be a rare talent even though his personality was not pleasing. Otherwise he would not have successfully graduated from the Royal School. If he had not fallen for such a woman, he would not have landed himself in such a dreadful plight.</p>
 <p>From Lang Jingchen’s attitude, Rong Yuan could tell that he had no knowledge of what Tianfeng Wei did. Rong Yuan had no intention of wasting anymore time on him. Since the purpose had been achieved, he ordered Yuan Zheng to release him and began to walk away.</p>
 <p>Regarding Gu Lingzhi’s narrow escape from death, Rong Yuan was so angry that he wanted to kill all those who were involved. However, he knew that the Lang Family could not be touched at the moment if Lang Jingchen did not participate in this matter. Upon seeing the contents of the Recording Crystal, Lang Jingchen must be suffering from within. The tremendous pain, brought to him by his own woman, had set things even.</p>
 <p>After Rong Yuan and Yuan Zheng left, a roar made by a dying beast could be heard from Lang Jingchen’s residence. A silhouette could be seen dashing in the distance, heading in the direction towards the Valley of Beasts.</p>
 <p>“Your Highness… Are you really going to let him go?” Upon seeing the figure, Yuan Zheng felt a little worried.</p>
 <p>If Tianfeng Wei was lucky enough to not only escape death but also found by Lang Jingchen, this matter would not be that easy to deal with.</p>
 <p>“No worries,” Rong Yuan laughed faintly while looking at the silhouette disappear, “As the next chief of the family, it is not wise to act impetuously. Previously when I went over to the Lang Family, I’ve discovered a few youths with potential. I can give them some advice.”</p>
 <p>After hearing that, Yuan Zheng secretly observed three seconds of silence for Lang Jingchen and proceeded to abandon this matter afterwards. It was all his fault to have fallen for someone he should not have, which offended others. If only he could have been a little stronger and not be so conniving towards Tianfeng Wei after marrying her, he would not have landed himself in such a situation now. Upon losing the glory of being the next patriarch, Rong Yuan need not further interfere as Lang Jingchen’s life in the Lang Family would have already been tough.</p>
 <p>Lang Jingchen was fully concentrated on the safety of Tianfeng Wei such that he had no idea that he had caused the loss of his own patriarch position.</p>
 <p><em>Would a miracle occur when being surrounded by numerous capuchin monkeys?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Afraid to think of the worst outcome, Lang Jingchen gave up on thinking and devoted his energy on hurrying back.</p>
 <p>Tianfeng Wei, who was the love interest of Lang Jingchen, was actually in a situation that was not as miserable as he thought. In fact, it was not too bad at all. A pair of frowning yet joyful looking eyebrows accompanied by red lips spoke in a low and flirtatious voice, “Brother Shao, I…I can’t stand it anymore…”</p>
 <p>“You hypocritical bitch, your body says otherwise.” While lying on top of Tianfeng Wei, Shao Weiming continued to work hard while spitting out kinky and obscene jokes.</p>
 <p>“Brother Shao, you’re so naughty… ” Tianfeng Wei feigned anger coquettishly while hitting Shao Weiming’s chest gently. A tinge of hatred could be seen flashing across her pair of eyes.</p>
 <p>She made the right bet that day. Shao Weiming was a Martial Lord and naturally had a treasure to help him escape. Tianfeng Wei worked hard to follow him and escaped several deaths. She had only managed to break free from the capuchin monkeys’ pursuit because of his help.</p>
 <p>But by then, they had already reached the habitat of fourth-order demon beasts. As a low grade Martial Teacher, Tianfeng Wei was naturally unable to deal with creatures of this level. She had no choice but to seek Shao Weiming shamelessly for protection.</p>
 <p>Since Shao Weiming was able to abandon his companions, he was naturally not a kind person. He made use of Tianfeng Wei’s helplessness to put forward a blatant request for her body. In order to survive, she could only comply while bearing a grudge.</p>
 <p>This was already the seventh day that they encountered the group of capuchin monkeys. They wondered if the outside world has become a mess. Rong Yuan was presumed to have already heard the news of Gu Lingzhi’s passing. It was a pity to have missed Rong Yuan’s reaction upon knowing the news of her death.</p>
 <p>“Be more concentrated! How can you still think of other men while being with me?” Shao Weiming noticed Tianfeng Wei’s inattention and punished her by aggravating his actions. This caused Tianfeng Wei to beg for mercy before he kissed those red lips with satisfaction and teased, “Are you thinking of that husband? If only he could see how you look while being under me, I wonder what expression would that be?”</p>
 <p>Tianfeng Wei bit on her lower lip and did not respond while her heart fluttered to Lang Jingchen upon hearing those words. She let out a laugh to mock herself. With Jiang Feixue’s constant companionship, it was presumed that he had already long forgotten about her. She had been contacting the Empress and others for a period, how could he not notice anything?</p>
 <p>Simultaneously, somewhere in the Valley of Beasts, a group of elite soldiers donning the Xia Kingdom’s armor was meticulously searching for something. This group of people was actually sent by Rong Yuan to find the whereabouts of Shao Weiming and others.</p>
 <p>In that case, the chances of others escaping may be slim. But as a Martial Lord, Shao Weiming would still be able to escape the group of capuchin monkeys if he had some intelligence. They were ordered to capture people alive in order to testify for the Wei Family.</p>
 <p>Four days later, Lang Jingchen, who entered the Valley of Beasts alone in search of Tianfeng Wei, was attacked by a fourth-order demon beast. He had to give in his best in order to gradually kill the opponent. Seeing how the sky had already darkened, his eyes were full of despair just like the darkened sky. After standing there for a long time, Lang Jingchen dragged his severely injured body in search of a place to settle.</p>
 <p>In his current situation, continual seeking was equivalent to seeking death. He was not afraid of death but having to lose Tianfeng Wei. Seeing how he was unable to find any remnants of Tianfeng Wei in the valley, he still had hope in his heart that she survived.</p>
 <p>It did not take long before he came across the entrance of a cave that was about two meters high, hiding behind a bunch of weeds. Joy sparkled in Lang Jingchen’s heart as he quickened his steps and headed towards the cave. He poked through the weeds that could delude demons and beasts and entered carefully. Sensing that there was not much danger, he went deeper into the cave.</p>
