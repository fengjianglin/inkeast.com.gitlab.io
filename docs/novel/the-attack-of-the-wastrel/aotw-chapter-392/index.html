 <p>Accompanied with the sad and shrilling calls of the beasts, Gu Lingzhi gracefully passed over a beast, and headed straight for the end of the team from the Forgotten City, to meet Rong Yuan and the others.</p>
 <p>“Little Chancellor, does Yuan Sheng not want to go to the Spirit City together with us?” Guan Yue asked, seeing that Gu Lingzhi came alone.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi responded, “Well, he said that he had his own way of dealing with the beasts, and he does not intend to abandon the Wasteland City for the time being.”</p>
 <p>Guan Yue opened his mouth but did not ask anymore questions. He did not know whether the decision to take the entire city’s population to take refuge in the Spirit City was right or wrong, so naturally, he was in no position to judge Yuan Sheng’s decision.</p>
 <p>There was a chance that they would become food for the beasts if they stayed in the Forgotten City. Now that they were en route to the Spirit City to seek refuge there, they still had to face the dangers of being attacked by these beasts. It was impossible to come to a conclusion on which decision had a higher survival rate. However, one point that Guan Yue was absolutely clear of, was that the Forgotten City would definitely not be able to hold off the beasts. If they did not wish to end up like the Crescent Moon City, going to the Spirit City was their only way out.</p>
 <p>“Lingzhi, I missed you so much,” Rong Yuan said with a voice that did not suit him, and with his palm, he familiarly embraced Gu Lingzhi’s waist. His arm rubbed her with longing in an attempt to get Gu Lingzhi’s attention back. “If we knew earlier that the Wasteland City’s Chancellor would turn down our help, I would not have allowed you to waste a trip there.” It caused them to separate without words, going a few days without seeing each other, yet the first words she spoke once they were reunited, was not to him! Rong Yuan did not want to admit that he was jealous.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi’s mouth twitched and without a word, she shifted Rong Yuan’s arm away from her waist. She cleared her throat and said, “If there is any matter, we’ll talk later. Let’s cross this hurdle before us first.”</p>
 <p>“Okay...” Rong Yuan unwillingly replied, his arms unyieldingly climbing back up to Gu Lingzhi’s waist again, as he buried his head in Gu Lingzhi’s neck longingly and took a deep whiff before he was satisfied to let go of her.</p>
 <p>The people surrounding them tried not to wonder at the strange sight, pretending not to witness this scene.</p>
 <p>Guan Yue calculated the distance between them and the group of beasts, estimating that it will take at most half an hour before they would be caught up by the group of beasts. Looking back at the people from the Forgotten City, panic was written across their faces. If not for Rong Yuan and himself for being at the back and providing support, together with the Vice Chancellor and other Amethyst Class Warriors who were maintaining order, at the first sight of the group of beasts, these groups of people would have fallen apart.</p>
 <p>Closing his eyelids to cover up the disturbance within it, he struggled for a moment before looking at Rong Yuan. “We can prepare to fight. If we continue to escape, it will only make us more passive.”</p>
 <p>Instead of waiting for the group of beasts to catch up and attack them, which would result in a flurried attempt to counterattack, it would be better to make the first move on the group of beasts, before they caught up with them.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, I have that intention as well.” Rong Yuan nodded his head, his thoughts aligning with that of Guan Yue’s. He then conveniently drew out a sword filled with golden spiritual energy and shot it at the beast that was at the front of the group. With satisfaction, he watched the beast collapse to the ground, its legs wounded by the sword’s energy, and being trampled into pulp by the countless beasts behind it.</p>
 <p>“Since we have decided to enter the war, we should get the front of the group to stop. If we continue to run forward, we will lose the time to prepare ourselves.” After finishing her sentence, with a lightning move of the hand, Gu Lingzhi exerted her strength to stab the ground. The originally flat ground had now sunk to become a big pit. Gu Lingzhi smiled at Rong Yuan before she mobilized her earth-based Spiritual Roots to create a base at the bottom of the pit. Rong Yuan coordinated with her and used golden spiritual energy to create metal frames, padded into the pit and finished by sprinkling some water on it, forming a simple foundation. Just like that, the cooperation between the two had created a temporary wall in the empty wilderness.</p>
 <p>Behind him, the Forgotten City residents who were fleeing had stopped. Each of them watching with fright, as the group of beasts came closer. Those who had fighting strength formed a human wall under Guan Yue’s command, preparing to welcome the arrival of the beasts.</p>
 <p>“Chancellor, should we continue to flee? There are so many beasts, how can we possibly kill them all?” A senior from the Forgotten City, who was behind Guan Yue spoke. He was frightened by not being able to see the end to the group of beasts.</p>
 <p>In actual fact, many Warriors above the Gold Class also had the same idea. Based on their strength, even if they were unable to defeat the beasts, based on their physique, they would be able to run faster than ordinary people, and would not be a problem for them to throw off the beasts.</p>
 <p>Guan Yue pursed his lips and glanced at him, directly expressing his thoughts, “You can escape, however, what about those low-level warriors, the elderly and children who are unable to protect themselves? After enjoying their services for such a long time, it should be time for us to contribute, right?”</p>
 <p>Being beaten by Guan Yue’s words, Luo Rongfa lowered his head in shame. He did think of relying on his own speed to escape and did not want to care about the lives of others. After being punctured by Guan Yue’s words, he felt like a jerk himself, how could he only think about himself?</p>
 <p><em>Bang, bang, bang!</em></p>
 <p>As the beasts approached, the ground shook as though there was an earthquake. The timid children were scared and hid in their parent’s arms, not being able to even cry out loud. The temporary wall that was created by both Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan was about a hundred meters wide and three meters tall.</p>
 <p>“Some of you follow me and protect this wall.” Gu Lingzhi said. The biggest difference between them and the beasts was as human beings, they were much more intelligent.</p>
 <p>If these were not being controlled by the Female Worm, how could they be so organised and disciplined to attack the city?</p>
 <p>"Little Chancellor, you are..." Guan Yue wondered. He had been curious as to why the two of them began to build this wall. The wall was made from a mix of soil and metal and had only one side, which would not be able to stop the beasts at all. When the beasts came to face this wall as an obstacle, all they had to do was go around it. This wall seemed to be a little extra.</p>
 <p>After a quarter of an hour, Guan Yue became convinced. He had overestimated the intelligence of those beasts.</p>
 <p>When the beasts discovered that there was a "city wall" ahead, none of the beasts from the group thought of going from the side, but directly went into an attack mode, attacking this earth wall as a city wall.</p>
 <p>Seeing that her guess was correct, Gu Lingzhi pursed her lips and smiled. She raised her sword and killed a beast that attempted to climb up the "city wall" before she stabbed her next target. Many of the warriors standing on the "city wall" treated it as though they were really defending the city, using the protection of the wall to attack the beasts behind it. Momentarily, death was still within their control.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the beasts who were blindly attacking the “city wall” seemed to pause for a moment and stopped attacking the “city wall” at the same time. They started to tilt their heads, as though they were listening to something.</p>
 <p>Looking at this scene, Rong Yuan frowned, and felt as though there was a familiar and loathing odour. Before he could recall where it was that he felt the same thing, he saw that the pause button seemed to be lifted and the beasts were back to their normal selves.</p>
 <p>This time, the beasts did not only attack the “city wall”, but some of them had gone around the “city wall” and started to wreak havoc in the crowd.</p>
 <p>If someone looked down from the sky at this moment, they would be witnessing this strange scene. Countless beasts were attacking a wall that was built in the middle of the wilderness, which resembled the actual shape of a city wall, with many warriors on it, trying to stop the beasts’ attacks. At the same time, a part of the group of beasts cleverly went around this false “city wall” to find the real entrance.</p>
 <p>Seeing that some of the beasts had found the right way and were wreaking havoc among the crowd, Gu Lingzhi gave up her position at the city wall and lithely leaped to the ground, in which she began stabbing the beasts to death. Not long after, her emerald green skirt was speckled with blood.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan killed the beast that was not far from Gu Lingzhi, while trying to recall the familiar aura that he felt whilst killing the beast.</p>
 <p>They had not been in the Lost Lands for very long and there were only a few people he came in contact with. However, he still was not able to find anything similar to that aura.</p>
 <p>"This group of bastards, aren’t they low in intelligence? How did they become so smart? They can even tell that these walls are fake!” Jiang Xinghai cursed and turned to look at Rong Yuan, "Seventh Brother, the spiritual energy in the spirit stone that you gave me has run out."</p>
 <p>Without another word, Rong Yuan grabbed a high-grade spirit stone from the Storage Ring and stuffed it into Jiang Xinghai's hands. Jiang Xinghai took it with a smile, and as he turned to face the beasts, the smile in his eyes turned cold, with the intention to kill. His control of spiritual power was not as precise as that of Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan’s. Every spiritual attack he made resulted in a huge waste of it. Without any supplementation of spiritual power, only the high-grade spirit stone could keep up with his rate of spiritual power consumption.</p>
 <p>With the high-grade spirit stone as a support, Jiang Xinghai freely used the spiritual power, and in a moment, his Steel Pen became a "Fire Pen", burning a group of beasts who were screaming. It also shot out growing roots of different plants, entangling the surrounding beasts. The people around Jiang Xinghai were envious, as they watched him attack the beasts skilfully and easily.</p>
 <p><em>Why did they not have such luck, to meet a friend who was willing to give them spiritual energy as well? It would definitely be much easier to deal with beasts using spiritual power!</em></p>
 <p>Rong Yuan however, had been shocked by one of Jiang Xinghai's previous sentences.</p>
 <p>Thanks to Jiang Xinghai, he finally managed to recall where he had experienced that aura<em>. Wasn't that the breath of the Female Worm who was wrecking chaos in the Spirit City?</em> It was only that this time the breath was much weaker than that in the Spirit City, so he was not able to recall it at that moment.</p>
 <p><em>There were in fact, many clones of the Mother Worm!</em></p>
 <p>Recognising this only made Rong Yuan's heart sink deeper. <em>With one, it could already cause such a huge disturbance. If there were a few more, wouldn't it be a huge mess?</em></p>
 <p>No - because it was already a huge mess now.</p>
 <p>The Crescent Moon City had been destroyed and the Burnt City was half destroyed, so they had to stand firm. They had not even reached the Spirit City yet, but the beasts were already fixated on them. What did the Mother Worm behind these beasts really want to do? Did it really want to kill all the humans from the Lost Lands?</p>
 <p>"I can’t do it, I really can't kill anymore..." A warrior not far from Rong Yuan let out a bitter laugh.</p>
 <p>The continuous journey had brought him such hardship and having encountered and attacked by beasts, he was already at his limit, from surviving up until now.</p>
