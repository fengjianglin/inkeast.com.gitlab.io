 <p>Gu Lingzhi took almost an hour to absorb all the Enlightenment Fragments. At the same time, she felt a strong wave of repulsion emanating from her body.</p>
 <p>The repulsion force expelled her from the Cangwu Realm.</p>
 <p>“When you are outside you have to be careful not to accidentally reveal your identity. Also, be wary of anyone whose surname is Pan. They are Pan Luo’s eyes and ears in the Tianyuan Continent.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you for your reminders, I understand.”</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, Gu Lingzhi felt a sense of weightlessness before she landed on the Thousand Mountains Range. Before she could make sense of where she had fallen, she could hear the sound of fighting.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi sat up in shock and immediately tried to restrain the spiritual energy that was emanating from her body. She tried to blend in with the trees so that she could leave this place easily, but she did not expect to hear Tianfeng Wei’s voice, “Tianfeng Jin, are you really going to kill me? We are from the same clan!”</p>
 <p>“A person like you isn’t fit to be in our clan!” Tianfeng Jin exclaimed angrily, her voice colder than usual.</p>
 <p>“Tianfeng Jin!” Tianfeng Wei cried out in pain, as if she was physically hurt, “If you kill me, my father will never forgive you!”</p>
 <p>“You should be praying that nothing has happened to Gu Lingzhi now. If something happens to her, do you really think our clan can still survive?”</p>
 <p>“Without a doubt! She is a nobody, do you really think that the Third Prince would start a war with the Four Great Clans just because of her? Even if he was the Third Prince, he wouldn’t be able to bear the consequences!”</p>
 <p>“You really don’t know your limits, do you?” Tianfeng Jin no longer bothered to argue with Tianfeng Wei.</p>
 <p>In the past, Tianfeng Jin had always restrained herself on the basis that she had been in the same clan as Tianfeng Wei. No matter what Tianfeng Wei did, Tianfeng Jin kept her mouth shut. This time, however, Tianfeng Wei had actually conspired with the Beicheng Clan to summon the Five Calamities Formation, and this had put the people who had followed Tianfeng Wei into the Cangwu Realm at the risk of dying.</p>
 <p>If it was not for Gu Lingzhi’s breakthrough that caused a Spiritual Energy Surge, the formation would not have been broken. There was a possibility that they would have died in the Cangwu Realm without ever getting out. Some of her clan members who were unable to hold on had also died in there. This made Tianfeng Jin furious.</p>
 <p>It was impossible for Tianfeng Wei to deceive so many of her clan members into conspiring with the Beicheng Clan. <em>Who knew how many powerful Tianfeng Clan members had a say in this? Was it really worth sacrificing her own clan members just to achieve their goal?</em></p>
 <p>Tianfeng Jin even considered leaving her clan. <em>If she were to kill Tianfeng Wei now, she could avenge her clan members who had died a wrongful death!</em></p>
 <p>Tianfeng Wei was not in a good condition right now, not that she had ever been strong enough to fight against Tianfeng Jin, but now she was pregnant too so her powers were even weaker than usual. She could only try her best to escape, hoping that her words could convince Tianfeng Jin to let her go.</p>
 <p>However, Tianfeng Jin refused to let her go after they had bumped into each other in the Thousand Mountains Range. It made no difference whether Tianfeng Wei had praised her or criticized her.</p>
 <p>“Tianfeng Jin, think carefully, no matter how good Gu Lingzhi treats you, she’s still an outsider. When you are met with trouble, you still have to rely on your clan to help you, will Gu Lingzhi help you? Why are you being such a fool?”</p>
 <p>“You are the fool!” Tianfeng Jin retorted coldly, “You don’t even know what mistakes you’ve made, no wonder the Third Prince dumped you.”</p>
 <p>This had touched Tianfeng Wei’s sore spot which caused her to momentarily disregard the danger that she was in. “If the Third Prince does not want me, that is his loss. Gu Lingzhi is just an illegitimate child, how noble can she be? One day, she’ll become just like her mother and cheat on him!”</p>
 <p>“I don’t know about the Third Prince, but I know that you like to accuse others without knowing the truth. Your mother has raised you so well!” Tianfeng Jin remarked sarcastically.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi finally stepped out of the trees, causing Tianfeng Jin’s heave a long sigh of relief. Tianfeng Wei’s face turned as white as a ghost and cried in surprise, “That’s impossible! Weren’t you swept away by the Spiritual Energy Surge? How are you still alive?”</p>
 <p>“I guess it’s just not my turn to die yet, I’m sorry I have disappointed you,” Gu Lingzhi apologized in a sarcastic tone.</p>
 <p>A hint of delight flashed past Tianfeng Wei’s eyes for a moment. Her cultivation level was that of a middle-grade Martial Practitioner, whereas Gu Lingzhi had only just become a Martial Practitioner. Even if Gu Lingzhi was talented, there was no time for her to stabilize her foundations. This was Tianfeng Wei’s opportunity to strike and get rid of Gu Lingzhi once and for all.</p>
 <p>Using her right hand, Tianfeng Wei lunged towards Gu Lingzhi with a sword, hoping that Gu Lingzhi would be too weak to block the hit due to her injuries.</p>
 <p>“Not bad!” Gu Lingzhi merely laughed blandly. She took out her Qingfeng Sword from its sheath.</p>
 <p>Indeed, it had not been long since her breakthrough to become a Martial Practitioner and did not have enough time for her foundations to be stabilized. However, her cultivation level was that of a Peak Level Martial Practitioner! Even if she could not control her sudden increase in cultivation, she had fighting experience and knew Heaven-Level techniques. It was not difficult for her to beat Tianfeng Wei at all.</p>
 <p>The weapons connected with each other, creating a string of sparks. Tianfeng Wei stumbled slightly due to the force and looked at Gu Lingzhi with a bewildered expression.</p>
 <p>“How…how were you able to block my attack?”</p>
 <p>Tianfeng Jin did not wait for Tianfeng Wei to recover from her shock before attacking her from the back. Tianfeng Jin used her golden spiritual energy to pierce through Tianfeng Wei’s right shoulder, causing her to lose a big part of her fighting abilities.</p>
 <p>“There’s nothing that isn’t possible.” <em>She has even rebirthed, was there anything that was truly impossible?</em></p>
 <p>Teaming up together, it took less than a minute to capture Tianfeng Wei alive. Holding up the blade of the Spiritual Sword against Tianfeng Wei’s neck, Tianfeng Jin asked Gu Lingzhi, “How are you planning to deal with her?”</p>
 <p>At the heart of this matter, the whole Cangwu Realm incident had happened because Tianfeng Wei had wanted to get rid of Gu Lingzhi. As such, Gu Lingzhi had the right of deciding how to deal with Tianfeng Wei.</p>
 <p>“No matter what, she is still the First Mistress of your Tianfeng Clan. Let’s go back first, and let the elders of the Gu Clan and Qin Clan decide what to do with her,” Gu Lingzhi remarked as she kept her sword. She did not bring up the point of how it was impossible for Tianfeng Wei to have plotted this whole plan by herself. If she killed Tianfeng Wei now, no one would know more people had been involved and it would be too unfair to those who had died in the Cangwu Realm.</p>
 <p>Tianfeng Jin could guess a little bit of Gu Lingzhi’s thoughts, she opened her mouth but decided not to speak. Though she was sorely disappointed in her clan’s actions, they did provide her with resources and raise her for her entire life. After struggling internally for a while, she could only sigh and say, “Alright, we’ll do whatever you say.”</p>
 <p>Understanding Tianfeng Jin’s dilemmas, Gu Lingzhi gave her a pat on the back and comforted her, “Don’t worry, there were only a few people involved in the decision-making. It will not affect those clan members who were innocent.”</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Rong Yuan felt like he was going crazy.</p>
 <p>It was rare that he had a chance to train, and yet when he did, so many events had occurred.</p>
 <p>The Five Calamities Formation, the Spiritual Energy Surge and not knowing whether Gu Lingzhi was alive. Never having known what suffering feels like, the Third Prince finally had a taste of it. The fear and pain of not knowing constricted him. Whether or not his life would become a living hell depended on whether Gu Lingzhi was still alive.</p>
 <p>Half a day had passed and there was still no news of Gu Lingzhi. He was on the brink of using his authority as the Prince to get the Kingdom’s Demigods to charge into the Cangwu Realm.</p>
 <p>“Your Highness, please do not be too anxious. Lady Gu is a very fortunate person, I’m sure she is alright,” Yuan Zheng repeatedly tried to comfort Rong Yuan, but even he did not entirely believe his own words.</p>
 <p>Legends had said that no one had ever survived after being drawn into a Spiritual Energy Surge. He prayed that Gu Lingzhi had been expelled from the Surge like the rest and hoped that the heavens had heard his prayers.</p>
 <p>“When we find Gu Lingzhi, I will make the Tianfeng Clan and Beicheng Clan pay for what they’ve done!” Rong Yuan exclaimed, furious. If it was not for the two clans making the Five Calamities Formation, Gu Lingzhi would not have experienced a breakthrough that led to the Spiritual Energy Surge.</p>
 <p>“Third Prince, do not be too worried, I’m sure Lingzhi is fine,” Qin Xinran coaxed. She had been searching for Gu Lingzhi with the Third Prince from the beginning. “Before the Surge had reached us, Lingzhi did tell me that she has a way to escape it.”</p>
 <p>“…I hope that’s the case,” Rong Yuan murmured. There were many unusual aspects when it came to Gu Lingzhi, Rong Yuan could only pin his hopes that those secrets that he did not know about would keep her safe.</p>
 <p>If he knew that there would be such a day where he would fear so much over her life, he would have divulged all his secrets to her so that she could better protect herself. <em>Since he has already devoted himself to her, what was there that he could not share with her?</em></p>
 <p>“Look, Your Highness!” Yuan Zheng gasped in delight, pointing to the trees in the distance. “That cloth looks like what Lady Gu had been wearing before she entered the Cangwu Realm.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan turned his head abruptly and made his way to the forest as fast as he could, picking up the green cloth that had been hanging on one of the branches.</p>
 <p>From the dark green threads and green peonies on the piece of cloth, it was indeed what Gu Lingzhi had been wearing.</p>
 <p>“It is hers! This was from her clothes!” Rong Yuan confirmed, keeping his hopes up.</p>
 <p><em>It is true that one could do anything for the person they loved.</em></p>
 <p>Rong Yuan had experienced a roller coaster of emotions in just one day, he felt that he would never come across a day where he would feel more sorrow than he did today. He swore to himself that he would marry her as soon as he found her.</p>
 <p><em>Who cares whether she is of age?</em> In the Xia Kingdom, the rules were determined by the Royal Family anyway.</p>
