<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>The other mercenaries who had narrowly escaped death realized that this weapon that had looked unassuming, was actually rather formidable. When they sent the dead body of the demon beast back to the Mercenary Guild, they all headed back to the store to purchase the same weapon.</p>
 <p>When mercenaries from the other squadrons had heard about this, they rushed to the Store of Many Treasures as well, wanting to purchase the weapon. A pity that it had all been sold out.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was not particularly surprised when she heard the news from Qin Boyu. After all, she had made the weapons herself, so she knew how powerful they were. However, Rong Yuan, who was standing behind her, gave a different reaction. When he heard that her weapons were so popular, he flashed an extremely proud smile which had caused the ladies who were walking by to feel bedazzled.</p>
 <p>Before the ladies could even think of joining in the commotion, Yuan Zheng immediately glared at them, preventing them from coming any closer.</p>
 <p>“Lady Hei, would you be willing to work with my store over a longer period of time and provide us with more weapons with special functions?” Qin Boyu was indeed an experienced man when it came to weapons, immediately sensing that Gu Lingzhi’s lower grade weapons were different from the others.</p>
 <p>The Spirit Tribe once ruled over the whole of the Tianyuan Continent, of course the weapons that were made from their methods were exceptional. Her weapon enabled a Martial Student to use skills that only Martial Practitioners could, but that was just one method of forgery that she had learnt. If she continued to progress in learning more advanced methods of making weapons, then those weapons would be even more helpful in enabling Martial Artists in using abilities surpassing those of their rank.</p>
 <p>“From what I know, your store is selling the weapons at a much higher retail price than what you are paying her. That’s not very fair,” Rong Yuan lamented even before Gu Lingzhi could reply. “If you want to work long-term with her, the minimum price per weapon is a thousand spirit stones. The weapons that Xiao Hei makes are definitely worth more than what you are paying her.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi immediately shut her mouth. She was not too sure about the prices of Spiritual Weapons, and when it came to business, she was even more clueless. Now that someone was willing to help her bargain for a higher price, she would not be a fool and decline the offer. She kept quiet and watched as Rong Yuan helped her bargain for the best price.</p>
 <p>Qin Boyu pursed his lips. <em>As the Third Prince, he was already a part of the Royal Family, why did he even bother to bargain? Where was his dignity?</em></p>
 <p>However, after hearing some rumors about Gu Lingzhi previously, Qin Boyu also had a better impression of Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>Observing how the Third Prince was acting, there was a very big possibility that this lady that had appeared from nowhere would eventually become a Royal Consort of the Third Prince. If Qin Boyu could foster connections with the future Royal Consort, then it would be extremely beneficial for his store. Even without the Third Prince in the picture, Gu Lingzhi’s natural talent for forging weapons was enough for him.</p>
 <p>He smiled warmly and replied, “You are right, Your Highness. I came specially to talk about this matter. If Lady Hei is willing, our Store of Many Treasures is willing to buy every one of her low grade Yellow-Level weapons at two thousand stones each.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan raised his eyebrows and smiled intriguingly. <em>This Qin Boyu was smart after all.</em></p>
 <p>A thousand spirit stones was indeed a rather low price. However, two thousand spirit stones was definitely a good price. The Third Prince had originally only wanted to help Gu Lingzhi bargain for a better price, he did not think that Qin Boyu would actually agree to his proposition. He turned back to smile at Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Hei, what do you think of this offer?”</p>
 <p>“I’m very satisfied,” Gu Lingzhi replied sincerely. This offer matched the price of some diddle grade Yellow-Level Spiritual Weapons, such as… the Recording Crystal.</p>
 <p>This train of thought led Gu Lingzhi to take out a Recording Crystal that she had made out of her Storage Ring. When she showed it to Qin Boyu, who looked astonished at the appearance of the Crystal, she asked blandly, “By any chance, do you want any Recording Crystals? I have some here that I made myself.”</p>
 <p>Qin Boyu looked at the strange shape in her hands. Other than the colour, it looked nothing like a Recording Crystal. He hesitated for a while before asking, “That’s a Recording Crystal?” If Gu Lingzhi had not explained to him what it was, he would not be able to guess that it was a Recording Crystal.</p>
 <p>“Yes,” Gu Lingzhi blinked. Though her Recording Crystal may look very different from the others, but there was a vague resemblance.</p>
 <p>“Don’t judge the appearance of the Crystal, its functionality is better than other Recording Crystals out there,” Gu Lingzhi commented proudly.</p>
 <p>Suspiciously, Qin Boyu took the Crystal in his hands and activated it, recording the surroundings and replaying the video. Indeed, it was like what Gu Lingzhi had said, it was better than other Recording Crystals even though it did look a little strange. If one were to disregard the appearance, the quality of the crystal was definitely of a superior quality.</p>
 <p>After thinking about it, he quoted her an offer of two thousand spirit stones.</p>
 <p>“If Lady Hei’s remaining Recording Crystals are of this quality, I am willing to buy all of them at two thousand spirit stones each.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi smiled satisfactorily, “Don’t worry, the quality of these Crystals will only get better and better.”</p>
 <p>She took out twenty more Recording Crystals, all unassuming and equally strange-looking. Qin Boyu racked his brains for something to say, before he settled for a compliment that sounded very forceful, “Lady Hei’s methods of forging weapons are indeed very special.”</p>
 <p>“You are too kind with your words,” Gu Lingzhi responded quickly.</p>
 <p>After Qin Boyu left, Gu Lingzhi resolutely walked towards the Town of the Brave, not forgetting her original goal. The two men behind her, Rong Yuan and Yuan Zheng, however, both held differing expressions on their face.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan’s acted normally as he was used to seeing Gu Lingzhi’s out-of-the-ordinary molding techniques the past few days. On the other hand, Yuan Zheng’s face had twitched the first time Gu Lingzhi took out her Recording Crystal. When she took out all twenty OF THEM, Yuan Zheng became rather amused. He whispered to Rong Yuan, “Your Highness, Lady Xiao Hei’s weapon forging techniques are rather special. If there comes the day where she wants to make a weapon for you, would you use it?”</p>
 <p>In a blink of an eye, Rong Yuan’s smile disappeared.</p>
 <p>This was indeed a very difficult question.</p>
