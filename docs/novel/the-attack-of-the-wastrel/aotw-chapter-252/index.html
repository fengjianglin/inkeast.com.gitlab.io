 <p>“What did he burn?” Mei Ying asked stupidly.</p>
 <p>As Pan Wuyang moved too fast, he did not have any time to stop his opponent’s move. He could only watch as Pan Wuyang burned the letters, his heart filled with doubts.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan raised his eyebrow. His face showed no sign of anger as one who had his important evidence taken away. He even seemed a little relaxed and said, “Of course it's some unscrupulous acts.”</p>
 <p>“Nonsense! My Uncle is a Demigod. What’s in there that could be immoral?” When Rong Yuan pulled out that stack of letters, Pan En was scared to death. Upon seeing the letters being destroyed, he immediately pointed at Rong Yuan indignantly. He secretly rejoiced upon witnessing Rong Yuan’s recklessness. <em>How dare he pull out the evidence for confrontation in front of a Demigod? Was he being naive or ignorant?</em></p>
 <p>It’s just that Rong Yuan’s reaction seemed a bit off. <em>Shouldn’t he be frustrated or angry upon seeing someone burning the evidence? How could he still possibly laugh?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>“If one has no wrongdoings, why would he be so anxious to burn the evidence?” Gu Lingzhi mocked.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Zhong Xiru, who was at a corner, seemed to have understood something. He approached the both of them and asked, “What exactly was the content of the letters that Pan Wuyang burned?”</p>
 <p>“If you want to know, just have a look and you’ll understand everything.” With that, Rong Yuan fished out another letter from the Storage Ring while Pan Wuyang and Pan En watched unbelievably. He handed the letter directly to Zhong Xiru while glancing at Pan Wuyang’s direction and reminded him, “Senior, please be careful. Don’t let those with a guilty conscience get hold of it once again.”</p>
 <p>After finishing his sentence, he seemingly pulled out a trick and once again, retrieved a stack of letters from the Storage Ring. Facing a few of the Martial Sages, he announced, “There are still many here. Seniors who wish to take a look, please feel free to do so and find out what exactly the North Qiu Royal Family is planning.”</p>
 <p>Right after he finished hearing the sentence, Mei Ying was the first to obtain a letter from Rong Yuan. A few people then followed suit afterwards. The change of scenario happened too fast this time. Even if Pan Wuyang was to attack Rong Yuan after recovering from the shock, it would have already been pointless. Zhong Xiru’s eyes turned red after scanning the general content of the letter quickly.</p>
 <p>“I will take vengeance for my disciple today!” Zhong Xiru roared as he attacked with his compass.</p>
 <p>“Brother Zhong, calm down. This evidence must have been planted by a crafty person. You must definitely not be used by them!”</p>
 <p>“Bullshit! You have not even seen the content of the letter, how do you know that they have framed you? Your Pan Family is too vicious!” Zhong Xiru scolded while attacking with his hands. Within a moment, he began to fight Pan Wuyang, leaving no time for any explanation.</p>
 <p>The angered look of Zhong Xiru was like a detonating fuse. In a blink of an eye, the rest of the people who had also read the letters, also looked at the North Qiu Royal Family with fiery gazes.</p>
 <p>What Rong Yuan showed was a few letters that had the same content printed on them. It clearly recorded how Pan Wuyang has been contacting Ding Wei and entrusting him with tasks. He promised numerous benefits as long as the Dayin Kingdom could work with the North Qiu Kingdom on infiltrating the other kingdoms and assisting them to scourge their royal families. Subsequently, when the North Qiu Kingdom had dominated the entire continent, the Dayin Kingdom would be the North Qiu Kingdom’s first affiliated country. They would enjoy an area that was twice as large as their current territory as the two neighbouring kingdoms of the Dayin Kingdom were promised to them.</p>
 <p>With such a generous promise, one need not guess to figure out how the Dayin Kingdom would respond.</p>
 <p>Thinking back to how Pan Wuyang had hurriedly burned the letters, there was no need to question the authenticity of the content.</p>
 <p>As to why Zhong Xiru was so enraged, he had figured out the purpose of the North Qiu Kingdom opening the Secret Territory. What else could be more attractive to Martial Artists than the birth of a large mysterious Secret Territory that held countless treasures?</p>
 <p>As long as the North Qiu Royal Family set up traps in advance, even if a large number of Martial Artists were to disappear, other people would at most assume that they were unlucky and had accidentally triggered the Restrictive Shields in the Secret Territory, killing them. It was unexpected for someone to actually invest such a large capital for this.</p>
 <p>As the most noble family in the North Qiu Kingdom, they were indeed full of schemes. He could not help but mourn for his dead disciple.</p>
 <p>Zhong Xiru could only think of killing Pan Wuyang who had cheated him into entering the Secret Territory. <em>If not for a promise made that he would let himself select the treasures in the Secret Territory, how would he be here? And if he had not come, how would the two disciples who studied the spell secretly, followed along? All of this was Pan Wuyang’s fault!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Along with the angered crowd, Pan Wuyang was not happy either. How could he possibly know that Rong Yuan had hid a few copies in his hand in addition to the stack of letters? But he clearly remembered that he had only written three of the secret letters containing a special logo to Ding Wei…</p>
 <p><em>Wait, if he only wrote three of those letters to Ding Wei, how was it possible that Rong Yuan took out so many?</em></p>
 <p>Instantly, Pan Wuyang knew that he had fallen into a trap. His eyes glanced furiously at Rong Yuan. If only he had not chosen such a time to bring out the stack of letters and also wanting to read them out on the spot, he would not have been muddled to snatch the letters and burn them. It had now put him in a situation where he would not be able to explain and justify himself.</p>
 <p>At this step, even if he were to play the death card, everyone would think that he did it for the sake of getting himself out of trouble.</p>
 <p>Thinking of this caused Pan Wuyang’s resentment towards Rong Yuan to reach an apex. Despite battling with Zhong Xiru, he shot a full blow at Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>Since he was no longer able to turn the situation around, he should at least pull the culprit down with him!</p>
 <p>“Rong Yuan… ”</p>
 <p>“Rong Yuan!” Gu Lingzhi exclaimed. Immediately, she wanted to control the Restrictive Shield and transport Rong Yuan to a safe place despite risking the exposure of her identity. However, Hua Qingcheng’s reaction was faster than hers and when Pan Wuyang attacked, he completely disregarded his own safety and charged towards it with his sword.</p>
 <p>Hua Qingcheng spurted out blood as his body flew for several meters before falling heavily onto the ground.</p>
 <p>“Senior Hua!” Gu Lingzhi cried while rushing hurriedly to check his injury.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Mei Ying and Su Ruo appeared beside Rong Yuan, guarding him from left to right. When Gu Lingzhi had given Su Ruo the Accelerating Advancement Pill, both Mei Ying and Su Ruo had already regarded Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan as their own daughter and son-in-law. Even though both of them separated afterwards, they simply regretted that the pair did not end up together.</p>
 <p>Seeing how someone wanted to harm Rong Yuan, they naturally would not let it happen.</p>
 <p>“Su Ruo, you stay here and look after Rong Yuan while I go and teach Pan Wuyang a lesson. Did he really think that the Pan Family owns the whole continent? He still dared to kill someone in front of so many people!”</p>
 <p>“Go,” Su Ruo nodded. If not for Pan Wuyang’s sudden attack on Rong Yuan, the couple would have already besieged and attacked.</p>
 <p>When Mei Ying formed a defense tactic with several other Demigods and surrounded Pan Wuyang, Su Ruo then noticed a Ding Rou with shocked expression standing beside her. She was then reminded that not just Gu Lingzhi cried out when Pan Wuyang attacked Rong Yuan, but also the sound of a weaker girl calling Rong Yuan’s name.</p>
 <p>“You…Rong Yuan…Why are you here? No, you are not Rong Yuan, who are you?” Ding Rou looked in surprise at Rong Yuan who was behind Su Ruo before looking at the figure beside her. The “Rong Yuan” that she held hands with has now caused her to be dazed and confused.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan was clearly by her side and had not left at all for the past few days. <em>Who exactly was this?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>When she was coaxed by “Rong Yuan” to come here, she felt that the voice speaking in front of the crowd seemed similar to Rong Yuan’s. Before she could understand what was going on, she saw Zhong Xiru and Pan Wuyang fighting in mid-air. Anxious to squeeze forward and see what was going on, the scene that unfolded before her eyes shocked her completely. Her heart felt a fright that she has never experienced before. She could not help but withdraw her hand that was holding “Rong Yuan”’s.</p>
 <p>However, the person next to her did not give her the opportunity to. Once he sensed the abnormality, he tightened his grip on her and lowered his head to whisper, “What’s wrong, Xiao Rou? Don’t you recognise me?”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing this sentence, Ding Rou’s flustered heart settled slightly.<em>&nbsp;Yes, Rong Yuan had been by her side all along. The person misleading people with heresy and provoking the relationship between the civilians and the North Qiu royal family, can never be Rong Yuan. Gu Lingzhi must have known that she was unable to take back Rong Yuan from her and thus, found a lookalike. It must be the case!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>When he saw that there were two of Rong Yuan, Ding Wei was also shocked and soon like Ding Rou, thought that the Rong Yuan beside Gu Lingzhi was fake.</p>
 <p>Ever since “Rong Yuan” could not stand the temptation and became a spouse to his younger sister, the two had never been separated. There was simply no possibility of having an impersonation. The one in front must definitely be a fake!</p>
 <p>Thinking of the vague sound from before, Ding Wei sneered and looked at Rong Yuan before speaking in a loud voice, “Who are you? You liar, why did you pretend to be Rong Yuan and slander the Dayin and North Qiu Kingdom?”</p>
 <p>The sound Ding Wei made was condensed by spiritual power and led everyone present to hear it loud and clear. Instantly, some of the people that had already begun fighting, turned unconsciously towards Ding Wei.</p>
 <p>One look and they could see the “Rong Yuan” beside Ding Rou as well as the Rong Yuan who was standing behind Su Ruo calmly.</p>
 <p><em>This…how could there be two of the Xia Kingdom’s Third Prince?</em> Everyone was flabbergasted.</p>
 <p>Seeing how his voice had an impact, Ding Wei turned to the Demigods that had besieged Pan Wuyang and said, “Seniors, do not be deceived by this villain. He is not Rong Yuan and thus, his words hold no meaning!”</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this opportunity, Pan Wuyang immediately said, “Stop! You have really wronged me!”</p>
 <p>Even though he had no clue as to why there were two of Rong Yuan, this was definitely a good chance to turn the situation around. If he could prove that the Rong Yuan from before was fake, then the evidence that he provided would be a complete joke!</p>
