 <p>“What? She is still alive?” Lu Heng gasped and his mouth fell open. He completely forgot about the insults Rong Yuan had made to him.</p>
 <p>It was already shocking that Rong Yuan had made it out alive. How did two people survive? After so many years, this was the first time someone had emerged from the outside world alive.</p>
 <p>At that point, Rong Yuan could not be bothered with scolding Lu Heng anymore and he directly snapped, “Of course.” His eyes remained focused on Gu Lingzhi’s face as he placed his fingers on her wrist to feel her pulse.</p>
 <p>Instantly, Rong Yuan frowned deeply.</p>
 <p><em>He could not use his spiritual energy at all!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>From the moment he dropped into Endless Sea Realm, he could not summon any of the spiritual energy in his body. He was a regular person then and if he could not use his spiritual energy, he could not check how Gu Lingzhi was. Lowering his head, Rong Yuan placed his forehead against Gu Lingzhi’s and sensed her temperature.</p>
 <p>Lu Heng cut in, “Brother, your wife does not seem to be well. I know a good doctor in the city, you can bring her there.”</p>
 <p>This finally got Rong Yuan’s attention and he stared at Lu Heng like he was an idiot. Without thinking twice, Rong Yuan reached into his Storage Ring and retrieved a Spiritual Medicine for Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>Lu Heng’s eyes bulged wide open in shock.</p>
 <p><em>Was that the rumored Spiritual Medicine?</em></p>
 <p>Spiritual Medicine was rare in the depths of the Endless Sea Realm and it was also hard to gather spiritual energy. Only a thin layer of spiritual energy existed in the main city, the Spirit City. Cultivation was a futile dream for many people there, not to mention Spiritual Medicine made by Alchemists. The entire Lost Lands only had one Alchemist.</p>
 <p>However, Rong Yuan had not thought twice when he gave Spiritual Medicine to his wife and Lu Heng twitched his lips and frowned at Rong Yuan’s ‘wastefulness’.</p>
 <p>In the Lost Lands with only one Alchemist, Spiritual Medicine was exceptionally rare.</p>
 <p>Although these thoughts crossed Lu Heng’s mind, he maintained a bright smile on his face. After all, this was a person from the outside world and he must have many valuable items with him. In an unfamiliar territory, Lu Heng might be able to trick the unsuspecting Rong Yuan in front of him to give him a few Spiritual Medicines.</p>
 <p>Greedy thoughts passed through Lu Heng’s mind. At that point, color returned to Gu Lingzhi’s face after consuming the Spiritual Medicine. Her breaths also became stronger and under Rong Yuan’s soft calling, she slowly regained her consciousness.</p>
 <p>“Rong Yuan…” Gu Lingzhi blinked and she thought she was dreaming when she saw Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p><em>Did she not drop into the Endless Sea Realm? Why was she looking at Rong Yuan now? Was it true that one’s lifetime would flash before her eyes before she died?</em> Gu Lingzhi stared at Rong Yuan carefully and tried to remember every single detail of his face so that she could find him again even in death.</p>
 <p>The image of Rong Yuan before her did not disappear and it started to feel more realistic. The warmth and strength of his arms around her made it impossible for him to be an illusion.</p>
 <p><em>Could she feel him right before death?</em> Gu Lingzhi wondered to herself and she laughed. Who cares? She felt blissful that she saw him one last time before death.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan saw Gu Lingzhi in a dreamy state before she broke out into a silly smile as she stared at him. She mumbled to herself and leaned her head against his chest.</p>
 <p>Did the water in Endless Sea Realm wreck her brain?</p>
 <p>This scary thought formed in Rong Yuan’s mind and he pushed Gu Lingzhi away slightly before he carefully examined her again.</p>
 <p>However the moment he pushed her away slightly, Gu Lingzhi pouted and scolded Rong Yuan, “Why is an illusion so strong?”</p>
 <p><em>Illusion?</em> Rong Yuan realized why Gu Lingzhi reacted the way she did. A smile played at the corner of his lips and he crashed his lips down onto hers disregarding the gaping looks on the onlookers nearby.</p>
 <p>At first, Gu Lingzhi was still stuck with the thought that the illusion was very real. However, Rong Yuan’s fierce kiss against her left her breathless and she finally came to realize…</p>
 <p><em>This was not an illusion, it was real!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>As she came to her senses, Gu Lingzhi immediately pushed Rong Yuan away and took a close look at her surroundings. The sky above her was the color of the water in Endless Sea Realm and she was so shocked, she was at a loss for words.</p>
 <p>The world below the Endless Sea Realm was completely different from what she expected and it was only natural that she thought she was in an illusion. The entire world was filled with a deep blue color and even the ground below her was shades of blue. Turning around, Gu Lingzhi observed the men dressed in animal skin clothing around her. Even the poorest men in the continent would not dress like that…</p>
 <p>“Where… Where is this?” As soon as she came to her senses, Gu Lingzhi hesitantly asked.</p>
 <p>At that point, Rong Yuan turned towards Lu Heng. From the moment he woke up till then, he had focused all his attention on Gu Lingzhi and had not cared about his surroundings at all. Now that Gu Lingzhi questioned him, he realized the oddness of the place.</p>
 <p><em>Great, the man finally realized his presence!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>The moment he got Rong Yuan’s attention, Lu Heng brightened with joy. He thought he was going to be ignored forever. By then, other groups had noticed the commotion and were gathering over. Lu Heng put on his brightest smile and extended an arm towards Rong Yuan, “Welcome to the Lost Lands that were abandoned by the Tianyuan Continent. I am the vice-captain of the Langya Troop, Lu Heng and these are the members of my group. How about you let us explain to you what happened to the Lost Lands? This is not a good place to talk.”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, Lu Heng stared down at his feet.</p>
 <p>Following his gaze, Rong Yuan noticed the heap of items piled up below him. He and Gu Lingzhi were lying on the heap of items and Rong Yuan’s face instantly blackened. Rong Yuan jumped to his feet like a bullet and pulled Gu Lingzhi up into his arms.</p>
 <p>How could he let Gu Lingzhi lie in such a dirty place? A disgusted expression crossed Rong Yuan’s eyes and Gu Lingzhi laughed lightly. Brushing a finger across Rong Yuan’s cheek, Gu Lingzhi said, “Let me down. I still have my legs and I can walk.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan twisted his face and scowled, “It is dirty, I should just carry you.”</p>
 <p>The men who watched this exchange were offended and they felt as though they had been forced to eat shit.</p>
 <p>Out of the corner of his eye, Lu Heng saw men from other camps approaching them. Without wasting another second, Lu Heng cut the couple short and instructed, “Please follow me, I will explain the situation to you.”</p>
 <p>After a long while, Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan finally understood what was happening.</p>
 <p>The Lost Lands was a small world below the massive Endless Sea Realm. The pile of items that they had landed on was known as the Smelt Mountain and it was the only pathway leading to the outside world.</p>
 <p>According to Lu Heng, every person in Lost Lands came from the Tianyuan Continent. However, a large meteor had appeared out of the blue one day and smashed onto the ground, forcing everyone below the ground. More than half of the population died and only Martial Artists survived. These men struggled to live by under the ground covered by the meteorite.</p>
 <p>It was only one day when a group of Martial Artists from unknown origins arrived in the world and used a mysterious force to open a small world that allowed the men there to live properly. This group of Martial Artists created a city in the center of the Lost Lands and called it the Spirit City.</p>
 <p>Numerous years passed and the Lost Lands had changed drastically.</p>
 <p>Spirit City was the main city of the Lost Lands but the group of Martial Artists that first created it had died many years ago. As time passed, the spiritual energy in the small world thinned and only a thin layer of spiritual energy filled the air. This spiritual energy decreased day by day and it would one day disappear from the Lost Lands.</p>
 <p>The Smelt Mountain, as the only pathway to the outside world was the only natural resource sustaining it.</p>
 <p>The Martial Artists who first created the Lost Lands knew that their days were limited and used their last remaining spiritual energy to create a pathway to the outside world. Four small arrays were positioned around the massive array in the Endless Sea Realm and they led to the small world. These arrays allowed the small world to transform and shift in accordance to the Endless Sea Realm array, thus sustaining it. Hence, anything that entered the Endless Sea Realm would also enter the Lost Lands and this was the reason why the Smelt Mountain was created.</p>
 <p>This was also the reason why the Endless Sea Realm remained so clean even after so many years.</p>
 <p>“Have you guys never thought of returning to the continent?” Once she learned the history of the Lost Lands, Gu Lingzhi could not help asking. Since a small world could survive under the Endless Sea Realm, it should be easy to return to the continent. Why did they choose to live at the bottom?</p>
