 <p>“Mm, indeed.” Rong Yuan nodded in agreement. “That’s why if Mayor Zang has any thoughts, feel free to say it. I am ready to listen.”</p>
 <p>Zang Guangping once again got pissed by Rong Yuan’s nonchalant tone. Smartly, Yuan Zheng moved a stool from a pavilion nearby and placed it in front of Zang Guangping, gesturing for him to sit, “Mayor Zang, if you have anything you can discuss it here. Both the Highnesses are feeling tired.”</p>
 <p>Knowing that Rong Yuan was not going to follow him to the study, Zang Guangping gritted his teeth as he sat on the stool Yuan Zheng brought, his chest filled with frustration. Controlling his temper, he spoke a few courteous sentences to Rong Yuan and instructed his own confidante to leave. He then went straight to the main point, “Your Highness, I know that your trip here is because the King of Feng Kingdom requested for you to take over the military matters of Sangbo Town. But the Dayin Kingdom is about to start attacking us and the one leading them is not only their prince, but there is also a very experienced old general with them. Although you are extremely talented and have reached the Martial Sage rank at such a young age, having talent and having the ability to go to war are two very different issues. If you are to be the commander, I am afraid…that the soldiers will not be happy…”</p>
 <p><em>Clearly, it wasn’t that the soldiers would be unhappy, but that Mayor Zang was unhappy about his power being stripped away from him.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Rong Yuan held a hint of a smile on his face as he took in his concerns.</p>
 <p>As the first line of defence for the Xia Kingdom, everyone knew how important it was to protect this area. Zang Guangping had been the mayor for ten over years, how could he let an opportunity like this pass? From what he heard on the way here, Zang Guangping was someone with a certain level capabilities. If not, he would not have been able to take charge of the Sangbo Town for so long without any incidents.</p>
 <p>However, these were not the reasons for him to refuse to give control to Rong Yuan. Although Zang Guangping looked respectful on the surface, there was a faint look of scorning in his eyes. Rong Yuan said blandly, “There is no need for you to worry. My father has always trusted me. Could it be that you do not trust my father’s judgement?”</p>
 <p><em>What he meant was that - even the king had no objections, what position was Mayor Zang in to raise any objections of his own?</em></p>
 <p>The expression on Zang Guangping’s face changed as he had a taste of Rong Yuan’s sharp words. From the corners of his eyes, he saw that everyone behind Rong Yuan was giving him an impatient look. He realised that it was not because of the scenery that Rong Yuan wanted to talk here, but it was to show his power. He did not want to continue putting a front as he snorted, “Your Highness, it is like I said, personal talent is not equivalent to leading soldiers to a battle. Maybe you had some experience and that is why the king trusts you, but I cannot hand my troops over to you so easily! I personally groomed my soldiers and they have been with me through thick and thin. I cannot hand them over to someone whom no one knows whether he is capable or not!”</p>
 <p>Zang Guangping’s outburst surprised Rong Yuan. Seeing his determined eyes, and knowing that he spoke what he was truly feeling, the unhappiness he had towards Zang Guangping reduced as he looked at him warmly. No matter what, it was always good to have a leader that looks after his subordinates. However…</p>
 <p>“As what you said, you cannot hand your troops over to someone whose capabilities you are not sure of. Similarly, I cannot hand my brothers over to someone who does not really know the enemy. Since this is the case, then let us lead our own troops separately.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan then turned to Gu Lingzhi and spoke to her softly, indicating that he did not wish to discuss this further.</p>
 <p>Zang Guangping was dumbfounded. <em>What Rong Yuan meant was he did not intend to collaborate with them? Then how was he going to go against the Dayin Kingdom? They had three Martial Sages experts, while on this side, before the Third Prince arrived, they only had one!</em></p>
 <p>But he also knew that it was not reasonable for Rong Yuan to hand his men over. With mutual understanding, he dropped the topic and started to talk about the military might that the Sangbo Town had.</p>
 <p>Since the Sangbo Town was located nearer the border, they always had quite a decent amount of troops stationed here. There was also a Martial Sage expert that set up camp with the military here.</p>
 <p>Originally, there was also only one Martial Sage situated at this border on the Dayin’s side. They both kept each other in check. However, this powerplay had changed with the arrival of Ding Wei. Ding Wei had brought with him two Martial Sages, tripling the military might of the Dayin Kingdom in a flash. It caused the Xia Kingdom to only be able to count on the border guards as well as the troops in the internal city to fight.</p>
 <p>If Rong Yuan did not rush over today, Sangbo Town would have fallen into Dayin’s hands.</p>
 <p>“What about the Martial Sage in Sangbo Town?” Rong Yuan frowned as he questioned.</p>
 <p>It was no wonder something felt off when they arrived. How did the Dayin Kingdom advance so quickly, were their movements really so fast?</p>
 <p>“Sigh…” Zang Guangping’s eyebrows involuntarily creased as he heard Rong Yuan’s question. “Elder Yuan was ambushed by the three Martial Sages a few days ago and is severely injured. He is now recuperating in the back room.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan nodded and turned around to ask Yuan Zheng to take some Spiritual Medicine over to the Martial Sage later on. It was a token of appreciation for fending off Dayin's attacks before they came.</p>
 <p>When someone reached the cultivation of a Martial Sage, they no longer had to be loyal to anyone and could choose to save themselves in times of danger. He could have left and waited until reinforcements arrived. No one would have blamed him if Sangbo Town were to have been lost.</p>
 <p>But that Martial Sage did not choose to do so and was worthy of Rong Yuan’s appreciation.</p>
 <p>After the entire night, Gu Lingzhi and the Silver-Armoured Troops had replenished their energy.</p>
 <p>As the dawn broke through, fighting sounds could be heard. Although the official residence was built in the centre of Sangbo town, they could still hear the chaotic battle cries and feel the waves of spiritual energy reverberating in the air.</p>
 <p>“You’re awake. Do you want to sleep longer?” The minute Gu Lingzhi opened her eyes, Rong Yuan woke up as well. His low and hoarse voice sounded beside Gu Lingzhi’s ear as his hand was draped over her waist in a flirty manner.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was very embarrassed as she asked, “Aren’t you going to take a look?” It sounded like the fight was very intense from the sound of it.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan replied irresponsibly, “We’ll go when you have enough rest.” He then pushed Gu Lingzhi, who was trying to sit up, back down onto the bed.</p>
 <p>“Rest assured, with Yuan Zheng and Hua Qingcheng, the Xia Kingdom’s troops will not lose out.”</p>
 <p>That was true. Hearing that Yuan Zheng and Hua Qingcheng had left, Gu Lingzhi relaxed as she lied back down. Together with Rong Yuan, they then cuddled intimately under the blanket and dawdled for over an hour before getting up to wash up.</p>
 <p>When they reached the city gates, the battle was at its peak. The numerous spiritual energies changed the city gates to become a small scale whirlpool of spiritual energy. In the midst of it all, the Silver-Armoured Troops shuttled back and forth between the two groups in the fight, looking disdainfully at whatever they passed.</p>
 <p>Slightly further away, the four Martial Sages had formed a group.</p>
 <p>Yesterday, Rong Yuan had arrived in a hurry and he only saw the two guards that followed Ding Wei around. Today, he finally saw the Martial Sage that was originally stationed here. He looked like a middle-aged man about forty years of age, with a stiff and plain face. He was carrying an iron rod emitting a black glow as a weapon. Every hit caused sand and rocks to fly up from the ground. Together with Chu Chao and Pang Huan, they surrounded Hua Qingcheng. They chose an area slightly further from the city gates, obviously not intending to let Hua Qingcheng live.</p>
 <p>“Your Highness, you are finally here. If you had come any late, Elder Hua might not be able to make it.”</p>
 <p>Zang Guangping’s annoyed voice floated over. Gu Lingzhi turned her head and saw Pang Huan’s undisguised criticising gaze. It was obvious they were unhappy with their arrival.</p>
 <p>Meeting his gaze, Gu Lingzhi tilted her head somewhat awkwardly as she poked Rong Yuan’s waist from behind her back, signalling for him to go help Hua Qingcheng and not let him suffer.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan grabbed Gu Lingzhi’s prodding hand and laughed, “Mayor Zang, you worry too much. Elder Hua’s ability is much greater than you imagine.”</p>
 <p>He could no longer be bothered by Zang Guangping as he looked calmly at the fight in front of him.</p>
 <p>It was an exchange of Martial Sages and the area was already covered with four domains. From afar, Hua Qingcheng’s unique lotus flower domain was exceptionally dazzling.</p>
 <p>From where Gu Lingzhi was standing, she could not see the situation clearly and could only ask anxiously, “Is Elder Hua okay? Are you really not going to help?”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan placed a kiss on Gu Lingzhi’s head, “If they can defeat him with just the three of them, then he would not be Hua Qingcheng.”</p>
 <p>Zang Guangping was once again enraged by Rong Yuan’s attitude. <em>What situation is it now? How did he still have the mood to stand here and flirt?</em></p>
 <p>“Your Highness, I know that you trust Elder Hua’s abilities, but there is always a possibility of him getting injured. If he were to be injured, it would affect the entire battle.”</p>
 <p>“Mayor Zang, if you are worried, you can go take a look for yourself. I am not going to waste my time.”</p>
 <p><em>How could helping Hua Qingcheng be considered a waste of time?</em> Zang Guangping had not even suppressed his previous anger before Rong Yuan aggravated him even more. He then looked on as Rong Yuan carried Gu Lingzhi and hopped off the city gates, standing in between the two troops fighting against each other.</p>
 <p>“Silver-Armoured Troops, listen up! Our target is the Shixi County, follow me and—” Following Rong Yuan’s sudden shout, the dispersed Silver-Armoured Troops that were fighting the Dayin Kingdom’s troops immediately responded with a shout, “Yes!”</p>
 <p>Their voices caused a vibration as the air over the battle field seemed to solidify. Before the troops from both countries were able to react, Rong Yuan’s wildebeest appeared from nowhere. Bringing Gu Lingzhi, Rong Yuan flipped onto his wildebeest and dashed towards the still shocked troops. He headed straight for the city adjacent to both the Dayin and the Xia Kingdom – the Shixi County.</p>
 <p>The revitalised Silver-Armoured Troops followed closely behind Rong Yuan, abandoning the fight behind them.</p>
 <p>“Rong Yuan, how dare you!” Still leading the troops to attack the Sangbo Town, Ding Wei cracked. He never thought Rong Yuan would give up defending against Dayin’s troops and take the Silver-Armoured Troops towards the Shixi County instead. <em>Why did he never ever follow what they had planned?!</em></p>
