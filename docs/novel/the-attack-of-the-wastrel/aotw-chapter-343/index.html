 <p>Things did not go as Pan Yue’er planned. Gu Lingzhi jumped up and avoided the whip thrown forward by Pan Yue’er. At that moment, a strong wind blew across her and Gu Lingzhi lost her balance mid-air. She stabilized herself and landed two meters away from her original position.</p>
 <p>In normal circumstances, two meters was nothing but this was the Endless Sea Realm! Unfortunately, Gu Lingzhi landed directly above the Endless Sea Realm. In an instant, she felt her body sink and the spiritual energy in her body felt paralyzed. Without any chance to struggle, her body sank towards the depths of the Endless Sea Realm.</p>
 <p>“Lingzhi!” Rong Yuan’s voice cracked as he shouted. He quickened his pace and flew right above the spot in the Endless Sea Realm that Gu Lingzhi fell through.</p>
 <p>“Rong Yuan, Lingzhi...” Mei Ying mumbled to himself as he felt a sense of hopelessness sweep through him. There was no chance to save them. No one had emerged alive after dropping into the Endless Sea Realm.</p>
 <p>The Endless Sea Realm appeared calm and silent even after swallowing the two. This was the most dangerous place in the world where men could be killed without any sound.</p>
 <p>When the Endless Sea Realm that surrounded the continent first appeared, it became the scariest thing on earth. Anyone who stepped into the Endless Sea Realm, regardless of cultivation rank and nature would fall prey to it.</p>
 <p>Many brave men tried to figure out the secret to the Endless Sea Realm, trying to uncover the way the Endless Sea Realm ‘ate’ up men. However, as soon as any part of the body fell above the Endless Sea Realm, they would be sucked into it mercilessly. The Endless Sea Realm was therefore a black hole that swallowed up anything that was alive. Such events happened countless times and the Endless Sea Realm became infamous for its danger. No one tried to test it out anymore.</p>
 <p>Pan Luming had chosen the venue to attack the group and he had not imagined that the Endless Sea Realm would end up swallowing Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>The bottom of the sea was deep and endless and the waters seemed like a different world from the continent. Pan Yue’er instantly regretted her decision and her face turned pale as soon as she thought of the consequences of her action.</p>
 <p>The Spirit Tribe member that finally appeared after countless years had dropped into the Endless Sea Realm. She did not dare to think about how the Deity King would react when he knew about it…</p>
 <p><em>Cold!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>This was Gu Lingzhi’s first reaction when she dropped into the Endless Sea Realm.</p>
 <p>Dark blue water wrapped around her body like uncountable cold needles poking through her body. This was a different feeling from soaking in a hot spring. The cold water numbed the human brain, this was how people died after entering the Endless Sea Realm.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi’s mind spun and dizziness overcame her. All of a sudden, she felt something wrap around her hand.</p>
 <p>Did something live in this ocean?</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi laughed bitterly, she did not think that she would die from a demon in this lifetime. At that point, she prayed that Rong Yuan would not be too upset over her death.</p>
 <p>The coldness numbed Gu Lingzhi’s mind and she completely lost all thoughts, she did not even have the strength to look at what grabbed her arm.</p>
 <p>Wrapping Gu Lingzhi in his arms, Rong Yuan transferred some spiritual energy to her through a mouth-to-mouth, slowly dispelling the coldness in her. He grabbed her by the waist and then proceeded to retrieve a rope from his Storage Ring to bind their legs together.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan stared down below him and took a good look at the bottom of the ocean.</p>
 <p>As expected of the most dangerous thing in the continent, the Endless Sea Realm, even he, as a Demigod, did not have any chance at resisting the gravity that pulled him to the bottom of the ocean. At the moment he entered the sea, he had to muster all the spiritual energy in him to alter his direction of sinking. That was how he managed to grab hold of Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>No one knew where the seawater from the Endless Sea Realm came from but it had incredible suppressive strength. Ninety-nine percent of his spiritual energy was sucked dry and he had to use his remaining spiritual energy to hold himself up and keep his consciousness.</p>
 <p><em>Was the Endless Sea Realm really equivalent to hell on this continent?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Rong Yuan bent his head down and delivered another breath of spiritual energy to Gu Lingzhi before he coldly glanced at his surroundings.</p>
 <p>From the moment they sunk into the Endless Sea Realm, roughly half an hour had passed. Their bodies continued to sink without control to the bottom. Although the sea was deep, it was not dark due to the deep blue waters surrounding them.</p>
 <p><em>What was at the bottom? What made the seawater so blue?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Rong Yuan hesitated and pondered deeply to himself. Gu Lingzhi’s face was turning blue from the lack of air and the cold and Rong Yuan quickly delivered another breath of air to her.</p>
 <p>As a Demigod, he did not have much need for food and oxygen. He could survive without breathing for as long as ten days. However, Gu Lingzhi was different and she would die as a Martial Sage if she did not have oxygen for a few hours.</p>
 <p><em>If they were going to sink all the way, there might be a chance at life at the bottom of the ocean!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>With that thought, Rong Yuan did not waste any energy trying to swim up to the top and he tried to sink as quickly as possible by focusing his spiritual energy to the bottom of his feet.</p>
 <p>Just as his spiritual energy was about to be depleted, Rong Yuan finally saw the massive structure at the bottom of the ocean and it seemed to stretch out over the entire continent. Numerous blue colored rays of light shot out of complicated ancient scripts that lined the ocean floor. The gigantic array that reflected blue light gave the ocean the magnificent blue color.</p>
 <p>Was this the reason why the ocean was so blue? Rong Yuan’s heart sank and disappointment filled him.</p>
 <p>There was no way to leave the Endless Sea Realm. The spiritual energy left in Rong Yuan was only enough to sustain Gu Lingzhi for another hour. Eventually, Gu Lingzhi would die because of the cold or lack of oxygen in her.</p>
 <p>“So be it, at least we will die together.” Rong Yuan thought to himself as he leaned his head against Gu Lingzi. He wrapped his arms tightly around Gu Lingzhi. IF they died like that, at least they could float in the ocean together.</p>
 <p>However, the sea was unusually pristine. The ancient seals were so clean and neat, they looked like polished jade stones. Aside from the array there was nothing in the ocean and it seemed as though someone had cleaned the ocean thoroughly.</p>
 <p>This caused a suspicion to rise in Rong Yuan and all of a sudden, the array below his feet suddenly jerked violently before a strong suction force emerged from afar. Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi were pulled effortlessly……</p>
 <p>“Hey, there are actually two people this time.” On a small mountain junkyard, a short burly man who wore animal skin clothes beamed with joy.</p>
 <p>Beside him, his companion whipped his head over to take a look. Were there two people?</p>
 <p>“Not bad, Lu Heng. With the items on these two people, the strength of our group will certainly increase!”</p>
 <p>“Of course!” Lu Heng grinned widely as he stared at the two people.</p>
 <p>On the small mountain piled with objects, it had been a long time before the corpse of Martial Artists had appeared. Ever since the Endless Sea Realm became known for its danger, it became rare that Martial Artists would risk their lives to go anywhere near the Endless Sea Realm. Any item that was not destroyed by the suction force must be a powerful item and it was definite that the Storage Rings of the two people would possess strong weapons. If they shared the spoils from the Storage Ring with their brothers, their Troop would certainly become the most fearful Expedition Troop in the Forgotten City.</p>
 <p>Lu Heng beckoned his members from the Troop over and his team members rushed over at the commotion. All of them stared greedily at the two people that landed on the mountain of items. Without warning, hands reached forward and grabbed the two men.</p>
 <p>Just as the hands were about to touch the bodies, Rong Yuan’s eyes opened and he glared weakly at the person closest to him. The man jumped back in shock and he had to rely on his comrades to support him or he would have fallen to the ground.</p>
 <p>“You- you are still alive!” Lu Heng gasped in utter shock as he pointed towards Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan had opened his eyes.</p>
 <p>Ignoring the question, Rong Yuan immediately lowered his gaze and checked on Gu Lingzhi who was still in his arms. Her pale white face stuck closely against his chest. Thankfully, the rope that Rong Yuan used to bind them together had not torn apart under the suction force.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan’s hands shivered as he stretched it out and he tenderly kissed Gu Lingzhi’s icy cold lips. Feeling her soft breaths, he immediately smiled.</p>
 <p><em>They were alive!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>The people around them were just stunned and they froze at their spots with their hands outstretched. The sharp-eyed man in front of them shivered uncontrollably as he held the woman in his arms tightly. That was the first reaction driven by pure love after the two had a near death experience.</p>
 <p>The members of the troop exchanged looks before one of them pushed Lu Heng forward, signalling to him to take charge of the situation. Lu Heng hesitantly stammered as he patted Rong Yuan’s shoulder, “Brother, she cannot be revived. Pick yourself up, you are already blessed to be alive. Don’t be too upset over her.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan whipped his head around and glared angrily at Lu Heng, “Who said she is dead? Your death would not matter to her. How did you manage to live until now if you do not know how to watch your words?”</p>
 <p>After experiencing such a harrowing event, Rong Yuan detested the word ‘death’.</p>
