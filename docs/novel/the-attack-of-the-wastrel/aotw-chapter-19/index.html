 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Linglong was about to go crazy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">How was Gu Lingzhi able to make the Spirit Moulding Pill?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">That was something that even most middle-grade Yellow Level alchemists had trouble making. How could it be possible for Gu Lingzhi, who had only started practicing for no more than 10 days?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Linglong knew how her mother had intentionally found people to hinder Gu Lingzhi’s learning. If not, she would not have specially come today to watch Gu Lingzhi make a fool out of herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The questions that Gu Linglong had were similarly reflected in Gu Rong and Lin Yue-er’s faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">They both did not believe that Gu Lingzhi had made this Spirit Moulding Pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">An Alchemist was different from a Martial Artist, being differentiated into levels based on their ability to cultivate different grades of Spiritual Medicine. They were separated into Heaven, Earth, Black and Yellow levels.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">For each level, they were further split into higher, middle and low grades.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">As long as one had a thirty percent success rate of refining a certain grade of Spiritual Medicine, they were considered to possess the qualifications of that particular level in Alchemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Prior to this, the two Master Alchemists that Lin Yue-er had hired for Gu Lingzhi were both low-grade Earth Level alchemists of the Gu Clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi had already prepared herself for such a reaction. She did not bother explaining herself, and only looked at Gu Rong very seriously, “If Father does not believe me, I can make one right now for you to see.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“Do it then!” Gu Linglong cut in before Gu Rong could reply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">There was no way she would believe that this Spirit Moulding Pill was made by Gu Lingzhi. She was extremely sure that Gu Lingzhi had gotten this pill from somewhere else to fool Gu Rong, so she was desperate for Gu Lingzhi to prove her abilities on the spot.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">She could not wait for Gu Lingzhi to fail so that she could mock her, because she had previously been reprimanded by Gu Rong for bullying Gu Lingzhi.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi fixated her gaze on Gu Rong, pretending that she did not hear a word that Gu Linglong said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“Father, will you not even give me a chance to explain?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">With Gu Lingzhi’s attention on him, Gu Rong’s heart softened a little. He thought that Gu Lingzhi would not have dared to speak up if she truly did not have the ability to make the Spirit Moulding Pill. Even if this pill was not made by her, he believed that whatever she made would not be any more inferior.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">After all, it was rare for people that possessed both fire and wood spiritual energy to have no aptitude for Alchemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Lin Yue-er suddenly panicked when she saw the determined expression on Gu Lingzhi’s face. Realizing that things had not turned out the way she had expected, she turned towards Cui Lian with a questioning look. Cui Lian adapted quickly and gave her a reassuring smile, insinuating that Gu Lingzhi was bluffing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Lin Yue-er breathed a sigh of relief as she held onto Gu Rong’s arm and smiled, “Since Lingzhi offered, why don’t we take a look? I heard that the Spirit Moulding Pill is a medicine that most middle-grade Yellow Level alchemists have trouble making. If Lingzhi really was successful, then our Gu Clan would have yet another talented Alchemist.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The Spirit Moulding Pill, as the name suggests, was a medicine that helped to stabilize a Martial Artists’ foundations. When Level Nine Martial Students were about to breakthrough to become Martial Practitioners, if they consumed a Spirit Moulding Pill that was compatible with their Spiritual Roots, the likelihood of them breaking through would increase drastically.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Spirit Moulding Pills that had only one attribute were not difficult to refine, and many lower-grade Yellow Level alchemists could do it. However, the difficulty of cultivating a Spirit Moulding Pill with two different kinds of attributes was not simply double that of one that only had one attribute. Due to the possibility that the different spiritual energies could clash during refining, it could easily fail if one was not careful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The Spirit Moulding Pill that Gu Lingzhi took out consisted of two different attributes. How could anyone believe that she had actually made it herself?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">However, the following hour, Gu Lingzhi proved to others that she was indeed talented at alchemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">She added medicinal ingredients with swift motions into the furnace, making the task look extremely easy as she controlled the flames.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">To others, making a Spirit Moulding Pill with different kinds of energy incorporated into it might be an extremely difficult task. However, for Gu Lingzhi who had possessed five kinds of Spiritual Roots, it was not difficult at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Using her Spiritual Roots to sense the changes in the pill, any instability that arose from the reaction of different kinds of energies was easily resolved.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Very quickly, a brand-new pill consisting of both water and earth spiritual energies appeared in Gu Lingzhi’s hand. While she made the pill, she thought about how much she wanted to slap both Lin Yue-er and Gu Linglong and was thus extremely focused during the process. As a result, the quality of the Spirit Moulding Pill that she refined was of similar quality to one that was made by a middle-grade Yellow Level Alchemist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Once the Spiritual Pill was cultivated, the expressions on both Lin Yue-er and Gu Linglong’s face were extremely amusing. Gu Rong, on the other hand, looked at Gu Lingzhi as if she were a precious gem, and his eyes seemed to glow. He was ecstatic and exclaimed with approval.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“That’s my daughter! You have such an extraordinary talent for Alchemy. If that old man in the Royal School knew about this, I’m sure he would agree too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">This old man that he was referring to was the best Alchemist in the Xia Dynasty, Bi Heng. Ten years ago, he made a middle-grade Heaven Level pill that increased the probability of Martial Artists to breakthrough into the Demi-god realm. Many Martial Artists tried to seek him out so that they could have the pill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Thereafter, he was specially invited by the Royal School to become a guest lecturer on Alchemy. This attracted many youths that were talented in Alchemy to compete so that they could get accepted into the Royal School to study, just to be under the tutelage of Bi Heng. They believed that he would help push them further on their path of Alchemy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“Father, it was all due to luck. How can I be compared to the best Alchemist?” Gu Lingzhi lowered her head and pretended to be embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Rong laughed out loud at this, which made Gu Lingzhi more satisfied with herself. He completely forgot about his anger from before and the fact that he had scolded Gu Lingzhi for not having any ambition in the same hour.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Although he had forgotten, Gu Lingzhi had not. She glanced at the expressions of Lin Yue-er and Gu Linglong, the sides of her mouth curving into a smile. She exercised extreme restrain as she turned her head to ask, “I wonder who gave Mother and Sister the impression that I was no good at Alchemy. Weren’t you the one that hired the two teachers to help me? It’s alright if outsiders do not know about my learning, but at the very least, you should know that I am not completely useless at Alchemy. You happily let others gossip about me and even restricted the Medicinal Kitchen from passing ingredients to me. Does Mother not want me to become an Alchemist? And this Spirit Moulding Pill…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi was distressed, “I even secretly exchanged some medicine that I had successfully made for medicinal ingredients so that I could personally make a Spirit Moulding Pill as a gift for Younger Sister. I never thought that what I would get in return was distrust!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">All of them suddenly remembered that Gu Linglong was a Martial Artist with dual water and earth Spiritual Roots. The Spirit Moulding Pill that Gu Lingzhi had refined previously was actually customized for Gu Linglong?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">If that was truly the case, the actions of Lin Yue-er and her daughter were truly disappointing.</span></p>
