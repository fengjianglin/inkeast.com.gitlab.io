 <p>Not a single person was willing to believe it.</p>
 <p>As everyone knew, although Spiritual Medicines could be consumed to raise cultivation levels, allowing their strength to skyrocket in a short period of time, it would also cause irreparable harm to their bodies and influence their future cultivation. As the next successor of the Ye Family, how could Ye Fei possibly have done such a thing without thinking of the future consequences? Otherwise, when Ye Fei’s cultivation was still going well, using Spiritual Medicines to raise her cultivation level was not something that she would do.</p>
 <p>However, if it was not a Spiritual Medicine, then what could possibly have explained the reason behind Ye Fei’s sudden increase in her cultivation level?</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan saw the improvement in Ye Fei’s cultivation and his eyes showed a tinge of surprise. Evidently, he did not know of the existence of any Spiritual Medicine that could increase one’s cultivation so suddenly without any negative impacts in the future.</p>
 <p>He quickly regained his calm as Tianfeng Jin had also appeared. His intuition as a Martial Artist was telling him that, she had similarly used a method unknown to others, to allow her cultivation to skyrocket.</p>
 <p>Obviously, the surrounding people did not have the same level of adaptation as Rong Yuan. After they sensed Tianfeng Jin’s cultivation, all of them felt as though their life had been subverted.</p>
 <p><em>What was this situation? Could it be that raising one’s cultivation was now as easy as eating a bowl of rice? Were the two of them unafraid of any impacts on their cultivation in the future?</em> They looked at Gu Lingzhi again… Good, her cultivation was still that of a Level Six Martial Student. Clearly, that method of increasing the cultivation had a limit. Otherwise, with their friendship, there is no way they would have left Gu Lingzhi out.</p>
 <p>However, they very quickly realised that their idea was completely wrong. That was because Qin Xinran had appeared. She had also been cleansing her Spiritual Roots and had broken through to become a Martial Practitioner. It was obvious that she had just broken through and had yet to stabilize her cultivation level. At this point, if Gu Lingzhi were to also break through to become a Martial Practitioner, no one would be surprised anymore.</p>
 <p>“Eh, why are all of you here? Was everyone unable to sleep tonight? Just as well, since I have just broken through, I do need a few people to test my strength against. It will be all of you then." Qin Xinran looked innocent and harmless as usual, but her words made everyone’s hair stand on ends.</p>
 <p>“Relax, I won’t use my cultivation to bully you all. When fighting, I will restrict my cultivation base to the same level.”</p>
 <p>At Qin Xinran’s words, everyone’s faces looked as though they had just swallowed a fly. At first, they had thought that with such a situation, they could take the opportunity to teach Gu Lingzhi a lesson. They never thought that the Third Prince would receive the news so quickly and appear before they could even make a move. Not only did they fail to teach Gu Lingzhi a lesson, they even lost twenty credits for nothing.</p>
 <p>After that, Ye Fei and Tianfeng Jin’s appearances had made them shocked. Now, even Qin Xinran had appeared. They were already starting to regret coming to find trouble with Gu Lingzhi. <em>Wouldn’t it have been good if they had just stayed quietly in their dormitories? Who cared about the spiritual energy storm and whether or not it would go out of control? When the school was constructing the dormitories, they had already laid down defensive arrays. Even if Gu Lingzhi’s dormitory were to explode completely, it would not have affected them.</em></p>
 <p>“Why is it always so unlucky to meet her?” Mu Niansi complained angrily as she left Gu Lingzhi’s dormitory. She was shocked for a moment when she saw a figure out of the corner of her eye, but then she sneered and raised her voice on purpose, “What a pity. They are sisters and obviously of the same family. The elder sister’s life is so good, not only did she become the Third Prince’s fiancée, but she even managed to get Senior Yan Liang to fall head over heels in love with her, who completely disregards her engagement and continues to woo her without fail. Yet, the younger sister is forgotten by all. It is really pitiful.”</p>
 <p>The surrounding people let out laughs when they saw Gu Linglong’s face turned white upon hearing Mu Niansi’s words. The enmity between the Gu Clan’s sisters was well known to all. If they couldn’t find trouble with the elder sister, then taking out their anger on the younger sister was not a bad idea. Hence, they started to follow in Mu Niansi’s lead and mocked Gu Linglong.</p>
 <p>“All of you…” Gu Linglong was so furious that her eyes were turning red. Originally, she had noticed the activity here and had specially hidden herself in one corner to watch Gu Lingzhi being made fun of. She never thought that she would instead be turned into a joke.</p>
 <p>“If you have the ability, then go and find trouble with her! What right do all of you have to bully me, when you’re all just a group of people who cower before power!”</p>
 <p>“Oh, so even you are aware that you’re weak. I wonder who was the one who said that Gu Lingzhi had no ability at all and was just a freeloader in the Gu Clan. No matter how I look at it, she seems to be much stronger than you. Well, at least in the aspect of seducing men, she is definitely much better,” Mu Niansi ridiculed.</p>
 <p>“Mu Niansi, don’t you go overboard! Gu Lingzhi was the one who offended you so why don’t you go and find her? I was only passing by. The Third Prince hasn’t left yet, do you want to have another twenty credits deducted for fighting?” Tao Qian spoke out, from beside Gu Linglong. Gu Linglong’s heart warmed in that instant when she saw that small, petite body standing in front of her and helping her to defend against their attacks. As she looked at Tao Qian, there was gratitude in her eyes.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi and the others were unaware of the conflict occurring there. The few of them had trained their eyes on Rong Yuan. They were having a headache as he refused to leave the dormitory even when it was almost time for the curfew.</p>
 <p>“Third Prince, the issue has already been resolved, shouldn’t you be going?” Gu Lingzhi subtly ordered after he refused to take the hints.</p>
 <p>Instantly, the evil smile on Rong Yuan’s face disappeared. He pouted, “Gu Lingzhi, you are really mean to throw me away after using me.”</p>
 <p>Everyone felt a chill in their hearts and looked at Rong Yuan with an extremely strange expression. <em>Rong Yuan, who was hailed as the War God, actually had such a side to him?</em></p>
 <p>Yuan Zheng, who had been quietly standing in the corner and acting as a good attendant, silently turned his head away. He had reached a new understanding of the shamelessness of his master. It looks like his master was willing to throw away all his pride in order to make Gu Lingzhi his wife. <em>It is shameful indeed!</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi took a deep breath to calm herself down, “Your Highness, it’s late. As far as I know, according to the Royal School’s regulations, no male students or tutors are allowed to be inside a female dormitory past curfew. Your Highness, are you intending to break the rules?”</p>
 <p>“There was such a regulation?” Rong Yuan blinked his eyes stupidly. “But the school doesn’t have a regulation that prevents a student’s fiancé from visiting during after curfew hours, right?”</p>
 <p>“Your Highness.” Gu Lingzhi was so infuriated that she emphasized every single word, “Just because you’re my fiancé, does it mean you’re not a male anymore?”</p>
