As though confirming their thoughts, Gu Lingzhi immediately said, “Since everyone understands the situation now, I have to trouble all of you to report back to the rulers of your respective Kingdoms. If they wish to know about the situation of the spies, then come take a trip to the Xia Kingdom’s Royal Palace. Both Rong Yuan and I will be sincerely waiting for their arrival.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After hearing Gu Lingzhi’s words, everyone present understood what she was thinking. She wanted to take the chance to use the information to her advantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lady Gu, it is now a special period, shouldn’t all the kingdoms come together to confront the North Qiu Kingdom? This information…I think you should let us take it back to our Kingdoms.” The one who said these words was a Demigod. His remarks were unanimously agreed by the others, who took the side that Gu Lingzhi should hand over the information for them to confront the North Qiu Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hey, isn’t it funny? She sneaked into the Royal Palace with no hesitation, at the expense of her own reputation, risked her life infiltrating the Royal Palace’s Secret Chamber to obtain these letters and when you say you want it, she owes it to you? If not for Lingzhi, I’m afraid all of you would not have known what was going on until the North Qiu Kingdom comes knocking on your doors. We’re just asking you for a small favor now in exchange for the information. If you’re unwilling, you can tell the rulers of your respective Kingdoms not to send anyone here anymore. The North Qiu Kingdom doesn’t want any of you here anyway.” Before Rong Yuan could open his mouth and come to Gu Lingzhi’s defence, Mei Ying could not help but respond.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Earlier on when Su Nian was disguised as Rong Yuan, he was already very disappointed with the reaction of these people. Now hearing that they wanted Gu Lingzhi to just hand over the information that she took such a big risk to obtain made him so angry that he wanted to give them a beating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After being an elder for so long, did they think that they were superior? Even at this time, they are still thinking of ways to take advantage of the situation. It was no wonder that it was only being discovered now that the North Qiu Kingdom had been infiltrating all of their Kingdoms after so many years.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing those words, awkwardness was apparent on the faces of those that wanted to obtain the information for free. They also knew that Gu Lingzhi’s information did not come easy, yet after Mei Ying expressed it out loud, there were still some who could not get over it, and defended, “Brother Mei, what you said is wrong. Now, we are all in the same state, no one knows how much inside information the North Qiu Kingdom has. We hope that Lady Gu can just hand over the information, just so we can understand the situation and make our arrangements early.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then you should quickly return back to your Kingdoms and tell your ruler to send people to the Xia Kingdom to discuss the matter. Everyone will be together then, and we can have a meeting to discuss how to deal with the North Qiu Kingdom,” Mei Ying rudely shot back again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time everyone could tell that Mei Ying was determined to help Gu Lingzhi, therefore no one asked her for information anymore. As for snatching? Since they only knew of the North Qiu Kingdom’s conspiracy after it was exposed by Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan, even if they had such a thought, they would feel too embarrassed to do it! Therefore, after some discussion again, everyone left the house to return back to their respective Kingdoms to report the news.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan did not wait around as well. After everyone left, they roughly summarized the current situation to Yan Liang, Tianfeng Jin and others, before rushing towards the entrance of the Sacred Lands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before deciding to expose North Qiu Kingdom, Gu Lingzhi had already controlled the exit of the Sacred Lands to prevent anyone exiting the place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thereafter, the matter had already ended, and Gu Lingzhi removed the ban. Instantly, groups of people who knew about the North Qiu Kingdom’s conspiracy poured out the Sacred Lands angrily. Only then did the North Qiu Kingdom’s guards, who were still stationed at the entrance charging the people entering the Sacred Lands, realized that there was something wrong. However, before they had the chance to report the situation back to the Royal Palace, they were killed by the angry group of people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Lingzhi and the others were also mixed in the crowd. Not long after exiting the Sacred Lands, they saw a group of people who had already been waiting there. It was a troop of guards that Rong Yuan brought with him when he came to the North Qiu Kingdom this time. Riding on the flying demon beasts prepared by his troops, the large group of people left hurriedly towards the Xia Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meanwhile, in the North Qiu Kingdom’s Royal Palace, they learned about the situation from a guard that had escaped from the crowd in the Sacred Lands. The ruler of North Qiu Kingdom dropped his favorite luminous jade cup in shock, staring at the guard and exclaimed, “What did you say?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your- Your Majesty. Our plan…it has been exposed.” The guard stood there under the intense gaze of the king of the North Qiu Kingdom. After trembling to say those words, he felt as though he was going to collapse. This felt worse than witnessing his fellow guards, whose identities were exposed, getting killed by the angry crowd in the Sacred Lands. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crash!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a moment of anger, the ruler of North Qiu Kingdom broke the armrests of his dragon throne, and demanded, “Tell me everything you know.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Stuttering, the guard recounted what had happened in the Sacred Lands. He highlighted that when the North Qiu Kingdom’s conspiracy was exposed, together with other companions, they wanted to take advantage of the chaos and sneak out of the Sacred Lands to report the situation to the Royal Palace. However, they found out that the exit was sealed, thus there was no way to leave and report the situation. He hoped that the king would understand that he did want to report but there was really no way of exiting the Sacred Land, and on that account, could spare him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, the King of the North Qiu Kingdom did not have any energy to care whether the guard was dead or alive as his entire state of mind was occupied by the guard’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The North Qiu Kingdom’s conspiracy, after thousands of years of careful planning, had just so easily been uncovered by Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Damn! I swear, when the North Qiu Kingdom rules over the entire Tianyuan Continent, I will have both Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan’s skins peeled in order to satisfy my hatred!” To the King of the North Qiu Kingdom, the previous five Demigods that were hurt were just a few unfamiliar seniors who passed away. Compared to losing a loved one, his heart bore more anger for the damage made to the Pan Family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it was different now, Pan En was the son he was the most proud of and also the next ruler of the North Qiu Kingdom. Yet, he was now dead in the Sacred Lands because of Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi - how could he not feel resentful and hurt?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Regardless, despite how upset he was, he was still the ruler of a kingdom and there were still many matters that he had to deal with. After a brief period of sorrow, the King of the North Qiu Kingdom sorted out his emotions and got up from his dragon throne carved with nine dragons. He stumbled a little out of the hall, commanding, “Go, notify the princes that our plan has failed, and everyone is to come together to discuss a countermeasure.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under this order, the atmosphere of the North Qiu Kingdom Royal Palace became more tense than ever before. Some palace servants did not know of the Royal Palace’s conspiracy, but after hearing the news that came from the Sacred Lands, they became anxious. There was no way that they would have guessed that the Royal Palace had such an ambition, that they would dare think of dominating the entire continent. What scared them the most was that North Qiu Kingdom’s conspiracy had actually been exposed. It was also exposed in one of the worst ways - in a huge Secret Territory, witnessed by countless Martial Artists. Now, the whole continent would learn about the evil ambitions of the Royal Palace of the North Qiu Kingdom in just a few days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people hurried back to their respective kingdoms to report to their rulers while the distressed North Qiu Kingdom’s Royal Palace fell into a state of emergency. Under such dire circumstances, everyone had neglected the mastermind behind the chaos - Liu Yiyan. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Within half a day, the crowd in the Sacred Lands had been reduced to a sparse population. Liu Yiyan who was sitting on the first level of the main palace sighed, “Young Master, have you forgotten about me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A-choo!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Gu Lingzhi, who was sitting on the back of the flying demon beast, rushing towards the Xia Kingdom, suddenly sneezed. Rong Yuan who was sitting behind her immediately hugged her tighter in concern. “Are you cold? I could take off my clothes for you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Lingzhi heard him and shook her head. “It’s alright, my nose is just a little itchy, you should focus on leading the way instead.”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was already a Martial Practitioner, yet why was she so weak? How could she feel cold just from riding on the flying demon beast?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the situation was so sudden, Rong Yuan had only prepared flying demon beasts for Gu Lingzhi and his other guards. Now that there were so many people, it was not possible to for everyone to have one demon beast each. Hence, Rong Yuan wanted Gu Lingzhi to take the same flying demon beast with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the suggestion was made, it was naturally opposed by Yan Liang, Xin Yi and others, but Rong Yuan had thick skin. He gazed at everyone and carried Gu Lingzhi to the nearest flying beast demon and hurried in the direction of the Xia Kingdom.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Really?” Rong Yuan asked again disappointedly, “You really don’t want it? It is really warm.” While speaking, Rong Yuan deliberately rubbed his chest against Gu Lingzhi’s back. When he said that he wanted to take off his clothes, he obviously did not simply refer to just removing his outerwear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sure enough, before Gu Lingzhi could reject the offer again, Rong Yuan suddenly said, “I know you are cold, come, let me help cover you.” After speaking, he skillfully used one hand to remove the belt of his outerwear, and like as though he was holding an infant, he wrapped Gu Lingzhi in his arms. Then under Gu Lingzhi’s embarrassed gaze, he slowly re-attached the strap, half of his body pressed on Gu Lingzhi’s back, before he let out a satisfied sigh. “If there were not so many people, I really want to do something with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Do what?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Lingzhi knew that what he had in his head was definitely not something good. Through Rong Yuan’s outerwear, Gu Lingzhi found that the flying demon beast flying jerked a few times strangely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Lingzhi’s face turned black and being surrounded by Rong Yuan, she struggled a few times to signal for him to let go. Unexpectedly, instead of getting what she wanted, she heard a groan from Rong Yuan who was pressed behind her, with something pressing into her back, its warmth marking its presence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lingzhi, even if you have the same thought as me and want to do something on this demon’s back, you don’t have to remind me so. See, my little brother is getting angry.”</span></p>
