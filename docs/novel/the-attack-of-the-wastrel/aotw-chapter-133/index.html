<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Gu Lingzhi had unexpectedly won in the challenge between her and Feng An.</p>
 <p>However, losing to Gu Lingzhi was the least of his worries. Feng An was more scared of Qin Xinran and Tianfeng Jin who were laughing harmlessly at the side.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi smiled very slightly – it almost seemed like she was not smiling at all. Feng An, on the other hand, looked like he was about to cry as he went up the battle arena stage. There was even a crowd that had gathered to watch.</p>
 <p>It was not that Feng An was scared of admitting defeat, but he knew that even if he did not accept Qin Xinran’s challenge now, she would still find other means to get him to accept it anyway. In this case, he’d rather lose now and at least get a reputation for being able to admit defeat.</p>
 <p>“Gu Lingzhi, I like you!” someone had shouted even before Gu Lingzhi had walked into the Battle Arena.</p>
 <p>The person who had confessed was a boy who was around the same age as her. His appearance was clean, and his face was flushed red with embarrassment. It was hard to imagine that such a blunt and affirmative confession could have come from someone that was so shy.</p>
 <p>“Sorry, I don’t like you,” Gu Lingzhi straightforwardly replied, although she was rather stunned as it was her first time experiencing something like this.</p>
 <p>From what the Third Prince had told her, you had to be straight to the point when rejecting someone, if not the other party would keep bothering you.</p>
 <p>“It’s… it’s alright. We can start from being friends and maybe you'd end up liking me back.”</p>
 <p>“I won’t. I don’t like boys who are younger than me.” The boy who had confessed looked like he had just enrolled in the Royal School this year. Naturally, he would have been a year younger than her.</p>
 <p>“Ah? About this… this… I don’t have a choice when my mother decides to give birth to me,” the boy stuttered. He looked like he was in discomfort, “I think that as long as both parties are in love, age is not an issue. Won’t you give me a chance?”</p>
 <p>“No,” Gu Lingzhi rejected him so ruthlessly that even the crowd who was watching the commotion stood up for him.</p>
 <p>“Even if you can’t reciprocate his feelings, can’t you let him down easily? So what if he’s younger than you? He could have gone through more than you have and be more mature than you are.”</p>
 <p>“Sigh, what do you know, she’s saving it for the Third Prince. If she accepted his feelings, how is she going to explain herself to the Third Prince?”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. How can a nobody like him compare to the Kingdom’s War God? The Third Prince is the most likely person to become a True God, to be his wife is to be extremely powerful, much better than marrying a nobody.”</p>
 <p>“But I thought the Third Prince didn’t want her anymore?”</p>
 <p>“You don’t know that. Maybe he’s just resisting his urges…”</p>
 <p>“Shut up! If you want to watch the match, keep quiet. If not, scram!” Qin Xinran shouted in frustration and anger. At the same time, she tried to remember the faces of the people who had spoken so that she could deal with them later on.</p>
 <p>The people who had spoken ill of Gu Lingzhi immediately realized that Gu Lingzhi still had someone as crazy as Qin Xinran by her side. <em>How could they forget that it was because Feng An had spoken ill of Gu Lingzhi which led him to being forced to fight against Tianfeng Jin and Qin Xinran?</em></p>
 <p>In an instance, everyone’s faces had changed. If it was not for Gu Lingzhi who had agitated them in the first place by rejecting the boy so harshly, how would they have lost their cool in the very first place?</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi felt her head starting to hurt. She did not think that even after so long, the girls who had been lusting over the Third Prince had still not let her go. When she turned back to look at the boy who had made the confession, the expression on his face was full of discomfort and awkwardness, but he still pursed his lip stubbornly. The boy saw her coming over and he smiled, “I know I’m not as good as the Third Prince, but I assure you that my affection towards you is not any less than his. I will treat you well, with all of my heart.”</p>
 <p>“This kid isn’t too bad.”</p>
 <p>It was hard to tell what kind of person the boy who had confessed was. The expression on his face was difficult to read, it was either he was extremely innocent, if not he was so scheming that others could not tell.</p>
 <p>Rolling her eyes internally, Gu Lingzhi tried to ignore what Ye Fei had said. “I entered the Royal School so that I can become more powerful, I didn’t come in here to fall in love or get into a relationship. Before I graduate, these are merely distractions and obstacles for me.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi then held Ye Fei’s hands and walked past the boy.</p>
 <p>“My name is Su Nian,” the boy said as he watched Gu Lingzhi walk away. “I won’t give up!”</p>
 <p>The only response he got was Qin Xinran turning back abruptly and giving him a cold glare. Su Nian immediately took a few steps back. It took a few seconds for him to recover and he looked back at Qin Xinran straight in the eye.</p>
 <p><em>Oh? He’s actually not scared of her?</em></p>
 <p>Qin Xinran raised her eyebrows in amusement. It seemed that she was not spending enough time in front of the freshly enrolled students as she was always staying by Gu Lingzhi’s side, so these students did not know that there was a lunatic like her that they should avoid.</p>
 <p>She looked at the crowd again. <em>Perhaps she should seize this opportunity to show them who she really was and why they should not provoke her!</em></p>
 <p>At the same time, those who had slandered Gu Lingzhi earlier suddenly froze, like deer in headlights under Qin Xinran’s gaze. As for Qin Xinran, she proved just how terrifying and formidable she was on the stage of the battle arena.</p>
 <p>The people who had spoken ill of Gu Lingzhi, including Feng An, were all ruthlessly injured by Qin Xinran. The new students who had never seen Qin Xinran fight were scared speechless. They silently swore that they would not provoke Qin Xinran in this life as everyone that had fought against her were severely injured. It was definitely the most brutal matches that they had watched ever since they enrolled in the Royal School.</p>
 <p>Compared to Tianfeng Jin who won in one single move every time, Qin Xinran was much more brutal.</p>
 <p>Yet, being beaten in a single move was damaging to their pride. When it came to Qin Xinran however, her opponent was always thinking about how to best reduce their injuries. As for the rest of the people who had slandered Gu Lingzhi and had not gone against Tianfeng Jin or Qin Xinran, they were looking for a way to escape.</p>
 <p>Tianfeng Jin and Qin Xinran were very effective in the message that they had sent to people who tried to challenge Gu Lingzhi, as no one asked Gu Lingzhi for a match again after that.</p>
 <p>On the second morning, Gu Lingzhi opened the door of her hostel and was about to head to class. She was stopped in her tracks when she realized that she had received two stalks of flowers.</p>
 <p>One stalk had a nameless card attached on it, whereas the other one had the word ‘Su Nian’ on them.</p>
 <p>“I guess the kid is serious. It must be true love if he’s bothering you even after getting beaten by Xinran,” Ye Fei gasped as she snatched the card from Gu Lingzhi’s hands. Gu Lingzhi thought that it was really weird for sixteen-year-old Ye Fei to address Su Nian, who was just one year younger than her, a child.</p>
