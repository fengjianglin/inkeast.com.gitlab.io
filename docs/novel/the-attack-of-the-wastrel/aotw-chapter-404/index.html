 <p>The beasts continued attacking the city for five days. In this time, Gu Lingzhi had lost count of how many Giant Insect Beasts she had killed and how many people’s energies she had helped replenish in the Lost City. She only knew that though she was extremely exhausted, the beasts had finally stopped attacking.</p>
 <p>The Spirit City was filled with celebratory calls when its residents saw that the beasts had disappeared from the horizon.</p>
 <p>“We’ve won! They’ve retreated!”</p>
 <p>“We can finally have a good night’s rest!”</p>
 <p>These people could go to sleep, but for Gu Lingzhi and her company, they still had some matters to settle.</p>
 <p>They had managed to defend against the beasts this time because the four other cities had shared the burden of guarding the West city gates and many people from the Spirit Tribe had sacrificed their lives to protect the city. Even so, the four other cities that helped had suffered heavy casualties, losing more than 10,000 lives in the process.</p>
 <p>Guan Yue was rather pleased with this outcome. If it was not for Rong Yuan who had found someone to train the men of the Forgotten City, they would not have been able to defend the west city gates with such minimal losses. Le Yan, on the other hand, was heavily dissatisfied. He had lost a few hundreds of soldiers in this war. His only comfort was that the other cities had also lost a few hundreds of soldiers, and he could not help but feel that the Spirit Tribe had used them as a tool to fight off the beasts. It was no wonder the people of the Spirit Tribe had treated them so nicely in the beginning.</p>
 <p>Lin Chongyuan only had one thing to say. “Whoever is unhappy can leave, I won’t force anyone to stay here.”</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Le Yan no longer felt angry, but he was still indignant. He felt that he had suffered losses from this experience, so he promised himself that he would get his hands on as many beast carcasses as he could.</p>
 <p>Though the beasts were ferocious, their carcasses were precious. The hide of the beasts could be harvested and used in making weapons. Lin Chongyuan had no intentions of fighting with him over such trivial matters, so he let Le Yan have his way. The other cities were not as thick-skinned as Le Yan; they did not complain even if they ended up receiving less rewards.</p>
 <p>When they had sent off the people from the four other cities, Gu Lingzhi took whatever body parts of the beasts that could be used in weapon-making and put it in her Inheritance Space. She passed these items to the descendants of the Spirit Tribe that were residing in her Inheritance Space before going back to her living quarters to rest.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi slept for almost an entire day, before she was awoken by a ruckus outside the next morning.</p>
 <p>“Lady Le, you can’t go in, my masters are resting, you can’t disturb them!” <em>It was Chun Tao’s voice.</em></p>
 <p>Ever since Gu Lingzhi met Lin Chongyuan, Chun Tao had become her servant. Since then, the beasts had wreaked havoc on the city and Gu Lingzhi’s Inheritance Space and her identity as a descendant of the Spirit Tribe had been exposed. Chun Tao’s attitude towards Gu Lingzhi took a 180-degree turn. At first, she was unwilling to serve Gu Lingzhi but now, she was almost obsessed with her master. Seeing that Le Yao had tried to seduce Rong Yuan before, Chun Tao was strongly against Le Yao entering Gu Lingzhi’s living quarters.</p>
 <p>However, Chun Tao was not physically strong. She was only in the early stages of being a Silver Class Warrior and was no match for Le Yao. It did not take much effort for Le Yao to barge into Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan’s living quarters.</p>
 <p>“Stop! Take one more step and I’ll call for back-up,” Chun Tao tried to appear menacing as she held both of her arms up to block Le Yao.</p>
 <p>“Look at this servant of yours, she’s rather loyal, isn’t she?” Le Yao chuckled, “I’m here to discuss some important matters and I’ll leave the moment I’m done. Do you have to make such a big fuss about it?”</p>
 <p>Chun Tao got an eyesore just from the way Le Yao’s big breasts moved every time she talked. “Bullshit! Why would my mistress have anything to do with you? Hurry up and leave, do not disturb my masters while they are resting.”</p>
 <p>“Your words are really hurtful. After all, I’ve once had a genuine relationship with your master…”</p>
 <p>“Who has ever had a genuine relationship with you? I only remember someone being shameless and making a fool out of herself that disgusted my husband. Lady Le, it seems that your memories are failing you. Do you need me to find someone to have your brain checked for you? Or else, people might say that the Spirit City does not treat its guests well. I wouldn’t be able to bear the consequences of any more insults hurled at us.”</p>
 <p>“Mistress, you’re awake!” Chun Tao turned and looked at Gu Lingzhi, evidently surprised. The expression on her face immediately turned into one of embarrassment. “I’m to blame for being too weak. I was unable to stop her from disturbing your rest.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi patted her on her head, “It’s alright, the difference in your cultivation levels is too big. If she wants to barge in, you won’t be able to stop her. Next time, don’t force yourself. What if you get hurt?”</p>
 <p>Chun Tao pouted and played with her fingers, “But I can’t just sit by and watch whilst someone barges in like that.”</p>
 <p>“Then wake me up and I’ll deal with her, don’t do anything silly,” Gu Lingzhi instructed Chun Tao before turning to face Le Yao, “Why have you come?”</p>
 <p>Le Yao twisted her ponytail before she laughed lightly, “Do I need a reason to come and visit you?”</p>
 <p>“It’s not that,” Gu Lingzhi said as she inched one step backwards towards Rong Yuan who was standing beside her to show her authority, “It’s just that my house is rather small, it would not be appropriate to host someone as important as you in it. If you have something you’d like to say, please say it and leave. My husband and I have many other important matters to see to, so we don’t have time to waste.”</p>
 <p>Le Yao blinked, almost as if she did not get Gu Lingzhi’s hint of chasing her away. She found a bench and sat down on it. “I’ve come today to apologize to you on behalf of my brother. That day, he saw that his subordinate was injured and in the heat of the moment, he said things that he did not mean to you. I hope that you won’t take it to heart.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was slightly taken aback, never expecting that Le Yao had come to apologize on behalf of Le Yan. Rong Yuan, on the other hand, narrowed his eyes at her words and asked Gu Lingzhi, “Did Le Yan bully you?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi thought about it carefully before she shook her head. Le Yan had the intention of making things difficult for her, but he did not manage to achieve his goal.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan noticed her hesitation and his face immediately darkened. When he thought about how he had been fighting the beasts outside the city whilst others were giving Gu Lingzhi a difficult time in the city, he could not help but feel that Le Yan was a horrible person and he should not have saved him back then. Then, Rong Yuan no longer bothered to entertain Le Yao any longer. He merely waved his hands dismissively. “I understand. Go back and let your senior know that if he wants to live a longer life, he should stop provoking others, else trouble would find him one day.”</p>
 <p>“Demigod Rong, are you really just going to chase me away like this?” Le Yao bit her lower lip and pouted at him, a wronged expression on her face. “I’ve come all the way here before I got to rest, aren’t you going to invite me inside for some tea?”</p>
 <p>“Do whatever you want,” Rong Yuan replied dismissively as his brows furrowed. He then pulled Gu Lingzhi into his arms, asking her eagerly about what Le Yan had done to her so that he could exact his revenge.</p>
 <p>Holding the teacup, her hands trembled a bit and her eyes twitched. <em>She hasn't even left yet, but they are blatantly discussing how to take revenge on her brother in front of her!</em></p>
 <p>Chun Tao laughed lightly at the scene in front of her, praising Rong Yuan in her head. Her master was indeed domineering, her mistress was really lucky to marry a man like him.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi grinned as she explained what had happened at the west city gates to Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan massaged her head gently and praised her, “Well done, do your best to rebuke anyone who dares to disrespect you next time. If they still dare to disrespect you, I’ll beat the daylight out of him so that they won’t be able to speak anymore!”</p>
 <p>“Mm.” Gu Lingzhi giggled, but Le Yao’s face turned green from anger. Her decision to stay had only resulted in embarrassment.</p>
 <p>Then, Xiao Yu suddenly walked into the guesthouse. She was holding a tray with two plates of snacks and she placed it at the table closest to Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi. She looked at Rong Yuan and said, “I admire how much Brother Rong dotes on the Little Chancellor. This morning, I saw that the both of you had not gotten up yet so I’ve decided to make some snacks for the both of you, I hope you like them.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi raised her eyebrows and looked at Xiao Yu, expressionless. A few days had passed, she thought that Xiao Yu would have given up on pestering Rong Yuan. However, she was still here, persisting! <em>Was Rong Yuan really that charismatic?</em></p>
 <p>After seeing the delight in Le Yao’s eyes, Gu Lingzhi took the plates from Xiao Yu and placed them in front of Le Yao and smiled. “Lady Le, you’ve rushed all the way here early in the morning. You haven’t had your breakfast yet, right? Try some of Xiao Yu’s food, she’s the best at cooking and won’t let you down.”</p>
 <p>“Lady Xiao Yu made these snacks for Demigod Rong, it wouldn’t be polite of me to eat them, would it?” Le Yao grinned as she pushed the plates away from her.</p>
 <p>“<em>Sigh</em>, how is it impolite? Since she has made us some food, anyone can eat it. Don’t you think so, Xiao Yu?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yu opened her mouth and glanced at Rong Yuan for a while before nodding her head, looking wronged. “Yes, if Lady Le doesn’t mind the food that I make, please eat it.”</p>
 <p>Le Yao sighed dramatically. “Look at how pitiful you are, how could I have the heart to eat it? Demigod Rong, do you really bear to reject her like this? Even if you don’t like her, you should at least have a few bites. Why are you making things so difficult for her?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yu lowered her head even more and her body started to tremble. She sobbed upon hearing Le Yao’s words.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi could only watch the scene unfold in front of her wordlessly. In an instant, she had become the bad person.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan’s eyes drooped, as if he was thinking of something. As Xiao Yu’s sobbing got louder, he suddenly walked towards the both of them and threw a handkerchief at her. “Look at you making a scene here. Aren’t you going to wipe away your tears?”</p>
