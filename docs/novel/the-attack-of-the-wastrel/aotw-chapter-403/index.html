 <p>The Spirit City was not that charitable - allowing people from other cities to seek refuge here came at a cost. It was their duty to defend the west city gate.</p>
 <p>Of course, the Spirit Tribe did not trust them completely. To prevent them from slacking off as it was not their own city, they had also sent some people from the Spirit City to be stationed there and guard the west city along with the other four cities.</p>
 <p>Soon, the roaring army of beasts were about to crash over. As the Spirit City was already prepared, it managed to recover its tranquility after the initial panic and was full of desire to fight against the invading beasts.</p>
 <p>Before the beasts could approach the city walls, they were blocked by various spiritual powers. The usually victorious flying beasts were of no help here. They were deadly sealed off in the sky above the Spirit City and were continuously attacked by those below the Spiritual Net.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan, the two vital forces, did not slack off. When the beasts swarmed in, they went into the herd and specially picked out those that were larger and more powerful to wipe them out batches by batches. Not long later, the ground in front of the city wall was covered with beasts’ corpses.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi sprinkled some Corpse Disintegrating Liquid before setting a fire to turn them into ashes. This restored the ground in front of the city wall by keeping it clean once again.</p>
 <p>“Little Chancellor, come back.” Chu Jiang shouted from the top of the city wall.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi heard and stopped what she was doing and returned back into the city. Rong Yuan continued to battle against the beasts.</p>
 <p>“The group in charge of handing the Spiritual Net does not have enough Spiritual Power. Go and take a look at them.” Chu Jiang hurriedly said once she landed back into the city.</p>
 <p>“Got it, just leave it to me.” Gu Lingzhi jumped off the city wall after hearing and went to find Lin Xiao who was responsible for sealing off the sky above the Spirit City.</p>
 <p>At this point of time, Lin Xiao’s face was covered in cold sweat. The excessive consumption of spiritual power had caused him to look haggard and it was the same for those around him. Upon seeing Gu Lingzhi’s arrival, he exclaimed, “You’re here, Little Chancellor. Sorry to trouble you.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi shook her head, “No problem. Thank you for working hard to eliminate the flying beasts.”</p>
 <p>After she had finished speaking, Gu Lingzhi executed the original plan and kept those from the Spirit Tribe, who had consumed a large amount of their spiritual energy, into the Inheritance Space. She then sent out those who have been cultivating inside the Inheritance Space to replace their position.</p>
 <p>While walking, Gu Lingzhi collected a number of people and sent them inside the Inheritance Space to recover their spiritual energy. This ensured that there was sufficient spiritual energy for those in charge of sealing off the Spirit City’s airspace. When Gu Lingzhi had reached the west side of the city, she took some time off and glanced around. It was found that the people of the Forgotten City were defending the west city gate tightly under Guan Yue’s leadership. Although they were not as skilled as the other cities, they had improved and were not falling behind. They were working with what Bian Cheng had taught them and were defending the city well, much more easily than those from the other three cities.</p>
 <p>Counting the time, there should be a lot of beasts corpse beneath the west city gate at this time. With this thought in mind, Gu Lingzhi flew up to the city wall and took a look at the ground below. Sure enough, a stack of corpses have been piled beneath the city wall. There were corpses of both beasts and humans.</p>
 <p>Unlike the people of the Spirit Tribe, the people from the four cities could not attack remotely and minimise the number of sacrifices. It was inevitable that sacrifices were made. Gu Lingzhi sighed and with a wave of her hand, sprinkled the Corpse Disintegrating Liquid. She then heard Le Yan shouting from not far away, “Little Chancellor, can you send some more people over from the Spirit City? I am almost unable to hold it here. We already have less manpower. If we were to lose even more people, I don’t know if we can hold this part of the city gate.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi frowned and looked at him, “It was already said that the four cities would guard the west city gate. Why are you saying that there is not enough manpower now? The battle plan had already been fixed. Where am I going to find more people for you?”</p>
 <p>Le Yan pointed to the people from the Spirit Tribe that were meditating in a distance to restore their spiritual energy and said, “What are you saying? Aren’t there quite a few people who are idle? Just send a couple over and the death toll can be reduced. You can’t neglect us just because we’re not citizens of the Spirit City.”</p>
 <p>These words might contain some form of provocation. A glimpse at those from the other three cities revealed that they have heard these words and were casting skeptical gazes. Gu Lingzhi chucked, “I will not blame you for being ignorant. A Martial Artists’ spiritual energy isn’t limitless. The Martial Artists resting at one corner have exhausted their spiritual energies and can no longer fight. It was already negotiated that the west city gate was to be defended by you all. In order to reduce your stress, two elite teams were specially sent to assist you all in defending the city. If the beasts are still able to enter under such conditions, I will really suspect whether there is a spy among you all, deliberately letting the beasts in.”</p>
 <p>With that, Gu Lingzhi scanned everyone before using a cold tone, “The Spirit City does not keep useless people. You can leave if you aren’t willing to defend the city. We will think of another solution. If anyone were to deliberately stir up the relationship between the aboriginal people of the Spirit City and the outsiders, don’t blame me for sending them out mercilessly!”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi left the top of the city wall without caring about the others’ reactions. She had also conveniently taken away a portion of those who were in need of replenishing their spiritual energy. She followed along the previous route and kept those who were meditating near the city wall into the Inheritance Space before bringing out a batch who had recovered their spiritual energy. She then proceeded to the next gate.</p>
 <p>“Fellow Chancellors, look. I’ve already said that the Spirit City had ill intentions!” Le Yan said with a gloomy voice upon seeing Gu Lingzhi’s departing figure.</p>
 <p>Yun Zhu and Yuan Sheng locked eyes but remained silent. Guan Yue chuckled softly and said, “Is that so? I feel that the Little Chancellor’s words make a lot of sense. The Spirit City does not keep any useless people. Since we are borrowing their territory, we have to display our worth. If the Spirit City is able to defend the city at a very small cost yet we are unable to, we can only blame ourselves for having inferior skills. It is alright if you are unaware and feel remorse. However, there is no reason to put the blame on them. At this point of time, focusing on defending the city and reducing the loss are what’s important at hand.”</p>
 <p>Seeing that Guan Yue had stood up for Gu Lingzhi, Le Yan’s face was flushed with anger and embarrassment, “Guan Yue, were you bribed by the Spirit City such that you are constantly speaking for them?”</p>
 <p>Guan Yue glanced at him, “Do you think everyone is like you and does not know how to return a favor? If not for the Little Chancellor’s help, my Forgotten City would have been destroyed by the beasts, let alone being able to survive and eat and drink. Defending the west city gate is not just for the Spirit City, but also for ourselves!”</p>
 <p>“You…” Le Yan was choked by Guan Yue’s words that he could not rebuke. What Guan Yue said was reasonable, but he could not bear to watch as his men were sacrificed. Guan Yue had managed to preserve his strength well and had more than twenty thousand people available. He was only left with a few thousand people and could not afford anymore losses. Upon seeing Yuan Sheng and Yun Zhu being moved by Guan Yue’s words, he said anxiously with a face of disapproval, “How are you certain that Gu Lingzhi had no other intentions? Perhaps she wants to win over everyone’s support and use the opportunity to revert the Forgotten City such that the citizens would become of the Spirit City instead? Wasn’t this intention revealed when she made us defend the city?”</p>
 <p>Yuan Sheng and Yun Zhu were shocked and their eyes gleamed as they thought about the possibility of Le Yan’s words. Guan Yue chided and could no longer stand Le Yan’s attitude. Before Le Yan could say anything else, a voice was inserted into their conversation.</p>
 <p>“Utter rubbish! Who cares about your defeated army? You think that everyone is the same as you just because you are narrow-minded? If the Spirit City had wanted to expand, do you think the other cities would still exist? Why don’t you take a look at your own virtues. Keeping you is a form of pollution to the air in my Spirit City.”</p>
 <p>Le Yan’s face turned verdant as soon as he heard this. No one has ever insulted him like this. He turned around and was faced with a handsome, sunny and energetic teenager who was looking at him with disdain.</p>
 <p>“Outrageous! Who are you? How dare you say such things to me?”</p>
 <p>“I’m your grandfather!” Fang Yue snarled at him with his hands on his hips, “There are really all kinds of birds when the forest is huge. It’s really a waste of talent for such a person like you to be able to cultivate into a Glaze Class Fighter. You can only think about nonsensical stuff all day, aren’t you worried that your brain might spoil from all these overthinking? It is sick that your brain has become like that, go get treated!”</p>
 <p>“Ridiculous!” Le Yan struck his palm in a fury. Fang Yue was already prepared and somersaulted to avoid the attack. Just when Le Yan was about to attack again, he opened his mouth and yelled, “Slaughter! The Chancellor of the Burnt City is colluding with the beasts and wants to silence me by killing me!”</p>
 <p>Le Yan was so exasperated that he almost choked on his saliva. He could only stare at Fang Yue as he could not attack even if he wanted to.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this, Guan Yue giggled and returned back to the city wall so as to continue commanding the battle. Yun Zhu glanced at Guan Yue before shaking her head and leaving. Her remaining strength was the smallest amongst the four cities. It was a blessing for her to be able to stay in the Spirit City and she dared not to think about anything else. She could not counter even if the Spirit City was to do something to them. It might be better off for her to gladly accept. If they were to really merge with the Spirit City, it might actually be a good thing for her. With this in mind, Yun Zhu was speedily enlightened.</p>
 <p>With everybody leaving, Le Yan’s eyes gleamed fiercely and he wanted to give Fang Yue a taste of his power. Anyway, he was the rude one to begin with. Even if he were to kill him, Lin Chongyuan could not fall out with him over this matter.</p>
 <p>The palm he had raised was turned into a glazed shape in an instant as he waved it towards Fang Yue.</p>
 <p>Fang Yue had already guarded himself secretly when the other three were leaving. When he sensed Le Yan’s desire to kill him, he leaped onto the top of the city wall in the blink of an eye. He ran and howled, “Slaughter! The Chancellor of the Burnt City wants to kill me! I’m scared!”</p>
 <p>Le Yan was so furious that he chased after him but was stopped by a group of Spirit City’s soldiers. They pointed their spiritual weapons at his direction and shouted, “Stop! Do not hurt the citizens of the Spirit City!”</p>
 <p>Le Yan stared coldly at the soldiers who were stopping him. He really desired to kill them all together. But Fang Yue’s shouting voice was too loud and had attracted the attention of quite a few people. The best time to vent his anger was missed and forcibly killing Fang Yue now would only cause inevitable trouble. After taking a few deep breaths to suppress his anger, Le Yan forcefully squeezed out a smile, “I was just joking and playing with him. Do you really think I would kill somebody? Do focus your concentration on defending the city. It would not be good if the beasts were to barge their way in.”</p>
 <p>“Is that so?” The leader of the troop studied him, seemingly believing his words as he retracted the Spiritual Weapon pointed at him. Just as he was turning around, a thumb was held out at an angle in which Le Yan could see.</p>
