 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Nightfall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The Gu Family was regarded as among the top five families in the Xia Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">A middle-aged couple led a group of uninvited guests into Gu Lingzhi's garden. The man looked dignified while the woman was beautiful. These two people were the current leader of the Gu Family, Gu Rong and his wife, Lin Yue-er. Behind them stood their daughter, Gu Linglong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Linglong, are you sure you heard a man's voice coming from your sister's room?" Gu Rong asked, his voice neutral and filled with prestige. This was the composure one expected of someone in power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Yes, Father, I initially wanted to find her so that we could chat, but I didn’t think that I would hear a man's voice there. I rushed to ask Mother for help, but never thought you would be there as well." Gu Linglong glanced at Lin Yue-er as she repeated the speech she had prepared beforehand and pretended to look lost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Father, maybe I misheard, should we just head back?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“Hmm, you are a level five Martial Student and your body has long been strengthened. How could you have misheard? Do not cover up for your older sister."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Rong took huge strides into the garden and headed straight for Gu Lingzhi's room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Behind him, Lin Yue-er and Gu Linglong exchanged glances as their eyes shimmered with excitement as they watched their plans unfold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Before he even entered the room, Gu Rong could hear low moans coming from the pitched black house in front of him, sounding like a mixture of pleasure and pain. Gu Rong, who was very experienced, turned ashen-faced. He raised his hands and pushed against the void in front of him. A crashing sound could be heard as the huge doors in front of him fell apart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The corners of Lin Yue-er's mouth tilted upwards in contradiction to what she said, "Dear husband, do not be rash, maybe this was meant to be a secret."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"A woman meeting with a man in the middle of the night, I for one want to see what secrets she has to keep!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Rong stomped into the room and the light shining in from the door lit up the sight in front of him. In the bed, two figures were blended into one. The anger in him burned as he could not help but want to give a beating to the two people in front of him. All of a sudden, the slender figure burst out in a desperate cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Clan Leader, please save me! I have been raped!" This voice belonged to Xiao Tao.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">As her voice filled the air, the expressions on Gu Linglong and Lin Yue-er’s face collapsed. The man had leapt off the bed and was pointing at Xiao Tao, shouting, "Xiao Tao, how come it is you?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Xiao Tao continued weeping, "Young Master, how can you deny that you violated me?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">At this point, Lin Yue-er realised something was wrong as she hurried to light a lamp to clearly witness the scene in front of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi's bed had been messed up completely and a few drops of blood remained on the bed that were especially obvious. On the corner of the bed, Xiao Tao hugged a blanket to herself as she wept. Bi Lingcan looked at her with utter disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">As everyone remained shocked at the scene in front of them, the sound of light, clear footsteps drifted into the room and Gu Lingzhi's voice could be heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Father, Mother, Younger Sister, what brings you here at this timing?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Everyone swiveled their heads to see Gu Lingzhi entering the room, unable to conceal the astonishment on their faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Why... why weren't you in your room?" Gu Linglong shouted in surprise when she saw Gu Lingzhi coming closer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">They had spent a considerable amount of effort setting up this entire scene, yet the one they wanted to target was left untouched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi lowered her head as she wore her familiar timid expression, "I heard that Father has been stuck in the Martial Lord level for quite some time, so I went to the Ancestral Shrine to pray for Father. I hope Father does not blame me."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">How could anyone blame Gu Lingzhi for that?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"That is so thoughtful of Lingzhi," Lin Yue-er forced out a dry laugh. Looking at the chaos in the room, she commanded the still shell-shocked Bi Lingcan, "Aren't you going to pack up and leave? You are disgraceful!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">It was unbelievable how he did not even know who he was hugging and had wasted all her efforts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Lin Yue-er's command caused Bi Lingcan to finally recover from the situation and hurriedly attempted to get dressed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Frowning, Gu Rong looked at the scenario before him. He then looked at Gu Lingzhi with a questioning gaze. Lin Yue-er was afraid that Gu Rong would investigate further and gave a few more orders to Bi Lingcan before shifting her attention to Gu Rong, wanting to persuade him to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Dear husband, this situation is ridiculous. Lingcan was fornicating with a servant and even brought it to her master's bed. I will discipline him after this. It is late now, we should go back to rest lest we prevent Lingzhi from resting."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi held back a cold laugh at how Lin Yue-er could so easily downplay a situation that had caused a young girl to lose her modesty. If she allowed Lin Yue-er to brush it off so easily, wouldn't it be a waste of her rebirth?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi feigned a look of shock as she stared at the scene in her room and rushed over to Xiao Tao, who was sitting in the corner, face white from what Lin Yue-er had said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Xiao Tao! What happened to you?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Xiao Tao could feel Gu Lingzhi gripping her hand tightly and she raised her head only to meet with a set of warning eyes. She immediately remembered what Gu Lingzhi had told her and her face turned even whiter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Xiao Tao utterly regretted agreeing with Gu Lingzhi to go along with her plan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">But what else could she have done? Looking at the current situation, Xiao Tao could tell that Lin Yue-er had developed a hatred for her. In fact, Lin Yue-er might even begin suspecting she had set this whole thing up. Since she could no longer win over Lin Yue-er, she might as well go along with Gu Lingzhi’s plans. Who knows, maybe she might get what she wished for after all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Xiao Tao gritted her teeth and cried out, "First Mistress, my life is such a tragedy!" After shouting out, tears rolled out of her eyes in streams.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"After night fell, Young Master barged into your room and grabbed me while I was just about to finish preparing your bed. He was calling for you and I tried fighting back, but he just… he just…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Xiao Tao struggled to finish her sentence. The faces of everyone who listened to her changed by different degrees.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Shut up! You slut! You were the one who tried to seduce me first, when did I call out for cousin Lingzhi?" Bi Lingcan shouted back in anger. His eyes, however, looked somewhat panicked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">If Gu Lingzhi was the person he had violated, that would have been easy. With his aunt's assistance, at most he would be berated, but at the end of the day, Gu Lingzhi would still belong to him. But now that he had done it with the wrong person, if he spoke the truth now, he would just be scolded in vain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Lin Yue-er looked at Xiao Tao in utter disgust. "You tried to seduce Young Master and still want to smear the name of your own mistress. As a mere servant, your intentions are vicious!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Xiao Tao seemed to shrink more into herself as she likened her situation to riding a tiger and having difficulty getting off. She gave it one last attempt, "If it was really my intention to seduce Young Master, then why would this happen in First Mistress' room and not in my own room?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Lin Yue-er felt her heart drop. She knew trouble was about to come home to roost.&nbsp;</span></p>
