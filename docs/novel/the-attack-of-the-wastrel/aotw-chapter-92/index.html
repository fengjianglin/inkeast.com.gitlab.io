 <p>“We’re not compatible,” Rong Yuan stated seriously as he stood in front of Concubine Rong.</p>
 <p>“Mother, I know you like her very much but it’s my decision who I get married to. I hope I can choose my own future wife.”</p>
 <p>“Choose what? To choose a savage whom you don’t even truly know?” Disapproval shone in Consort Rong’s eyes. “How sincere can a random person be? Rong’er, I just don’t want to see you get played by anyone.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan’s face twitched, “Mother, do I look like I will be fooled easily?”</p>
 <p>Consort Rong assessed him seriously before making her judgement, “No, you’re glib-tongued, and certainly not easy to fool.”</p>
 <p>“Mother, I’m charismatic and bright. How could you say that about me? If your future daughter in-law overhears, she’d misunderstand the kind of person I am. How can I possibly find a good daughter in-law for you then?”</p>
 <p>“Oh, you haven’t even seen her face and you are already calling her my daughter in-law? I haven’t given my permission,” Consort Rong resisted laughing although Rong Yuan had already cheered her up. Remembering why she had called him over, she looked at him seriously as she said, “Rong’er, you may be smart but when it comes to relationships, it is not something that can be understood just by being smart. Women are the best at acting when it comes to relationships. Even if they hate you, they are still able to pretend that they love you. yYou…”</p>
 <p>“Mother…” Knowing that his mother was about to go into a long lecture, Rong Yuan quickly raised his hands in defeat, “Mother, I know you are worried about me, but rest assured. Your future daughter in-law is currently trying her best to avoid me and always pretends like she doesn’t recognize me. If it’s really like what you say, I’d be happy even if she was pretending to like me.”</p>
 <p>“What? She dares to avoid you?” Consort Rong immediately raised her long, shapely eyebrows upon hearing that her son was being avoided by a girl. “My son is so outstanding that there is no one in the entire Tianyuan Continent that is as good as you, how dare she avoid you?”</p>
 <p><em>Just based on the fact that she doesn’t like me…&nbsp;</em>Rong Yuan sighed internally.</p>
 <p>“Mother, for my sake and pride, don’t you think the best punishment for her is to make her fall in love with me and marry into the Royal Family?”</p>
 <p>“That’s right, when she marries into the Royal Family, I’ll… wait, since when did I agree to let her marry into the family?” Concubine Rong was almost tricked by Rong Yuan into giving permission as she regained her composure, grinding her teeth, “You little brat, how dare you try to trick your own mother!”</p>
 <p>“I wouldn’t dare to,” Rong Yuan immediately begged for mercy, “Aren’t I just asking for your help? This is the first time that I am actually interested in a girl and want to take care of her. Can you bear to see me in this position and not help me?”</p>
 <p>Consort Rong was confused as she looked at Rong Yuan’s pitiful expression.</p>
 <p><em>She didn’t understand how the conversation had switched from her trying to discipline her son to listening to her son complain.</em></p>
 <p>She understood her son’s personality best and knew that although Rong Yuan seemed like he was trying to talk his way into convincing her, his eyes held a seriousness that she had never seen before. It was a kind of determination that she knew he would not change his mind.</p>
 <p>However, if she agreed to his request, what would happen to Tianfeng Wei? She was her best friend’s daughter and she had always treated Tianfeng Wei as her daughter in-law. She would have to be held accountable.</p>
 <p>“Mother, are you worried about Auntie Jin?” Knowing his mother well, Rong Yuan could sense her worry from her expression. He then called for Yuan Zheng.</p>
 <p>“Let my mother have a look at what we have found over the past few days.”</p>
 <p>Yuan Zheng then took out a stack of papers from his Storage Ring and handed it to Consort Rong.</p>
 <p>“This is…”</p>
 <p>“I want you to see Tianfeng Wei’s true colours,” Rong Yuan smiled.</p>
 <p>Over the past few days, he had ordered people to investigate and collect information on what Tianfeng Wei has been doing in the Royal School.</p>
 <p>In order to chase away women that were interested in Rong Yuan, she had resorted to underhanded means. Putting this aside, the most intolerable thing was her recruiting soldiers and buying horses for the Tianfeng Clan under the guise of being the Third Prince’s fiancée. In the past few years, there had been multiple graduates from the Royal School being recruited into the Tianfeng Clan under his name.</p>
 <p>He knew that his mother was familiar with the scheming amongst women and even if he gave her proof of her wrongdoings, she would just think that Tianfeng Wei’s methods were a bit harsh. However, if what she did affected Rong Yuan, then it would be a completely different story.</p>
 <p>Alas, Concubine Rong’s expression darkened as she read the materials and was furious by the time she got to the end.</p>
 <p>“How dare the Tianfeng Clan use your name for themselves. If someone hears about this, then you…” Horror was written all over Consort Rong’s face, how did she not notice this earlier?</p>
 <p>As a Consort, she was still under the Empress.</p>
 <p>The Emperor of the Xia Kingdom had children other than Rong Yuan. In terms of status, the Crown Prince and the Second Prince were superior. Rong Yuan also had many younger siblings. The Royal Family did not tolerate any formation of cliques or collusion between any parties. If the behaviour of the Tianfeng Clan was reported to the Emperor, Rong Yuan would still be punished in front of the Empress and the Crown Prince no matter how much the Emperor liked him.</p>
 <p>“Mother, do you still think Tianfeng Wei is suited to be my Royal Consort?” Rong Yuan added, “In the Royal School, she has also caused quite a bit of trouble for your future daughter in-law. She almost caused you to not have any grandchildren.”</p>
 <p>Consort Rong glanced at Rong Yuan coldly.</p>
 <p>“Don’t think that I don’t know you’re just trying to get me to accept the woman that you like. Don’t you threaten me!” <em>Almost not having any grandchildren? Was he insinuating that if she did not accept him finding his own wife then he will not get married at all?</em></p>
 <p>“I wouldn’t dare, I wouldn’t dare, why would I dare to threaten you?” Rong Yuan laughed guiltily.</p>
 <p>Consort Rong sighed as she handed over the stack of papers that were full of Tianfeng Wei’s misdeeds back to Yuan Zheng.</p>
 <p>“You are old enough now to make your own decisions, I shall not interfere with who you choose. You better not come back complaining to me in the future.”</p>
 <p>Consort Rong then left the hall elegantly using her Golden Lotus Steps movement technique. The banquet was still ongoing outside and she could not be absent for too long.</p>
 <p>Knowing that his mother had acknowledged the existence of Gu Lingzhi, the guilty expression on Rong Yuan’s face immediately turned to a sneaky look.</p>
 <p><em>Tianfeng Wei was trying to use Consort Rong to save their engagement. She forgot that Rong Yuan was her son. How could her, as an outsider ever hold a more important place in his mother’s heart than him, her own son?</em></p>
 <p>Seeing his master’s face turn back into the coquettish charm he used to face others, Yuan Zheng really wanted to tell Consort Rong that it was not just women that knew how to put on an act. Even her own son was pretty good at it.</p>
