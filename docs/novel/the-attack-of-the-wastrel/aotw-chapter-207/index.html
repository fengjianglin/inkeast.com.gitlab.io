 <p>Looking at Liang Xiao’s fainted state, Rong Yuan pursed his lips as he patiently asked Ding Wei to describe the fight.</p>
 <p>Ding Wei knew there was no way to fabricate anything and recounted the entire scene truthfully after hesitating slightly. He ended off with saying Gu Lingzhi was too harsh during the battle.</p>
 <p>He thought that with how submissive Rong Yuan was to Ding Rou, he would berate Gu Lingzhi after hearing this. Never did he expect that after hearing this, Rong Yuan’s face would turn serious as he asked, “Are you saying… that Gu Lingzhi lifted her Spiritual Sword towards Liang Xiao and cut off his arm?”</p>
 <p>Even though he rarely watched the battles, Rong Yuan knew quite a bit about a few students' moves from his subordinates. Liang Xiao’s ultimate move, Ten Thousand Swords to One, was considered a powerful move. For Gu Lingzhi to lift her Spiritual Sword directly at him and cut off his arm would mean that Liang Xiao’s original target was Gu Lingzhi’s arm as well.</p>
 <p>Even though he knew that Liang Xiao was not Gu Lingzhi’s match, Rong Yuan became extremely angry thinking about what the outcome could have been if Gu Lingzhi had been holding a normal Spiritual Sword instead of an Earth-Level Spiritual Sword. Gu Lingzhi could have been in extreme danger and Rong Yuan wanted so badly to tear Liang Xiao apart. Although he controlled his expression, he could not control the gloomy aura that was emanating off him.</p>
 <p>“Rong Yuan, how about we forget about this? After all, a sword has no eyes and Liang Xiao can only blame himself for not being strong. What is important now is to find a physician for him.” Sensing something wrong with Rong Yuan’s expression, Ding Rou tried to mediate.</p>
 <p>“Forget it?” Rong Yuan chuckled coldly, “No matter what Lingzhi has done wrong recently, she’s ultimately still my official fiancée. If not for his evil intentions to begin with, how would he have ended up like this? On the other hand, I want to ask Ding Wei. As their leader, how do you think you should be punished?”</p>
 <p>With this interrogation, not only the people from the Dayin Kingdom, but everyone was also slightly confused.</p>
 <p><em>Rong Yuan had obviously shown his loss of interest in Gu Lingzhi, why is he suddenly protecting her?</em></p>
 <p>As Ding Rou and Ding Wei both grew up in royal families, they could guess what the issue was. Like what Rong Yuan said, Gu Lingzhi is still his official fiancée and what Ding Wei did was akin to challenging him. What more when Rong Yuan had a past relationship with Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>From an outsider’s point of view, it seemed like Rong Yuan had been taking extra care of her, his ‘savior’ and ignoring Gu Lingzhi. However, only her and Ding Wei knew the efforts she had gone through to make Rong Yuan stay with her.</p>
 <p>She always knew that Rong Yuan had always sincerely liked Gu Lingzhi. If not, she would not have set up that whole scene of sacrificing herself for Rong Yuan to make him feel guilty and indebted to her.</p>
 <p>In the original plan, she had only intended to pretend to save him. It was just that she as well as the people she hired, had underestimated Rong Yuan’s abilities and could only sacrifice her life to make him stay.</p>
 <p>Thereafter, she then took the chance to confess to Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>However, she was rejected by Rong Yuan the minute she told him about her feelings. She then pleaded with Rong Yuan to treat her affectionately while she recovers and not tell anyone the truth as to round off the infatuation she had for him all these years.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan was also very trustworthy and did not bring this up to anybody. He even hid it from Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>After realizing this, Ding Rou then made use of a woman’s jealousy and intentionally created the façade that she and Rong Yuan had something going on. Gu Lingzhi had fallen for it and in the few times that they were with Gu Lingzhi, the two of them had always parted ways unhappily. Rong Yuan had also slowly showed his displeasure with Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>When Ding Rou had pretended to fall a few days ago, she thought that Rong Yuan had finally seen the ugly mask of Gu Lingzhi’s jealousy. Thereafter, the way Rong Yuan treated Ding Rou had clearly changed and was no longer as skimpy as before. He even silently accepted when she subtly showed her interest for him.</p>
 <p>The day before, Ding Wei had taken the chance to drink with Rong Yuan and tried to probe for the situation between him and Gu Lingzhi. Rong Yuan had shown his unhappiness with Gu Lingzhi and did not seem as determined on her as before.</p>
 <p>All these made Ding Rou feel that along with the rumors she had spread, Rong Yuan would ultimately get tired of Gu Lingzhi and come to her. However, today’s scene seemed to reignite the spark between Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi. After all, she was officially his fiancée and he could not see her get mistreated. Just like the malicious rumours surrounding Gu Lingzhi, Rong Yuan had already came up with a plan. Although he seemed like he did not care, he already had a card up his sleeve.</p>
 <p>Thinking of all these, Ding Rou was slightly annoyed with Liang Xiao. This fool who thought he was so smart. It would be okay if he had succeeded in cutting off Gu Lingzhi’s arm, but now it was his own arm that was cut off and he even caused Rong Yuan to pay attention to Gu Lingzhi once again. <em>What a wastrel!</em></p>
 <p>So many things ran through Ding Rou’s mind in a mere few seconds. She immediately put on a reprimanding face and looked at Ding Wei, “Brother, what are you doing? Liang Xiao brought this upon himself. No matter how angry you are, you cannot vent your anger on Lingzhi!”</p>
 <p>In a mere few sentences, Ding Rou had made her brother’s impatience seem like it was out of concern. She then turned towards Gu Lingzhi, “Lingzhi, I hope you don’t mind. My brother has always been rash. He is just upset that we have lost such a great student and he doesn’t mean you any harm.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi stared at her blandly and did not miss out the things she did just to make it seem like she was a good person. <em>Ding Rou has certainly spent a lot of effort trying to make Rong Yuan irritated with herself. Since that was the case… then she should just play along. She should not let her down right?</em></p>
 <p>“No bad intentions?” Gu Lingzhi looked harshly and scorned, “I thought that it was you who ordered Liang Xiao to cut off my arm.”</p>
 <p>“How can you think that way? Lingzhi, you’ve misunderstood me. We should be like sisters and get along.”</p>
 <p>“Who wants to be your sister?” Gu Lingzhi scoffed. Ding Rou purposely said words to disgust her and she did not mind being rude, “My father only has me and Linglong. Princess Ding Rou, you can’t spout nonsense. Kinship cannot be taken lightly.”</p>
 <p>These scornful words caused Ding Rou’s face to change and Rong Yuan had to force himself not to laugh.</p>
 <p>He loved and hated this lively version of Gu Lingzhi after they had cleared things up.</p>
 <p>“Rong Yuan, does Lingzhi not like me? Then in the future, when we…” Ding Rou was not someone that was easy to deal with. Immediately after being shot down, she had turned to Rong Yuan to complain, speaking in a tone as if she was extremely confused. Yan Liang, who had been standing beside them and listening to the conversation, could not help but say, “The Third Prince of the Xia Kingdom can only have one official wife. Could it be that the princess wants to give herself as a concubine?”</p>
 <p>Ding Rou’s face could not look any more sour.</p>
 <p>Sensing the people around them increasing and almost no one was paying attention to the current ongoing battle anymore, Rong Yuan frowned and coughed out, “That’s enough. Those that have yet to compete, go to the competition grounds and wait. Those who don’t have a duel today, then please leave. Stop standing around and making so much noise.”</p>
 <p>He then turned towards Gu Lingzhi, “Follow me, I have something to say to you.”</p>
 <p>Without waiting for a response, he then grabbed her hand and pulled her out of the arena. Ding Rou hesitated and exchanged glances with Ding Wei. She then followed along, bringing with her one servant girl. Before she could take more than two steps, she was held back by Yuan Zheng.</p>
 <p>“Sorry to offend you, Princess, His Highness has something to discuss with the Princess Consort. He will give you an explanation later.”</p>
 <p>Ding Rou was delighted<em>. Did Yuan Zheng mean that… Rong Yuan was going to tell Gu Lingzhi about them?</em></p>
 <p>Rong Yuan dragged Gu Lingzhi all the way to their dorm before closing the door and pulling Gu Lingzhi into a hug. After a long while, he then mumbled, “Lingzhi, I am sorry.”</p>
 <p>If not for him, Liang Xiao would not have been so harsh and she would not have to bear being ridiculed by Ding Rou and everyone else.</p>
 <p>Heaven knew how flustered he was when he received the news from his subordinates and immediately rushed to the arena. It was only until he saw Gu Lingzhi standing, perfectly unharmed, that he could relax. He then heard that someone had wanted to hurt Gu Lingzhi and had never felt more useless in his life.</p>
 <p>If only he was as powerful as the Emperor of the North Qiu Kingdom, then he would not have to go about and put on an act with Ding Rou, much less allow Gu Lingzhi to suffer.</p>
 <p>“Just bear with it a little more. It will be a month at most, and then you will no longer have to put up with them.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi frowned slightly as Rong Yuan was squeezing her too hard. She resisted the urge to push him away and patted his head. In a similar way to how he always comforted her, she did the same to him, “Don’t worry. As long as your heart is true, I don’t care about what other people say.” The only people that could hurt her were those she cared about.</p>
 <p>The two of them enjoyed each other’s embrace for a while before Rong Yuan let Gu Lingzhi go. In a surprised tone, he then asked, “Are you already an Earth-level Weapon Forger?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi nodded as she grinned, “Although Zhang Kuihan was secretive, but he revealed quite a few useful things and I managed to successfully breakthrough.”</p>
 <p>Although Gu Lingzhi said this casually, but to become an Earth-level Weapon Forger before she was even twenty years of age was extremely impressive. It was a standard that 80 percent of Weapon Forgers could not reach even if they tried very hard. Even Rong Yuan who was already used to being impressed by her, could not help but be surprised. He then raised his brows as he took out a bunch of materials used for forging from his Storage Ring. The materials fell in front of Gu Lingzhi. They were all material of good quality that could be used to make Earth-Level Spiritual Weapons. Ever since he was sure that Gu Lingzhi liked him, he had begun to collect materials used to make weapons. To a Martial Artist, it was extremely romantic to receive a Spiritual Weapon personally made by someone you loved.</p>
 <p>“My dear wife, since you are already an Earth-Level Weapon Forger, then I will leave you to make all my future Spiritual Weapons.”</p>
 <p>He acted so naturally that Gu Lingzhi wanted to throw the materials at his face. However, she kept all these precious materials into the Storage Ring.</p>
 <p><em>Only a fool would throw such precious gems away.</em></p>
