 <p>The others heard and lifted their heads. Before, they could only see the two figures from afar and thought that they were two flying beasts. Now that they have become closer, it was discovered to be of a man and woman.</p>
 <p>“Oh my, how can humans fly?” Ban Yue murmured.</p>
 <p>Chen Dong was so excited that he began to speak incoherently, “I heard from the elders that Martial Artists are able to fly. This must be them! The two from the Spirit City!”</p>
 <p><em>If it was really the two of them, they would be saved!</em></p>
 <p>He was certain of this as it was the two of them who rendered their assistance when the Burnt City was in trouble. Although they did not help to the end, the citizens of the Burnt City did not blame them as the other cities were also being attacked by the beasts. It was not possible for them to only care about the Burnt City.</p>
 <p>The whole team cheered when they were able to see the two of them clearly. <em>They were saved! It was really the two Martial Artists from the Spirit City!</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi paused in shock upon being watched by more than a dozen pairs of earnest eyes before stabilising herself and landed with Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>Before her feet could find balance, she heard Chen Dong saying, “Little Chancellor, are you here to save us?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi nodded, “Indeed. Upon hearing that the beasts went on a rampage, the Chancellor has ordered us to escort those who are willing to head to the Spirit City.”</p>
 <p>When Gu Lingzhi had just finished her statement, Chen Dong replied immediately, “Me, I’m willing!”</p>
 <p>Fearing that if he were to reply late, Gu Lingzhi would think that they were unwilling and proceed to abandon them here.</p>
 <p>“In this case, come with me. Don’t resist and I will send you all to a safe place.”</p>
 <p>After Gu Lingzhi had finished speaking, she cast a spell on all of them. Everyone felt that their bodies had become lighter and were then teleported into an earthly paradise.</p>
 <p>Even before the beasts had gone on a rampage, they had never come across such a scenery.</p>
 <p>The sky was white, the lake was milky, the air was fresh and the plants were green. There were even mountains inside. Were they in a dream?</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi’s voice broke their astonishment, “This is one of my space-dimension spiritual treasures, you will stay here temporarily. Let Bian Cheng know if you need anything. I’ll let you all out upon reaching the Spirit City.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, okay.” Chen Dong replied while stuttering. He was still unable to recover from the shock.</p>
 <p><em>A space-dimension spiritual treasure! There actually was such a magical item in this world…&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Upon seeing the group enter a state of disbelief, Gu Lingzhi smiled and turned around before commanding Bian Cheng, “These people will be handed over to you. I’ll continue to search other places.”</p>
 <p>As soon as she said this statement, the ground around them had suddenly risen and formed into a wall of about three to four meters tall. A boundary was created to restrict everyone’s movements. At the same time, she commanded Bian Cheng to take care of these people. They were not allowed to head to other places in fear of disturbing those from the Spirit City from cultivating.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, the Spirit Plants inside - every bunch of them - were Gu Lingzhi’s treasures. If one or two bunches were to be accidentally destroyed by these people, she would be in anguish.</p>
 <p>After commanding briefly, Gu Lingzhi then withdrew from the Inheritance Space.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan, who was stationed outside, smiled upon seeing her. He chuckled and asked, “Done?”</p>
 <p>“Done.” Gu Lingzhi laughed and took Rong Yuan’s outstretched hand before flying into the air once again.</p>
 <p>Rescuing people could never be delayed. Since the Pan Family had already known that the Inheritance Space was in her hands, she did not care whether the Inheritance Space would be exposed. It was convenient to use the Inheritance Space to temporarily settle those they had rescued.</p>
 <p>They had searched for more than half a month. More and more people were being stored into the Inheritance Space.</p>
 <p>On this day, two of them had stopped and rested outside a patch of forest. Rong Yuan sat on a huge rock and roasted the meat of a beast skillfully while Gu Lingzhi was washing and cutting some fruits. A series of careful footsteps were heard from the forest.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi stopped her movements and lifted her head towards the direction in which the sound had come from. A woman wearing a water-blue dress could be seen holding the corners of her skirt and walking over timidly.</p>
 <p><em>What a beautiful lady</em>, Gu Lingzhi secretly praised. Her eyebrows were cyclically arched above her bright almond-shaped eyes. She pursed her thin rosy lips before looking at them timidly. Upon perceiving Gu Lingzhi’s gaze, the lady smiled sheepishly and asked softly, “Can I come over?”</p>
 <p>Her voice was as crisp as a warbler.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi unconsciously revealed a benevolent smile, “Sure.”</p>
 <p>The lady thanked her and quickened her steps while pinching the corners of her skirt nervously. She sat on a boulder that Gu Lingzhi had pointed to and spoke timidly, “I have not eaten for a long time, can I eat with the both of you?”</p>
 <p>“Of course, there’s so much food anyway, we won’t be able to finish them.” Gu Lingzhi laughed and handed the lady a fruit platter in which she had cut and decorated. The lady gently shook her head and was finally willing to let go of her skirt. She pointed to Rong Yuan’s direction, “I...I want to eat meat.”</p>
 <p>After saying that statement, she bowed her head embarrassedly, seemingly afraid to look at Gu Lingzhi’s expression.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was amused by her behaviour, “The meat is not fully cooked yet and can’t be eaten. Eat some fruits to fill your stomach first.”</p>
 <p>“It’s not done yet?” The lady pursed her lips in disappointment and reluctantly took a piece of fruit from the platter to chew on.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi smiled, “I’m Gu Lingzhi, what’s your name? Why are you alone here?”</p>
 <p>The lady moved the fruit away from her mouth and replied bashfully, “My name is Xiao Yu. I was originally fleeing with my family but was separated from them a few days ago.”</p>
 <p>“Seperated?” Gu Lingzhi repeated the word and studied the lady quietly. She glanced at Rong Yuan before striking up a conversation with her. However, Xiao Yu was staring at the piece of meat Rong Yuan was roasting the whole time such that Gu Lingzhi did not know whether to laugh or cry. After Rong Yuan had roasted the meat, he cut a large piece and handed it over to her.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yu’s eyes brightened immediately upon receiving the meat. Before Gu Lingzhi could warn her that it was scalding hot and ask her to be careful, Xiao Yu was already holding the barbecued meat and eating it with big bites. She smiled shyly while eating, forming a striking contrast from her brutal table manners.</p>
 <p>After finishing the meal, Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan planned to continue their journey and find people who were in need of help. Xiao Yu expressed that she wanted to go along with them.</p>
 <p>“I am separated from my family and do not know whether I can find them again. Can I...come with you both?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi looked at Rong Yuan and hesitated.</p>
 <p>This girl named Xiao Yu appeared to be pure and harmless, but the timing of her appearance was too coincidental and appeared at a time in which they were about to eat. She claimed to be separated from her family yet her clothes were clean and tidy. Not a single strand of her hair was disheveled, making her seem like a rich lady who was on an excursion.</p>
 <p><em>But in this situation, who would be in the mood for an excursion?</em> Not to mention that Xiao Yu was not surprised at all when Gu Lingzhi revealed her name.</p>
 <p>It was not that Gu Lingzhi was narcissistic, but the names of her and Rong Yuan have spreaded all over the city in recent years. It can be said that they were known to everyone. This was particularly evident when they were searching and rescuing people. Everyone they met knew who they were upon hearing Rong Yuan and her name. Why was it that only this suspicious Xiao Yu was ignorant?</p>
 <p>Unless she had already recognised their identities and was intentionally befriending them. Gu Lingzhi did not know whether to bring such a person along with them.</p>
 <p>“Are you unwilling to?” Xiao Yu blinked her eyes and asked, “I will be very obedient and won’t disturb you. It is very desolate here, moreover, there are beasts wrecking havoc. Are you really going to let a weak lady roam alone outside?”</p>
 <p>If Xiao Yu was just an ordinary lady, Gu Lingzhi absolutely would not bear to let her be alone. But in this case whereby there was obviously something off with the other party, she had no choice but to bear with it.</p>
 <p>“Let’s bring her along.” Rong Yuan spoke suddenly. When Gu Lingzhi looked over doubtfully, he whispered, “I doubt that she will be able to play any tricks.”</p>
 <p><em>Such confidence.&nbsp;</em>But Rong Yuan indeed has such capabilities.</p>
 <p>There will always be a solution to every problem. Maybe this lady had recognised them and wanted their protection such that she had acted this way?</p>
 <p>After figuring this out, Gu Lingzhi smiled at Xiao Yu and moved her into the Inheritance Space.</p>
 <p>The scenery in front of Xiao Yu suddenly changed and caused her to be greatly frightened. But upon seeing the surrounding scenery and the rich spiritual power in the air, her eyes twinkled and she asked excitedly, “Where is this place? Why is the spiritual energy so strong here? You actually have such a magical item.”</p>
 <p>“It’s just a space-dimension spiritual treasure. You can live here with a peace of mind. I’ll let you out when we reach the Spirit City.”</p>
 <p>“Okay, I’ll stay here and won’t go anywhere!” Xiao Yu replied happily. Her eyeballs spun around and was full of curiosity towards the Inheritance Space.</p>
 <p>“Have you sent her in?” Rong Yuan asked.</p>
 <p>“Yes, I’ve let Bian Cheng watch over her so that nothing will happen.” With that, Gu Lingzhi squinted at him and asked, “Why did you want to take her along? Are you charmed by her?”</p>
 <p>“What did you say?” Rong Yuan lightly pushed her head as he found it funny and ridiculous. “If she really needed our help, it’s fine to take her along. If she has any other ill intentions, she will still find another chance if we do not take her along now. We might as well have someone guarding over her now and figure out what her motive is.”</p>
 <p>“That’s true.” Gu Lingzhi shrugged her shoulders and set off with Rong Yuan once again to search for people in need.</p>
 <p>One month later, Gu Lingzhi had already sent more than ten thousand people into the Inheritance Space. The two returned back to the Spirit City as they were running out of space to hold anymore people.</p>
 <p>The two were preparing to leave after placing the people they had found in designated districts but were stopped by a sudden voice.</p>
 <p>“Lady Gu, can I go with you? I am unfamiliar with this place, I’m afraid…” Xiao Yu pitifully gripped onto Gu Lingzhi’s clothes and looked at her expectantly.</p>
 <p><em>Sure enough, there was a conspiracy.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was a little disappointed as Xiao Yu’s character was still quite likeable. There were many people in the Inheritance Space who had a good impression of this shy girl.</p>
