 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

</div>
<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">In the following days, Gu Lingzhi was repeatedly challenged by numerous students, both guys and girls. Some were intentionally ordered by Tianfeng Wei while others just wanted to join in on the fun. In less than ten days, the number of Challenge letters that Gu Lingzhi received exceeded 200.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">At the same time, another issue that caused a huge commotion in the school was related to Qin Xinran.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">On the second day that Gu Lingzhi was challenged, Qin Xinran started challenging over ten people every day. Everyone thought she was crazy. She challenged people the same way people challenged Gu Lingzhi -- by issuing Challenge Letters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">No one knew whether it was a coincidence but everyone who was challenged by Qin Xinran would always be someone that also issued a challenge to Gu Lingzhi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi heard about this matter and could not understand the motives behind Qin Xinran’s actions. However, she brushed it off as long as Qin Xinran did not plot against her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“It is about time to give everyone a reply,” Gu Lingzhi muttered to herself as she counted the number of Challenge Letters she had received. Her hopes of achieving enough points seem to be possible now. She decided that tomorrow, she would not submit to these maltreatments any longer. It was time to give them a surprise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Hence, to the surprise of the student that issued Gu Lingzhi a challenge the following day, Gu Lingzhi did not walk away silently like she usually did. She stared straight at them and said, “I accept.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“How can this be possible? I am a Level Seven Martial Student, I will not be pressured by her.” Troubled, she shifted her weight between her legs as she became determined to show Gu Lingzhi who was boss in the Battle Arena!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The news that Gu Lingzhi had accepted a challenge quickly spread throughout the school as this was something that concerned too many people. There were also people that started a bet on how long Gu Lingzhi would hold out before she accepted a challenge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Once this news spread, many who heard it were extremely surprised. Ye Fei on the other hand was extremely pleased. Being a business-minded person, she had taken the chance to create the betting system. Being able to have first-hand information to what Gu Lingzhi was going to do was priceless and certainly not a money-making opportunity she would miss.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">When Gu Lingzhi first heard about this, she gave a slight look of disapproval towards Ye Fei’s money mindedness. However, when she came around, she also silently bet whatever she had on exactly ten days. Tianfeng Jin had also taken all her valuable and did the same.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Ye Fei could only take out a small portion of her valuables to bet so as to not increase suspicions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">She then excitedly started the new bet -- whether Gu Lingzhi would win or lose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Hence, once Gu Lingzhi accepted the challenge, a bet on whether Gu Lingzhi would win or lose quickly became a popular thing to do in the school.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The three people in Gu Lingzhi’s dorm naturally bet on Gu Lingzhi winning. Surprisingly, both Xin Yi and Qin Xinran also bet on her winning. Someone from the top four students on the Stone Tablet of the Training Tower had also made a huge bet on Gu Lingzhi’s victory. This caused Ye Fei to wonder if someone amongst the three of them was secretly leaking out information. Otherwise, why would anyone else believe that Gu Lingzhi would win?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">With regards to that, the reason why Ye Shuisheng had bet that was because he believed in Tianfeng Jin not Gu Lingzhi. If Gu Lingzhi was someone who was only good in Alchemy, she would not have gained the approval of Tianfeng Jin and be able to live under the same roof as her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">There were many others that had also thought of this possibility. However, they refused to believe that someone who had just discovered her Spiritual Roots could be more outstanding than students that had been in the school for over a year.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Soon, this battle which raised a sensation in the school was scheduled to start promptly at the Battle Arena once afternoon classes ended.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Looking at Gu Lingzhi standing in front of her on the Battle Arena, Fan Xiang said in a charitable voice, “If you don’t want to lose badly, you can admit defeat now. After all, even if you lose, you will not get points deducted.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi’s expression shifted slightly as she replied blandly, “We will only know who wins and who loses after the fight.” She then turned to the teacher-in-charge, Yuan Chun, and asked, “Teacher, may we begin?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Yuan Chun who was still looking at the commotion replied, “Yes, you may begin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">He was also curious what abilities she had. After all, she had caused such a big fuss just a few weeks after entering the school. Furthermore, she was personally invited into the school by the Third Prince and even received the approval of the only Demigod Senior Mu Yang?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Others may not know this, but on the day that Gu Lingzhi went into the admission office, he clearly saw the look of approval in Demigod Senior Mu Yang’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“Hmph, then do not blame me for not showing mercy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">With a valiant look, Fan Xiang took advantage of her strength and charged towards Gu Lingzhi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“It’s shameful to use a weapon while battling someone whose cultivation is lower than yours,” Ye Fei’s mocking voice could be heard from the crowd. She then placed her hands around her mouth as she shouted, “Go for it Lingzhi! Let these bunch of bullies see what you are truly made of!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">After all, the bets could not be changed once the battle has started, so Ye Fei was not at all worried that the bets would be changed when people realised Gu Lingzhi’s true potential.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">It was as if Gu Lingzhi responded to Ye Fei. Before Fan Xiang could laugh at Ye Fei’s blind faith in Gu Lingzhi, she was thrown off the Battle Arena by one heavy blow from Gu Lingzhi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The Battle Arena suddenly fell into a deafening silence as everyone could not believe their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">A Level Seven Martial Student could not even last a few minutes against a Level Three Martial Student and was even thrown off the Battle Arena. Were they seeing things?</span></p>
