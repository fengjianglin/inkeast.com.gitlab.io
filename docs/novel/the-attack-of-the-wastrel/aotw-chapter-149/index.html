<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>When she had first refined the Spirit Cleansing Pill, Gu Lingzhi had already consumed one. She used the opportunity of cleansing her Spiritual Roots to raise her cultivation by three levels, breaking through to become a Level Nine Martial Student.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi’s cultivation speed was unprecedented and probably would not be replicated by anyone else even in the future.</p>
 <p>Her strength was improving so rapidly that some of the medicine she had refined previously were becoming irrelevant. For example, the Spirit Essence Bath had pretty much no observable effect anymore.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Tianfeng Jin and Ye Fei’s cultivations also rose explosively after they consumed the Spirit Cleansing Pill. For Tianfeng Jin especially, she was nearing the threshold between the Martial Student and Martial Practitioner ranks prior to this, and with the help of the pill and a few other medicines, she immediately broke through into the early Martial Practitioner realm.</p>
 <p>Ye Fei was not as high-levelled as Tianfeng Jin and with the help of the pill, she reached the peak of the Level Ten Martial Student rank, lacking just a little bit more to break through. As for Qin Xinran, she immediately returned to her own room to consume the Spirit Cleansing Pill.</p>
 <p>Sitting in her own room, Gu Lingzhi could feel the constant waves of energy coming from the two rooms beside her. She never expected the disturbance to be this huge, for when she had consumed the pill herself, she did so within the Inheritance Space and any spiritual energy fluctuations that had been released were all contained within the space.</p>
 <p>However, the spiritual energy fluctuations from Ye Fei and Tianfeng Jin’s rising cultivation levels, along with the residual medicinal energy from the pill, surged and created a dense, violent fluctuation of spiritual energy in the house. This caused Gu Lingzhi to become slightly panicked, and she immediately prepared to react to any unwelcome situations.</p>
 <p>Indeed, the following events proved that her worries were not unfounded. Not long later, a group of students with more sensitive spiritual perceptions had gathered outside their house in order to find out what had happened.</p>
 <p>“Ye Fei and Tianfeng Jin are both in the midst of a cultivation breakthrough. Could everyone please head back to where you came from, so as not to influence their concentration?” Gu Lingzhi asserted rather forcefully. This was because she noticed that a few of the more daring students were already planning to force their way into the residence to see for themselves what was going on.</p>
 <p>“And who are you to order me around, hmm?” Immediately, someone challenged, in response to Gu Lingzhi’s words.</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Gu Lingzhi turned to see who had spoken and saw that it was Mu Niansi. A few months had passed since they last met, and Mu Niansi had become a Level Eight Martial Student.</p>
 <p>“Based on the fact that I am one of the residents of this household,” Gu Lingzhi calmly replied.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi had the confidence to go head to head with a Level Ten Martial Student, much less Mu Niansi, who was a Level Eight Martial Student.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, it’s true that you are one of the owners of this residence, but no matter what, we are still students of the Royal School. When such a strong fluctuation of spiritual energy is coming from here all of a sudden, it’s only natural that we want to see what is going on. Otherwise, who knows if something will happen that may affect the rest of us, right?” Mu Niansi argued.</p>
 <p>“Yes, exactly! The spiritual energy this time is extremely violent, it doesn’t feel anything like someone breaking through. We need to check it personally to make sure,” a couple of students immediately concurred, adding on to what Mu Niansi said. Gu Lingzhi could see that none of them believed her claims that her two housemates were merely experiencing a breakthrough.</p>
 <p>“I’ve already said that they’re breaking through. Are you telling me you want to force your way in?” Gu Lingzhi knew there was no point trying to convince these people with her words, and decided to take a harsher stance. She did not believe that they would still insist on forcing their way in if she made it clear that she wasn’t going to budge.</p>
 <p>“So what if I am?” Mu Niansi countered. “How dare you make such a ruckus and think that you can stop us from finding out about it?”</p>
 <p>Mu Niansi signalled to the rest of the crowd using her eyes, indicating for them to force their way in together. Even if Gu Lingzhi had the right to stop them from entering the house, it did not matter because they had many people. Even if they did not force their way in, they could still make things difficult for Gu Lingzhi. Frankly speaking, she did not really care what Ye Fei and Tianfeng Jin were up to because what she really wanted to do was to make trouble for Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>As it was close to the end of the day, male students were not allowed in the female dorms, so there were only girls left in here. Among the female students present, a number of them had been told off by Third Prince not to make trouble for Gu Lingzhi, and they did not dare to cause too much trouble normally. Now, they had a perfect opportunity to mess with her, how could they let it slip by? Exchanging glances, they began contemplating how to use the chance to deal with Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>Just as the fight was about to break out, a lazy voice resounded nearby, “Lingzhi, what’s going on?”</p>
 <p>Hearing that voice, Gu Lingzhi immediately relaxed. Looking at the person who spoke, she said, “These people are trying to force their way into my residence.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, there’s really such a thing happening?” Rong Yuan raised an eyebrow, looking at the group of female students who didn’t dare to meet his eyes.</p>
 <p>“I didn’t know that our Royal School advocated such behaviour, such as breaking into other people’s residences,” Rong Yuan said. Then, not giving any of them the chance to make excuses, he immediately proclaimed, “Gathering unlawfully, breaking into someone else’s residence, threatening a fellow student, for this, twenty points will be deducted from everyone. Also, tomorrow morning, everyone is to report to the administration office for their punishment. Those who don’t show up will have double the points deducted for every day they are late.”</p>
 <p>Hearing Rong Yuan’s announcement, the students everywhere sucked in their breaths, and it was clear that many were unwilling to accept it. Immediately, Mu Niansi objected, “Third Prince, you can’t show favouritism to Gu Lingzhi because of the relationship between the two of you. In the first place, it was because there was a violent disturbance of spiritual energy coming from her residence, which was why we came to verify the situation.”</p>
 <p>With a hasty look in her eyes, Mu Niansi immediately added on by calling on some friends for support, “Fan Xiang, isn’t that so?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, absolutely, we had no choice but to come. Given how strong the spiritual energy fluctuation was, we had to check if there was any danger!” Being called out by Mu Niansi, Fan Xiang could only harden her heart and reason. Even as she said this, however, she looked at the Third Prince with hidden yearning in her eyes.</p>
 <p><em>What did Gu Lingzhi do to deserve the Third Prince’s attention? A year ago, she was still just a piece of trash! How could she have obtained everything that Fan Xiang desired?</em></p>
 <p>However, when he heard what the students had to say, Rong Yuan’s mouths curled up into a sneer, as he responded, “So, based on what you are saying, I’m in the wrong for not letting you girls force your way in?”</p>
 <p>Fan Xiang instinctively wanted to nod her head, but when she saw the cold look in Rong Yuan’s eyes, she immediately froze and turned towards Mu Niansi for help.</p>
 <p><em>This useless person! How was she fit to run errands for Tianfeng Wei?!</em> Yet, even as this thought flashed through Mu Niansi’s mind, she turned to the Rong Yuan and explained, “Third Prince, it’s not that we definitely have to go in and see for ourselves. It’s just that we wanted to be sure of what’s going on, so we……”</p>
 <p>“Oh, I never knew that we had to report to the other students whenever we were going to make a cultivation breakthrough,” a voice suddenly cut in. This voice belonged to Ye Fei, and she continued, “Well, I’m deeply apologetic that I’ve never picked up the habit of reporting to other people what I’m up to.”</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Gu Lingzhi immediately turned around and saw Ye Fei beaming with delight. Standing there, Ye Fei obviously had yet to properly stabilize her cultivation at the peak of the Martial Student rank, and the aura she released made everyone stunned speechless.</p>
 <p>“You’re a Level Ten Martial Student? Am I seeing things? I remember that this afternoon, she was still a Level Nine Martial Student. How did she reach the peak of the tenth Level in such a short time?”</p>
 <p>“It’s got to be that burst of spiritual energy earlier! She probably took some medicinal pill that forcefully raises her spiritual energy, allowing her to breakthrough so quickly. That’s definitely it!”</p>
