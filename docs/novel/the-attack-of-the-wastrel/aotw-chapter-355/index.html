 <p>The Spirit City banned outsiders from living in it. Anyone who lived in the city for a day would need to pay a very high price. Gu Lingzhi, Rong Yuan and Guan Yue’s plan was to infiltrate the enemy territory and gain their trust to allow them to gain the privilege of staying in Spirit City for free.</p>
 <p>As Wei Lingshu explained further details on what was required of them, the two quickly agreed to him. This made Wei Lingshu suspicious and he wondered why his journey this time was so easy.</p>
 <p>Observing the hesitation from Wei Lingshu, Rong Yuan laughed, “I will tell you the truth, we do not have much spirit stones left.”</p>
 <p>The two men from Spirit City and He Qiuyu were stunned and they tried to hide their urge to laugh. Their eyes watered up and they smirked. The two knew that there was no way spiritual energy could be regained in Lost Lands but they spent it so mindlessly. It was common news that the two used valuable spirit stones and Spiritual Medicines to exchange for a bunch of useless items. Men who did not consider the consequences of their actions were useless regardless of how high their cultivation ranks were.</p>
 <p>The richer one was, the dumber he was. Their families must have spoilt them and supported them to get their high cultivation ranks. With such an impression and stigma formed against the two, the three others unknowingly allowed their guards against the two to drop.</p>
 <p>Later, Wei Lingshu informed the two of a departure time before he returned to the Spirit City with the other man.</p>
 <p>Once the pair left, He Qiuyu praised the two and complimented them for their decision. She claimed that it was rare for Spirit City men to personally come down to recruit men.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan had a new impression of He Qiuyu, she truly was a manager with her good ways of speaking.</p>
 <p>When the couple returned to the headquarters of the Langya Troop, the members surrounded them and poured questions onto them.</p>
 <p>Lu Heng placed his hand on Rong Yuan’s shoulder and happily greeted, “I knew that you could complete the missions successfully. How could the missions on the mission board stop the both of you?”</p>
 <p>“Of course. With Seventh Brother and Eighth Sister’s strength, they can accomplish anything, not to mention the missions on the mission board.” Jiang Xinghai agreed.</p>
 <p>“The bunch of you really know how to suck up to them. Seventh Brother and Eighth Sister just returned, you should prepare some food for them. Look, Eighth Sister seems to have grown skinnier, she should eat more.” Xing Mei’er pulled Gu Lingzhi’s hand and nagged at the rest.</p>
 <p>Lu Heng gasped, “Oh no, I would not have noticed if Fifth Sister did not mention it. Eighth Sister does seem to have grown skinnier. Seventh Brother, it must be your fault. How can you neglect her even if you are focused on the missions?”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan rubbed his nose in embarrassment and Gu Lingzhi shot him a glare. It was true, it was his fault.</p>
 <p>Because of the situation with the North Qiu Kingdom, the two had not been intimate with each other for a long time. After a near death experience, it was only natural that their feelings for each other grew stronger and they would be more intimate with each other when they were alone. Aside from the time when they were doing the missions, Rong Yuan had not let Gu Lingzhi rest. However, she could not scold Rong Yuan there in front of the crowd and Rong Yuan shyly said, “I deserve Second Brother’s scolding. I will definitely make it up to her.”</p>
 <p>Lu Heng may seem rash and inexperienced at times but he had lived for more than two hundred years already. He was comfortable with Rong Yuan addressing him as Second Brother and he burst into laughter.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a serious voice interrupted the chatter among the crowd, “Seventh Brother, Eighth Sister, come here for a moment.”</p>
 <p>It was Lu Yuan, and Rong Yuan could guess what he wanted to speak with them about. Without hesitation, Rong Yuan pulled Gu Lingzhi and led her over to Lu Yuan.</p>
 <p>Once they entered the room, Lu Yuan closed the door and took out the box that Rong Yuan gave him from a drawer. He pointed to the secret martial technique and said with a stern face, “I do not understand this.”</p>
 <p>This left Rong Yuan at a loss for words, he had originally thought that Lu Yuan called them over to express his thanks to them. However, he could not help stifling a laughter at Lu Yuan’s unexpected statement. Rong Yuan took the book over and patiently explained it to Lu Yuan.</p>
 <p>Bored, Gu Lingzhi sat at a corner and she noticed that the spiritual energy around Lu Yuan was that of a Level Two Martial Student. This speed of cultivation was fast and given a few years in the outside world, Lu Yuan would be invited to the Royal School.</p>
 <p>Regardless of spiritual cultivation or physical body cultivation, talent played a huge part.</p>
 <p>Through Rong Yuan’s explanation, Lu Yuan had all his concerns dispelled and he thanked Rong Yuan sincerely. “Seventh Brother, I am very grateful that you gave me this martial skills technique book. If you need any help in the future, I will not hesitate to lend you a hand.”</p>
 <p>“You’re too kind,” Rong Yuan quickly helped Lu Yuan up and said, “This martial arts technique is a common technique and it is useless to me. I am after all a member of the Langya Troop already and the stronger the troop, the more advantageous it would be for me. It is a win-win situation, and I should help you as much as I can. You don’t have to thank me.”</p>
 <p>Although Rong Yuan had been humble, Lu Yuan and Rong Yuan both knew that Rong Yuan would be able to attain many benefits in the Lost Lands with his own strength even without handing over the martial arts technique. The Langya Troop benefited more from Rong Yuan giving the martial arts technique to them. Could the other troops members learn the martial arts technique as well?</p>
 <p>Lu Yuan could not help twitching his lips slightly, “Seventh Brother, what do you mean?”</p>
 <p><em>How could Rong Yuan tolerate being in a club that was not strong? How could he be in a troop that was ranked third in the Lost Lands?</em></p>
 <p>Lu Yuan expressed his thanks to Rong Yuan on behalf of the troop and he left the room with his heart filled. He could not wait to share the martial arts technique to the rest of the men!</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi stared after the open door and asked, “Are you trying to nurture them?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan knew their strength well even though others may not. The martial arts technique could be beneficial in exposing the club members to cultivation and hence raise their strength. They would also be able to use Storage Rings. But Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan had the Inheritance Space! The thick spiritual energy there was enough to train a few people to become Demigods. Rong Yuan had his own intentions and plans.</p>
 <p>He dipped his head down and laughed, “My wife is truly smart. You guessed it before I even said anything.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan had to admit that he had his intentions in sharing martial techniques with Lu Yuan. While Lu Yuan did have a good character, Rong Yuan needed a few trusted aides. Although they had found a lead on how they could leave the Lost Lands, no one was trustworthy. If leaving was so easy, why were the men in Spirit City still there after so many years? As such, Rong Yuan decided to plan ahead and gain the trust of the troop members.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Lu Yuan had been in distress when he received the martial arts technique from Rong Yuan as he had suspicions on whether Rong Yuan had evil intentions. However, he was glad when Rong Yuan gave him the permission to share the martial arts technique with the other club members.</p>
 <p>When Lu Yuan returned to the hall with a sheepish grin stretched widely across his face, the club members stared at him in confusion. Lu Yuan called the elders forward and shared with them Rong Yuan’s actions. Chaos immediately erupted in the hall and Lu Heng roared with excitement as he hugged the martial arts technique book closely to his chest and chanted, “Is this a martial arts technique? My god! I didn’t think I would get the chance to have it after so many years. Even the Chancellor does not have one. Am I dreaming?”</p>
 <p>“You are dreaming. Hurry back and sleep, perhaps you may become a Demigod in your dream.” Xing Mei’er played along with him and snatched the martial arts technique book from him. She flipped through the book and scanned it quickly, her hands shook from the excitement.</p>
 <p>The elders were the oldest members in the club but the typically calm and serious elder, Wang Kuan could not help jumping out of his seat and snatched the manual out of Xing Mei’er’s hands as well.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, the manual was passed from person to person. Each of their eyes welled up and Jiang Xinghai broke out into an uncontrollable cough as he tried to calm himself down. The Steel Pen in his hand shook and he said, “I think that we should make a few manuals of the copy so that everyone can have a copy to read.”</p>
 <p>“Right, Sixth Brother is right, make copies of it right now.” Lu Heng immediately threw the manual to Jiang Xinghai’s hands and hurried him to start copying the manual. This allowed everyone in the hall a moment to breathe.</p>
 <p>His pen moved quickly across paper as he carefully copied the manual. Jiang Xinghai had not been so excited in his life and he blurted, “Seventh Brother, you are my lucky star.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, Seventh Brother.” Many others agreed.</p>
 <p>After Jiang Xinghai made the first copy of the manual, the elders discussed who would practice it first. Lu Yuan watched with amusement at the sight of the elders being like kids arguing over their beloved toy. He shook his head and raised a point, “Are you guys forgetting that there is no point in cultivation if there is no spiritual energy?”</p>
 <p>This made everyone jolt to their senses. Lu Yuan’s reminder was like pouring water over a fire and many hearts broke in that instant.</p>
 <p>Lu Yuan coughed lightly and brought his hands forward. A few heaps of brightly lit spirit stones appeared.</p>
 <p>Everyone’s mouth gaped open and they stared at the spirit stones in amazement.</p>
