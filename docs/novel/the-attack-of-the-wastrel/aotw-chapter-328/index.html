 <p>“Ridiculous! How can you be so useless as the Crown Prince of a kingdom? How can you be so cowardly in the face of a crisis?” Pan Luming snapped angrily and his suspicion towards ‘Pan Wen’ disappeared in that instant.</p>
 <p>“Chief Duke…” ‘Pan Wen’ took the chance and stepped in front of Pan Luming. Pan Luming suddenly felt a strange energy wrapped around him and while he wanted to resist the energy, his body failed to move as he wanted. The moment the energy surrounded him, the scene in front of him flashed and he found himself teleported to another area.</p>
 <p>“This is…” Pan Luming stuttered in surprise and his mind ventured to a terrifying thought.</p>
 <p>It was a small world that was filled with a dense and thick spiritual energy. Could this…be the Inheritance Space that the Spirit Tribe members inherited from their Tribe Leader?</p>
 <p>If that was the case, he was right. <em>The Spirit Tribe had appeared again!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Pan Luming’s excitement lasted only for a brief second when a large net of fire appeared suddenly in front of him and threatened to burn him.</p>
 <p>“Too lousy.” With a scoff, Pan Luming drew his hands forward in front of him and tore the fire wall produced by Rong Yuan apart. Sparks scattered in all directions and burned the grass in the Inheritance Space.</p>
 <p>The fire wall that Rong Yuan had released was not meant to hurt Pan Luming. Just as the fire wall was destroyed, Rong Yuan sprinted forward with a metal spiritual energy attack, he threw all he had into this attack.</p>
 <p>“Rong Yuan?” Taking a close look at his attackers, Pan Luming jumped in shock. He recognized the Third Prince of Xia Kingdom. Rong Yuan should be with his wife in the Alliance, what was he doing here now?</p>
 <p>With all the confusion and question in his head, Pan Luming suddenly felt the ground below him crumble apart to form a crater. Sharp needles pointed out below him. This was the ambush that Rong Yuan prepared for him.</p>
 <p>At the same time Pan Luming fell through the crater, Gu LIngzhi and Rong Yuan mustered their energy to form numerous sword streaks aimed directly above the crater. A downpour of sword attacks rained down on Pan Luming like a meteor shower.</p>
 <p><em>Boom boom boom!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>As the sword attacks fell down upon the ground, deafening explosions sounded.</p>
 <p>Stuck in the middle of the crater, Pan Luming’s voice echoed, “Aren’t you underestimating me if you think you can be me down like that?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan exchanged a glance before they simultaneously retreated backward. In the next instance, a terrifying blast exploded from underground, swallowing the sword attacks.</p>
 <p>Without wasting a second, Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan raised their swords in their hands and swung it down as hard as they could. Fire and metal sword radiances flashed through the sky and threatened to slice Pan Luming’s body apart.</p>
 <p>Although the peak of the Martial Sage rank was a far cry from a Demigod, it was miniscule compared to the difference between a Demigod and a True God. Even a godly talent at the peak of the Martial Sage realm could kill a Demigod. Senior Mei Ying was a good example.</p>
 <p>Both Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan were recognized as godly talents and when they collaborated, even Pan Luming struggled to protect himself against them.</p>
 <p>“Asshole! You collaborated with an outsider to take me down! Once I am out, I will make sure to get your father to dispose of you!” As he struggled against the attacks, Pan Luming yelled out in rage. Even at this point, he did not know ‘Pan Wen’’s true identity.</p>
 <p>“That is dependent on whether you will make it out.” ‘Pan Wen’ smirked. Gu Lingzhi did not bother to reveal herself, there was no harm in letting Pan Luming continue to believe that she was Pan Wen.</p>
 <p>“Ridiculous…!” Pan Luming cursed as he coughed unstoppably onto the ground. His body had reached its limits after thirty years of trying to break through to become a True God. He sustained himself with Spiritual Medicine and elixirs, and rarely took part in battles. At most, he would only live for another hundred years.</p>
 <p>Lord Fashen’s appearance and the unexpected battles against enemies took a toll on his body in recent years. With the dust and fumes from the explosion, he felt as though his lungs and internal organs were being ripped apart.</p>
 <p>The two above him had the upper hand and were relentless in their release of attacks. As Pan Luming struggled to defend himself, over time, more and more dust accumulated around him and he became a disheveled mess. He had never been so exhausted ever since he became a Demigod.</p>
 <p>Pan Luming wanted to use the Life Whip to create three Martial Sage stonemen to help him. However, the Life Whip’s powers were not limitless and it could only create three Demigod stonemen or ten Martial Sage stonemen with a large amount of spiritual energy. The lower the cultivation rank of the stonemen, the more stonemen could be created at once.</p>
 <p>Previously, he had used the Life Whip to create three Demigod stonemen who were currently fighting against Lord Fashen in the outside world. They would only disappear in another fifteen minutes and Pan Luming could only grit his teeth in frustration at his plight.</p>
 <p>Fifteen minutes later, Pan Luming was ready to use the Life Whip again. Grinning inwardly, Pan Luming swished the Life Whip in his hand and readied himself to create new stonemen.</p>
 <p>Golden light flashed in front of him as three stonemen appeared. Pan Luming jumped for joy and quickly ordered the stonemen to attack Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan when suddenly, bright light blinded him. Once Pan Luming reacted, he stared at his empty right hand in shock.</p>
 <p>“My Sacred Weapon! My Sacred Weapon!” Like a mad man, Pan Luming shrieked in horror as he scanned his surroundings for the Life Whip. he spotted a small figure a distance away speeding across the sky with the life Whip in its mouth.</p>
 <p>“Give me back my Sacred Weapon!” Pan Luming demanded and he chased after the small figure with all his might.</p>
 <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As a Duobao Spiritual Squirrel, Zi Zi did not have much other talents other than escaping. Its four paws scampered through the sky at lightning speed and with Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan’s help, Zi Zi left Pan Luming scrambling behind him. At the critical moment, a familiar wave of energy swept over Pan Luming and he immediately screamed, “How dare you!”</p>
 <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">“Why wouldn’t we dare to?” ‘Pan Wen’ triumphantly replied. With a mental thought, Pan Luming was thrown out in the next instant.</p>
 <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In the outside world, Lord Fashen and Rong Huachang were both stunned at the sudden disappearance of Pan Luming along with ‘Pan Wen’. This was different from what they planned. <em>Why did Gu Lingzhi suck Pan Luming into the Inheritance Space?</em></p>
 <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">However, the enemies they were facing did not give them any chance to be distracted. With nervousness in their hearts, the Demigods continued to fight with the stonemen.</p>
 <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Without Pan Luming ordering them around, the stonemen were weaker than they were before. Nonetheless, the stonemen possessed the strength of Demigods and Lord Fashen could not defeat them easily.</p>
 <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Loud clashing sounds rang through the corridors as the battle continued. Even though the walls were soundproof due to the cultivation room, it did not guarantee that men outside would not notice anything. They could not risk being discovered before they defeated Pan Luming and the stonemen.</p>
 <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Just as Rong Huachang and Lord Fashen were in jitters over what was happening in the Inheritance Space, the stonemen in front of them jerked suddenly and turned into ashes.</p>
 <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Pan Liwen cursed at his plight. Pan Luming was teleported away by an unknown power and he could not take on Rong Huachang and Lord Fashen by himself. The outcome of their battle was clear.</p>
 <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">“Finish him up quickly, don’t let others find out.” At the instant that the stonemen disappeared, Lord Fashen dashed towards Pan Liwen for the kill.</p>
 <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Without Gu Lingzhi around, there was no way for them to enter the Inheritance Space and hence, there was nothing they could do to help. As such, they could only deal with the threat in the outside world before they took on Pan Luming.</p>
 <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Pan Liwen turned and ran towards the exit of the room without hesitation but Rong Huachang did not give him a chance to escape. Her body swiftly flew through the sky and she blocked the exit. Smirking at Pan Liwen, she scoffed, “Where are you rushing off to? We have not seen the outcome of our battle.”</p>
 <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In the next moment, sword shadows filled the air and blurred everything in front of Pan Liwen. Pan Liwen released a few desperate sword strikes to no avail and his expression turned horrified as he defended himself against Rong Huachang’s attacks. He desperately tried to pave an escape route for himself.</p>
 <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This was a good choice in theory but he forgot about the most powerful man in the continent, Lord Fashen. Even if his vision was blocked by all the sword shadows, he could estimate where to strike to finish the kill.</p>
 <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>Pss-&nbsp;</em>The sharp sound of a sword cutting through flesh pierced through the room. Time seemed to stop as Pan Liwen’s body jerked violently amidst the dust cloud. His eyes trailed to the wound in his chest to see a sword filled with wood spiritual energy pierced through him. Wood spiritual energy that was supposed to give life now ended Pan Liwen’s life.</p>
 <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">“Liwen…” Pan Luming shouted. He had not expected to see such a pitiful sight the moment he came out of the Inheritance Space.</p>
 <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Pan Liwen was the second most powerful man in the Pan Family behind Pan Luming but he was fatally harmed by a sword filled with wood spiritual energy.</p>
 <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">“Urgh…urgh…” Pan Liwen’s mouth hung open and he tried to stammer out a few words. However, his Elixir Field was quickly being destroyed by the wood spiritual energy that pierced through his body. This foreign energy greedily sucked on his lifeblood and reduced him to a weak and frail state.</p>
 <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">“Lord Fashen, Rong Huachang, I’m going to kill you!” Pan Luming shouted in rage and he ordered the three stonemen that had been thrown out of the Inheritance Space with him to take on Lord Fashen while he targeted Rong Huachang.</p>
 <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Rong Huachang jumped in shock but she managed to avoid his first attack. The sword in her hand shifted and she was just about to return with another attack when she suddenly caught sight of Pan Luming slashing the big door down. He ran for his life as fast as he could.</p>
