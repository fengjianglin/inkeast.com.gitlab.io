 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">When Gu Lingzhi saw the sympathetic look Ye Fei gave her, she knew that Ye Fei had misunderstood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">For this trip of hers to the Royal School, Gu Rong was very generous towards her and gave her not only a huge pile of spirit stones but also a bunch of medicinal ingredients for her to practice with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The reason why her room was so empty was because she was not familiar with the place and did not know where she should arrange her furniture.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“I have enough spirit stones. It is just that I just arrived and haven’t gotten the time to arrange my furniture. This must seem like a joke to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“Oh, so that is the reason…” Ye Fei seemed to breathe a sigh of relief. She then patted her chest valiantly and said, “Let me know when you decide to furnish your room. The largest store in Chiyang City, Ye Store is run by my family. When the time comes, I will give you a 20 percent discount!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi then realized that she was talking to the daughter of the top conglomerates in the Xia kingdom. She grinned, “That’s great, I will be sure to find you when the time comes.” She had a good impression of the carefree and joyful young lady in front of her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Ye Fei plopped herself down on the only decent piece of furniture in the room, the bed, and looked at Gu Lingzhi with her head tilted to the side, “I really don’t understand how those ridiculous rumors about you came about in the Chiyang City. You were clearly invited by the Third Prince for your talent and yet there are rumors that the Third Prince was seduced by your good looks and that was how you made it in. Only idiots would believe such a rumor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi did not realize that the rumors about her had already spread like wildfire even before she entered Chiyang City. Curiously, she asked, “Are there… a lot of rumors about me in Chiyang City?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“Of course, haven’t you heard?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Once again, she looked at Gu Lingzhi pitifully. “That’s right, you didn’t even bring any servants with you, who would help you find out about what’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The look in Ye Fei’s eyes was too obvious, making Gu Lingzhi second-guess her decision to reject the servants Gu Rong wanted to send with her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Was it a mistake?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">&nbsp;But once she thought about how one of her servants had all along been serving Lin Yue-er instead, she pushed the thought out of her mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi preferred her freedom compared to always having to be on her guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“I prefer to be independent and bringing a servant around would be too troublesome.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Ye Fei could detect the slight change in Gu Lingzhi’s mood and very cleverly switched the topic to talk about the Royal School. Once she knew that Gu Lingzhi had signed up for four subjects, the look in her eyes could not even be described as sympathetic. It was more like she felt pain for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">“Why did you choose so many subjects? Did you not know about the rules before you entered?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi shook her head. She only roughly knew how to go about obtaining points and thought that as long as she managed to get 60 points, she would be able to successfully promote to the next year. She did not know that every additional subject would add 60 points to the promotional criteria.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Talking to Ye Fei, Gu Lingzhi also learned several ways of getting around the Royal School’s point system.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">For example, if one did not have enough points, they could buy over points from poorer students that had extra points and arrange for them to intentionally lose. As long as it was not too obvious, the school usually closed an eye to these activities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">In addition, other than earning points from examinations and duels, one could sneak into the Training Towers in the different Districts to earn points.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Each of the five major Districts of the school had a Training Tower that could measure one’s abilities. At every Level, the Training Tower would allocate points according to your performance during the training. Every month, the top-ten performing students in the Training Tower would not only get their names displayed on a Stone Tablet at the main entrance, they would also get 20 points as a reward. This was a good way to earn points.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">What made Gu Lingzhi even more surprised was that Tianfeng Jin was ranked number three on the Martial Student Training Tower’s Stone Tablet. She was slightly popular in school and many had expectations for her to make it onto the Golden List in a few years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi was excited as she heard about the Training Tower from Ye Fei, wondering how she would perform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">As the conversation drew to a close, Ye Fei grabbed Gu Lingzhi’s arm affectionately, requesting for her to make sure to sell any Spiritual Medicine she made in the future to the Ye Store first. If need be, she could also provide the medicinal ingredients that Gu Lingzhi needed. Of course, the money needed for the medicinal ingredients could be repaid from the sales of the medicinal products that she made.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi did not know whether to laugh or cry as she saw Ye Fei’s eyes lighting up at the thought of money. There was no doubt that she was the only daughter of the leader of the Ye conglomerate. At such a young age, she already had a head for business and knew how to get long-term partners.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">This was exactly what Gu Lingzhi was looking for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Just like that, Gu Lingzhi’s first night at the Royal School was spent with Ye Fei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The next day, she headed out to breakfast at the cafeteria with Ye Fei and Tianfeng Jin. After breakfast, she rushed to the Alchemy District to practice while Ye Fei and Tianfeng Jin headed to the Martial Student District to learn about the art of fighting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Following the map of the Royal School that she had obtained as a gift from Ye Fei, Gu Lingzhi took almost half an hour to locate the Alchemy District.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">She did not know if it was just her imagination, but she felt like everyone she passed by was looking at her weirdly. This made her quicken her pace to find her classroom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Fortunately, the Alchemy District was not that big and she managed to find her classroom rather quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">From the outside, it might seem like the classrooms in the Alchemy District was no different from any other place. But once inside, one could notice the differences.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">In a classroom about ten square meters large, multiple pill furnaces were neatly laid out in the dignified Pill Cultivation Rooms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Standing outside the classroom, Gu Lingzhi could very clearly feel the gazes of the people around her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Previously, she had been uncertain whether people were truly staring at her, but this time, she could clearly tell that their gazes were directed at her and she had nowhere to hide.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Then, it was time for class to begin and all the students were present. The teacher also stood at the desk in front of the classroom, ready to start the class.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The teacher in-charge of teaching them Alchemy techniques was a skinny-looking young man who seemed like he was 30 years old. The eyebags on his eyes were so heavy they seemed to droop to the ends of the earth. His cheekbones jutted out and he looked as though he had not slept for ten years. When he saw Gu Lingzhi, he merely rubbed his eyes and randomly pointed her to an unoccupied pill furnace.</span></p>
