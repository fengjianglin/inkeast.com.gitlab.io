<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>After Gu Lingzhi had left the school, it did not take long for her to realize that Rong Yuan was following behind her. She wanted to ignore the fact that he was there, but Rong Yuan immediately caught up with her when he had realized that. He looked at her with a tenderness that was entirely different from how he had regarded the students earlier on during his lesson.</p>
 <p>“I heard that you made it to the top in the Yellow-Level Alchemy Tower rankings yesterday. I did not have a chance to congratulate you yet, why don’t we go to the Bright Silk Eating House to have a drink and celebrate?”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan had to take the initiative to ask her knowing that she would not ask him out.</p>
 <p>“That’s okay, I was just lucky. You must be very busy with your everyday matters, I don’t want to waste your time.”</p>
 <p>“How is it a waste of time if I am spending it with someone I like?” Rong Yuan laughed, “It would only be a waste of time if I spend it doing something else.”</p>
 <p>“But I don’t want to waste my time,” Gu Lingzhi stood there, looking at Rong Yuan seriously. “Just like what I told Su Nian earlier this morning, I am not going to waste my time on relationships while I am studying in the Royal School. If you are bored, you can find some other girl who is willing to spend time with you, but not me.”</p>
 <p>“You think that you’re wasting time when we are together?” Rong Yuan narrowed his eyes. “You really think that I would just spend time on any other girl?”</p>
 <p>“Why not?” From Gu Lingzhi’s point of view, Rong Yuan had favored many different girls before, such as from when he was engaged to Tianfeng Wei, to when he had met the girl who identified herself as the the Black Thorn. He even cancelled his engagement over that girl whom he did not even know how she had looked like. <em>Now, he came back to chase after her, wouldn’t that give her the wrong impression?</em></p>
 <p>“Am I really that kind of person in your heart?” Rong Yuan clenched his teeth, seething with anger. He felt that he had already shown how genuine he was in wanting to win her heart, but he did not think that he was such an unreliable and fickle-minded person in her eyes. <em>He had initially thought that she would give in after some time, but from the way it looks, it seemed that he would need a more effective method to win her heart.</em></p>
 <p>Rong Yuan stepped forward, surprising Gu Lingzhi. He held her waist, not caring about the students who were still around them. He then lowered his head, and kissed her.</p>
 <p><em>Since she had so little faith in him, he had to at least show everyone that she was his, so that no one else would dare steal her away from him.</em></p>
 <p>He had originally kissed her as a form of punishment, but the moment his lips met with hers, it became almost desperate.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was shocked at first. When she felt the forceful sensation on her lips, she immediately fought back and tried to push him away.</p>
 <p><em>Scoundrel, let go of me!</em></p>
 <p>Rong Yuan was so immersed that Gu Lingzhi’s struggling was rather entertaining to him. He even used his tongue and teeth to tease her.</p>
 <p>To think that the Xia Kingdom’s War God who was known as the person who would most likely become a True God was daring enough to kiss a girl passionately in public. It would definitely become a scandal, and in just an instance, the students who were watching immediately erupted in boisterous conversation. They were equally as shocked as Gu Lingzhi, and only recovered when she started to struggle against the kiss.</p>
 <p>It did not take long before they were surrounded by an enormous crowd.</p>
 <p><em>The Third Prince was not a pushover.</em></p>
 <p>When Gu Lingzhi saw the disbelief in the faces of the crowd, she closed her eyes and directed all the spiritual energy in her right leg and wanted to teach Rong Yuan a lesson he would not forget. However, before she could do that, Rong Yuan broke her train of thought.</p>
 <p>“If you really hit me there, you would regret it next time,” Rong Yuan said mischievously.</p>
 <p>Before Gu Lingzhi could retort, a bright piercing streak shot towards Rong Yuan. He reacted fast, holding on to Gu Lingzhi and dodging the streak. When he looked at who had attacked them, Rong Yuan furrowed his brows in bewilderment. “Yan Liang, what are you doing?”</p>
 <p>“Let go of her!” Yan Liang replied calmly, but there was anger in his voice.</p>
 <p>“Oh? When did the Student Union have the right to tell teachers what to do?”</p>
 <p>“She did not give consent!” Yan Liang raised his voice. He stretched his hand towards Gu Lingzhi, wanting to grab her away from Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan dodged it easily once again, raising his eyebrows, “You’re not her, how did you know that she was not willing?”</p>
 <p>“I was not willing!” Gu Lingzhi said agitatedly, “Senior Yan Liang, the Third Prince abused his authority and treated his students unfairly. I suggest that the school revoke his right to be a teacher!”</p>
 <p>From the way Rong Yuan regarded him, Gu Lingzhi guessed that Yan Liang must be the one who was ranked second place on the Golden List – the son of the Demigod General. Therefore, she could so outrightly state her request. In other schools, the Student Union may not be as powerful, but in the Royal School, it was well within the Student Union’s power to strip a teacher of their position.</p>
 <p>However, she had forgotten that the Third Prince was in a complete separate league of his own. How could he be talked about like he was the rest of the other teachers? Rong Yuan faked a laugh and said, “I’m afraid I'll have to disappoint you, Lingzhi. I was specially assigned to be a teacher by the Royal School. I can quit as and when I like, the Student Union has no right to strip me of my position.”</p>
 <p>“That does not mean that you can do whatever you want!” Yan Liang raised his voice in agitation, his eyes full of anger. Rong Yuan narrowed his eyes suspiciously at him, “Yan Liang, could it be that you have developed feelings…”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan did not have to complete his sentence for Yan Liang to understand what he meant. Yan Liang retorted, “So what if I did?”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan’s head instantly started to hurt. <em>How could he not have realized sooner that his Lingzhi had so many suitors?</em></p>
 <p>He had to chase one away earlier this morning, and now there was another one. Su Nian was a small fry to him, it was easy to make him back off; but Yan Liang was different. As the son of the Demigod General Yan Fei, Yan Liang had inherited all the admirable traits and talents of his father, as well as his serious and determined persona. As long as someone like him had his mind on something, he would never give up.</p>
