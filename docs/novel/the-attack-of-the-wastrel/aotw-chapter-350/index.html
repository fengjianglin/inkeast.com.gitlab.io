 <p>Jiang Xinghai took out his weapon, a large pen that was made out of steel. In the blink of an eye, Jiang Xinghai turned from looking like a book worm to a Gold Class Warrior.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan smiled with excitement and he also took out his weapon, the Dragon Sword.</p>
 <p>At the sight of the oddly-shaped item in Rong Yuan’s hands, Jiang Xinghai jumped in surprise and he wondered, “Seventh Brother, is that your weapon?”</p>
 <p><em>Could it be that people from the Tianyuan Continent had taste in such odd-looking weapons? But the items at the Smelt Mountain were not oddly shaped. Strange.</em></p>
 <p>Rong Yuan chuckled as his eyes scanned the sword in his eyes. In a warm voice, he explained, “This is my Dragon Sword, it is a low grade Heaven-Level Spiritual Weapon that my wife made for me when she became a Heaven-Level Weapon Forger.”</p>
 <p>The moment Rong Yuan finished, gasps could be heard everywhere.</p>
 <p><em>Low grade Heaven-Level Spiritual Weapon? A Heaven-Level Weapon Forger?</em></p>
 <p>Even if they had not gone to the Tianyuan Continent before, they knew how the weapons of the continent were graded. A Heaven-Level weapon was equivalent to a Gold Weapon in the Lost Lands. Weapons in the Lost Lands were divided into the Steel, Bronze, Silver and Gold grade with the highest being the Gold grade weapons. The entire Lost Lands only had five items that were of the Gold grade, and this was not even enough for the Glaze Class Warriors in the Lost Lands.</p>
 <p><em>Furthermore, what did Rong Yuan say? His wife was a Heaven-Level Weapon Forger? Didn’t that mean that they had more than one Heaven-Level item with them?</em></p>
 <p>As soon as they heard of this, everyone turned towards Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>When the couple first arrived, they had shown their affection towards each other outrightly. Was Gu Lingzhi the Heaven-Level Weapon Forger that Rong Yuan mentioned?</p>
 <p>If that was the case, the Langya Troop would definitely stand to gain!</p>
 <p>Lu Yuan and Lu Heng had travelled with Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi for a long time but they had never asked them about Weapon Forging. Now that they heard it for the first time and learned that Rong Yuan’s wife was a Heaven-Level Weapon Forger, they instantly glued their eyes onto Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p><em>This was a Heaven-Level Weapon Forger. With Gu Lingzhi, would they be able to get any weapon they wanted in the future?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi knew that the attention was on her and she cleared her throat. “Aren't we here to watch the sparring? Why isn’t it starting yet? The sky is turning dark.”</p>
 <p>This diverted the attention back to the battleground and everyone turned back towards Rong Yuan and Jiang Xinghai. They were eager to see how a Martial Artist battled. However, a few people would occasionally shift their eyes back to Gu Lingzhi as they wondered how accomplished she was.</p>
 <p>Lu Yuan frowned as he heard the conversations among the crowd, “Spiritual energy is very valuable, how can you use it to satisfy their curiosity here? Seventh Brother, don’t bother about them. Just use your physical body strength in this sparring.’</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan waved his hand dismissively and said, “It is alright. Even if I don’t use my spiritual energy, it would be gone after a while. I might as well show them how it is used.”</p>
 <p>There was nothing else Lu Yuan could do at this point and his face turned more serious. Rong Yuan did not leave any face for him by turning him down three times in a row already. <em>Was he doing it on purpose?</em></p>
 <p>All of a sudden, Jiang Xinghai drew the steel pen across the air, aiming for Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan’s body flashed and he calmly deflected the attack. The Dragon Sword swished across the sky and a bright orange colored sword streak burned through the sky. Jiang Xinghai jumped in shock and he increased the strength he placed into his attack. The steel pen fiercely slammed against the fiery dragon sword streak as a rain of sparks poured down from the sky. Jiang Xinghai was enveloped in flames and blazing hotness filled the surroundings.</p>
 <p>“Wow, that’s amazing!” Jiang Xinghai exclaimed with adrenaline amidst the flames that surrounded him. The steel pen flew gracefully across the sky, its speed so fast, it whipped up a tornado that allowed Jiang Xinghai to escape the ball of flames.</p>
 <p>As the fiery ball of flames tore apart, stray flames swept past the spectators nearby and people screamed in fear. Miraculously, the flames did not hurt anyone severely before it died down when it hit the ground.</p>
 <p>People gulped down nervously and they remained in awe at the power of the flames.</p>
 <p>So that was a casual strike made by Rong Yuan but it had already mustered up a strong fiery dragon. How powerful was he at his full strength?</p>
 <p>Jiang Xinghai roared in eagerness and he excitedly asked, “What other moves do you have? Show us!”</p>
 <p>“As you wish,” Like a gentleman, Rong Yuan agreed to the request and changed to utilizing his earth-based Spiritual Roots. Numerous earth walls were summoned and the ground shook violently as the soil was uprooted. Jiang Xinghai lost his footing at the unexpected earthquake and suddenly, roots sprung out of the ground and wrapped around Jiang Xinghai in a vice like grip. Everyone gasped at this sight and they were in disbelief. What would they do if they were Jiang Xinghai? Many knew that they would not survive a fight against Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan knew that he had to put a good show so that people would know his strength. This was to prevent others from trying to spar with him to gain his items. As such, he used all his four spiritual energies - metal, wood, water and fire. Rong Yuan ended the show with a final release of countless earth roots that swept past Jiang Xinghai. With a light smile, he asked, “Is Sixth Brother happy with this?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, yes I am!” Jiang Xinghai exclaimed excitedly and he stared at Rong Yuan with bright eyes.</p>
 <p>“Seventh Brother is amazing. The next time the Tanlang Troop seeks trouble with us, you should throw them onto Smelt Mountain and let them die by themselves.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan smirked. Smelt Mountain was formed based on the array that held that Lost Lands together. Everything that entered the Endless Sea Realm ended up on Smelt Mountain and within seven days, Smelt Mountain would be cleared by the troops in the area. Jiang Xinghai’s suggestion was brilliant.</p>
 <p>However, Lu Yuan laughed bitterly and reprimanded, “Seventh Brother must have used a lot of spiritual energy to spar with you. Arent you going to bring him and Eighth Sister to rest?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, yes, I will lead the way.” Jiang Xinghai remained cheerful and he instantly returned to his serious state. He was truly worried that Rong Yuan’s spiritual energy would be used up.</p>
 <p>The living quarters assigned to Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi was a yard located in the southern area of the headquarters. As they sat in the yard, they relaxed and stared at the lake. A nine feet long bridge was built above the lake and a few men wearing animal skin clothes chatted casually with each other on the bridge. It was a warm and comforting sight.</p>
 <p>Jiang Xinghai chatted with the two for a while before he left. After Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi familiarised themselves with the room, they decided to take a walk around.</p>
 <p>Right as they walked out of the gates of the Langya Troop’s headquarters, they coincidentally bumped into Lu Heng. Lu Heng enthusiastically volunteered to be their guide and shared about the Forgotten City with them.</p>
 <p>Forgotten City was large and it was split into four major areas - north, south, east, and west. The southern area where the Langya Troop’s headquarters was located at was considered an upper class district where only people with status could live.</p>
 <p>The eastern area of the city was the merchant area and it was also the area with most activity. In the north was a large market place where people could exchange and trade goods. Further down to the west was where the commoners lived.</p>
 <p>As she listened to Lu Heng’s thorough explanation, Gu Lingzhi was thankful that she did not turn him down. Otherwise, she and Rong Yuan would have gotten lost in the entire city. For instance, if they had accidentally gone to the west area they would have to walk one big round before they could head to the merchant area.</p>
 <p>Three of them sat on the Dragon Horse carriage and chatted casually as they took in the sights of the city. Time flew by quickly.</p>
 <p>Half an hour later, the group arrived in the merchant area. Instructing the driver to return, the three got off the Dragon Horse Carriage and walked down the streets. As she bumped into men wearing clothes made out of demon beast skin, Gu Lingzhi could not help asking, “Isn’t there cloth here? Why do so many people wear clothes made out of demon beasts’ skins?” When she first met Lu Heng, she had thought that she was in the wrong place.</p>
 <p>Lu Heng sighed, “Eighth Sister, it’s not that. The durability of cloth is too weak and it will tear apart during battle.”</p>
 <p>A sympathetic look crossed Gu Lingzhi’s eyes. The Lost Lands had to struggle due to their limited resources. With no spiritual energy, it was not possible for them to make clothing using spiritual energy. The technique to make the clothes in the lost Lands would be energy intensive and it would be much more efficient to use the thread and needle to make clothes. After all, the skin of demon beasts were more durable and they could provide strong defense.</p>
 <p>Further down the street, Gu Lingzhi noticed a merchant shop and beckoned the other two to head in.</p>
 <p>The boss of the shop sat behind the counter and greeted the two casually. However, the moment he spotted Lu Heng, he smiled brightly and walked forward.</p>
 <p>“Isn’t this the Second Elder of the Langya Troop? It is my honor that you came to visit my shop!”</p>
