 <p>“Do you think we do not want to?” Lu Heng bitterly laughed, “The bottom of Endless Sea Realm is a bottomless pit. At the beginning, many people wanted to leave the place. However, those who tried to leave would end up dead and their corpse would pile up on Smelt Mountain. Even those Martial Artists in the Spirit City are unable to leave and many people gave up a long time ago. On the other hand, what about you guys? Why did you decide to commit suicide through the Endless Sea Realm?”</p>
 <p>Although the Lost Lands were cut off from the outside world, there were a few lucky people like Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan who were sucked into Smelt Mountain after they died, tainting Smelt Mountain with blood and death. These men gave information to the people in the Lost Lands so they understood that the sea above them was called the Endless Sea Realm. It was famous for being dangerous and no one in their right mind would get close to it. Lu Heng hence assumed that the couple were trying to commit suicide.</p>
 <p>“Who said that we wanted to commit suicide?” Gu Lingzhi frowned. “We were too close to the Endless Sea Realm and accidentally dropped into it.”</p>
 <p>Lu Heng put on an understanding look, “Curiosity kills the cat.” The two wore delicate clothes and he could tell that they were from the upper class. It was only natural that they would be curious about the Endless Sea Realm that was full of its mysteries.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was at a loss for words and she turned to look at Rong Yuan. Rong Yuan must have gone after her when she dropped into the Endless Sea Realm.</p>
 <p>Taking in a soft sigh, Rong Yuan reached into his Storage Ring and gave a low grade Black-Level Spiritual Medicine to Lu Heng, “Thank you for explaining the situation to us. Take this as a gift for introducing the Lost Lands to us. It is dark already, we should…” Before Rong Yuan could finish his sentence, Lu Heng interrupted.</p>
 <p>“You two should stay here.” Afraid that Rong Yuan would misunderstand his intentions, he explained, “You are not familiar with the Lost Lands having just arrived here. It is dark and inconvenient for you two to travel around. Why not stay the night and make your plans tomorrow?”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi were instantly suspicious and they suspected that Lu Heng was a man who was trying to trick them to stay over. His attitude made questions form in their head and they exchanged a look.</p>
 <p>With caution, Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan agreed and entered a room that Lu Heng led them into.</p>
 <p>The two had tried numerous times to summon natural spiritual energy. However, the situation was like Lu Heng described, there was no source of spiritual energy in the surroundings. The only thing that they could use was the spiritual energy in their Storage Rings. Once this spiritual energy ran out, they would be no different from the average man.</p>
 <p>Luckily, Gu Lingzhi’s Inheritance Space was not affected and she and Rong Yuan could enter the Inheritance Space at her own free will. This comforted Gu Lingzhi greatly.</p>
 <p>Regardless of what Lu Heng was planning to do to them, Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan were not afraid of him.</p>
 <p>In a place where spiritual energy did not exist, she and Rong Yuan were considered powerful.</p>
 <p>With this understanding, Gu Lingzhi thought of the outside world and she started to worry, “I wonder what happened to Lord Fashen. They must be worried since we dropped into Endless Sea Realm right? Would Xinran and Tianfeng Jin think that we died? Also, would Ye Fei blame this on Pan Yue? That would be disastrous…”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi muttered to herself and rambled on as she recalled the familiar outside world. Without any warning, there was a high chance they would no longer be able to return. It would be a lie to say that she was not upset. She could only indulge in nostalgia to comfort herself.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a strong arm wrapped around her and a soft voice whispered, “Don’t worry. Fashen will know how to handle things and Ye Fei is no longer the rash girl she was. She would not hate her lover just because of us. We should only worry about how we will return to the Continent.”</p>
 <p>“Return to the Continent?” Gu Lingzhi hesitated, “Do we have a chance?”</p>
 <p>“Others may not have a chance but you definitely can.” Rong Yuan eased the frowns off Gu Lingzhi’s head. The Inheritance Space could still be assessed and there should not be a problem for them to retrieve spiritual energy.</p>
 <p>From what Lu Heng told them, Rong Yuan could make some deductions. The group of Martial Artists that lived in the Lost Lands with the people there were different from them. They must have had a plan to return to the Tianyuan Continent.</p>
 <p>The first reaction of the group when they came was not to leave but to construct a small world there. They only tried to leave the Lost Lands after many years.</p>
 <p>From this point, Rong Yuan guessed that the group had a plan to leave the Lost Lands. However, something stopped them from doing so and they failed every time.</p>
 <p>As Rong Yuan explained this to Gu Lingzhi, she agreed on his deductions and just as they carefully planned what they should do, someone knocked on their door.</p>
 <p>“How are you guys? It’s Lu Heng, our captain wishes to speak to you.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi glanced at each other before he waved his robe aside, stood up and opened the door, “Come in.”</p>
 <p>Although Lu Heng had been with Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi for a few hours, he could not help admiring their looks and he immediately exclaimed at the sight of them, “Wow!”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan’s defined features were similar to Hua Qingcheng’s and he gave off a cold vibe. His sharp facial features were clean and distinct and his muscles peeked through the animal skin clothes. He looked like a cheetah stalking its prey on the grassland. The menacing aura that Rong Yuan gave off as he glared down at Lu Heng sent chills down his spine.</p>
 <p>Knowing that Rong Yuan was not welcoming to him, Lu Heng directly said, “Brother, are you fine with this room? Sorry for putting the both of you under such circumstances. I will get someone to clean up the room tomorrow and I am sure you will be happy with it.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan gave him a side glance and said, “We are planning to leave tomorrow. You do not have to go through all that trouble.”</p>
 <p>“What? Leave tomorrow?” Lu Heng exclaimed in shock, “Brother, did you not remember what I told you? The Lost Lands is different from the outside world, this place…”</p>
 <p>“Shut up,” Lu Yuan snapped and Lu Heng immediately cupped his mouth with his hand and kept silent.</p>
 <p>“Apologies on behalf of him.” Lu Yuan’s lips curved into an awkward angle, he did not smile often and his ‘smile’ gave off a chilling vibe. “Lu Heng told me that you two came from the outside world. What are your plans? If you do not mind, how about you join our Langya Troop?”</p>
 <p>This man spoke to the point and Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi exchanged a glance. They had not expected that they would be invited to join the troop on the first night.</p>
 <p>“If you are afraid that we will take advantage of you because you came from the outside world, you don’t have to worry. Our troop abides by fairness and we will not force you to hand over what you have.”</p>
 <p>“Exactly.” Lu Heng chimed, “Everyone in our troop is good unlike those backstabbing men from the other Expedition Troops. If you want to live long here, you should join us!”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan drummed his fingers on the table nearby and he turned towards Gu Lingzhi, “What do you think?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi only laughed, “It is up to you.”</p>
 <p>After all, there was no place for them to go now and there was no harm in joining the Langya Troop.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan understood Gu Lingzhi’s intentions and he turned towards Lu Yuan, “It should be fine for us to join your troop. However, I would like to know more about the Lost Lands. It will put my heart at ease if I understand more about this foreign place.”</p>
 <p>Lu Yuan nodded in agreement and he began to explain the situation in Lost Lands in greater depth. His explanation was different from Lu Heng’s explanation that morning as he added in his own analysis.</p>
 <p>The two learned that there were five cities in the Lost Lands.</p>
 <p>Aside from Spirit City, there were four cities that surrounded Spirit City, namely the Forgotten City, Crescent Moon City, Burnt City and Wasteland City.</p>
 <p>They were currently in a small town called Luochuan Town in the Forgotten City. Since this town was close to Smelt Mountain, there would be items that appeared from the outside world occasionally and thus, many Expedition Troops would frequently patrol the area. As the third largest Expedition Troop in the Forgotten City, the Langya Troop was bound by this convention as well, so one of their units was stationed here. Everyday, members of this unit were assigned with the task of going to the Smelt Mountain to obtain treasures.</p>
 <p>Lu Heng added that Lu Yuan and him rarely headed to Smelt Mountain personally and he went the previous day only because Lu Yuan had another task and there was nothing for him to do. He had not expected that he would pick up two strangers at the mountain and Lu Heng awkwardly scratched the back of his head and looked down. He stared at Lu Yuan out of the corner of his eye, anticipating some praise and compliments from his captain.</p>
