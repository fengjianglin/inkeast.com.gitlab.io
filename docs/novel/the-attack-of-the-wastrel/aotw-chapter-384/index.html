 <p>Lin Rong turned towards Gu Lingzhi, “Right, my grandfather said that tonight, he will pass to you the list of names of the people that you can bring into the Inheritance Space to train. He wanted me to tell you that if you have any suitable people in mind, you can also bring them in to train with the others.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi nodded her head, she knew that Lin Chongyuan was just covertly trying to make it convenient for her.</p>
 <p>Now that she had found her family, the Inheritance Space that she possessed had turned into the hope of the entire Spirit Tribe. She no longer had the freedom to bring anybody into her Inheritance Space as and when she wished to. Furthermore, several carefully selected seedlings would be sent into her Inheritance Space to train starting from tomorrow onwards. If she wanted to bring other people in, she would have to be more careful from now on.</p>
 <p>The next morning, Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan followed Lin Rong to the main hall of the Chancellor’s Manor. The main hall was full of people, just a casual glance revealed at least a hundred people. A majority of them were children, with only a few adults amongst them. When Gu Lingzhi entered, they looked at her fanatically.</p>
 <p>“These are the best youths that we have carefully selected from our Spirit Tribe. They have already sent their greetings to their family and are ready to follow you for training.” Lin Chongyuan explained to Gu Lingzhi. She had been shocked by their fanatic stares.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi nodded her head silently. She walked further in and sized up these people who were going to enter her Inheritance Space. There were many familiar faces among them, many of them had left a deep impression on Gu Lingzhi during the Spirit Essence Awarding Ceremony. All those children who had successfully become a Level One Martial Student in a quarter of an hour were all present. It can be said that all the children who had been selected, were those who had performed well during the Spirit Essence Awarding Ceremony. Even the adults that were selected had outstanding qualifications and cultivation speeds. Evidently, in order to nurture as many high-ranking Martial Artists as possible, the Chancellor and the officials had spent a lot of effort to select these people.</p>
 <p>“It’s been so many years. I’m finally able to witness such a grand gathering of countless Spirit Tribe youths once again.” The Duobao Spiritual Squirrel stood on Gu Lingzhi’s shoulder and sighed emotionally.</p>
 <p>By the side, Lin Chongyuan and the others bowed to Zi Zi, “Greetings to our ancestor.”</p>
 <p>Zi Zi nodded its head reservedly. Once it had discovered that Spirit City’s citizens were all descendants of the Spirit Tribe, it was unable to control itself and came out of the Fenlan Painting to boast about his status.</p>
 <p>Since Lin Chongyuan was able to identify the Fenlan Painting, naturally he also knew about the records left behind in the ancient books and about the Duobao Spiritual Squirrel that had been sealed into the Fenlan Painting by the Sacred Maiden. When Zi Zi had announced its identity, he had pulled Chu Jiang along in shock to perform a respectful bow to it.</p>
 <p>Since it was the spirit pet of the Sacred Maiden then, it was definitely worthy of their respect.</p>
 <p>In the subsequent days, it was as though Zi Zi had turned into a mouse completely. From time to time, he would rush out from the Fenlan Painting only to run around everywhere and look at the Spirit Tribe’s situation every day or so. After it found out that Lin Chongyuan wanted to send a group of people into the Inheritance Space to train, it excitedly expressed its desire to guide this group of people in their training.</p>
 <p>On Gu Lingzhi’s shoulder, Zi Zi was so excited that its eyes were turning red with excitement. Gu Lingzhi looked at Zi Zi and silently gave her condolences to the children in the Inheritance Space.</p>
 <p>Based on Zi Zi’s combat dregs, what kind of exceptional students would it be able to guide? It would be better to let Bian Cheng put in more effort and train this group of children properly. Although Bian Cheng did not have an outstanding character and had betrayed his country, he had considerable ability in leading troops and his personal strength was decent as well. With the addition of Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan’s pointers, it would be sufficient.</p>
 <p>However, Gu Lingzhi had actually underestimated the influence of the “<em>virtuous</em>” old squirrel. Under the combined guidance of Bian Cheng, Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan, the strength of the group of children and adults had skyrocketed. Despite that, the influence of the trouble-making squirrel caused each of them to have headaches from dealing with the trouble it caused. It almost tore down the entire Inheritance Space.</p>
 <p>Of course, that was something to be worried about in the future. For now, the group of children and kids were very obedient.</p>
 <p>Fifteen minutes later, Lu Heng and Jiang Xinghai were brought in by the Chancellor’s guards. When everyone saw the two of them, they immediately understood the reason. Back then, when Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan had been mistaken as the murderers, Lu Heng and Jiang Xinghai’s actions and behaviour had been witnessed by everyone there. It was the two of them who had wholeheartedly viewed them as family. Thus, they had no objections against letting them enter the Inheritance Space as well. In truth, they were in no position to have any opinions anyway. After all, back then, these two as outsiders, had believed in Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan. Yet, the rest of them, as members of the Spirit Tribe, had not believed in them. Come to think of it, they should actually be embarrassed of themselves.</p>
 <p>After they had waited for another half an hour, everyone who was supposed to enter the Inheritance Space had arrived. Lin Chongyuan spoke some encouraging words then waved his hand to inform them to start preparing to enter the Inheritance Space.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi received the signal and immediately connected to her Inheritance Space as she cautioned everyone, “Do not resist.” A strong wave of suction power emanated from Gu Lingzhi’s body.</p>
 <p>Lu Heng and Jiang Xinghai did not know why Rong Yuan had called them here. He had only said that there was something incredibly good and if they wanted to be a part of it. Hence, the two of them had turned up just like that. Now, there was suddenly a strong wave of suction power and before they could even understand what was going on, they had appeared into another world with the rest of the people around them.</p>
 <p>The world in front of them made them feel as if they were hallucinating. What kind of world was this? This was the first time that they had ever seen skies that were not dull blue in colour. Without that dull blue colour, the plants all looked to be a bright, verdant green. Furthermore, the spiritual energy in the air was extremely dense. A few diligent children had already started to meditate.</p>
 <p>When the others saw this, they also reigned in their shock and started to sit down to meditate as well.</p>
 <p>During the selection process, they were already aware of the responsibility that they had to shoulder. Now that they were in an environment with such dense spiritual power, they knew that they could not slack off.</p>
 <p>Within moments, the only people left standing around were Gu Lingzhi, Rong Yuan, Lu Heng, Jiang Xinghai, Lin Chongyuan and Chu Jiang.</p>
 <p>While Lu Heng and Jiang Xinghai were still at a loss, everyone else went off to do what they needed to do.</p>
 <p>Seeing the people seated around, Jiang Xinghai gulped and asked, “Seventh Brother, this is the good thing you were talking about?”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan raised an eyebrow, retorting, “You mean letting you cultivate here is not good enough for you?”</p>
 <p>“No! It’s the greatest!” Lu Heng immediately shouted. “Seventh Brother, Eighth Sister, you are too amazing to be able to find such a great place!”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi did not know how to respond to that.</p>
 <p>Seeing Lu Heng’s excited state, no one knew what other nonsense he was going to say. Jiang Xinghai hastily clamped a hand over his mouth and dragged him over to an empty spot, reminding him, “Let’s cultivate!”</p>
 <p>After saying this however, Jiang Xinghai looked hesitantly at Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>Noticing his hesitation, Rong Yuan immediately figured out Jiang Xinghai’s concerns. He patted Jiang Xinghai’s shoulder, saying, “Relax, I’ll offer this opportunity to the leader and the rest, if they also want to come here to cultivate. You and Second Brother can just focus on cultivating for now.”</p>
 <p>That immediately put Jiang Xinghai’s worries to rest, allowing him to wholeheartedly focus on cultivating.</p>
 <p>In just a short while, the Inheritance Space had become a huge cultivation room for everyone.</p>
 <p>Lin Chongyuan laughed helplessly, before turning to Gu Lingzhi. “Come on, let’s take a look at the techniques you were talking about.”</p>
 <p>The small hut within the Inheritance Space had long since transformed into a beautifully decorated building, occupying the centre of the Inheritance Space. With just a thought from Gu Lingzhi, she transported their group in front of the building.</p>
 <p>Because of the importance of these techniques, Gu Lingzhi had set up a Restrictive Shield around it. Besides Rong Yuan, no one other than herself would be able to step even one foot into the building. Today, Lin Chongyuan became the third person to be able to do so.</p>
 <p>As they entered the library on the second floor, Lin Chongyuan’s eyes widened. Seeing the bookshelves filled with precious manuals filled him with shock. He had never been more certain that spring had come again for the Spirit Tribe, after a long period of bitter suffering.</p>
 <p>Lu Heng, Jiang Xinghai, and the rest of the Spirit Tribe members thus settled down in the Inheritance Space. This space was much better than what they had before. Using their earth-based spiritual energy, they constructed simple homes for themselves. Some chose to stay alone while others decided to stay with friends.</p>
 <p>Whenever they met any difficulties, they would look for Bian Cheng, who was completely under Gu Lingzhi’s control, or Gu Lingzhi herself. When they were bored, they would just mess around, and when they were homesick, they would request for one day of leave to visit their families.</p>
 <p>Just like that, two years had gone by.</p>
 <p>In this period, two more members of the Langya Troop joined them in the Inheritance Space. They were Xing Mei’er and Wang Kuan. Meanwhile, Jiang Xinghai swapped out to take charge of the Langya Troop. Some of the members of the Spirit Tribe’s upper echelon also used a similar kind of rotation for their cultivation.</p>
 <p>Of course, as the leaders of Spirit City, they could not lose out to the rest in cultivation!</p>
 <p>The one who had the most freedom here was Lin Rong. Because of her special status, she treated the Inheritance Space like her backyard, coming and going as she pleased. Whenever she wanted to go, she would bother Gu Lingzhi to take her out, and this made Gu Lingzhi extremely annoyed. She complained numerous times to Rong Yuan, wondering if her mother was just like this as well, when she was still alive.</p>
 <p>Every time this happened, Lin Rong would flick her hair and retort, “But of course. We have the same blood in us, naturally, we would be alike in many ways.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi, however, was not just going to accept this. She mercilessly pointed out, “But Granny said that Mother was extremely obedient when she was young, never causing them to worry even once. On the other hand, you’re just a troublemaker, never sparing a thought for them even once.”</p>
 <p>This caused Lin Rong to begin chasing Gu Lingzhi, raising a ruckus throughout the Chancellor’s Manor.</p>
 <p>….</p>
 <p>“Brother, brother! Trouble! There’s a lot of fierce beasts!” Suddenly, a woman with a beautiful figure and messy clothing rushed into the study of the Burnt City Chancellor’s Manor, yelling to get the attention of the man writing at the desk.</p>
 <p>Le Yan unhappily put down his work, glaring at the girl. “Isn’t it just a few beasts? What are you all flustered for?”</p>
 <p>“This…It’s not just a few! There are a lot of them!” Le Yao was already in a panic, and thus, seeing Le Yan’s disinterested and lazy look, she decided to just drag him out to see for himself, saying, “Just come and see it for yourself!”</p>
