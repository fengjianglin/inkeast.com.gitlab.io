 <p>Everyone’s gaze landed on Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>The rumors surrounding Gu Lingzhi was such a big matter and it was impossible for Rong Yuan to not know. However, he did not do anything about it and allowed the rumours to become wilder. <em>Wasn’t he worried about Gu Lingzhi’s reputation?</em></p>
 <p>Other than the rumor about Gu Lingzhi, there was also another rumor that was spreading around recently. Thinking about the other rumour, everyone started to feel conflicted.</p>
 <p>His official fiancée was the subject of malicious rumours yet he always went to find another woman. It was as if he treated his own dorm as a guest house and stayed more frequently at the Dayin Kingdom’s dorms.</p>
 <p>Regarding his recent behavior, a substantial number of people had started to predict when Rong Yuan would come out and officially annul his engagement with Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>“You do not need to care about the North Qiu Kingdom. Before the competition ends, the only thing that you should focus on is how to improve your condition and win as many battles as possible.” Ignoring Lang Jingchen and his clear intention to trigger him, Rong Yuan said a few more instructions before asking everyone to leave.</p>
 <p>With his attempt to stir a fight ending up in flames, Lang Jingchen left Gu Lingzhi’s dorm dejectedly. He turned back to see the living room still lit up by candlelight and the corners of his mouth pulled up into a sly smile.</p>
 <p>Although he did not know who was the one that started the rumors regarding Gu Lingzhi, that did not stop him from making use of the situation. Rong Yuan’s new attitude made him think that Rong Yuan had grown bored of Gu Lingzhi. Thinking of his own situation where he had been forced by his clan to take a concubine from the Situ family, he started to feel depressed. Tianfeng Wei was starting to change her attitude towards him, but because of this, she had gone back to treating him indifferently.</p>
 <p>Without even needing to think, he knew who was the one that caused this. To think that he had thought the Third Prince was actually serious about Gu Lingzhi. It was just a fling after all. He wondered how the entire Xia Kingdom would respond to the Third Prince cancelling his engagement for the second time. <em>Would they still support him like before?</em></p>
 <p>Looking at those that remained after Lang Jingchen had left, Rong Yuan sighed as he said without changing his expression, “If there is nothing, then please leave. There are still competitions tomorrow, don’t you all need your rest?”</p>
 <p>He was about to bring Gu Lingzhi up to the second level to rest when he was held back by Tianfeng Jin.</p>
 <p>“Do you have something to say?” Rong Yuan looked back at her and responded as if he could not see the anger in her eyes.</p>
 <p>“Yes,” Yan Liang replied instead. The look that he gave Rong Yuan was stern and controlled, “Aren’t you going to explain yourself to Lingzhi?”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan had been going to see Ding Rou everyday. Although she did not say it, it was obvious to anyone observant that Gu Lingzhi has been slightly upset these few days. As for the rumors that had been spreading, their words did not hold as much weight as Rong Yuan’s. The rumors had spread to this extent precisely because Rong Yuan did not say anything.</p>
 <p>“Explain? What do I have to explain?” Rong Yuan retorted, “The rumors are for ignorant people.”</p>
 <p>“Your Highness, has your brain stopped working because of lust? Are you not able to see what Gu Lingzhi has been putting up with and the indignance she is feeling?” These agitated words were from Su Nian. It seemed as if his emotions were on a high as he was normally very introverted but was the first one to scold Rong Yuan today.</p>
 <p>“Although you are indebted to Ding Rou, Gu Lingzhi is your official fiancée. Look at how you are always running over to Ding Rou, have you mixed up their positions?”</p>
 <p>“Oh? Then what do you suggest I do?”</p>
 <p>Seeing Rong Yuan really asking him for his opinion, Su Nian froze for a while before answering, “Of course you should accompany Lingzhi.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan nodded, “And allow others to say that people from the Xia Kingdom are ungrateful and do not know how to treat people they are indebted to? Or that we don’t care about those who have risked their lives to help us?”</p>
 <p>The night of ambush had been intentionally dramatized. Ding Rou had only protected Rong Yuan, but now, it seemed as if Ding Rou had risked her life for Rong Yuan. Rong Yuan, the only witness, could not do anything to dispel the rumors in case he was looked upon as ungrateful.</p>
 <p>Su Nian coughed, “But… but you can’t ignore the rumours. Do you know what they are making Lingzhi out to?”</p>
 <p>“I thought I already made myself clear. Only ignorant people believe in the rumors. I can’t change people’s minds.”</p>
 <p>“That… but…”</p>
 <p>Seeing how Su Nian was struck speechless by a few words from Rong Yuan, Gu Lingzhi sighed as she took the chance to drop the hand that Rong Yuan was holding. Brushing the stray hairs from her face, she gave a shaky smile, “What His Highness says is right. Only ignorant people would believe the rumors. As long as I do not care about them, no matter how dramatic the rumors become, it is not my business. On the other hand, tomorrow is the day of the drawing lots and the first wave of competitions are for the Martial Student category. You should rest and conserve your energy.”</p>
 <p>The warm coaxing voice of Gu Lingzhi made Su Nian feel more sympathy for her and a tinge of red filled his eyes.</p>
 <p>Looking at him made Gu Lingzhi want to laugh, a complete change from her upset state these past few days. <em>He was not the one that was wronged, why did he look more upset than her?</em></p>
 <p>“Be obedient and go.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi patted Su Nian’s head as if she was older than him and encouraged him to leave. Looking back, Rong Yuan’s gaze fell intensely on the right hand that Gu Lingzhi used to pat Su Nian’s head.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi rolled her eyes. <em>Every day, he went and hung out with another woman, yet he could not stand it when she was slightly affectionate to someone else?</em></p>
 <p>As she drifted into thought, Rong Yuan took her right hand and used a white handkerchief to wipe it as if there was something dirty on her hand. After he was done, he brought her hand to his lips and lightly kissed it, “I’m disinfecting it for you.”</p>
 <p>Seeing what Rong Yuan just did made the people around them hesitate, unable to continue questioning him.</p>
 <p>Objectively speaking, other than his inaction with the rumors and him finding Ding Rou daily, Rong Yuan was behaving as before.</p>
 <p>“Your Highness, I don’t care what you are planning, but you had better not hurt Lingzhi, if not…” Dressed in red, Xin Yi’s beautiful face was filled with threat. His red lips protruded out as he seemed to make a vow, “If not, I will make sure to do my best to seek justice for her!”</p>
 <p>Another one promising to protect her for no reason.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi’s heart palpitated as she was once again shocked by Xin Yi’s action.</p>
 <p>“You won’t have the chance,” Rong Yuan looked deeply into Xin Yi’s eyes, “If you have the time to think of things that won’t happen, then you should spend more time gathering your energy. You better not lose the first battle and embarrass me.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan was exaggerating. There were so many people from the Royal School that made it to the finals this round, creating talk among people. Even if Xin Yi lost the first round in the finals, it would not be embarrassing. On the contrary, it would allow others to be relieved.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan then did the same to bid Tianfeng Jin and Yan Liang goodbye, leaving only Nie Sang, an outsider in the living room with them. Rong Yuan rubbed his head in pain, “Why? Are you also here to accuse me?”</p>
 <p>Who knew that it would be so stressful to have a fiancée that was so popular among men? Dealing with all these people who wanted to seek justice for Gu Lingzhi was taking a toll on his energy.</p>
 <p>Nie Sang simply smiled looking extremely innocent. However, what he said could make people grind their teeth in anger, “No, I stayed only because it was entertaining.”</p>
 <p>A crack appeared in Rong Yuan’s expression as he suppressed the urge to physically kick him out. Warmly, he remarked, “So are you done watching?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, I am done,” Nie Sang nodded and simply turned. Patting the imaginary dust off his butt, he walked out. It was rare to see Rong Yuan so triggered and being held accountable by so many people. Even if Rong Yuan decided to be petty and hold a grudge against him, it would be worth it.</p>
 <p>When everyone finally left, there was no one to stop Rong Yuan from dragging Gu Lingzhi to the second level.</p>
 <p>“Don’t you have anything you want to ask me?” Rong Yuan asked her as he guided her to the bed.</p>
 <p>Thinking of the empty room beside hers these past few days, Gu Lingzhi squeezed her lips together, “…Have you been looking after Ding Rou overnight these few days?”</p>
 <p>“Yes,” Rong Yuan replied softly as he looked at Gu Lingzhi neutrally. “She was injured because of me, I had no choice but to stay.”</p>
 <p><em>His reply...</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi shut her eyes as she controlled the emotions that were threatening to burst out of her.</p>
 <p>“Is there no one else from the Dayin Kingdom that can take care of her?”</p>
 <p>“There is,” Rong Yuan sounded helpless, “But Ding Rou doesn’t like them to attend to her.”</p>
 <p><em>So she asked you, a prince, to take care of her?</em> Gu Lingzhi remained silent but her eyes clearly reflected her thoughts.</p>
 <p>Unable to bear seeing the hurt and suspicion in Gu Lingzhi’s eyes, Rong Yuan pulled her into his embrace and said comfortingly, “Don’t think too much. No matter how outstanding Ding Rou is, I only have you in my heart. When her injury is better, I will not go over everyday anymore.”</p>
 <p><em>Will he really not go over when Ding Rou recovered?</em> Leaning into Rong Yuan, Gu Lingzhi pursed her lips. Up till the end, Rong Yuan refused to speak about the rumors and she continued to pretend as if she was not affected by them.<em>&nbsp;In the past, when did Rong Yuan ever allow anyone to defame her?</em></p>
 <p>“I want to sleep now, you can go.” Speaking softly, Gu Lingzhi pulled herself out of Rong Yuan’s embrace.</p>
 <p>Suddenly losing her warmth, Rong Yuan’s gaze looked at her, unwilling to leave before saying, “You should rest early, I will not disturb you.”</p>
 <p>As he closed the door, the warm look that he wore when facing Gu Lingzhi disappeared, only to be replaced with a solemn one.</p>
 <p>“Your Highness, are you really not going to tell the Princess Consort about your plans?”</p>
 <p>Yuan Zheng, who was guarding the door could not help but ask. He could not bear to see how Gu Lingzhi was looking more and more forlorn as the days passed. Her usual gentle and elegant demeanor had morphed into one mimicking a withered flower within a mere few days. Only the Third Prince could bear to be so harsh.</p>
 <p>“No,” Rong Yuan said in a cold and harsh voice, “Since she likes to bear with it, then let her bear with it!”</p>
 <p>Yuan Zheng backed down quietly. He was conflicted. <em>Aren’t you the one that is hurting when the Princess Consort is hurt?</em></p>
 <p>The next day, the group from the Xia Kingdom entered the finals under Rong Yuan’s lead.</p>
 <p>There were over fifty finalists in every category of the finals. The way that the finals was going to be held was via drawing lots. What was different was that losing a battle did not mean getting eliminated. Instead, the final rounds were going to involve points.</p>
 <p>Winning a battle would earn the winner three points. A draw would award each party one point and no points would be given for losing.</p>
 <p>Everyone would have three battles and the top ten contestants after these three rounds would advance into the grand finals.</p>
