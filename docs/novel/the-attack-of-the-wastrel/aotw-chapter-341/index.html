 <p><em>He’s finally here!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi heaved a long sigh of relief upon hearing this voice. She had no intentions of committing suicide earlier and was simply delaying time in a way that would induce the least amount of losses.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan saw through her intentions. Otherwise, his reaction would not have been so calm.</p>
 <p>The North Qiu Kingdom had only used a day’s time to set up this battle and threatened them with Rong Huashang and Pan Yue. Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan were not foolish and had already used the Communication Conch to contact Lord Fashen, who had already reached the borders, upon sensing that something was wrong.</p>
 <p>Even if Lord Fashen were to advance at full speed, it would take an entire day for him to arrive from the border of the East Qing Kingdom.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, Lord Fashen had arrived before the situation worsened.</p>
 <p>Compared to Gu Lingzhi’s joy, Pan Luming’s mood was as dark as a cloud cover. Glancing sorrowfully at Lord Fashen, he asked with a rough voice, “Why are you here?”</p>
 <p>He had clearly sent a few Demigods and numerous soldiers to cloud Lord Fashen’s judgement such that everywhere would have the traces of Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan. He was afraid that Lord Fashen might interfere upon hearing something. He did not expect that the worst case scenario would happen. With the addition of Lord Fashen, it would be difficult to bring Gu Lingzhi away.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing his inquiry, Lord Fashen fished out his Communication Conch respectfully and answered naturally, “Of course I’ve rushed over after hearing the news.”</p>
 <p>“News?” Pan Luming stared intensely, “Who leaked the news?”</p>
 <p>Only a few confidants had known of their plan whereby Rong Huashang and Pan Yue were used as bait to lure Gu Lingzhi. The remaining people only know of this after the battle had ensued, thus, there was no chance for this matter to be leaked. Then the source of origin for Lord Fashen’s news would be from one of his confidants.</p>
 <p>Thinking of this, Pan Luming glanced at those who had known of this matter beforehand, looking to see if he can obtain any clues. But the expression of his confidants were even more surprised than him.</p>
 <p>“Chief- Chief Duke.” One of them stared at Pan Luming and asked boldly, “Don’t you know that the item Lord Fashen is holding, is used for long-distance communication?”</p>
 <p><em>Long-distance communication?</em> Pan Luming’s face turned green and he did not say anything further but everybody could already tell from the color of his face. The Communication Conch had become a mode of communication for long-distance communication between all forces, yet Pan Luming knew nothing of this!</p>
 <p>It was no wonder that Lord Fashen was able to arrive on time. Previously, they had not heard of Pan Luming bringing this matter up and thought that he had already thought of a countermeasure. However, it’s actually because he did not even know that such a thing existed!</p>
 <p>“So…Are you all trying to say that the information was not leaked by you but Lord Fashen had figured it out by himself?” Pan Luming glared at the surrounding confidants who had lowered their heads. He laughed angrily, “Looks like I have wronged you all.”</p>
 <p>After he had finished laughing, the expression on his face suddenly changed to a sinister one, “When did such an object appear in the Continent? Why didn’t anyone tell me about it!”</p>
 <p><em>Wasn’t it because they thought you knew and did not dare to spew nonsense?</em></p>
 <p>But no one dared to say such a thought out loud and chose to endure Pan Luming’s anger instead. Who would have thought that this had never been brought up in front of Pan Luming before?</p>
 <p>The North Qiu Kingdom fell into a state of embarrassment while Lord Fashen pretended to have not seen it and laughed cheerfully, “It’s okay if you had not known about this, at least now you do. This item was retrieved by Lingzhi from the remains of the Spirit Tribe, its functions are great. The various major events that have occured on the Continent over the past few decades, have been transmitted efficiently by this item.”</p>
 <p>He had to rely on his enemies to update him during such a situation. What an embarrassment!</p>
 <p>Pan Luming clenched his fists behind his back in a resentful manner so that he would not rush forward impulsively and fight against Lord Fashen. He secretly took out the golden flag that Pan Luo had given them to aid them in catching the Spirit Tribe. He then slightly shook the flag to activate the array ability.</p>
 <p>In an instant, countless stone pillars appeared in the middle of the battlefield. They ranged from tall to short and thick to thin and were arranged in a specific direction so as to trap Lord Fashen in the middle.</p>
 <p>Lord Fashen sneered at the sight, “It’s not effective to use the same method twice.”</p>
 <p>Even though he had said so, he dared not let his guard down and formed a sphere of spiritual energy. The sphere was quickly expanded to a boundary of two feet, enclosing Gu Lingzhi and the others inside.</p>
 <p>Just as Lord Fashen had finished this action, gold, wood, water, fire and earth was suddenly shot out of the numerous stone pillars. The five Spiritual Power had different light rays where they interlaced in the air, forming a complex pattern. The surrounding scenery was also changed according to the pattern formed. Each layer of array was superimposed at a speed that was still visible to the naked eye. With each added layer, it meant that the array trapping them was increased by one more element. Gu Lingzhi roughly counted and found that there were as many as nine of them.</p>
 <p>“<em>Tsk</em>, the Ninety-Nine to One formation. Pan Luo is really willing to leave such a complicated array into an inferior sacred weapon, he must really have high hopes on you.” Zi Zi, who rarely revealed itself, suddenly spoke in Gu Lingzhi’s mind, giving her a shock.</p>
 <p>“Senior, you know about the array’s origin but do you know how to crack it?”</p>
 <p>“How would I know of such things?” Zi Zi answered. “As a Duobao Spiritual Squirrel, I specialize in finding spiritual treasures, it is already not bad that I could identify the Ninety-Nine to One formation.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi heard a hint of satisfaction among Zi Zi’s tone and was wise to not comment on it. She simply asked again, “Senior, can you get us through the array and take us out?”</p>
 <p>“Of course, this doesn’t stump me.” Zi Zi answered while lying under a tree in the Fenlan Painting with its legs crossed. By the way it spoke, one could tell that it was content, “Being able to pass through all sorts of enchantment is the talent of my Duobao Spiritual Squirrel Tribe. In this world, there are only places at which we do not want to go, there’s no such thing as places we can’t go.”</p>
 <p>On this side, Gu Lingzhi was inquiring Zi Zi in her mind on how to break through the array. On the other side, Lord Fashen and Rong Yuan had already borrowed the array’s power and began fighting with them.</p>
 <p>This array was controlled by Pan Luming and would naturally not trap his own men. When faced with an ambush where they were greatly outnumbered, even if the two of them were superb, it would be hard to fight given their numbers. At the moment where the two of them were losing, Lord Fashen waved his Sacred Weapon and three stonemen having the cultivation of Demigods appeared. One was responsible for protecting Gu Lingzhi, Rong Huashang and Pan Yue while the other two helped them to deal with the enemies. This helped them greatly in reducing their pressure.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi made use of this opportunity where the opponent was busy dealing with Lord Fashen, Rong Yuan and the Stonemen to follow according to how Zi Zi had managed to pass through the enchantment previously. She attempted with the hand that was wrapped with Zi Zi’s abilities to touch the surrounding array.</p>
 <p>It was seen that the hand had touched the innermost layer of the array as if it was just like water. A small ripple was made and the hand was able to penetrate in without creating any effects. Even Pan Luming, who was controlling the array, was not able to detect any abnormalities.</p>
 <p>Seeing that it had really succeeded, Gu Lingzhi bursted with joy while her face remained calm and composed such that it would not attract any attention. She slightly moved her wrist that was still in the array and tried to find out how wide of a tunnel she could open up. After confirming that the holes she made in the array were wide enough for them to pass through, Gu Lingzhi withdrew her hand with satisfaction and wanted to inform the rest to leave from here. As she turned around, she found out that Lord Fashen and Rong Yuan were separated by several Demigods. A few people were then moving in on her with ill intentions. Looking at the breaths expelled from their bodies, they were all Demigods!</p>
 <p>In an instant, Gu Lingzhi could guess what Pan Luming’s plan was.</p>
 <p>It barely went well when Pan Luming had used this trick previously, why would he repeat it especially with Rong Yuan in the picture now? It turned out that he was waiting for this!</p>
 <p>After figuring it out, Gu Lingzhi immediately threw Rong Huashang and Pan Yue into the stoneman’s arms while she turned around and smashed into the wall formed by the array. Under the surprised gazes of the Demigods, she smashed into the array’s second layer before entering the third, fourth, fifth… such that people were beginning to doubt about their lives.</p>
 <p>After passing through the last layer of the array, Gu Lingzhi did not have the time to check on the several Demigods that were chasing after her. She then ferociously waved her Phoenix Sword and formed several flames that were a few feet long in front of her. This forced the Martial Artists that were guarding outside to retreat. She then charged towards the direction with the least number of people.</p>
 <p>It was fortunate that Pan Luming had brought all the Demigods in North Qiu into the formation of stone pillars as he wanted it to be foolproof. The people stationed outside were unable to hold back Gu Lingzhi. Within a few seconds, Gu Lingzhi had already escaped quite a distance and was about to reach the periphery of the encirclement.</p>
 <p>“Stop her, you trash!” Pan Luming, who was controlling the formation, yelled. However, he was unable to leave and stop her personally. He could only watch as Gu Lingzhi ran past the crowd and escaped further and further.</p>
 <p>At the same time, several Demigods who attacked Gu Lingzhi were removed from the formation. The group was led by Pan Yue’er who dropped a sentence upon seeing the situation, “Fret not Chief Duke, I will go and catch her.” With that, Pan Yue’er sprinted off instantly.</p>
 <p>Pan Luming then eased his look slightly. With Pan Yue’er, there should not be any accidents…right?</p>
 <p>Even though Gu Lingzhi had managed to break through the siege, she did not know where to head next. Unfamiliar with the area, she could only test her luck and kept moving forward. After half an hour, a wall rose from the ground suddenly, blocking her path.</p>
 <p>“Surrender now and I can still make it easy for you.” Pan Yue’er said coldly while chasing behind.</p>
 <p>There was no need to delay any further, Gu Lingzhi did not care about her and jumped lightly before landing on the wall. She stepped on the ground at a ninety degree angle as though she was standing on a flat ground. Just when she had climbed to the top of the wall and before Pan Yue’er could remove the wall by retracting her Spiritual Power, she used the wall to push herself such that her body spun a few rounds in the air gracefully. With a light tap of her foot, her body turned one round. The speed at which she leaped was faster than her usual running speed. This was part of the Moon Stride movement technique.</p>
 <p>As long as there was a levelled ground for her to borrow some strength, she would be able to step and glide as if she was walking on the moon.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing this scene, Pan Yue’er gritted her teeth and did not dare to set up any more obstacles for Gu Lingzhi. Amidst their chase and escape, a bright blue colour appeared at the end of their sight. It's...the Endless Sea Realm!</p>
