<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>After the end of the entrance examinations, the new students looked forward to the class allocation.</p>
 <p>On the surface, Gu Lingzhi was only a Level Four Martial Student. Naturally, she was placed into a class together with the new students, to learn Martial Skills from the beginning. She was pleasantly surprised. When she had first entered the school, it was already nearing the end of the school semester. The tutor could not reteach the syllabus from the very beginning just for her which she felt was such a pity. She did not expect such good news and hence started preparing for the new school semester with excitement.</p>
 <p>“Martial Students, Class Eleven…” Gu Lingzhi arrived at her allocated class and happily found a place to sit. In her heart, she was guessing who the tutor in charge of this class would be.</p>
 <p>As more youths started to enter one by one, the classroom began to fill up. Gu Lingzhi was stunned when she saw a figure amongst them and laughed dryly as she turned to look elsewhere.</p>
 <p>She never thought that she would be placed into the same class as Gu Linglong. <em>It seemed to her that enemies indeed often crossed paths.</em> From what she knew, Gu Rong had returned to Tai-an City the very night that the entrance examinations had ended. She just did not know… how big of an impact did the Recording Crystal have on the relationship between Gu Rong and Gu Linglong.</p>
 <p>“You slut! Sooner or later, I will surpass you so that Father would know that you are just a wastrel!”</p>
 <p><em>Gu Lingzhi hadn’t made any trouble for her, but Gu Linglong still came to find her.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>With a confused expression, Gu Lingzhi feigned ignorance and questioned, “Wastrel? Are you talking about yourself? You couldn’t even beat someone two Levels lower than you. Linglong, you definitely have to work harder.”</p>
 <p>“You…!” Gu Linglong was so furious she could not speak at all.</p>
 <p>Being defeated by Gu Lingzhi in one move had disgraced her. Even in front of her mother, she was too embarrassed to mention it. She had merely retold Gu Lingzhi’s words and did not expect that her mother’s reaction would disappoint her so greatly. Her mother had wandered around the house for a long time before giving some instructions to Gu Linglong in a low voice.</p>
 <p>When she thought about the spiritual treasures that her mother had given her, Gu Linglong’s rage turned into complacency. She was confident that she could win Gu Lingzhi with those spiritual treasures given by her mother.</p>
 <p>“Hey, if there is some problem with your brain then go and have it treated. Don’t just stand here and block the way,” a light, youthful voice sounded and instantly caused Gu Linglong’s expression to change.</p>
 <p>“Whose brain did you say had a problem?”</p>
 <p>The youth shrugged, “You.”</p>
 <p>“You…” Gu Linglong sucked in her breath, “Do you know who my father is? How dare you speak to me like this?”</p>
 <p>“Ha!” Gu Lingzhi could not help but laugh out loud. Gu Linglong would always mention her father no matter what, she wondered what Gu Rong would think if he knew of it.</p>
 <p>“How would I know who your father is?” The youth squinted at her, “In the Royal School, we follow the academy’s rules. Unless you’re telling me that your father is the principal?”</p>
 <p>“Haha!” This time, it was not just Gu Lingzhi, but also everyone nearby who had heard the conversation, burst out laughing.</p>
 <p>The students who were able to enrol into the Royal School had self-confidence and pride. How could they possibly look up to Gu Linglong just because of two sentences? To these talented youths, they looked down upon people who were only capable of using their family backgrounds to exert pressure on others.</p>
 <p>“You, all of you…” She started to tear up as she looked around the group of people who were all mocking her. She was never put in a tough spot like this before.</p>
 <p>Two knocks sounded on the door. Although it was not loud, it was particularly clear in the noisy classroom and brought everyone’s attention to the door.</p>
 <p><em>It was… the Third Prince?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi’s eyes widened in surprise and she subconsciously shrank back into her seat. <em>It couldn’t be that the Third Prince had come to the classroom at this time to find her, right?</em></p>
 <p>In the short time frame that she had disguised herself as the Black Thorn, he had insisted on marrying her regardless. Yet in the blink of an eye, he had chased her all the way back to the Royal School.<em>&nbsp;It was just as Ye Fei had said, this Third Prince was just a scum!</em></p>
 <p>For unknown reasons, Gu Lingzhi suddenly felt distressed when she thought of this. <em>Was it because she felt that it was unfair to all the other girls who secretly loved him? Turns out that the Third Prince who was rumored to not be promiscuous was actually just like any other man.</em></p>
 <p>Rong Yuan was angered when he saw Gu Lingzhi shrink back subconsciously but he had nowhere to vent it.</p>
 <p>Without any hesitation at all, he had ignored the weird looks from his father and the upper management of the Royal School and lowered his status to come here and teach. It was all just to be able to spend more time with Gu Lingzhi. <em>Yet, her first reaction when she saw him was to shrink back. Also, what did that momentary glimmer of disappointment in her eyes mean? Was she so unwilling to have him as her teacher?</em></p>
 <p>Rong Yuan leaned against the door frame with a smile that was both self-deprecating and flippant. He faced the shocked students and stated, “I am your tutor, Rong Yuan. If nothing untoward happens, then I will be your tutor for this semester. I hope that all of you will behave well and not cause me any trouble. You had better coordinate with me, otherwise… I do have the authority to expel any of you.”</p>
 <p>The whole class went into an uproar.</p>
 <p><em>The Third Prince was going to be their tutor? They did not hear it wrongly, right? They never expected that they would become students of the kingdom’s War God upon entering the school. Even if they were unable to earn enough credits for this semester, it would still be worth it!&nbsp;</em>All the youths were extremely excited and looked at Rong Yuan with awe-filled eyes, quietly and quickly sitting down in their respective seats. There was no need for Rong Yuan to say anything.</p>
 <p><em>In front of the kingdom’s War God, they had better behave well!</em></p>
 <p>However, there were some exceptions among them. One of them was Gu Linglong. She felt as if her soul was leaving her body when she looked at that flippant smile of Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p><em>Did the Third Prince suddenly become a tutor of the Royal School… because of her?</em></p>
 <p>The more Gu Linglong deliberated, the more she was sure that she was right. In this entire class, the only one who was familiar with the Third Prince was none other than her. <em>If the Third Prince was not here for her, then who else could it be?</em></p>
 <p>As she thought of this, her eyes became misty. She stared viciously at the youth who had made fun of her earlier and then looked pitifully towards Rong Yuan with tenderness in her eyes.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan would rather be burned alive than be looked at like that. He glanced over, and after determining that it was Gu Linglong, his smile widened.</p>
 <p><em>She dared to make such an expression at him while in front of Gu Lingzhi. It looked like it had been a good idea not to interfere with the class allocations. It would only be interesting when one could look down on their enemies and trample over them.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Gu Linglong shyly lowered her head when she noticed that Rong Yuan had looked over. However, Rong Yuan did not bother with her and instead, lifted his hand to point at Gu Lingzhi, “Well, we will start by introducing ourselves. Let’s start from… this student.”</p>
