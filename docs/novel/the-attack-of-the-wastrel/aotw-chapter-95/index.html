<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Suddenly, the rumor had spread like wildfire in the city. Every young lady who had received the news were eager to get into action, thinking about how they would present themselves in front of the Third Prince.</p>
 <p>As for Tianfeng Wei whose engagement was cancelled, it was about time for her to give others a chance after having the Third Prince to herself for so long.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi, who had been recuperating the past few days at the inn, had no idea of the frenzy that was going on outside of her room.</p>
 <p>At this moment, she was frowning at the main character of the rumor mill.</p>
 <p>“What are you still doing here?” The moment she woke up, she saw the main culprit behind why she got injured in the first place, which immediately put her in a bad mood.</p>
 <p>“I said I would take care of you.”</p>
 <p>“I don’t need you to,” Gu Lingzhi replied flatly, causing Rong Yuan’s smile to falter.</p>
 <p>“I’ve checked. Though I am unable to confirm who tried to kill you, I’m sure it is connected to me. Since I was the reason you got hurt, the responsibility falls on me to take care of you.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan’s words were very sincere and did not even give Gu Lingzhi the time to object, before taking a bowl of porridge from the table. He took a spoonful of porridge and held it in front of Gu Lingzhi. Smiling gently, he said, “You must be hungry. Come, I’ll feed you.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi felt like her brain had been electrocuted and was stunned for a moment. She stared at Rong Yuan with an incredulous look.</p>
 <p>“Your Highness, are you okay?”</p>
 <p><em>What she actually wanted to ask was whether he was out of his mind.</em></p>
 <p>“I’m okay,” Rong Yuan replied through clenched teeth. <em>Could she not tell that he was trying to earn her favor?</em></p>
 <p>“Really?” Gu Lingzhi did not really believe him. She took the spoon from him and started to eat the porridge on her own.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan looked down at his hands that were now empty and did not pursue the matter any further. He sat in a corner; his gaze focused on Gu Lingzhi which made her feel uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>“…Your Highness, don’t you have other things to attend to?”</p>
 <p>Knowing that Gu Lingzhi was trying to chase him away once again, Rong Yuan was prepared for it this time.</p>
 <p>“My biggest task that I have to attend to now is taking care of you.”</p>
 <p>“Haha, it is truly an honor to be taken care of you,” Gu Lingzhi replied sarcastically.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan merely smiled gently and said, “That’s right.”</p>
 <p><em>What else could she say?</em></p>
 <p>Rong Yuan looked so brazen that Gu Lingzhi could only avert her gaze as much as possible. She was seriously starting to consider whether she should return to her original identity as Gu Lingzhi to rid herself from being constantly annoyed by the Third Prince.</p>
 <p>The next few days, Rong Yuan used the same excuse of wanting to make up for his mistakes to stay by Gu Lingzhi’s side. He even rented the room beside Gu Lingzhi’s room. When Gu Lingzhi asked about it, Rong Yuan gave a charming smile and said, “I have a responsibility to ensure that you will not be in danger because of me until I find out who was trying to hurt you.”</p>
 <p>On the surface, it sounded natural and generous. However, his eyes were way too delighted, he obviously did not mean what he said and there were underlying intentions behind why he wanted to stay.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi had almost fully recovered after resting these past few days. The moment she could move, she had already thought about returning back to the Town of the Brave.</p>
 <p>“I’m going to the Town of the Brave tomorrow to battle, do you want to go watch?”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan had so casually thrown out that suggestion to tempt her because he could tell what she was thinking.</p>
 <p>“Don’t you want to see how the Kingdom’s War God fights? It’s rare to have such a close encounter, you know.”</p>
 <p><em>He’s actually praising himself like that, how shameless can he get?</em></p>
 <p>Though she could not stand the Third Prince praising himself, she could not deny that the offer was indeed very tempting.</p>
 <p>“Okay, I’ll go.”</p>
 <p>“Good,” Rong Yuan said as he patted Gu Lingzhi’s head. Gu Lingzhi was stunned for a moment and almost kicked him in the face.</p>
 <p>She resisted the urge to kick him in the face when she realized that her calf had not completely healed yet, there was a possibility she might end up injuring herself again. Without hesitation, she said coldly, “Third Prince, please have some dignity.”</p>
 <p>Hearing the unhappiness in her voice, Rong Yuan’s eyes darkened. There was a long road ahead of him if he wanted to make her his wife. He decided to change the topic, “What do you feel like having for lunch? I’ll ask Yuan Zheng to go prepare.”</p>
 <p><em>I’ve just had breakfast and he’s thinking about lunch already?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi pouted, wondering if Rong Yuan was really out of his mind.</p>
 <p>“It’s okay, I’m not hungry yet. You can have lunch yourself first.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan was speechless as he realized that he had just eaten breakfast as well. Indeed, the girl that he liked had too sharp of a mind for him to try and trick her.</p>
 <p>That day, Gu Lingzhi finally stepped out of the inn with the Third Prince beside her. They immediately became the center of attention when they appeared together like that.</p>
 <p>Since the news of Rong Yuan and Tian Fengwei’s engagement being cancelled was spread, it was the first time Rong Yuan was being seen in public. The young ladies in town who were determined to make him theirs ran straight to the inn.</p>
 <p>It was a pity that by the time they reached the inn, Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan were already on the way to the Town of the Brave.</p>
 <p>Though Gu Lingzhi ignored all the gazes on her initially, she could not help but ask when she had finally reached the Town of the Brave.</p>
 <p>“Third Prince, why do they keep looking at us?”</p>
 <p>To be more accurate, the ladies were hovering in front of Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan the entire time. Rong Yuan led the way as they entered the battle arena designated for Martial Lords.</p>
 <p>“It probably has something to do with the cancellation of my engagement with Tianfeng Wei.”</p>
 <p><em>Cancellation of his… engagement?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was shocked. “Why did you cancel the engagement? Isn’t Lady Tianfeng good enough for you?”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan turned around and looked straight at her, “What do you think?”</p>
 <p>“How would I know?” Gu Lingzhi muttered nervously before she tried to run to the battle arena for Martial Students, but Rong Yuan stopped her.</p>
 <p>“Don’t you want to see me in combat? The battling arena for Martial Lords is not that way.”</p>
 <p>As soon as he completed the sentence, he held Gu Lingzhi’s hand and walked towards the Martial Lord battle arena.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi did not even realize that her hand was being held because she was so shocked by the news. She snapped out of a daze when she heard the commotion of the crowd, before she reacted and violently shook her hand out of his grip.</p>
 <p>“Third Prince, please have some dignity.”</p>
 <p>“I do have dignity,” Rong Yuan replied, sounding slightly wronged. “If I didn’t, I would not come openly to woo you without first breaking off my engagement.”</p>
