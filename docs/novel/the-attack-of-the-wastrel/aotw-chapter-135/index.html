<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>On the other side, Gu Lingzhi was waiting for the other students to form a line under Rong Yuan’s instructions. They faced a demon beast about a hundred meters away and were about to shoot fireballs at it. As long as they failed, they had to receive punishment.</p>
 <p>It was difficult for these Martial Students to complete this task that was taxing even for Martial Practitioners and this was evident in the number of students that were being punished to jog around the field. Yet, Rong Yuan did not think there was anything wrong with the way he was carrying out his lessons, which invigorated the students’ competitiveness.</p>
 <p><em>Shooting a fireball the size of a palm successfully at a demon beast? How hard could that be!</em></p>
 <p>What was difficult about this task was that the demon beast could run incredibly fast.</p>
 <p>A fireball landed beside the leg of the demon beast. Rong Yuan raised his brow and was about to reprimand the student that had made the mistake, but then he saw Gu Lingzhi’s outstretched arms.</p>
 <p>“…It’s okay to fail once, you just need to practice more.”</p>
 <p><em>Could this preferential treatment be any more obvious? It made Gu Lingzhi want to cut off his tongue!</em></p>
 <p>Undoubtedly, there were people who were unhappy with this.</p>
 <p>“Third Prince, why can she get away with punishment?”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan turned around and narrowed his eyes at the male student, “If you can do better than her, I won’t punish you too.”</p>
 <p>The male student opened his mouth and was about to list out the aspects in which he was stronger than Gu Lingzhi. However, after thinking for so long, he could not think of anything to say. The only thing that was superior was his cultivation, but even then, she had beaten him in a match before. He was inferior to Gu Lingzhi even when it came to everyday assignments. When he thought about it, he was immediately guilty.</p>
 <p>“What about the rest of you? Who else feels wronged? If any of you can say that you are stronger than her in a particular area, then you will be exempted from punishment.” The male student kept quiet. Rong Yuan swept his gaze across his students, and every single one of them was quiet.</p>
 <p>When the students met eyes with Rong Yuan, they all lowered their heads, unable to look at him, because they realized that the only thing that they were superior to when compared to Gu Lingzhi was their cultivation.</p>
 <p>However, Gu Lingzhi was just a Level Five Martial Student. Though she did not have as much cultivation as the other students, she has beaten every one of them before.</p>
 <p>When Gu Lingzhi saw the peculiar expression on everyone’s faces, she thought about it briefly before she remarked coldly, “I clearly didn’t manage to hit the target. I am willing to accept the punishment. I’ll just stick to the original punishment of ten thousand frog jumps.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi immediately went to the side and began to carry out her punishment.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan, who was observing from the side, clenched his teeth so hard that it made a sound. Yuan Zheng, who had heard the sound, involuntarily took two steps back.</p>
 <p>Immediately, Rong Yuan shouted, “Today’s lesson on controlling your spiritual energy will end here. Everyone is to do ten thousand frog jumps, no one is allowed to leave until they are done!”</p>
 <p>All the students roared in protest.</p>
 <p>Those students who had received punishment earlier suddenly thought that they were lucky to have started on their frog jumps earlier than the students who had just started. On the other hand, the students who had put in all their effort not to lose control of their fireball looked like they were about to cry.</p>
 <p><em>If they knew that they had to receive punishment regardless of whether they completed their task, why did they bother to try so hard?</em> This is all Gu Lingzhi’s fault, if it was not her that was so determined to carry out her punishment, none of them would have ended up in this predicament.</p>
 <p>These students were smart, and did not have to ponder for too long to know how they had landed in this situation. They all looked at Gu Lingzhi with hatred.</p>
 <p><em>Why did she have to act as if she was so upright? She caused all of them to receive punishment!</em></p>
 <p>With the way everyone was glaring at her, Gu Lingzhi did not take too long to figure out why. She did not have a good feeling the moment Rong Yuan had issued everyone the ten thousand frog jumps.</p>
 <p><em>Rong Yuan was definitely her nemesis, nothing good ever happened to her whenever they were together!</em></p>
 <p>Though Gu Lingzhi was upset at this situation, Rong Yuan was even more depressed. Rong Yuan had heard the news of her being ranked first in the Yellow-Level Alchemy Tower and was excited to find her to congratulate her, but in the end, he received the news of someone confessing to her. When he reached the classroom, he saw the boy who was half-beaten to death by Qin Xinran sending Gu Lingzhi to class. If it was not for the fact that he had heard Gu Lingzhi rejecting the boy’s feelings, Rong Yuan did not mind using underhand means to cause that boy to become bedridden.</p>
 <p>With a stomach full of jealousy, what made him angrier was that Su Nian did not feel like he did anything wrong. He could only vent his anger on today’s exercise, and he did not think that he would cause Gu Lingzhi to accept the punishment so eagerly. It made him so angry that he did not even think twice about letting the rest of the students join in on the punishment with her.</p>
 <p>He may not have the heart to torment Gu Lingzhi, but he was willing to let others suffer.</p>
 <p>From this point of view, it was not wrong for others to be angry at Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>For a normal human being that did not have any cultivation, it was impossible to do ten thousand frog jumps. However, for these youths who had enough cultivation to be Level Six Martial Students, as long as they persevered, it was a task well within their abilities.</p>
 <p>“That’s enough, you have the least amount of cultivation here, you have done enough frog jumps for today,” Rong Yuan could not help but say. He was standing at the side supervising everyone, when he saw Gu Lingzhi’s face turn white from exhaustion after doing two thousand jumps.</p>
 <p>Everyone was speechless.</p>
 <p>“It’s okay, I can do it,” Gu Lingzhi replied. <em>You may be shameless, Your Highness, but I don’t want everyone in the school to hate me!</em></p>
 <p>It was too bad that Gu Lingzhi’s desperate prayers were not received by the Third Prince. All Rong Yuan could only see that Gu Lingzhi was struggling physically so that others would not look down on her. His heart ached so much that he did not care about the jealousy he was previously feeling, or how others had regarded the situation. The only reason why he had agreed to teach in the Royal School was because he wanted to interact more with her. <em>There was no way he was going to keep a distance when she had two suitors going after her!</em></p>
 <p>“I said it’s enough. Do you want me to make them jump another two thousand more?” Rong Yuan raised a brow, silently threatening Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi pursed her lips and finally retorted back, “Third Prince, how shameless can you be?”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan merely smiled and said, “As long as I can win your heart, I don’t mind being shameless.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi had nothing to say to that. <em>Alright, he has won.</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was dismissed from class early, under Rong Yuan’s preferential treatment that was utterly obvious. Rong Yuan followed closely behind her, and did not forget to instruct Yuan Zheng to supervise the rest of the students so that they would not slack off. This created a whole lot of hatred for Gu Lingzhi.</p>
