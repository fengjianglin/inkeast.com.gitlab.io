 <p>Lu Heng lightly acknowledged the store owner’s greeting before he pointed to Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi and introduced, “These two are the two new elders of the Langya Troop. I am bringing them around the city now.”</p>
 <p>The store owner jumped in surprise. Two new elders? Who in Forgotten City was not familiar with the top five ranked elders in the Langya Troop? The elders were all Gold Class Warriors. If the Langya Troop gained two more Gold Class Warriors, it seemed that the second ranked troop, the Meteor Troop would no longer be able to keep their rank.</p>
 <p>At this thought, the store owner’s expression brightened, “So you two are the new elders. I could tell that you guys were extraordinary the moment you stepped in. I never expected that you were both Gold Class Warriors as well. Both are good looking too, what a good match.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan nodded with pleasure and he completely ignored the fact that he was presumed to be a Gold Class Warrior based on his looks. He was fond of the store owner for recognizing that both him and Gu Lingzhi were powerful individuals. As such, Rong Yuan was willing to spend money in the store on things that Gu Lingzhi would be able to study and conduct her research on.</p>
 <p>Throwing a knowing look at Rong Yuan, Gu Lingzhi could guess what he was thinking. She turned towards the shelves and took a close look at the items displayed.</p>
 <p>Since she could not use her spiritual energy, she could not estimate the worth of the items available in the store but she could tell that they were many times inferior to items in the continent. After scanning through the items, Gu Lingzhi casually took down a sword on the wall. Frowning slightly as she felt the weight of the sword in her hands, she realized that the lack of spiritual energy in crafting weapons resulted in many complications such as an increased weight of weapons.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi pointed out the same flaws in many of the weapons and she had a better understanding of the standards of weapon crafting in Lost Lands.</p>
 <p>Seeing Gu Lingzhi’s silence as she surveyed the items, the store owner placed a hand on his forehead and admitted, “I apologise for my poor memory, Elders, these items are of an inferior grade for you, they are only for Silver Class Warriors. They must not be to your liking. I will head in and take better items for you.”</p>
 <p>With that, the store owner turned and swiftly headed to the storage warehouse to bring better items for Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>Not long later, a few servants carrying boxes emerged from the storage. Gu Lingzhi opened a box and brilliant light reflected off the shiny sword that sat inside it. With eager eyes, Gu Lingzhi reached for the sword.</p>
 <p>The store owner laughed and introduced, “This sword is called the Flying Dragon Sword and it is a valuable item that I personally purchased from a top Weapon Forger. The entire sword is made from priceless materials and it went through a delicate handicraft process. It is a rare Upper Silver Class weapon. Do you like it?”</p>
 <p>“Not bad, it is quite interesting,” Gu Lingzhi commented.</p>
 <p>Originally Gu Lingzhi had the impression that the weapons in the Lost Lands were poorly crafted due to the poor handiwork and lack of spiritual energy. However, the Flying Dragon Sword proved her wrong.</p>
 <p>While spiritual energy could not be used by Weapon Forgers in Lost Lands, they could repeatedly use their bare hands to craft pure weapons. Although this was nowhere comparable to the weapon crafting techniques in the Tianyuan Continent, it was a special technique. The Flying Dragon Sword before her was a softly crafted sword that had its own beauty. It was comparable to a middle grade Black-Level Spiritual Weapon and Gu Lingzhi was impressed by it.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi continued to open a few more boxes and examined the weapons inside them. Each weapon was crafted differently based on the materials that were used and this sparked Gu Lingzhi’s curiosity.</p>
 <p>Shaking his head slightly at Gu Lingzhi’s enthusiasm, Rong Yuan asked the store owner, “How much are you selling these for? I want all of them.”</p>
 <p>“All- all of them?” The store owner stuttered, thinking he had misheard Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>The valuable items that were brought out of the storage were not cheap and the average Warrior was lucky to afford one of two. Was this Elder mad to want all of them?</p>
 <p>Lu Heng also nervously watched the situation unfold and he could not help forming an impression of Martial Artists of the Tianyuan Continent. Despite being the Second Elder of the Langya Troop, Lu Heng could not afford all the weapons.</p>
 <p>However, Gu Lingzhi had a curiosity towards the weapons in the Lost Lands. She was truly a Heaven-Level Weapon Forger.</p>
 <p>Lu Heng pondered to himself as Rong Yuan readily exchanged a Medicinal Pill with the store owner in exchange for the items.</p>
 <p>Before the store owner could react, Rong Yuan waved his arm and the boxes on the floor of the store were kept into his Storage Ring.</p>
 <p>With so many things disappearing in the blink of an eye, the store owner could only suspect that the two were from the Tianyuan Continent. Lu Heng’s next comment confirmed his suspicion.</p>
 <p>“Seventh Brother, Spiritual Medicine is a very valuable resource in the Lost Lands. You should save on them just in case you might need them in the future.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan dismissed him with a laugh, “I have my own plans.”</p>
 <p>It was the same answer. Rolling his eyes, Lu Heng ignored Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>After all, the two had only spent a couple of days in the Lost Lands and Lu Heng did not have much authority to scold them.</p>
 <p>Once the three men walked out of the store, the store owner jumped in pure joy. “I am rich, I am rich! This is a Spiritual Medicine! I never imagined that I would have the chance to own one in my lifetime!”</p>
 <p>As he waved the Spiritual Medicine in his hand excitedly, the store owners felt envious stares at him. He barked, “What are you looking at? Do you have nothing else to do? Go and make some preparations. I am going to the Chancellor’s Manor!”</p>
 <p>The store owner stared at the Spiritual Medicine with bright eyes and he bit on it like a gold bar before he placed it in a jade bottle. Although a Spiritual Medicine was valuable, it was not something a small store owner like him would need. As such, he would be better off if he exchanged it for more concrete currency.</p>
 <p>Throughout the day, Lu Heng saw the generous spending by Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>The two swept through stores like a tornado, clearing shelves and stores as they threw items into their Storage Rings. Lu Heng’s heart ached when he saw the sheer amount of Spiritual Medicine Rong Yuan gave to the store owners. Spirit stones were also exchanged for the items and by the time the three returned to the Langya Troop’s headquarters, Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan were already well known people in the city. In a few days time, the entire city would come to know of the two new elders of the Langya Troop.</p>
 <p>At the same time, in the Chancellor Mansion of the Forgotten City, a middle-aged man dressed in a long purple robe was in deep thought after hearing a report from a subordinate.</p>
 <p>“Did the two new elders of Wolf Teeth Club spend so much Spiritual Medicine and spirit stones in one go?” Guan Yue asked with his deep voice rumbling through the hall.</p>
 <p>“Yes, I am absolutely positive. I heard that the two elders came to the Lost Lands half a month ago and they are very strong. Bao Wenhao of the Tanlang Troop was killed by the lady.”</p>
 <p>“Interesting.” Guan Yue chuckled to himself as he fiddled with the jade bottle in his hand.</p>
 <p>In one afternoon, six men had come to him to exchange Spiritual Medicine for money. This was far more than a few years combined and who would not be greedy upon hearing about the treasures that the two elders possessed? The Langya Troop was lucky to have the two elders join their club. However, as the chancellor of the city, he should extend an invitation to the two…</p>
 <p>It was night time and Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan were cultivating in the Inheritance Space when Zi Zi informed them, “Someone is here.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi immediately stopped her cultivation and brought Rong Yuan out of the Inheritance Space.</p>
 <p>As soon as they took their seats, they heard a subordinate tell them, “Seventh Elder, Eighth Elder, the chancellor of the city would like to meet you in the hall.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan exchanged a look before Gu Lingzhi replied to the servant, “Alright, we will go now.” With that, she stood up and tugged on Rong Yuan’s sleeve.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. The person you have been waiting for is here.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan laughed lightly, “I don’t even know the chancellor, why would I be waiting for him?”</p>
 <p>Rolling her eyes, Gu Lingzhi replied, “Did you think I did not know what you were trying to do with your actions in the day?”</p>
 <p>Money could move hearts and in the eyes of the men from the Lost Lands, the two were like two large banks that came from the Tianyuan Continent. If they were to live discreetly in Lost Lands, they would not display their wealth so outrightly. However, Rong Yuan purposely showed how rich he was in the market that day as though he was inviting robbers to steal from him.</p>
 <p>Other than the city’s chancellor, who else would have greater authority to meet the two?</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi saw through Rong Yuan’s plan but Rong Yuan did not show any hint of embarrassment. Ruffling through her hair, Rong Yuan praised her, “Clever girl.”</p>
 <p>Instantly, Gu Lingzhi smacked him, “You deserve it.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan scoffed and pouted at Gu Lingzhi. He moved her hands to his lower body and rested his chin on her neck, “Next time, place it below.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi’s face turned bright red and she scolded, “Pervert!”</p>
 <p>Despite being married for so long, she still could not take Rong Yuan’s perverted ways.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan chuckled, “Only to you.”</p>
 <p>“Let’s go, we should not make our guest wait.”</p>
 <p>When the two made their way to the hall, they found Lu Yuan and the other elders of the Langya Troop already present there. Worried looks were on their faces and Lu Heng hung his head down in shame.</p>
 <p>It was his fault for not warning them.</p>
 <p>He had only thought of what a waste it was for Rong Yuan to spend his Spiritual Medicine and spirit stones and had not imagined that Rong Yuan’s actions would attract the attention of others.</p>
