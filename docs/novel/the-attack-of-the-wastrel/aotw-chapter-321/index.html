 <p><em>What was wrong? Was he setting up a trap?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi’s heart pumped fiercely in her chest, still disguised as Pan Wen. She stared at the area Pan Liwen pointed out. However, she had to remain calm as she asked, “Chief Duke, is there something wrong?”</p>
 <p>“That’s what I should be asking you.” Pan Liwen did not answer her directly. The Imperial Guards stepped forward and tore down the stonewall that was tall enough to squeeze a person behind it. Throughout this process, Pan Liwen stared hawk-eyed at Gu Lingzhi, observing her every move.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi blinked innocently, she was prepared to run at any moment.</p>
 <p><em>If Pan Liwen had placed anything behind the stonewall to implicate her, she would be in deep trouble!</em></p>
 <p>Pan Yu was also shocked by the sudden revelation and his expression turned serious and nervous as he stared at ‘Pan Wen’. He shifted his gaze towards the stonewall and clenched his fists tightly in anxiousness. If ‘Pan Wen’ had truly been hiding something from him, there was nothing Pan Yu could do even as the king of the North Qiu Kingdom.</p>
 <p>At that point, all eyes were strained on the stonewall. The Imperial Guard carefully removed the stone that Pan Liwen had pointed out, his hands shook from the nerves in his heart. It was almost as though there was a huge weight on him and his hands almost slipped and dropped the stone.</p>
 <p>“If you come clean, I can spare you based on our blood ties. However, do not blame me for being vicious once whatever you are hiding behind this stone is revealed.” Just as the stone was about to be removed, Pan Liwen warned.</p>
 <p>“Chief Duke, I do not understand what you are saying,” ‘Pan Wen’ bit down on his lip and continued looking innocent, “I have never done anything to harm the kingdom, I have nothing to confess to.”</p>
 <p><em>How stubborn...</em></p>
 <p>Pan Liwen narrowed his eyes. ‘Pan Wen’ was finally acting like how a Crown Prince should. It was a pity that this had to happen.</p>
 <p>With a sigh, Pan Liwen’s eyes turned towards the stone and he instantly froze. At the same time, all the guards who were staring at the stonewall seemed to have frozen as they stared blankly at the secret behind it.</p>
 <p><em>What was hiding behind the stonewall? What was going on?</em></p>
 <p>‘Pan Wen’ swallowed his saliva before carefully and slowly turning to look at the stonewall. Instantly, he was dumbfounded by what he saw.</p>
 <p>A pile of sex toys and scandalous pornography images were stuffed behind a small cabinet.</p>
 <p>Even if she had never seen such items before, Gu Lingzhi could guess what they were used for. The small cabinet should be what Pan Wen used to store items for his own sexual entertainment.</p>
 <p>She had been ready to escape but then she was met with such a situation.</p>
 <p>‘Pan Wen’’s face turned beet red as the Imperial Guards started to react. They turned towards him with awkward but knowing looks on their faces. On the other hand, Pan Yu let out a long sigh, he could not even muster up the strength to reprimand Pan Wen.</p>
 <p>Cursing at Pan Wen for being a pervert, Gu Lingzhi boiled with anger as she felt the judging stares at her. Pan Wen was a total pervert!</p>
 <p>However, she could not deny that the objects were hers and she could only tolerate the stares while her face turned redder and redder in embarrassment.</p>
 <p>“Cough, Chief Duke, I believe the assassin is not hiding here. Should we head somewhere else to check?”</p>
 <p>Pan Liwen was evidently uncomfortable there and Pan Yu created a way out for him. After he reprimanded ‘Pan Wen’, Pan Liwen left.</p>
 <p>‘Pan Wen’ lowered his head and took in his words. Once everyone left his living quarters, he burnt the sex toys without hesitation. That concluded his day and he laid on the bed and tried to catch up on sleep.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi had not slept at all since she had been worried that Lord Fashen was the assassin. Since the assassins had not arrived even as dawn broke, Gu Lingzhi wondered if the assassins were on her side. Upon concluding that there was a high chance they were not from the Alliance, Gu Lingzhi could finally relax and sleep.</p>
 <p>As she slept, Gu Lingzhi dreamt of the same night where a group of assassins infiltrated the North Qiu Kingdom. However, the assassins were with Lord Fashen and they quickly met up with her. In the dream, they linked up Zi Zi’s special ability and Fashen’s skill to steal the Sacred Weapon from Pan Luming by force. The Sacred Weapon was used to create a large army of Demigods and the Alliance managed to crush the North Qiu Kingdom quickly, putting an end to the few dozen years of war.</p>
 <p>“Generals, the enemy is in chaos, follow me and…..” Gu Lingzhi’s voice rang through the battlefield. Behind her, a mass of army charged forward strongly, all of them yelling, “Die!”</p>
 <p>The cacophony of voices assembled together to become a loud roar that echoed through a large area.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi’s dream seemed incredibly real. All of a sudden, her body shivered and she sprang up from her bed in a shock.</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, her bed shook strongly and she felt the floor shift.</p>
 <p><em>It was not a dream, there was a battle happening outside among high-ranked Martial Artists!</em></p>
 <p>At this thought, Gu Lingzhi, who was still disguised as Pan Wen, threw on her clothes and rushed out of her palace. She instantly saw three fierce battles occurring in the sky, one of the men fighting was Lord Fashen.</p>
 <p><em>Damn it, Lord Fashen had infiltrated the palace that night!</em></p>
 <p>‘Pan Wen’ whipped his head around and observed his surroundings as his heart pumped wildly. He was trying to find Rong Huachang. However, the entire palace was in chaos and it was impossible to find Rong Huachang.</p>
 <p>“Your Highness, please save me, I am very scared!” Just as ‘Pan Wen’ was about to let Zi Zi out to sense the surroundings, he heard a very familiar voice.</p>
 <p>‘Pan Wen’ turned towards the voice, smiling brightly. In front of him was a familiar, yet strange servant maid.</p>
 <p>“Your Highness, I am very scared…” Knowing that ‘Pan Wen’ recognized her, Rong Huachang, who was disguised as the servant maid, shrieked slightly before she allowed her body to fall forward. As her limp body rested against ‘Pan Wen’, she wrapped her arms around his neck boldly. In front of other people’s eyes, it seemed like Rong Huachang was a bold servant maid who was trying to seduce the Crown Prince.</p>
 <p>Pan Wen’s personal guards froze in their place, unsure of what to do.</p>
 <p>This was where Pan Wen’s reputation came into good use. Many people knew about his poor reputation, but no one was going to stop the young servant maid and the prince from getting together. However, they wondered which palace the servant maid belonged to. <em>Why would she choose such a moment to seduce the Crown Prince? Didn’t she know that the Crown Prince was barred from coming into contact with any woman now as punishment?</em></p>
 <p>The scent of Rong Huachang’s perfume drifted through her nose, causing Gu Lingzhi to recall how Rong Yuan held her in his embrace. Rong Huachang coughed slightly as she smirked at ‘Pan Wen’. She took the initiative to grab ‘Pan Wen’’s hand and squeezed it. Without thinking twice, ‘Pan Wen’ carried Rong Huachang back to Wenrong Palace.</p>
 <p>“Crown Prince…are you really doing this? What if …” If the Chief Duke knew about this, he would be in trouble.</p>
 <p>The personal guard of Pan Wen immediately stood up and stammered. He tried to stop the Crown Prince in his actions.</p>
 <p>However, ‘Pan Wen’ only scoffed, “What? Am I not allowed to do what I want?”</p>
 <p>The guard shook his head, “Your Highness is brave and capable. How can any woman resist you? However, the Chief Duke is now battling the Demigod from the Alliance. If he knew that you were hooking up with a woman now, he would be very angry.”</p>
 <p>“Isn’t it just some random Demigod from the Alliance?” ‘Pan Wen’ rolled his eyes. “Do you not think that the Chief Duke will not be able to handle him?”</p>
 <p>“That’s not what I meant! The Chief Duke is powerful, how can the assassin match up to him?”</p>
 <p>“Then there you have it.” Gu Lingzhi knew that she had the final say as she sternly shot the guard a death glare. Through her eyes, she hinted to the guard to keep his mouth silent as she carried Rong Huachang back to Wenrong Palace.</p>
 <p>As the guard watched ‘Pan Wen’ leave, the guard scrunched his face up in disgust and he barked towards the other guards to keep their mouths silent. If Pan Liwen learned of the matter, ‘Pan Wen’ would be reprimanded and punished to stay in his room. However, they would be punished more severely and it was certain that ‘Pan Wen’ would beat them up. This was the right choice.</p>
 <p>Rong Huachang followed ‘Pan Wen’ to his room and upon seeing that they were safe, she immediately asked, “Where is he?”</p>
 <p>Knowing that Rong Huachang was referring to Rong Yuan, Gu Lingzhi replied, “He is in a safe place.”</p>
 <p>“He isn’t here?” Rong Huachang frowned. She recalled that the two had infiltrated the North Qiu Kingdom under Pan Wen’s identity. Why was Rong Yuan not around?</p>
 <p>“Pan Liwen has been strict in security elately. Rong Yuan is a guard now.”</p>
 <p>Rong Huachang did not probe further but her anxiousness was evident in her tone, “We have failed. The Sacred Weapon is kept with Pan Luming like it is his own child. There is no chance to obtain it. Fashen had no choice but to expose himself and lure Pan Luming to attack to try and steal it by force. However, he was stopped by two Demigods that Pan Luming created. If anything goes wrong, you guys must not expose yourselves. Your only job is to spy on the North Qiu Kingdom and report back to the Alliance.”</p>
 <p>“Grand-aunt, you…” Gu Lingzhi jumped in surprise. Rong Huachang’s words were filled with a brave sadness and Gu Lingzhi could not help thinking of the worst case scenario. “Grand-aunt, are you thinking of…”</p>
 <p>“Lord Fashen is the pillar of the Alliance. Nothing must happen to him!’ Rong Huachang did not reply Gu Lingzhi’s question directly but her answer was enough for Gu Lingzhi to know that she was determined.</p>
 <p>She was afraid that Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan might act rashly if anything happened to her and hence, she deliberately warned her.</p>
