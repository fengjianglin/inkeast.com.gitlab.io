 <p>Chu Jiang and Lin Chongyuan stared at Gu Lingzhi in bewilderment, they did not understand why she had suddenly started to cry. Subsequently, they felt a wave of strong suction power covering them. The wave of suction power felt very familiar that stopped any thoughts of resistance. In that instant, their surroundings had changed completely.</p>
 <p>“Where is this place?” Lin Chongyuan looked around in shock.</p>
 <p>The place had clear, blue skies and crystal-clear waters. It was completely different from the dull blue skies that were always present in the Lost Lands. There was a small building surrounded by several medicinal gardens. Without going near to it, they could already tell how precious the herbs in the medicinal gardens were by the density of the spiritual power in the area.</p>
 <p>Not far off, there was a white lake shrouded in fog, looking as though it was a dream. It was such a beautiful sight that the two of them could not help but sigh in admiration.</p>
 <p>As the two of them were still immersed in the shock from the Inheritance Space, Gu Lingzhi’s voice rang out lightly, “This is the Inheritance Space. My mother’s maiden name…was Wang Yu.”</p>
 <p>“What did you say?” Lin Chongyuan turned around abruptly to look at her.</p>
 <p><em>Hadn’t the Inheritance Space chosen his eldest daughter? How could it appear on Gu Lingzhi now? What else did she say? That her mother was called Wang Yu?</em></p>
 <p>Chu Jiang also looked at Gu Lingzhi in shock, then a stream of tears flowed from his eyes as he sobbed, “First Mistress…”</p>
 <p>Wang Yu and Lin Yu. Gu Lingzhi’s mother was undoubtedly their First Mistress. As he thought about when Gu Lingzhi mentioned that her mother had died young, he felt intense grief in his heart.</p>
 <p>The smart, adorable, yet sensible First Mistress of his, would never be able to return.</p>
 <p>Naturally, Lin Chongyuan understood the meaning behind Gu Lingzhi’s words. However, he was unable to accept that his daughter had already passed away long ago. Ever since young, his adorable eldest daughter had always been extremely sensible. Even when she knew that she was going to be sent alone to Tianyuan Continent, a completely unknown place to her, she had never once complained. In fact, she had even comforted her parents and told them to take good care of themselves, to wait for her to return as a Demigod and reunite as she broke the Spirit Tribe out of this cage.</p>
 <p><em>But now…</em></p>
 <p>Lin Chongyuan looked up at the sky. How was he supposed to convey this piece of bad news to his wife?</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was also quietly crying by the side. Rong Yuan was so distressed that he had no choice but to change the topic, “Chancellor, now is not the time to be grieving. Before, when I was fighting the female Insect Beast, I noticed something weird.”</p>
 <p>Lin Chongyuan wiped his face upon hearing that and recollected himself, “What did you notice?”</p>
 <p>“When we were in the Heavenly Lands, there may have been another terrifyingly strong female Insect Beast.” Rong Yuan said solemnly.</p>
 <p>“What? There is another one?” Before Chu Jiang could even recover from the shock of losing the First Mistress, he was once again shocked and terrified by this piece of news.</p>
 <p>The appearance of just one female Insect Beast had already thrown Spirit City into chaos. If there were to be another even more powerful one, then they would really be finished.</p>
 <p>“That’s right.” Rong Yuan nodded, “The Insect Beast had turned into a piece of white worm meat after being killed by me. It wasn’t complete. I suspect… that it might have been a clone that had been detached from its mother.”</p>
 <p>Lin Chongyuan’s face became much more serious. Rong Yuan had been very conservative in his proposition. How could it have been a clone that had been detached? It was obviously a clone released by a mother Insect Beast. No wonder people had been saying that the Heavenly Lands had become much safer these few years. Looking back, it had not become safer. There was obviously a creature plotting a terrifying conspiracy!</p>
 <p>It was very likely that that one female Insect Worm that had come to the Spirit City was merely a probe by that creature.</p>
 <p>It seems like they would have to make good use of their time now to make some preparations, to raise the combat power of the whole city before the creature in the Heavenly Lands makes its move, hence reducing their losses.</p>
 <p>As Lin Chongyuan looked at the vibrant world brimming with spiritual power, his gaze landed on Gu Lingzhi. He had never noticed it before, but Gu Lingzhi resembled him to a large extent. She had beautiful features from which he could see hints of Lin Yu. Before this, he had assumed that such extraordinary beauties would always share certain similarities in facial features. However, it seems like this was simply because these facial features had been inherited.</p>
 <p>Lin Chongyuan’s expression softened and his eyes shined with love and some pity, “Child, come over here and let Grandfather take a good look at you.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was shocked. There was an indescribable feeling in her heart.</p>
 <p>Whether it was before or after her rebirth, she had never once felt such familial warmth and affection before. The little bit of affection that Gu Rong had for her was completely dependent on tangible benefits. As for her mother, Lin Yue-er had led her to her death back when Gu Lingzhi was still an infant. Could she really expect to receive any familial affections?</p>
 <p>“Child, why are you still standing there in a daze? Don’t you want to acknowledge your grandfather?” Lin Chongyuan smiled.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi raised her head and saw the tender expression on Lin Chongyuan’s face. This expression was one that she frequently saw on Rong Yuan’s face when he looked at her. Evidently, this person in front of her who was her grandfather, genuinely cared for her.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi’s eyes started to tear up again as she choked on her tears and jumped into Lin Chongyuan’s embrace. She cried out, “Grandfather!”</p>
 <p>“My good child.” Lin Chongyuan’s eyes turned red as he patted her head.</p>
 <p>The Heavens did not treat him badly. Although he had lost his daughter, he had also gained a granddaughter. Hence, he was not in too much agony.</p>
 <p>Chu Jiang cried tears of joy as he watched their touching reunion. He was genuinely happy for them.</p>
 <p>It was not merely because of their reunion, but also because of the Spirit Tribe’s future. The Inheritance Space was brimming with spiritual power. It was definitely sufficient for them to groom several Demigods and open a Teleportation Array. When that happened, everything here would come to an end.</p>
 <p>The news that the Chancellor had taken in the Martial Artist from the outside world, Gu Lingzhi, as his granddaughter had spread. All who heard this piece of news were shocked.</p>
 <p>They had only ever had of people taking in disciples or godchildren, but never ever heard of anyone taking in a god-granddaughter. Was Lin Chongyuan just joking around?</p>
 <p>Regardless of public opinion, the issue of Gu Lingzhi having become the Chancellor’s granddaughter was already fixed in stone. Back then, because of the situation whereby Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan had to fake their deaths, Lin Rong was so angry that she almost overturned the Chancellor’s Manor. In the end, she was called back to the harem by the Chancellor’s wife and reprimanded. She then reappeared afterwards with red eyes and no longer dared to cause any trouble. However, even Lin Rong had a complete change in attitude and supported the move. Everyone else therefore were all relatively supportive of the move. Only those who knew about the issue that had happened a hundred years ago, were able to guess the real truth.</p>
 <p>“Lingzhi, because of certain reasons, we still cannot announce your status and identity. We can only settle it like this for the time being. You won’t blame your grandparents for this, right?” In Lin Chongyuan’s residence, a woman pulled on Gu Lingzhi’s sleeve. She looked to be about thirty years old with apricot eyes, pale lips, and had pale white skin. She wore a white dress and looked extremely elegant. This was Gu Lingzhi’s grandmother, whom she had never seen before.</p>
 <p>“Why would I blame you?” Gu Lingzhi smiled. She was already delighted to be able to acknowledge her grandparents, why would she blame them for anything?</p>
 <p>Back then, when her mother was sent to Tianyuan Continent, they had covered it up by announcing that the First Mistress had gone missing. Only a few important characters in the Spirit Tribe were aware of the truth. Now that Gu Lingzhi had returned, they could only announce her status as the Chancellor’s god-granddaughter to avoid stirring up trouble and provoking the other cities. Once the Spirit City improved its strength such that it could go against the other four cities, they would then announce the truth.</p>
 <p>“Grandmother, you on the other hand, have to take good care of your body. You should not continue to have such poor health.” As the Chancellor’s wife, Tang Yan’s strength was not to be underestimated. However, after sending Lin Yu away, she had been so guilt-ridden that she could neither eat nor sleep well. Gradually, she lost weight and became weaker. In just a few years, she was already on the sick bed. She could maintain her youthful looks only because Lin Chongyuan continuously provided her with medicinal pills. Otherwise, she would definitely have become a white-haired old lady by now.</p>
 <p>Even so, Tang Yuan’s condition was deteriorating continuously. At his wits end, Lin Chongyuan decided to have another child, Lin Rong, with Tang Yan. Finally, Tang Yan’s body gradually started to take a turn for the better. However, she was still much weaker compared to other Amethyst Class Warriors. A hundred years of guilt had taken a toll on her body.</p>
 <p>“Alright, I will get better soon,” Tang Yan patted Gu Lingzhi’s hand tenderly. Only she herself would be aware of the regret in her heart. The loss of Lin Yu would become an eternal scar in her heart. Furthermore, this scar was caused by her and her husband themselves. If it were not for their heartlessness, why would Lin Yu be sent away at such a young age and have such a pitiful outcome? Now, to Gu Lingzhi, who had lost her mother at such a young age, they could only try their best to make up to her and shower her with love.</p>
 <p><em>Hmph.&nbsp;</em>Lin Rong snorted and spoke angrily, “Now that you have a granddaughter, you have already forgotten about your daughter. Mother, don’t you love me anymore?”</p>
 <p>Tang Yan laughed and smacked her, “Nonsense. You are already so old, yet you want to vie for affection with your niece?”</p>
 <p>Lin Rong stared at her, “Lingzhi is older than me by tens of years, you know?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi laughed, “Grandmother, don’t tease her anymore, she’s going to start crying soon.”</p>
 <p>Lin Rong immediately played along, she rubbed her eyes and pouted, “That’s right. Mother, you cannot become too biased. Ever since you acknowledged Gu Lingzhi, I can count the number of times that you have come to visit on my fingers.”</p>
 <p>Tang Yan replied helplessly, “Who was the one who was so delighted that she went around announcing her relationship with Gu Lingzhi to everyone? As if you were so afraid that nobody would know that you have become an Aunt.”</p>
 <p>Lin Rong stuck her tongue out, “I was just overly excited.”</p>
