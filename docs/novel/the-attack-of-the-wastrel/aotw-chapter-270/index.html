The whole envoy from the North Qiu Kingdom also disappeared together with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did they just use… the Teleportation Spell?” the envoy from the Tianlan Kingdom exclaimed. He was from the Luosheng Sect and was one of the people who had followed Zhong Xiru into the Secret Territory. He was shocked and curious as to what spell Pan Wen had used to disappear into thin air. As part of the Luosheng Sect, it was normal that they were interested in researching such spells. However, since Pan Wen had left so quickly, he did not manage to have a good look of what the spell entailed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is no wonder that Pan Wen had been so daring to sow discord amongst all of us today. It’s because he had a back-up plan. I bet he didn’t think that though he’d be able to escape… he would lose something even more valuable,” Mei Ying smiled evilly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He then turned to look at Rong Yuan and praised him, “Rong Yuan, you were smart to teleport him into your realm.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rong Yuan returned the gesture with a humble smile, yet everyone else who was present became restless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was unimaginable that what helped Rong Yuan to advance to the rank of a Martial Stage was the enlightenment of the existence of space-dimension realms. Since every Martial Artists had different Spiritual Roots, the kinds of realms that they could be enlightened about were different. As for the space-dimension realm, it was known to have the most offensive power compared to the other realms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was no wonder that when a gold-colored protective shield was formed around Rong Yuan earlier, it did not take long before Pan Wen lost his manhood. Martial Sages who had the ability to create space-dimension realms had the power to manipulate space and kill someone in that particular space.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When these people thought about how fast Pan Wen had gotten injured earlier on, they could not help but shift in nervousness, worrying that they might be next.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Did Rong Yuan truly only have the ability to manipulate space? From how he was able to block the attack of the bodyguard who was also at the rank of a Martial Sage and cause Pan Wen to lose his manhood, it seemed that Rong Yuan was also able to manipulate time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Rong Yuan had sucked Pan Wen’s soul into his realm, he had manipulated time in his realm as well. If everyone was to know that Rong Yuan had the ability to manipulate both space and time, they would definitely be extremely shocked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without anybody to interfere, the wedding ceremony became much smoother after that. With the Prime Minister’s blessing, Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan successfully completed their wedding vows to each other before making their way to the bridal room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the way to the bridal room, Gu Lingzhi could not help but ask Rong Yuan, “Aren’t you going to drink with the guests?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to normal wedding procedures, the bride and groom would usually entertain their guests at a banquet before moving into the bridal room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yuan Zheng will do it in my place. It is more important that I spend time with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon hearing this, the matrons of honor giggled, “Your Highness is really sweet to your wife, not even bothering to go to the banquet. We’ll take our leave then, so we do not disturb you any longer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll have to tell my mother tomorrow to increase Ai Lan’s salary.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was good to have a servant that knew the right thing to do under changing circumstances.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Though Gu Lingzhi was shy, she felt extremely happy on the inside too. The veil prevented her from having a clear look at Rong Yuan’s face, but she could clearly see him looking straight at her through the veil, making her extremely nervous.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Lingzhi was thinking about whether she should say something to break the silence before she heard the sound of footsteps, followed by the sound of the door being closed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Rong Yuan had finally returned back to her side, Gu Lingzhi felt her body relaxed before she was picked up by Rong Yuan and thrown onto the soft bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Rong Yuan…” Gu Lingzhi grumbled, the veil obstructing her vision so she could not see what Rong Yuan was doing. She wanted to remove the veil when Rong Yuan stopped her from doing so.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shh…</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">let me do it,” Rong Yuan spoke gently at her ear. His warm breath at her ear caused her face to turn red and hot. Rong Yuan pulled her up so that she was sitting on the bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Rong Yuan looked at Gu Lingzhi who was sitting on the bed, her head slightly tilted downwards as she waited for him to lift her veil, he felt like he could no longer contain the happiness inside of his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Rong Han had suggested for Rong Yuan to get married, Rong Yuan thought that it would take a long time before Gu Lingzhi would agree to it. He did not think that his dreams were coming true now. A few days before the wedding, until today, it had felt surreal to him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that he looked at the girl who was sitting in front of him in a pretty red dress, he could tell himself that the day he had been waiting for so long was finally here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rong Yuan picked up the stick on the table and with a deep breath, he put it underneath the veil and lifted it slightly. He could see that Gu Lingzhi was shivering uncontrollably and he smiled, knowing that Gu Lingzhi was as nervous as he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the veil was completely lifted from her face, the first thing that Gu Lingzhi saw was Rong Yuan’s charming smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lingzhi, you’re beautiful,” Rong Yuan breathed, before planting a kiss on Gu Lingzhi’s lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Lingzhi froze a moment, but then she realized that they were a wedded couple now and it was completely reasonable for Rong Yuan to do anything he wanted to her. Her outstretched hand that had originally intended to push him away slowly relaxed. She arched her neck slightly so that Rong Yuan could kiss her more easily. When Rong Yuan realized this, his eyes filled with lust.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She would be completely his from today onwards!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he saw the nuptial wine on the table, he used his mind to obtain two cups of wine that appeared in his hands the next second. He was reluctant to separate from Gu Lingzhi, but he passed one of the cups to her. With a hoarse voice, he urged her, “Here, drink this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Lingzhi was confused for a moment and looked down to see two nuptial wine cups connected by a red thread. Under Rong Yuan’s guidance, they interlocked their arms as they drank the wine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The moment she took a swig of the wine, Rong Yuan tilted her chin up and kissed her passionately. As they kissed, they exchanged the sips of wine such that it was mixed together in their mouths and swallowed it bit by bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they had finished the wine, Rong Yuan then smiled and said, “This is the correct way to drink nuptial wine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was obviously not the correct way to drink the nuptial wine. Was he trying to trick her just because she had no experience in getting married?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Lingzhi narrowed her eyes at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, to Rong Yuan, it looked more like a plea for his love. Maybe it was the wine or maybe it was because he kissed her, but her lips were redder and poutier than usual. As she panted and looked straight at him, he felt the fire in his body intensify. Heat rushed to his manhood and evidently, he had gotten an erection.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rong Yuan pushed everything in his mind aside as he pressed his body against Gu Lingzhi. It was just the start of the night for the both of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, everyone at the wedding hall knew exactly why Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi had rushed to the bridal hall. They exchanged knowing smiles before resuming normal conversations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whilst Rong Yuan was enjoying himself, his subordinates – Yuan Zheng and the Silver-Armored Troops had a difficult time managing the rest of the wedding ceremony in his stead. They took turns to drink with the various envoys from the other Kingdoms until they were drunk. The joyous occasion slowly died down as the night went on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time the Ronghua Palace was almost empty, Yuan Zheng finally walked towards Yan Liang who was sitting at a corner, drunk. “Stop drinking, I’ll send you home.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not leaving,” Yan Liang’s words slurred. Yet, he still sat straight on the stool and ordered Lu Feng to pour more wine for him. With a pained expression in his eyes, he looked towards the direction of the bridal room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had almost been three hours ever since Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi had left the Ronghua Palace, yet none of them had showed up yet. When Yan Liang thought about what they were doing in the bridal room, his chest tightened. He figured that the only way to lessen the pain was to get himself drunk, otherwise he might lose control and do something that he might regret.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Liking someone could be so painful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop holding onto me, I want to keep drinking!” Qin Xinran bellowed from another side of the hall. Evidently, she had also been drinking huge amounts of wine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xinran, even if you’re happy for Lingzhi’s marriage, you don’t need to drink so much, do you?” Ye Fei looked at her with a bewildered expression. “You can drink more next time, the servants of the Ronghua Palace need to clean up the place now. Be good, we can drink more when we get back.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No, I want to drink it here!” Xinran shook her head. When Ye Fei tried to carry her away, Xinran grabbed onto a nearby pillar. Pitifully, Xinran stuttered, “You’re all so mean. I just want to drink some wine, I…I…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Xinran was halfway through her sentence when tears welled up in her eyes. Not wanting to let people see that she was crying, she wiped off her tears on her shoulder whilst she hugged the pillar.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The man she liked had gotten married to her best friend, can’t she drink some wine because she was happy for them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unbeknownst to Xinran, her actions had caught Yan Liang’s attention. Looking at her, he could tell that they were going through the exact same thing.</span></p>
