 <p>Obviously, Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan had thought of this outcome, but they could not escape and could only face the situation.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Pan Yue’er was not content and had wanted to give Rong Huashang another slap, Gu Lingzhi shouted, “Stop!”</p>
 <p>Under Pan Yue’er provocative gaze, she spoke slowly, “Aren’t I the one you want? Let them go and I will come with you.”</p>
 <p>With that, she reached behind and pinched Rong Yuan’s hand so as to soothe his emotions. Her lips opened slightly and she spoke in a voice that could only be heard by the both of them, “I will make them release Grand-aunt and Pan Yue first. After I leave, you will bring them away and locate Lord Fashen first before rescuing me.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan moved his lips and wanted to say something to oppose, but at that moment, there was indeed no better way than this. Under such a scenario where their strength and position were at an absolute disadvantage, Gu Lingzhi’s choice was undoubtedly the best. But because of this, Rong Yuan’s heart was extremely uncomfortable. If he were to be stronger, Gu Lingzhi need not have to undergo such resort in exchange for the safety of Rong Huashang and Pan Yue.</p>
 <p>“...Be very careful.” Rong Yuan could only utter such words as he repeatedly blamed himself.</p>
 <p>“I will.” Gu Lingzhi replied with a chuckle. The North Qiu Royal Family would not let her die so easily before finding the whereabouts of the Spirit Tribe. After all, that was the task the Deity King had assigned to them…</p>
 <p>“The Third Princess Consort is indeed a heroine. Being able to sacrifice oneself to protect the others is an admirable act.” Pan Luming pretended to compliment her and was quick to order the release of Rong Huashang and Pan Yue from the pillars. He beamed from ear to ear, “Well, you can come over now.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi stood still and frowned at the sight of Rong Huashang and Pan Yue collapsing onto the ground upon their release and said, “What happened to them? Did you feed them something they aren’t supposed to consume?”</p>
 <p>“Why would I?” Pan Luming spoke while smiling, “I’m just afraid that they are too energetic and do something they shouldn’t. I sealed their spiritual powers for the time being. They will be fine after resting for a few days or have someone with a higher level cultivation to help them unblock their veins.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was relieved upon hearing those words. Although Rong Huashang and Pan Yue’s faces were not looking great, it was ascertained that they had not suffered any external injuries.</p>
 <p>And at this moment, there was no reason for Pan Luming to lie to her. She nodded her head, “Get your men to bring them over. Once I’m certain that they are fine, I’ll leave with you.”</p>
 <p>“Lingzhi, don’t fall for their trap, they will never release us!” Rong Huashang shouted as she was being pulled off the ground.</p>
 <p>Pan Yue panted heavily before speaking in a hoarse voice, “Don’t worry about us, I did not help you last time so that you will save me.” If Gu Lingzhi was brought to Pan Luo, wouldn’t everything he had done earlier be in vain? He would rather die than to see something happen to Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>When someone had developed a habit from investing in an activity which was beyond their estimation, their efforts would then become a form of obsession. It was the same as gambling; the more one lost, the more one desired to win. Even if one knew that everything might go down the drain, they would still grit their teeth and persist on.</p>
 <p>The emotions Pan Yue had towards Gu Lingzhi was similar to this. He wanted to watch her grow and reach new heights step by step, breaking the fate of their tribe and freeing the descendants of the Pan Family. He still held on to this glimpse of hope even though he knew that the chances were practically unthinkable. After all, this was the only chance for the Pan Family to get rid of the slave seal on their souls.</p>
 <p>But now, Gu Lingzhi was actually sacrificing herself so as to save him. How ironic was this? Was all of his efforts falling short due to his own failure?</p>
 <p>This turmoil caused Pan Yue’s gaze to become anxious, furious and desperate. Gu Lingzhi laughed lightly, “I know, you are helping yourself.”</p>
 <p>After Gu Lingzhi had spoken, Rong Huashang and Pan Yue were being sent forward, about ten meters away from Gu Lingzhi’s position. The men placed both of them on the ground before locking their eyes firmly on Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>Of course their job was not as simple as sending the two over. Both of them were Demigods. The reason behind Pan Luming sending them over was to prevent Gu Lingzhi from playing tricks. As long as Gu Lingzhi showed any signs of rebellion, the two were ready to attack and subdue her.</p>
 <p>At the same time, a group of people began to gather at the originally empty space behind Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan. They were holding onto Spiritual Weapons and staring closely at them. Once Pan Luming passed the order, they would all be caught alive.</p>
 <p>Glancing casually at the surrounding situation, Gu Lingzhi sneered at Pan Luming, “Senior, are you planning to break the deal?”</p>
 <p>“Why would I? Even though I’m not truthful, I would still keep to my words. As long as you come over obediently, Princess Rong and Pan Yue will naturally be safe.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi actually heard another meaning behind his words. Rong Huashang and Pan Yue would be safe, but what about Rong Yuan?</p>
 <p>Would the North Qiu Kingdom allow Rong Yuan, who was a wild card, back to the Alliance?</p>
 <p>Of course not!</p>
 <p>In fact, Pan Luming had no intentions of letting Rong Huashang and Pan Yue off. He had said those words earlier so as to deceive and stabilise Gu Lingzhi. Now that the siege had been formed, it would be almost impossible for Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan to escape while carrying two handicapped men with no abilities to fight back. It would still be difficult even if they were to abandon Rong Huashang and Pan Yue.</p>
 <p>Thinking of this, Pan Luming no longer had the patience to continue his pretense and ferociously ordered the two sides, “Go!”</p>
 <p>In a split second, the area where Gu Lingzhi and the others were standing had become like a purgatory with an unknown number of domains appearing out of thin air.</p>
 <p>The sky was dark while the wind was howling like a ghost. The gold and cyan wind blades mingled in the wind, clamouring to tear everything in its path.</p>
 <p>“I’ve never thought that after so many years, the descendants of the Spirit Tribe would still so dumb.” Pan Luming’s taunting voice emerged prominently into Gu Lingzhi’s ears, causing her face to turn gloomy in an instant.</p>
 <p>“And the North Qiu Kingdom is as disgusting as your master.”</p>
 <p>As soon as the words fell, the wind howled and an attack that was directed towards her body disappeared strangely before suddenly emerging from Gu Lingzhi’s back. It was as if the blow had entered another space-time before being transported back. It was the power of Rong Yuan’s realm.</p>
 <p>“Protect yourself, leave the rest to me.” Rong Yuan instructed as he hid Gu Lingzhi behind him. He then dashed towards the nearest Demigod.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi used this opportunity when Rong Yuan was blocking off all the attacks to inspect the injuries of Rong Huashang and Pan Yue. After confirming that their spiritual power was just temporarily sealed off as what Pan Luming said, she then heaved a sigh of relief. Gu Lingzhi retrieved two Spiritual Medicine from her Storage Ring and placed them into their hands, signalling for them to swallow. Both of them did not move and just continued to stare at Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>Pan Yue clenched his fists, causing a trail of fresh blood to seep from his fingers. It was hard to imagine how Pan Yue broke his palm when he did not even have the strength to stand up.</p>
 <p>“Are you an idiot? Can’t you see the obvious trap Pan Luming had set? Are you satisfied now that even Rong Yuan is dragged in?”</p>
 <p>The series of questions caused Gu Lingzhi to break out in cold sweat as she was worried for Pan Yue. He was already in such terrible conditions yet he still had such a temper. <em>Wasn’t he afraid of suffocating and killing himself, leaving Ye Fei behind as a widow?</em></p>
 <p>However, it was estimated that these words would raise Pan Yue’s anger and cause him to die faster. Gu Lingzhi could only helplessly point towards the Spiritual Medicine in Pan Yue’s hand and said, “You aren’t eating it? This medicine was made and refined with the spring water from my Inheritance Space. It’s very precious and hard to find.”</p>
 <p>Pan Yue replied, “So what? Can it help us to pass this trial?”</p>
 <p>Even though he said such words, his hand still subconsciously placed the Spiritual Medicine into his mouth. After swallowing the Spiritual Medicine into the stomach, Pan Yue then realised what he had done and grinded his teeth out of frustration.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi chuckled upon seeing how Pan Yue had not forgotten his true nature as a merchant and had subconsciously not wasted any valuable item despite being full of anger. This led Rong Huashang to be full of shock and to suspect that she was seeing things.</p>
 <p><em>They were already in such a situation, how could Gu Lingzhi still possibly laugh? Did she think that there was no chance of surviving and had thus, given up?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi noticed Rong Huashang’s stares and blinked mischievously at her before holding her hand and sending the Spiritual Medicine into her mouth. After making sure that she had swallowed, she then patted the ashes off her skirt and stood up. The Phoenix Sword was then lifted from its sheath and the target was no other, it was – herself!</p>
 <p>“Stop!” As long as you were to hurt any of them, don’t ever think of finding out the whereabouts of the Spirit Tribe.”</p>
 <p>“Lingzhi!” Rong Huashang and Pan Yue exclaimed at the same time.</p>
 <p>“Quickly put the sword down, how could you be joking so casually?”</p>
 <p>“Grand-aunt, I wasn’t kidding. If any of you were to get hurt, I will not continue living. After all, it was because of me that you all had landed in such a plight.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi’s voice was flat as she pressurised those within the area. Pan Luming’s face then changed immediately.</p>
 <p>“Are you threatening me?”</p>
 <p>Gu Linghi laughed gently, “No, I’m just reminding you to keep your promise.”</p>
 <p>“And what if I don’t?”</p>
 <p>“Then be prepared to receive my corpse.” At the end of her speech, Gu Lingzhi used a little force and made a cut that was about half an inch on her neck with the Phoenix Sword. Using an angle at which one’s hair would rise upon seeing the scene, dark red blood was seen flowing down her neck and into her clothes. Soon, Gu Lingzhi’s collar was stained red. If the cut were to be one or two centimeter deeper, she might actually cut until her trachea.</p>
 <p>“You…” Pan Luming squinted his eyes to look at the Phoenix Sword on Gu Lingzhi’s neck and his eyes were filled with intense rage. He had not anticipated that Gu Lingzhi would use this method to threaten him.</p>
 <p>But he could not place a bet on whether Gu Lingzhi was determined or not. If Gu Lingzhi had really died in his hands, it would enrage the Deity King and this was not something his Pan Family could handle. Even if they were a world apart, Pan Luo would still come up with ten thousand methods to eliminate them from the Tianyuan Continent.</p>
 <p>“So? Are you letting them off? Using three lives in exchange for the future of your Pan Family, this deal isn’t a loss right?”</p>
