 <p>There were too many Bat Beasts. Even though Rong Yuan was providing support at the side, there were many people who were still being attacked by the Bat Beasts and many of them became corpses in just a few seconds. There was a mix of roars, cries and the Bat Beasts’ calls.</p>
 <p>This raid took up to twelve hours before it ended. Only when the remaining Bat Beasts flapped their wings and flew away, the people who were subjected to the mind attacks for a long time could finally relax their nerves, groaning and holding their heads in pain.</p>
 <p>There was no cheering after the great catastrophe, and there was only the fear of the unknown.</p>
 <p>Being discovered by the beasts meant that they will always be living in the shadows, for fear of possibly being attacked by the beasts again in the next part of their journey. It was uncertain who would be able to survive and reach the Spirit City, out of the 500,000 people. Many people were scared by the Bat Beasts and started to speak incoherently, complaining that they should not have listened to Gu Lingzhi or Rong Yuan to move to the Spirit City, putting them in danger.</p>
 <p>In regards, Rong Yuan could only smile coldly, “If there is anyone who is unwilling to go to the Spirit City, you may return now.” The only question was whether they even had the power to return to the Forgotten City alive.</p>
 <p>“You speak so lightly, but we have travelled so far, so how can we return?” Someone shouted angrily.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan raised his brows, “If you really wish to return, I can give you a ride.”</p>
 <p>The person who shouted immediately kept quiet.</p>
 <p>That person was merely just joking about it. It was not as if they had not heard about the tragic situation in the Crescent Moon City about those who did not manage to escape from the city. If they returned, they would definitely become the food of the beasts.</p>
 <p>Seeing that no one dared to make a noise or move, Rong Yuan then tidied his shirt, returning back to his tent to rest. As the strongest one in the entire team, he had to rest as much as possible, to ensure that he would be able to face any unexpected encounters in the best state.</p>
 <p>After his figure disappeared into the tent, only did some dare to discuss softly, mostly blaming Rong Yuan for saying that he was bringing them to the Spirit City to seek refuge, but not protecting them properly, allowing many to die after facing the bat beasts for the first time.</p>
 <p>Hearing the commotion, Guan Yue frowned, looking at Rong Yuan’s tent. He lowered his tone and reprimanded the ones who spoke the loudest, “Nonsense! Demigod Rong had good intentions. The path to the Spirit City was not smooth to begin with. Before we left the city, I’ve already clearly told you the possible situations that we could face. It’s too late to regret your decision now. Besides, there were so many Bat Beasts, how could Demigod Rong defend everyone? It is inevitable for some damage to be caused.”</p>
 <p>After reprimanding, Guan Yue paused, scanning the ground filled with the corpses of Bat Beasts, before commanding, “There is no need to look for tonight’s dinner, these Bat Beasts will do.”</p>
 <p>To keep them from having to starve overnight was the only thing that was comforting tonight.</p>
 <p>After explaining to the attendants how to deal with the aftermath, Guan Yue went into Rong Yuan’s tent. The beasts would come again, and they would have to reformulate their plans for the journey…</p>
 <p>The Bat Beasts’ flesh was not delicious. Perhaps it was because they lived off fresh blood, no matter how they cooked the Bat Beasts’ flesh, there was always a strong bloody smell. It was not a tasty meal, and yet it was the only dinner where they were full since they have started on this journey.</p>
 <p>After everyone had their dinner and before they could get some sleep, they received orders to continue on their journey. It was only until most people’s faces reflected exhaustion that they could stop for a rest. After a short nap, they continued to hurry on their way.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Gu Lingzhi, who just came out of the Wasteland City, after two days, saw shadows upon shadows. Gu Lingzhi was very happy, thinking that she had caught up with Rong Yuan and the others. Only when she got closer, did she then realise that it was actually a group of beasts.</p>
 <p><em>Weren’t they going to attack the Wasteland City? Why were they heading towards the Spirit City then? Unless they had changed the target of their attack?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi's face turned ugly and followed far behind the herd, until she saw the beasts split their way during the night. One group was headed to the Spirit City, and the other to the Wasteland City. She then understood that the beasts did not intend to fight just one battle, but had changed it to two battles.</p>
 <p>Observing from a distance, the group of beasts that separated to head towards the direction of the Wasteland City, Gu Lingzhi silently hoped that the Wasteland city would be able to survive this disaster, before she continued to follow the group of beasts that were heading to the Spirit City.</p>
 <p>After following them for less than a day, she found out what was wrong with the group of beasts.</p>
 <p>Although there were many ferocious beasts heading to the Spirit City as well, as compared to those arrogantly heading towards the Wasteland City, the numbers were very different. <em>Did the beasts think that just because there were only a few people in the Spirit City, there was no need for so many beasts?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi understood this question a day later.</p>
 <p>Looking at the long line of people appearing at the end of her line of sight, Gu Lingzhi's heart lifted. She ran as fast as she could in that direction, not even bothering to hide her figure although the group of beasts were only ten meters away from her, and left behind a trail of dust.</p>
 <p>“Oh—"</p>
 <p>“Eh—"</p>
 <p>The group of beasts let out startled sounds, one after another, in which it was followed by a crazy chase.</p>
 <p>The beasts that caught sight of Gu Lingzhi’s figure howled as they chased after her, their calls alerting the beasts in front, causing an uproar.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi relied on the flexibility of her body movements to move left and right as the group of beasts pursued her. In the end, she even jumped into the group of beasts, stepping on the heads of the different beasts to move forward. Those she stepped on like stepping stones, fell onto the ground as soon as her feet left.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a familiar sharp pain shot through her brain and Gu Lingzhi looked towards the sky with her red eyes and it was indeed a large group of Bat Beasts hovering above.</p>
 <p>“Those damn Bat Beasts!” Their mind attacks are so much more troublesome as compared to physical attacks by the other beasts. Sparing no effort, she stepped hard with both feet and the two beasts under her feet let out a yelp before falling to the ground. With the strength from that step, Gu Lingzhi’s body moved to work at its peak and she rose up. As the Bat Beasts dived towards her, she suddenly rose, half floating in the sky. With a leap, she struck at them with her Fengwu Sword. The Bat Beasts in its surroundings immediately let out wails and went off to find somewhere to hide. At lightning speed, Gu Lingzhi continued to strike with a few more fire swords, and a large number of Bat Beast bodies fell, as though they were a patch of black snow.</p>
 <p><em>Hiss!</em> Suddenly, a sharp and long hiss drilled into Gu Lingzhi’’s ear, causing Gu Lingzhi’s actions to freeze momentarily. The surrounding Bat Beasts seized the opportunity and charged towards Gu Lingzhi, wanting to tear her, who dared to set their kind on fire, into shreds. However, in a blink, that human disappeared.</p>
 <p>In the Inheritance Space, Gu Lingzhi clutching her head with lingering fear, and recalled the sharp mind attack she had encountered that was sharper than by the other Bat Beasts added up together, and still felt pain in her brain. It was hard to imagine that Bat Beasts that have barely achieved the Silver Class Warrior’s power could launch such a frightening attack. Even her, a Martial Sage was affected, and could hardly control her form from falling onto the ground.</p>
 <p>“No, that could not have been an attack by the Bat Beasts!” Gu Lingzhi muttered. Attacks by Bat Beasts were almost silent, acting in the brain, however this attack was obviously made by a sound, which were many times more powerful than an attack by the Bat Beasts.</p>
 <p>“Lingzhi, what is the matter with you?” It just so happens that Lu Heng was nearby when he saw Gu Lingzhi enter the Inheritance Space, clutching her head, talking to herself.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi’s eyes brightened and looked at Lu Heng, asking “Second Brother, within the Lost Lands, do you know what beasts, other than the Bat Beasts, have the power to attack the mind?”</p>
 <p>“Power to attack the mind?” Lu Heng frowned for a while, before he shook his head. “No, Bat Beasts are the only ones that I know that have the power to attack the mind. Why don’t you ask Sixth Brother? Old He knows more.”</p>
 <p><em>Jiang Xinghai was with the migrants in the Forgotten City.</em> <em>How could she possibly ask him?</em> Gu Lingzhi rolled her eyes and gave up on talking to Lu Heng.</p>
 <p>Counting the time, she had hidden in the Inheritance Space for so long and the group of beasts had disappeared. She should be off on her way again, so Gu Lingzhi patted Lu Heng's shoulder for him to practice hard and went out again.</p>
 <p>"What's the matter with Lingzhi? Coming in and out of the Inheritance Space." Seeing Gu Lingzhi directly disappearing into space again, Lu Heng blinked.</p>
 <p>As Gu Lingzhi expected, the beasts were not extremely intelligent. In a situation where no one could be found, they thought that Gu Lingzhi was already gone. After circling around with no sight of Gu Lingzhi’s figure, they continued to hurry on their way.</p>
 <p>As compared to one human who had disappeared, obviously the large group of humans in front was more important and delicious. One of the beasts drooled and greedily continued on the road. Among the group of beasts, a translucent white worm the size of a palm laid on top of the head of a beast. It lifted the top half of its body and its round eyes turned suspiciously. It then layed back down on its stomach. The beast it layed on looked exceptionally fierce, shuddered violently, its eyes filled with panic, as it carefully dragged the bug forward. If Gu Lingzhi saw this scene, she would definitely be able to recognize that the bug lying on the head of the beast was very similar to what Jin Hao had originally held in his palms.</p>
 <p>However, it was a pity that Gu Lingzhi had been hiding in the Inheritance Space at the time, and did not see this. Even after she came out, as she wildly ran to catch up with the crowd in front of the group of beasts, she did not notice anything else.</p>
 <p>In order to avoid being found by the beasts again, delaying her speed. Gu Lingzhi chose wisely, to fly this time.</p>
 <p>Those that had become a Martial Sage or above could fly, and accompanied with the Moon Stride movement technique, she was extremely fast. Gu Lingzhi finally managed to catch up to the front of the beasts and joined the group heading for the Forgotten City.</p>
 <p>At that time, the team heading for the Forgotten City had entered a state of high alert. As they hurried forward, they continued to pay attention to the situation behind them. Rong Yuan, Guan Yue and others who were powerful, had all shifted their positions to the back of the group, their backs keeping a distance from the group of beasts behind them. Rong Yuan held a high-grade spirit stone in his hand to replenish the spiritual power he had used up. From time to time, he created earth walls or vines that were three to four meters high, in order to block the path of the beasts. However, the effects were small and only obstructed them a little.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Rong Yuan instinctively raised his head to look in the direction of the group of beasts. He could see a shadow that was of the size of a rice grain flickering above the black crowd of beasts, just like the brightest star in the night sky. This made Rong Yuan who had been gloomy for many days, let out a soft smile.</p>
 <p><em>Lingzhi is finally back...</em></p>
