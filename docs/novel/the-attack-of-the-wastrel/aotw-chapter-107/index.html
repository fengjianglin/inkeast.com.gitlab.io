<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>“You!” Gu Linglong’s eyes widened and she lifted her hand to slap Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>When Gu Lingzhi said that, she knew Gu Linglong would get angry. Her smile disappeared as she avoided the slap, looking as though she was being bullied by Gu Linglong.</p>
 <p>As Gu Lingzhi had spoken softly, the people around them only heard the loud shouts from Gu Linglong. This made it seem like the arrogant Gu Linglong was bullying her weaker older sister, causing Gu Linglong to receive many disapproving looks.</p>
 <p>Naturally, Gu Rong and Lin Yue-er who were here to send their children off for the test saw the scene unfold in front of them. They did not understand what was going on and could only see the look on Gu Linglong change from one of mockery to one that wanted to attack. The two sisters were then separated by the people in-charge. Gu Rong had initially wanted to instruct Gu Lingzhi to take care of Gu Linglong but the words were stuck in his throat as he could not bring himself to ask her.</p>
 <p>Seeing the indignant look on Gu Linglong’s face as she was dragged away, Gu Lingzhi lowered her head and a sly smile pulled at the corners of her mouth.</p>
 <p><em>When Gu Lingzhi told Gu Rong earlier this morning that she was going to attend the examination as well, she could read Gu Rong’s intentions from his face. Just as she was thinking of how she could reject Gu Rong, Gu Linglong provided the perfect opportunity. How could Gu Lingzhi pass on such a good opportunity?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Very quickly, the head examiner, Jiang Xian, appeared in front of everyone. He immediately announced, “I believe everyone already has a simple understanding of the test today. Similar to past years, all of you will head to the back of the school. The route there will be filled with numerous obstacles and demon beasts. You will have to defeat the demon beasts and obtain a minimum of five beads from within the beasts. After that, you will have to make sure that you reach the backdoor of the school before sunset in order to pass and become an official student of the school. If you do not meet any of the criteria, you will fail the test and not be able to enter the Royal School.”</p>
 <p>Jiang Xian then paused for a moment as his eyes locked onto Gu Linglong among the crowd of participants. Jiang Xian admired Gu Lingzhi and as he had seen what happened earlier, he was slightly annoyed by Gu Linglong. As his gaze fell on Gu Linglong, he intentionally said, “Lastly, I want to emphasise that although the abilities of Martial Artists is very important, to the Royal School, we also emphasise on following the rules. If I were to find out about any unscrupulous behaviour among participants, such as stealing other’s beads by force, I will fail you regardless of who you are and you will never be able to apply again! I hope that everyone will consider the consequences of your actions and not take the risk.”</p>
 <p>His long speech finally ended, signalling the start of the test. A bell sounded and over a hundred young participants rushed into the Red Leaf Hill as if blown by a strong gust of wind.</p>
 <p>Gu Linglong was furious as she walked amidst the crowd. Jiang Xian was looking directly at her as he said those words, clearly warning her to behave. Although she was embarrassed, indignance and fury also burned within her.</p>
 <p><em>Gu Lingzhi was a bitch who had angered Gu Linglong on purpose to make her look bad. She’s nothing more than a child of a slut. One day, Gu Linglong would surpass her and show everyone that she was Gu Rong’s most outstanding daughter!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>On the other hand, Gu Lingzhi had already been in the Red Leaf Hill multiple times and did not hesitate to take a detour to head to the back of the school. Whenever she met a demon beast, she would then kill them and retrieve their bead.</p>
 <p>As she walked, she marvelled at the amount of resources the Royal School had. The entire Red Leaf Hill was basically the Royal School’s back garden and they could do whatever they wanted with it. Two months ago, it was filled with ferocious demon beasts and acted as the final examination for students. Now, it was changed into a testing ground for new students and filled with low-level demon beasts suited for Level Six Martial Students.</p>
 <p>At the start, Gu Lingzhi was able to take her time. However, after four hours had passed, she started to have a headache. Hearing the occasional shouts of help from within the woods, she started to become more wary.</p>
 <p>Although the demon beasts in the forest were not difficult to deal with, the road was filled with obstacles that were hard to avoid. This was a way for the school to test the observation skills of their potential students.</p>
 <p>In order to inspect the woods closely for traps, Gu Lingzhi started to proceed slower and more carefully.</p>
 <p>As time passed, a few students that were lagging behind her started to catch up and overtake her. This included Gu Linglong.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was not surprised by Gu Linglong’s appearance. After all, she was the favored mistress of the Gu Clan and did not lack training. Other than her hair looking slightly dishevelled, Gu Linglong still looked pretty energetic and could not help mocking Gu Lingzhi, “I never thought that I would see you here. I didn’t think that you were capable of anything other than acting like an obedient child. I see you actually have some abilities, maybe you’ll be able to reach the back door of the school before nightfall.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was in the midst of observing the route in front of her and had no time to bother with Gu Linglong. She threw a stone at the ground in front of her to test the floor. After a second, the ground did not move.</p>
 <p><em>Good, it meant that the road was safe.</em> Relieved, Gu Lingzhi stepped forward and continued examining the trees around her. Looking up, she realised that the branches of trees were intertwined in an unnatural way. She nodded her head and took a detour.</p>
 <p>Seeing how Gu Lingzhi ignored her, Gu Linglong’s fury rose as she rushed towards Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>“Gu Lingzhi, why aren’t you acting anymore? Aren’t you happy to see me suffer?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi gave her a cold look and stated plainly, “Out of our kinship, I will remind you that this place is not safe.”</p>
 <p>“What do you mean? Are you trying to threaten me?”</p>
 <p>This time, Gu Lingzhi was too lazy to even give her a cold look. She silently proceeded to find a safe route.</p>
 <p>“Gu Lingzhi, let me tell you this. Even if… ah!” Gu Linglong shouted in surprise as a few vines suddenly appeared, dragging her towards the tree branches.</p>
 <p>“Help! Gu Lingzhi, you set me up! You made me step into the trap on purpose, didn’t you?”</p>
 <p>After her initially frenzy of getting tied to the tree by the vines, Gu Linglong’s face was covered in dirt as looked at Gu Lingzhi. “You knew there was a trap and lured me here on purpose. How could you be so evil? When I get out of here, I will tell everyone about how you set me up!”</p>
