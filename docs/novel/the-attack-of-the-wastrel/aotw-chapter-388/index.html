 <p>“Brothers of Burnt City, come with me and kill those few big beasts!” Le Yan shouted out loudly as he saw the Giant Insect Beasts about to reach the city walls. His companions behind him also let out some shouts as they followed behind him and rushed towards those few Giant Insect Beasts.</p>
 <p>The citizens within the city let out huge cheers praising the Chancellor, as they saw this scene.</p>
 <p>Le Yan was very experienced with dealing with beasts and he knew that a beasts’ strength was not simply dependent on their size. In his opinion, the most powerful Insect Beast among this group only had the strength of an Amethyst Class Warrior. He, alone, was enough to deal with it. His companions would be able to deal with the rest of them.</p>
 <p>Earlier, he had sent some people to call Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan over because he had wanted to show off some of his strength. His guess was spot-on. This group of Insect Beasts only had the strength of an Amethyst Class Warrior. However, because of the hardness of their bodies, they were actually very close in strength to a Glaze Class Warrior. When his first attack landed on the Insect Beast, he realised that they were too big. The Insect Beasts had already reached the city walls, he could not let them damage the city walls. He could only shout out a command loudly, “You don’t have to kill them, just try to hold off as much as possible, do not let them approach the city walls!”</p>
 <p>The shell of the Insect Beast was hard, but it was not impossible to break. It just required his full strength as well as some time.</p>
 <p>Having heard Le Yan’s instructions, his companions could only grit their teeth miserably and act accordingly. The strongest one amongst them was only an Amethyst Class Warrior. Against these few huge beasts, they simply stood no chance at all.</p>
 <p>Unexpectedly, these Insect Beasts which were usually very easy to deal with, became so difficult to deal with once they grew so large. They were only able to create some sparks when their attacks landed on the shells. At Le Yan’s side, he was only slightly better off than them as a Glaze Class Warrior. With his full-powered attack, he was only able to leave a crack on their shells. To completely break through their thick and hard shells, he would need a lot of time.</p>
 <p>The citizens who had prepared to welcome their Chancellor back victoriously were stunned when they saw the bitter fight. <em>Wasn’t their Chancellor a powerful Glaze Class Warrior? How could he look so powerless against these few Insect Beasts?</em></p>
 <p>Le Yao realised that something was wrong and hurriedly explained, “The Insect Beast has become much more hardy after becoming bigger. Their shells are fine despite being attacked non-stop by Amethyst Class Warriors. It seems like their hard shells are already as strong as a Glaze Class Warrior.”</p>
 <p>Although Le Yao’s words resolved the crowd’s doubts, what followed after was a wave of intense fear and panic towards the Insect Beasts.</p>
 <p>“Since these Insect Beasts are so tough, will the Chancellor be capable of stopping them? What if they were to rush over?” In the face of the Insect Beasts’ enormous mountain-like sizes, the city walls hardly seemed to be strong enough.</p>
 <p>“Don’t scare yourself. The Chancellor is already a Glaze Class Warrior, how could he be unable to stop a few Insect Beasts?” Didn’t you see that the Vice Chancellor has already managed to stop several Insect Beasts? Once the Chancellor kills off that Giant Insect Beast that he is fighting, then the remaining few will not be an issue anymore.”</p>
 <p>“But…but…what if the Insect Beasts manage to break through the blockade before the Chancellor has killed off that one?” His whole body shivered as though he had seen something incredibly terrifying outside the city.</p>
 <p>The man who believed in the Chancellor earlier laughed, “How can that be possible?”</p>
 <p>He turned his head and continued to observe the situation outside the city. This time, his face changed, “Damn it! Why didn’t they stop that Giant Insect Beast? If it manages to run to the city gate, then everyone is going to die!”</p>
 <p>After he shouted out in shock, he hurriedly ran deeper into Burnt City, hoping that he would have a higher chance of staying alive after the Giant Insect Beast knocked down the city walls.</p>
 <p>Obviously, plenty of people had all witnessed this scene. The people who were standing guard on the city walls saw this incident and many of them started running towards the inner city with the same mindset. In a split second, more than half of the Warriors who were guarding the city wall nearest to the Insect Beast had fled. The remaining few were so frightened that they were in a daze and unable to move.</p>
 <p>Le Yao cursed and roared out loud, “Why are all of you running? Aren’t I still here?”</p>
 <p>She then took Ding Jiule and her other male concubines and jumped off the city walls. They broke through the many layers of beasts and directly rushed towards that one Insect Beast.</p>
 <p>Although Le Yao’s private life was very messy, her strength was actually quite good. As a woman, she was able to train her body to become an Amethyst Class Warrior, proving her talent. A whip lashed through and Le Yao successfully slowed down the Insect Beast. Together with Ding Jiule, she attacked the Giant Insect Beast. Her other male concubines dealt with the surrounding beasts so that the two of them could deal with the Giant Insect Beast without any distractions.</p>
 <p>Now that Le Yao had joined the battle, the people who had previously fled in a panic started to return bit by bit. However, their eyes were constantly trained on Le Yao. They were deeply afraid that the Insect Beast would suddenly succeed in breaking away. At this time, the people who had been in charge of blocking the Insect Beast had managed to catch up to it and surrounded it again.</p>
 <p>However, the Insect Beast seemed to have become cleverer with its previous experience of breaking out from the encirclement. It actually turned a blind eye to all of their attacks, relying on its hard shell to withstand the attacks. It then took the opportunity to slam violently into the people in front of it, breaking out of the encirclement successfully and rushed towards the city walls. As long as it could knock down those walls, then it would have completed its mission successfully!</p>
 <p>When Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan had rushed over, this was the scene that they saw.</p>
 <p>The citizens fled in panic while the faces of Le Yao and the surrounding fighters changed greatly as they struggled to chase the Insect Beast. Like a fairy from the moon, Gu Lingzhi flew out. As though she was treading on moonlight, her feet moved so quickly in the air that there were afterimages. Before she arrived, a wall rose up from the earth in front of the Insect Beast, blocking its path. Then her silhouette flashed, and she landed on the top of the wall. With fire spiritual power, she used her Fengwu Sword and slashed downwards. The Insect Beast howled miserably. Two of its eight legs had been cut off and the remaining fire spiritual power penetrated the Insect Beast’s body, inflicting a second major injury. It howled miserably once again and madly crashed into Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi snorted and leaped onto the back of the Insect Beast. With both hands, she used her Fengwu Sword concentrated with golden spiritual power to stab downwards. The shell which had remained unbroken even after the combined attacks of Le Yao and her male concubines, was instantly punctured by the sword, her sword dug in halfway.</p>
 <p>The Insect Beast wailed loudly once more as it thrashed about in an attempt to throw off the person on its back. However, Gu Lingzhi held on tightly to her half-buried sword and stood as steady as a mountain. Her eyes flashed and she channelled even more golden spiritual power into her Fengwu Sword again. The sharp golden spiritual power entered the Insect Beast’s body and turned into countless small blades that cut the insides of the Insect Beast. The Insect Beast moaned loudly and collapsed, dead, as green blood flowed out from its nose, mouth, and wounds.</p>
 <p>From the time when Gu Lingzhi appeared to when she had killed the Insect Beast, only a few breaths of time had passed. Everyone was stunned and stared at Gu Lingzhi incredulously.</p>
 <p><em>The Insect Beast… was killed so easily?</em></p>
 <p>Compared to the bystanders, Le Yao and the others who had fought the Insect Beast, suffered a much greater shock. <em>Were Martial Artists that much stronger than Warriors of the same rank? The Insect Beast that they had tried so desperately to stop was actually killed so easily by her. Even in their records, the difference in strength between Martial Artists from the outside world and Warriors were not this great!</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was unconcerned about the impact on others caused by her action and very quickly moved on to another Insect Beast. As for Rong Yuan, he had already killed three Giant Insect Beasts. Compared to Le Yan who was slowly grinding away at the Insect Beast, Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan appeared to be much more relaxed.</p>
 <p>They acted so quickly that Le Yan was still unaware of the situation even after they had killed seven Giant Insect Beasts. When Le Yan heard the cheers coming from the city, he had even thought that the citizens were cheering in support of his brave and valiant figure fighting against the Insect Beast. Instead, he almost vomited blood at the sight after he took the time from his hectic battle to glance back.</p>
 <p><em>Why were all the other Insect Beasts dead? Were the pair standing on the corpse of an Insect Beast Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan? When did they arrive? Were those Insect Beasts killed by them? Also, why were the citizens staring at them in veneration? Don’t they know that he was their Chancellor, not them? Was it so amazing that they had managed to kill those few Insect Beasts? He could kill them too!</em></p>
 <p>Such excessive stimulation could rouse a human’s potential. The Insect Beasts’ shells which were previously difficult to break turned out to be much easier under the effect of his stimulated potential and in less than a quarter of an hour, the Insect Beast collapsed with a wail. However, Le Yan did not feel as pleased as he expected. Instead, he glanced at Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan as he forced out a smile, “Many thanks for helping. If it were not for the two of you, it would be unknown how much time we would need to deal with these few Insect Beasts.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi smiled, “Wasn’t it the Chancellor who had sent some people to call us over? Wasn’t it to deal with these Insect Beasts?”</p>
 <p><em>Of course not!</em> Le Yan pretended not to be ashamed as he praised Gu Lingzhi’s strength before returning to the city walls. As he saw how his citizens stared at Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan in worship yet did not bother with him at all, Le Yan clenched his fists. He took several deep breaths before he raised his head and addressed everyone, “The Insect Beasts have already been defeated, victory will naturally be ours if we fight against the rest of the beasts together!”</p>
 <p>“We will be victorious!” Many people echoed after him. The citizens became much more unified after this simple encouragement.</p>
 <p>Just as Le Yan was about to lead a group of fighters out against the beasts to win back some of his honour, the beast horde started to retreat like before without any prior warnings.</p>
