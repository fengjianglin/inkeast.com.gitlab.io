<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Business was as usual at the Bright Silk Eating House. Numerous customers poured in and out and the delicious smell of food wafted out of the shop.</p>
 <p>Gu Linglong brought Gu Lingzhi into the private room she had reserved.</p>
 <p>As she entered the private room, Gu Lingzhi assessed her surroundings. Even though she knew the answer, Gu Lingzhi still asked, “Where is Father? Why do I not see him?”</p>
 <p>“Maybe he was caught up by something. You know that Father always has things piled up on his plate.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi nodded as if to accept Gu Linglong’s excuse. However, she became more on guard.</p>
 <p>“Sister, the snacks from Bright Silk Eating House are the best. Since we are waiting here, we should eat something while we wait.” Without waiting for Gu Lingzhi’s response, Gu Linglong grabbed the order sheet and wrote down a few dishes, handing it to the waitress standing outside the private room.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi did not stop her but looked at her bemused, “You have changed. Seeing how you did not call me a bitch the moment you saw me, it seems like you have really matured in the past few months. You are even able to calmly order food for us. The Royal School has really taught you well.”</p>
 <p>Sensing the obscured meaning behind Gu Lingzhi’s seemingly kind words, Gu Linglong wanted to lash out in anger. However, she thought of her plan and forced herself to calm down. She pursed her lips and forced a laugh, “You must be kidding me, Lingzhi, we are a family. No matter how much we don’t get along, blood is still thicker than water, why would I hold a grudge against you?”</p>
 <p>The two of them continued to make idle conversation as the waitress brought in a few dishes.</p>
 <p>“These are the dishes you ordered as well as sake. Please help yourself.” The waitress placed the dishes down one by one and left the room.</p>
 <p>After the waitress left, Gu Linglong immediately gestured to Gu Lingzhi to begin eating, acting as if all their disagreements before were nothing but a dream and the two sisters had a close relationship. Each dish was brought in front of Gu Lingzhi by Gu Linglong as she coaxed her, “Sister, eat more since we are already here. When Father comes later on, we can order more dishes.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi looked at the dishes in front of her piling up and really wanted to tell Gu Linglong that her unusual behaviour was making it very difficult to not be suspicious. But as Gu Lingzhi’s eyelashes fluttered, she decided not to say it. She followed what Gu Linglong wanted and grabbed her chopsticks, extending it to the porcelain bowl in front of her.</p>
 <p>“You are right, which family holds grudges? I will not be able to finish all these by myself, you should eat too.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi smiled innocently as Gu Linglong suddenly hesitated.</p>
 <p>“Why? Are you afraid of sharing my saliva? Don’t worry, I haven’t even touched my chopsticks yet. It is still clean,” Gu Lingzhi intentionally interpreted Gu Linglong’s expression differently as her eyes filled with interest.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi’s words made Gu Linglong realise that she had almost exposed herself. Laughing dryly, she picked up her chopsticks and stuffed a few mouthfuls of vegetables into her mouth.</p>
 <p>Luckily, she had listened to Tao Qian and took the antidote beforehand. Otherwise, she would not have dared to eat and Gu Lingzhi would be suspicious.</p>
 <p>“Sister, please eat too,” Gu Linglong reminded Gu Lingzhi after taking two mouths.</p>
 <p>“No rush, let me drink some tea first.” Gu Lingzhi laughed. Lifting the teapot, she poured a glass for herself. Using the glass as a shield, she took out an antidote meant for all kinds of poison from her storage ring. She then swallowed the pill secretly as she drank the tea. Following that, she then proceeded to begin eating the dishes under Gu Linglong’s watchful eye.</p>
 <p>First off, she ate an emerald green vegetable that was the most popular dish of the Bright Silk Eating House.</p>
 <p>As Gu Lingzhi ate it, she kept it in her mouth and tried to detect any difference in taste. Very quickly, she realised what was off.</p>
 <p>Luckily for her, Gu Lingzhi was always brought to the Bright Silk Eating House by Ye Fei and Tianfeng Jin to eat and was extremely familiar with every dish. Therefore, it was easy for her to taste the difference in today’s food. <em>There was an extra sweetness…it was the Thousand Fantasy Herb!</em></p>
 <p>The flavour was very mild and along with the flavour of the vegetable, if she was not alert, she would not have realised anything difference in taste.</p>
 <p>With a plan, Gu Lingzhi then extended her chopsticks to the next dish. Not unexpectedly, she tasted another herb in the food.</p>
 <p>In the next four to five dishes she tried, she could taste that they contained different herbs. Individually, each herb would make the dish become more fragrant and would not have any negative impacts. However, when three or more were consumed, their combined effects would create a reaction that was similar to when one consumed the Thousand Fantasy Herb.</p>
 <p>Tilting her head downwards, Gu Lingzhi could guess what Gu Linglong wanted to do to her today. She played along and ate all the vegetables in the first bowl, moving on to the next few dishes.</p>
 <p><em>Although people may have ill intentions, the food was innocent.</em></p>
 <p>Gu Linglong looked at Gu Lingzhi taking big mouths of the food without caring and secretly celebrated the success of her plan. At the same time, she despised the way Gu Lingzhi was eating. <em>It was certainly different to be a child of a slut. Even if she was now the Third Prince’s fiancée, she still behaved like a hungry ghost and did not even know that her food had been manipulated with.</em></p>
 <p>After eating the majority of the food on the table, Gu Lingzhi rubbed her stomach as she thought of the time. Deciding that it was about time, she blinked and pretended to be curious as she rubbed her chin.</p>
 <p>“That’s weird, it isn’t that sunny today, why is it so hot?”</p>
 <p><em>Hot? Are the herbs finally working?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Linglong’s eyes glittered as she asked, “Sister, are you not feeling well? Do you want me to help you to the guest house in the back to rest?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi fanned herself with one hand as she used her other hand to press on the table, in an attempt to get up. “There is no need, I…I will just head back to school.”</p>
 <p>But before she could stand properly, she fell back on the chair, “This is weird, why do I feel so tired?”</p>
 <p>“Sister, you can’t even stand properly, let me help you to the guest house to rest.”</p>
 <p>Gu Linglong no longer bothered to pretend to sound obedient as she sneered at Gu Lingzhi. She opened another door and let someone into the room.</p>
 <p>Through her half-opened eyes, Gu Lingzhi recognised that this person was the waitress that was serving them.</p>
 <p>“Quick, the medicine has started to take effect. Bring her to the guest room, I will go get someone.”</p>
 <p>Gu Linglong left hurriedly after saying this. The waitress was actually Tao Qian, a girl who appeared to be weak and delicate. After Gu Linglong left, she looked at Gu Lingzhi with disdain. Gu Lingzhi had started to remove parts of her clothing haphazardly as Tao Qian spoke to her in a soft but cruel voice, “Is it very hot? Someone will come to help you later. I really wonder what the Third Prince will do when he sees his beloved fiancée fooling around in bed with a stranger?”</p>
