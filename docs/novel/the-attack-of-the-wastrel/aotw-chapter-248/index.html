 <p>“Lingzhi, you’ve taken quite a number of spiritual treasures for me during this period, why don’t you return to the palace and rest for a few days first before coming again.”</p>
 <p>After receiving the spiritual treasure Gu Lingzhi gave him and seeing her wanting to rest at the temporary shelter beside the main hall as usual, Pan En seemed concerned.</p>
 <p><em>What exactly is Pan En planning?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi pondered in confusion while her face revealed a touched expression, “I’m fine, Second Highness. I’ll just rest here.”</p>
 <p>“How can that be?” Pan En shook his head and glanced at Gu Lingzhi with affection, “No matter how great it is here, it can never be compared to the level of comfort the palace offers. You have been tired for such a long time, just follow me back to the palace for a few days of rest. Seeing you so exhausted makes my heart ache.”</p>
 <p>Since Pan En has already spoken, Gu Lingzhi did not persist further. Moreover, she would like to find out what he has up on his sleeve. <em>Why did he suddenly want her to take a rest?</em></p>
 <p>After apologising to Rong Yuan in her heart, Gu Lingzhi followed Pan En and left the Sacred Lands.</p>
 <p>On the route back to the Royal Palace, she could sense someone watching her. Pan En acted even more suspiciously as he constantly asked her matters regarding the main palace. The focus was on how she could easily pass Liu Yiyan’s challenge.</p>
 <p>“If only my subordinates had capabilities like you and can easily come and go into the main palace, the North Qiu Kingdom’s strength would definitely improve. What a pity …”</p>
 <p>“Second Highness, there’s no need to worry. Don’t you have me?” Gu Lingzhi looked at Pan En timidly. Her performance was exactly like a woman in love, “Isn’t what’s mine yours too? Just tell me if you need something. The treasures in the main palace can’t be finished even after moving them a thousand times.”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing Gu Lingzhi’s words, piles of treasures involuntarily appeared in Pan En’s mind. His eyes flashed for a moment, remembering the duty delegated by his ancestors before taking Gu Lingzhi to a remote place.</p>
 <p>“Oh? This doesn't seem to be the direction to the Royal Palace?” Gu Lingzhi knowingly asked after being conscious of Pan En’s actions. She wanted to get up and leave the horse carriage. Pan En hurriedly stalled her and explained, “This is another route to the palace. Before I return, I have to get something for my uncle from here.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, alright,” Gu Lingzhi replied, seemingly believing what Pan En said. She was in fact, touching the Storage Ring hidden beneath her sleeves and retrieving the Fenlan Painting that contained Zi Zi.</p>
 <p>As Hua Qingcheng had to take care of Meng Rou, he stayed behind in the Sacred Lands. Rong Yuan was still inside the main palace. Even though it was predetermined that the North Qiu Kingdom’s Royal Family would not do anything to her due to the treasures in the main hall, she had to protect herself in case they dared to hurt her.</p>
 <p>The wildebeest carriage advanced forward again for another half an hour. Suddenly, the hull of the carriage was unstable and Gu Lingzhi’s body rushed forward uncontrollably. After managing to hold onto the wall of the carriage and stabilizing herself, she heard a gloomy voice from outside, “Is the Second Prince of the North Qiu Kingdom, Pan En, and Lady Gu inside the carriage?”</p>
 <p>“Who is he?” Gu Lingzhi questioned Pan En with her gaze. With a bitter laugh, Pan En shook his head and expressed that he was unclear of who the person was. With one hand, he pushed open the door of the wildebeest carriage and came face to face with a tall man wearing a purple and black mask and exuded a fierce vibe. “I am indeed Pan En, what do you want?”</p>
 <p>The man snorted and looked at both of them from top to bottom before spitting out a chilly sentence, “I heard that you both have found quite a lot of treasures in the Sacred Lands. If you want to survive, you’d better obediently hand over your Storage Ring, or else…”</p>
 <p>Although he had not finished his words, Gu Lingzhi and Pan En both understood what he meant. Pan En’s face darkened instantly, “By doing this, aren’t you afraid that the elders in my home would come after you?”</p>
 <p>The masked man made a low and unpleasant laughter, “One picks up wealth amidst the dangers. For the sake of the rare treasures in the Sacred Lands, it’s worth the risk.”</p>
 <p>After that, he stared at both of them fiercely, “Are you giving it to me or not? If you’re not, I would take the risk and fight for it, even if it means that I might offend the North Qiu Royal Family.”</p>
 <p>Accompanied by the fierce voice, a powerful pressure surged over the top of their heads. As soon as they felt this force, both of their faces changed.</p>
 <p>“It’s a Demigod! Lingzhi, we should just…” After recognising the person’s cultivation, Pan En motioned to Gu Lingzhi to obey the masked person’s words. “The treasures can be taken again. However, if you lose your life, you’ll have nothing at all.”</p>
 <p>“At least the Second Prince is smart enough. Now that you have Lady Gu around, you don’t have to be afraid of getting more spiritual treasures.”</p>
 <p><em>“This person has the smell of the Biyun Fruit on his body,</em>” Zi Zi’s voice suddenly sounded in Gu Lingzhi’s mind. The Biyun Fruit was a spiritual treasure that she handed to Pan En just half a month ago. Presently, there was only one seedling in the entire Tianyuan Continent. The number of years needed for it to grow and be used as a medicine was still uncertain. Now that this person had the smell of the Biyun Fruit on his body while Pan En did not release any news of losing it, where could this person possibly come from? She just needed to probe a little more to find out his identity.</p>
 <p>However, just what exactly was Pan En scheming? Could it be that he sent someone to test her as he was afraid that she might steal the main palace’s treasures out of greed? But everytime she acquired the treasures from the main palace, she would turn them over without fail. With North Qiu’s foundation, there iwasno need to do such a thing.</p>
 <p><em>Then what could it be exactly? Unless…her identity as the controller of the Sacred Lands had been discovered?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p><em>No, that could not be it either.</em> If her identity had been exposed, Pan En would not be here staging with the masked man on making her hand out the Storage Ring but torture her directly. Then, the only conclusion would be to test her. Thus with a change of mind, she put the Fenlan Painting that was hidden underneath her sleeves inside the inheritance Space.</p>
 <p>“Lingzhi, hand him the Storage Ring quickly.” He had already pretentiously handed over the Storage Ring, but Gu Lingzhi still sat in a daze, so Pan En could not help but to urge her. He wondered in his heart, <em>Gu Lingzhi would not really have something eccentric right?</em></p>
 <p>Before he could finish guessing, Gu Lingzhi was seen happily removing the Storage Ring from her hand and tossing it outside the door of the carriage.</p>
 <p>“I hope you’ll keep your word and release us now.”</p>
 <p>“Naturally.” The masked man caught the Storage Ring Gu Lingzhi tossed and began examining it eagerly. Gu Lingzhi took the opportunity and reminded Pan En, “Second Highness, can we leave now?”</p>
 <p>Pan En was stunned for a moment before realising that he had a scene to act. He deliberately increased his volume and asked, “Ah, yes. Senior, may we leave now?”</p>
 <p>With the power of the Demigod, a small amount of effort was all that was needed to clearly see the contents within Gu Lingzhi’s Storage Ring. Pan En’s sentence was also secretly asking the masked man if there were any suspicious belongings within Gu Lingzhi’s Storage Ring.</p>
 <p>The masked man pondered for a moment before recovering his consciousness from the Storage Ring and said, “Be on your way now.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi heaved a sigh of relief secretly. Ever since she owned the Inheritance Space, she had enjoyed keeping the prized possessions inside it. Within the Storage Ring were only some Alchemy materials and a few spiritual treasures that were not very rare. The only precious thing was the Fengwu Sword.</p>
 <p>“Hang on.” Just as Gu Lingzhi pondered if she needed to find some time and resculpt another sword, the masked man’s voice rang once again, “You still have a ring on your hand.”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing this, Gu Lingzhi was taken aback but still kept her cool and said, “Senior, this ring is just an ordinary one, not a Storage Ring.”</p>
 <p>“You must still give it to me.” Seeing how Gu Lingzhi has rejected him, the masked man lowered his volume, the threat in his tone is self-evident.</p>
 <p>“Just give it to him Lingzhi, unless the ring has other functions?”</p>
 <p>He had long discovered the ring on Gu Lingzhi’s hand. The small silver ring was simple yet generous, no spiritual fluctuation could be felt from it. It seemed to be made from normal iron. When worn by a Martial Artist, something feels off no matter how one looks at it. Previously, even though the situation had been life-threatening, Gu Lingzhi did not hurriedly remove the ring. Thus, he did not suspect anything. However, her hesitant attitude right now led him to be suspicious.</p>
 <p><em>Was it really necessary to give away the ring now and having to find a chance and obtain it back later?</em> Gu Lingzhi lowered her eyes and pursed her lips. From the perspective of Pan En and the masked man, this was the look of absolute grievance. Just when the masked man was about to snatched the ring away from Gu Linhzhi, she whispered in a mournful voice, “This ring is an object of no elegance. It’s ok to give this to you, but it is actually a love token given to me by the Third Prince of the Xia Kingdom.”</p>
 <p>Upon saying this, Gu Lingzhi glanced at Pan En apologetically, “Originally, this item should be thrown away when I’ve decided to be with you. But since the Third Prince has personally bestowed it to me, I have to return it in order to break our fate completely. Ever since Rong Yuan has been taken away by Ding Rou, he was never to be seen again. There was not enough time to return the ring, so…”</p>
 <p>Before Gu Lingzhi could finish saying, Pan En and the masked man both understood what she meant.</p>
 <p>Certain that the both of them would not head over to Rong Yuan for verification and even if they did, he would come up with an idea to help her conceal her plan, Gu Lingzhi then casually put the blame on Rong Yuan. Afraid that the Demigod would not believe her, she deliberately removed the ring and pointed to the inner frame, “If you still do not believe me, there’s an engraving of the Third Prince’s surname here.”</p>
 <p>After she spoke, she handed over the ring.</p>
 <p>Once the masked man received the ring and took a look at it himself, he found that it was exactly like Gu Lingzhi had said, no matter how he observed it. The ring was made from normal silver and within the inner ring, there was an engraving of a word. It was just that the font was quaint and used back in the ancient times.</p>
 <p>After confirming that there were no issues with the ring, the masked man twitched his face beneath and looked at Pan En with sympathy. It must have been really miserable to have a girl wearing a token of love from another man while accompanying him. He wanted to help Pan En, so he wanted to instantly crush the ring with one blow.</p>
