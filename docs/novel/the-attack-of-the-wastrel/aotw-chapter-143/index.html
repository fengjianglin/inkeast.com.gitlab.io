<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Even if Consort Rong preferred Tianfeng Wei as her daughter-in-law, as long as Rong Yuan was not willing, she would not insist on it. She even took the initiative to announce the annulment of the engagement the day after she knew of her son’s feelings.</p>
 <p>Even though she had heard reports from her various sources about Gu Lingzhi, it was only when she finally met Gu Lingzhi did she understand why her son would be so infatuated with her.</p>
 <p>Although Gu Lingzhi was only sixteen, she had a demeanor beyond peers her age. Her gaze was focused and calm. Just based on this alone showed that she was not like any other girl.</p>
 <p>Thinking back to Gu Lingzhi’s history, Consort Rong felt more pleased with her new prospective daughter-in-law. It was no wonder that even Yan Liang, reputed to be as cold as a rock, would be moved by her.</p>
 <p>“Lingzhi, if there’s anything you’re unhappy about with Rong Yuan, feel free to say it and he’ll change. Marriage is a very important matter, you shouldn’t reject something so important over small grievances.”</p>
 <p>“Consort Rong, Your Highness, the matter between the Third Prince and me isn’t any small grievance. In the first place...” <em>She didn’t even have that kind of feelings for him</em>!</p>
 <p>However, before Gu Lingzhi could finish what she wanted to say, Consort Rong interrupted her, saying cheerfully, “Since that’s the case, then, let’s not bring up something like rejecting the marriage anymore.”</p>
 <p>Consort Rong could obviously see Gu Lingzhi’s reluctance about the matter, and deliberately cut her off.</p>
 <p>“Come, let’s eat! Let’s not talk about distressing things, just take it as having a meal at my place,” Consort Rong continued, as she instructed a serving girl to help Gu Lingzhi get her portion. Following that, she immediately focused on eating. By her side, Rong Yuan was acting similarly, making Gu Lingzhi feel awkward if she insisted on talking. Gu Lingzhi helplessly followed their lead, digging into her food. Unbeknownst to her, as she was attacking the mountain of food that the serving girl had heaped onto her plate, Rong Yuan and Consort Rong exchanged a meaningful glance, with the same cunning look hidden in them.</p>
 <p>Only after Rong Yuan had escorted her back to her own residence did she realize that her objective in agreeing to go to the palace to meet Consort Rong had not been achieved in the least. Rather, because of Rong Yuan and his mother taking turns to lead the conversation, she could never find the chance to bring up her issue.</p>
 <p><em>Could it be that Consort Rong doesn’t want me to break off the engagement with the Third Prince?&nbsp;</em>Immediately, she thought that was impossible. Consort Rong’s fondness of Tianfeng Wei was well-known, and she had constantly taken Tianfeng Wei along with her to many functions and parties among the aristocracy. Also, talking about first impressions, she did not think that she was that capable to thoroughly impress Consort Rong on their first meeting, to the point that the latter would be set on having her as a daughter-in-law.</p>
 <p><em>Could it be something to do with her status? That can’t be right either.</em></p>
 <p><em>Although being the First Mistress of the Gu Clan sounded like something pretty impressive, given the Royal Family’s intelligence network, how could Consort Rong be unfamiliar with the Gu Clan’s present circumstances? If it was to find someone with a background worthy of the Third Prince, there were plenty of more suitable people. For example, Beicheng Haoyue who visited her today would definitely qualify, way more than herself. Then…what explanation could there be for Consort Rong’s inexplicable favorable impression of her?</em></p>
 <p>Her failure in rejecting the marriage engagement left her in a bad mood.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, in the palace, Rong Yuan was feeling extremely pleased with himself. Knowing his mother so well, he knew that his mother would not make things difficult for her out of consideration for his feelings. <em>Even if she did not like Gu Lingzhi personally, she would still restrain herself, what more when Gu Lingzhi’s performance today was so good?</em></p>
 <p>His purpose in bringing Gu Lingzhi to visit Consort Rong today was two-fold. Overtly, it was simply to have Gu Lingzhi meet his mother. Beyond that, however, what he truly intended to do was use the chance to tell everyone that Gu Lingzhi was not just someone he fancied, but that she was someone who Consort Rong approved of. <em>With that done, as long as nothing unexpected happened, Gu Lingzhi was destined to be his!</em></p>
 <p>“Yuan Zheng, I’m in a really good mood tonight. Shall we have a couple of drinks?” In his jubilant mood, Rong Yuan could not help but resist inviting Yuan Zheng to share a few drinks with him.</p>
 <p>Yuan Zheng frowned as he heard this, and reminded Rong Yuan, “Your Highness, you have a class tomorrow.”</p>
 <p>It was already 2am, if they really started drinking now, they would probably finish at dawn.</p>
 <p>“No problem, at most, you can just take over the class for me.”</p>
 <p>Yuan Zheng immediately regretted bringing up that point.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>The next day, Yuan Zheng was in class on time as usual. However, unlike most days which he would arrive early in order to make things difficult for the latecomers, the Third Prince was late today.</p>
 <p>This made those students who came early to circumvent the Third Prince’s eccentricities absolutely infuriated.</p>
 <p>If they had known that class would be delayed by two hours today, they would not have bothered to get here early. Still, no matter how much frustration they felt, looking at Rong Yuan’s unsympathetic look, they could only swallow it down.</p>
 <p>At the end of the day, their lives were still the most important. In order not to cross the Third Prince and suffer his ire, they knew that they had to swallow anything the Third Prince did.</p>
 <p>Surprisingly, the Third Prince was in an exceptionally good mood today. From the start of class till the end, only two unfortunate students had their points deducted. As for the rest of them, they managed to complete the task even with a few mistakes.</p>
 <p>As though realizing something, the entire class covertly looked in Gu Lingzhi’s direction. The fact that Gu Lingzhi had gone with the Third Prince to have dinner with Consort Rong, returning just before the curfew was something that almost everyone knew about. Combined with the Third Prince’s odd behavior today, was it a sign that something had happened last night?</p>
 <p>Instantly, the look that everyone gave Gu Lingzhi became saddled with a variety of emotions. Among many of the girls, there was also a trace of disdain.</p>
 <p>“I can’t believe she sold herself to obtain unfair gains, one day she’ll suffer for it.”</p>
 <p>“Precisely, she acts noble and pristine all the time. Who knew that she was so devious inside? What does the Third Prince even see in her, could it be something to do with her <em>other&nbsp;</em>skills?” The girl who said this immediately sneered harshly thinking about it.</p>
 <p>“What are you saying, aren’t you embarrassed to talk about it?” Another girl replied, as her face flushed a deep red. She pushed the other girl teasingly as she too smirked at the thought.</p>
 <p>Regarding all these people who were thinking nasty things about her, Gu Lingzhi had already learned to ignore them. Even when she heard what some of them were saying, she merely smiled casually, noting down the names of these people so that she could get back at them in the future.</p>
 <p>However, even though she did not react to it, someone else did. Therefore, the class was suddenly filled with a sharp shriek.</p>
 <p>“Ah! My hair! What the hell, who’s doing it?” Following the first shriek, another cry followed soon after.</p>
 <p>“Ah, my clothes!”</p>
 <p>“No! Stop! Who is releasing the fire spiritual energy?!”</p>
 <p>Similar ear-piercing shrieks and cries rang out here and there, as though they were competing for who could scream the loudest.</p>
