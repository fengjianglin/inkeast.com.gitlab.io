<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>“Fengyin Grass, Jiulong Herb, Lingxu Sprout…” Gu Lingzhi chanted as she picked out the ingredients needed to create the Spirit Essence Bath. After repeated failures, she finally found out that she had to change two ingredients entirely and use ingredients of a higher grade in order to create a higher tier version of the Spirit Essence Bath.</p>
 <p>The Spirit Essence Bath turned from dark green to black and emitted a fresh medicinal fragrance which made Gu Lingzhi eager to try it out.</p>
 <p>She left her Inheritance Space and wanted to try out the effectiveness of the Spirit Essence Bath that she had made, but before she could, she heard someone shouting.</p>
 <p>“Gu Lingzhi, come out now! I challenge you to a competition!”</p>
 <p><em>It’s actually the voice of a male?&nbsp;</em>Gu Lingzhi furrowed her brows when she realized that the voice had sounded familiar. She walked over to the window and looked out to see Feng An’s silhouette.</p>
 <p>“Gu Lingzhi, you’re such a coward. You rank as the first in the Alchemy Tower, yet you do not dare to accept my challenge?”</p>
 <p>Tianfeng Jin unsheathed her sword and pointed it towards Feng An, remarking coldly, “If you can’t get past me, you don’t have the right to challenge Gu Lingzhi.”</p>
 <p>Feng An unconsciously retreated a few steps back when the sword was pointed in his face. He thought again about his original purpose of going to find Gu Lingzhi, before he shouted at Tianfeng Jin. “It is none of your business that I am challenging Gu Lingzhi. You specialize in Martial Skills, so why would you care about Alchemy at all?”</p>
 <p>Everyone in the Tianyuan Continent knew that Alchemy and Martial Skills were separated into two completely separate realms of Martial Practitioners.</p>
 <p>There is a limit to a person’s spiritual energy, therefore someone who was outstanding in one area would naturally not perform as well in another. Usually, an exceptional Alchemist would be weaker in fighting. Even if they had achieved a high level of cultivation, they would still be inferior in terms of their ability to fight when compared to another Martial Practitioner of the same Level as them. This applied to Tianfeng Jin as well.</p>
 <p>“This is just the excuse of a weak fighter,” Tianfeng laughed in mockery. She knew that Gu Lingzhi was exceptional in both Alchemy and Martial Skills. Not only did she have a talent for Alchemy, she was also extremely strong when it came to fighting.</p>
 <p>Tianfeng Jin was only suspicious because Feng An had suddenly decided to challenge Gu Lingzhi. She did not understand why he did not bother to show off in front of the new students today, but instead came all the way here to challenge Gu Lingzhi. <em>Unless, he was someone sent by one of the girls who had a crush on the Third Prince?</em></p>
 <p>Her suspicions quickly disappeared, when she saw that Ye Fei was playing with a treasure as big as her fist. When Ye Fei saw that Feng Jin looked ready to fight, she went up to Feng An and scolded him.</p>
 <p>“Feng An, are you a sore loser or does your brain have a problem? The fact that Gu Lingzhi is ranked as the first Yellow-Level Alchemist just means that she has the capabilities to earn that title. Even if you can’t acknowledge that, the truth will not change. If you had any pride in being an Alchemist at all, you should divert the time that you spend showing off in front of new students into improving your Alchemy skills, instead of making so much noise here like a crazy dog.”</p>
 <p>Ye Fei did not bother to soften her words at all, which made Feng An absolutely furious. He really wished that he could become a mad dog right there and then so that he could bite Ye Fei to death. Yet, he did not dare to do anything to either Tianfeng Jin or Ye Fei, because he was born from a small clan and could not afford to offend any of them who belonged to bigger clans.</p>
 <p>“Fine, I accept your challenge.”</p>
 <p>When she saw that there were more people who had gathered to observe the commotion, she shouted from her window before Ye Fei could lash out at Feng An again. “How do you want to compete? I will go through with it any time.”</p>
 <p><em>If she could prove herself and let people who had the same thoughts as Feng An back off once and for all, it may not be a bad idea to accept Feng An’s challenge.</em></p>
 <p>“We will compete on our Alchemy skills, right now!” When Feng An had heard Gu Lingzhi’s agreement to compete, he took no time at all to announce his motive. Yet, deep down, he secretly hated the fact that Gu Lingzhi was in the hostel, yet waited for Tianfeng Jin and Ye Fei to speak out for her first. <em>She must be scared which is why she did not accept his challenge at first.</em></p>
 <p>“You became the top-ranking Yellow-Level Alchemist at the Alchemy Tower?” Tianfeng Jin could not help but ask the moment she saw Gu Lingzhi come down from the stairs.</p>
 <p>Although Tianfeng Jin knew a long time ago that Gu Lingzhi was talented in both Alchemy and Martial Skills, she did not think that Gu Lingzhi was much better than she had anticipated. It had only been a short period of time since Gu Lingzhi had enrolled into the Royal School. <em>If Gu Lingzhi had achieved such a feat in such a short period of time, what more if she had more time to advance? Wouldn’t she achieve first place in all the Alchemy Towers?</em></p>
 <p>“Yes, it happened in the afternoon, I didn’t have time to tell you.”</p>
 <p>Tianfeng Jin silently gave Gu Lingzhi a thumbs up. Not because of Gu Lingzhi’s innate talent, but because of her calmness.</p>
 <p>After becoming the top-ranked Alchemist in the Alchemy Tower, Gu Lingzhi did not show any signs of excitement or gloating whatsoever, instead of chatting around as per usual. It was rare for someone to be this calm and steady even after achieving results that others would be jealous of.</p>
 <p>“Thank you,” Gu Lingzhi generously accepted Tianfeng Jin’s compliments before walking over to Feng An.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go now.”</p>
 <p>Other people who had been watching the commotion also walked in the direction of the Arena.</p>
 <p>Tianfeng Jin looked over at Ye Fei for a second, before they both hurriedly caught up with the crowd. Qin Xinran, who had received the news even before they reached the Arena, rushed over and gave Feng An a death glare.</p>
 <p>“I… I followed the rules and am challenging her openly. Which… which student in the Royal School has never been challenged before?” Feng An stuttered underneath Qin Xinran’s glare. He was starting to regret how rash he was in challenging Gu Lingzhi. Even if Gu Lingzhi was no longer under the protection of the Third Prince, there was still that lunatic, Qin Xinran. In the Royal School, the existence of Qin Xinran was way more frightening than that of the Third Prince.</p>
 <p>“Hehe…” Qin Xinran let out a short laughter. She did not have an opinion about how Feng An had challenged Gu Lingzhi, she was just intrigued at how Feng An was so easily startled by her when he was the one who had the guts to challenge Gu Lingzhi first.</p>
 <p>“When the competition is over, don’t leave yet. Let’s go to the battle arena for a match.”</p>
 <p>Feng An immediately turned dark. <em>Who had come out alive after fighting against Qin Xinran?</em></p>
 <p>“Me too,” Tianfeng Jin added blandly. This made Feng An turn white completely. He looked so frightened that Ye Fei could not help but intervene.</p>
 <p>“Stop scaring him, you guys. He’s going to underperform and blame Gu Lingzhi for winning unfairly.”</p>
 <p>“Mm, you are right,” Gu Lingzhi turned back to look at Feng An. “If you can beat me, you don’t have to fight them anymore.”</p>
 <p><em>If he doesn’t win, then he should start praying for his life.</em></p>
