 <p>“It ended… just like that?” Gu Lingzhi was slightly stunned.</p>
 <p><em>What happened to wanting to let her see how he fought? Liar!</em></p>
 <p><em>How could she learn anything if he ended the battle in just one move?</em></p>
 <p>However, the person that was the most upset about this was the Third Prince’s opponent. He did not think that his first battle would be against the Third Prince and now, he lost to him in just one move. It really did damage his pride.</p>
 <p>“I was just lucky. If you’re a top tier Martial Lord like me, it would be hard to say who would’ve won,” Rong Yuan said as he saw Gu Lingzhi staring at him from under her mask, not wanting her to think that he was just an arrogant bully. He gave Liang Po a firm pat on the back, which made Liang Po feel much better.</p>
 <p>“Liar!” Gu Lingzhi exclaimed. Rong Yuan initially thought that winning the battle in one move would definitely impress her, but he did not think that she would call him a liar instead. His brows instantly furrowed and looked at Yuan Zheng in confusion.</p>
 <p><em>Didn’t Yuan Zheng say that girls were attracted to powerful people? He had already shown how outstanding he was, why did Gu Lingzhi still call him a liar?</em></p>
 <p>“Xiao Hei, the Town of the Brave does not allow anyone to lose on purpose to ensure fairness,” Rong Yuan tried to remind her that he had won fair and square.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi pursed her lips, feeling like she had been teased. “Didn’t you say you would let me see how you fight? This is only one battle, are you afraid that I might secretly learn the Royal Family’s techniques?”</p>
 <p>“Why would I be?” Rong Yuan tried to explain himself, “If you want to learn the Royal Family’s skills, I can just teach you, you don’t have to learn it secretly.”</p>
 <p>Yuan Zheng, who had been standing close by, found this scene intriguing. It seems to him that Rong Yuan had indeed set his mind on Gu Lingzhi. The Royal Family’s techniques were top secret and could not be divulged to outsiders and only members of the Royal Family were able to learn it. Rong Yuan’s words evidently meant that he was determined to make Gu Lingzhi his wife eventually.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Gu Lingzhi did not understand the meaning underneath his words, but she did know that the Royal Family’s techniques could not be spread to outsiders. Seeing how serious Rong Yuan was, her heart skipped a beat. She calmed herself down before replying coldly, “Who wants to learn your techniques? I only wanted to see how the experts fight, that’s all.”</p>
 <p>She felt like smacking her forehead the moment she realized she had called the Third Prince an expert.</p>
 <p>She felt that she became a child whenever she was around the Third Prince. Only around him would she ever say such childish things. <em>Had the Third Prince’s pampering really changed her? This was not a good sign.</em></p>
 <p>Rong Yuan’s eyes brightened when he heard what Gu Lingzhi had said. He smiled slyly, “So it seems that in your heart, I’m already an expert. If that’s the case, why would I disappoint you?”</p>
 <p><em>Why did she feel that towards her, Rong Yuan acted even more like a child than she did?</em></p>
 <p>Not long after, it was time for Rong Yuan’s second battle.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, his opponent was Liang Po again. Liang Po had an extremely unpleasant expression on his face, which propelled Rong Yuan to smile apologetically and say, “Sorry for beating you too quickly earlier on, I promise this time I will not let you lose so quickly.”</p>
 <p>Liang Po was speechless. <em>What’s the point if he was going to lose anyway?!</em></p>
 <p>Rong Yuan was a man who kept true to his words. When he said he would not let Liang Po lose so quickly, he really did take his time.</p>
 <p>To let Gu Lingzhi better see the way he fought, he tried to lure Liang Po into an area of the stage that was the closest to where Gu Lingzhi was. He even slowed down his attacks so that Gu Lingzhi could see every swing and kick that he made.</p>
 <p>Yes, it was more like a performance. Everyone in the arena could tell that Rong Yuan had intentionally slowed down his speed of attack. Not only were the audience in shock, but even Liang Po had mistakenly thought that he had a chance of winning.</p>
 <p>It was indeed a misperception on his part, because right when Liang Po tried to win by increasing the speed of his attacks, he did not even swing twice before Rong Yuan suppressed him. Liang Po had no choice but to slow down his attacks once again.</p>
 <p>“It seems that the Third Prince is going to have a breakthrough to become a Martial Sage, don’t you think?” Elder Pu commented to a middle-aged man that was standing nearby.</p>
 <p>“He controls his spiritual energy wonderfully which allows him to control even his opponent. His opponent has no choice but to let him take the lead in attacking. The Third Prince is in a league of his own. Our Xia Kingdom will soon have another powerful Martial Sage,” the middle-aged man commented after observing Rong Yuan for a while. “From what I know, he’s only around 30 years of age. Seeing as how he has achieved this level of cultivation at such a young age, it is no wonder he is rumored to be the person that would most likely become a True God.”</p>
 <p>“Haha, if the Third Prince can really become a True God, I would let him buy all my cultivation resources at a third of the price.”</p>
 <p>The two did not bother to lower their voices as they talked, so everyone that was nearby could hear them clearly. Their reactions differed from envy, jealousy to respect.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi herself was also nearby, and heard what they had said. She felt like she had gained a newfound understanding of just how powerful the Third Prince was.</p>
 <p>It was common knowledge that whoever possessed Spiritual Roots would be able to cultivate and become a Martial Artist. However, in the whole Tianyuan Continent, there were very few top-tier Martial Artists. Currently, the highest cultivation that a Martial Artist had reached was only a demigod, and there were less than twenty of them. This alone showed the difficulty of being a top-tier Martial Artist. As a Martial Artist reached a higher level of cultivation, the harder it would be for him to advance to a higher tier.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan was about to become a Martial Sage at just thirty years of age clearly showed that he was a top talent even amongst talents. When she thought about this, Gu Lingzhi looked forward to when she herself would turn thirty. Hopefully, she would be just like him, reaching a league of her own.</p>
 <p>Though Rong Yuan had been fighting, a large amount of his concentration was still on Gu Lingzhi. When he saw how Gu Lingzhi was looking at him, he thought that his method of dragging the battle out had worked. He was set on the idea of dragging this battle for as long as possible.</p>
 <p>He continued fighting for over an hour that even Elder Pu who was watching from the side had to urge him to end the battle.</p>
 <p>“Third Prince, quickly end the battle when you are done experimenting with your battle techniques, there are many matches to be fought after yours.”</p>
 <p>Evidently, Elder Pu thought that Rong Yuan did not end the battle because he had learnt some new fighting techniques and was testing it out on his opponent.</p>
 <p>Yuan Zheng, who was the only one who knew the truth silently covered his face. If it was possible, he really wished he did not have to admit that Rong Yuan was his master. If he had known that his master would become so stupid when he was in love, he would have done whatever he could to prevent Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi from coming to the Town of the Brave.</p>
