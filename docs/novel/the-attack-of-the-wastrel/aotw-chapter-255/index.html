However, the nasty words that Gu Lingzhi had said to him gained her many looks of disapproval.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Lady Gu, even though Demigod Wu is widely known to be part of the North Qiu Kingdom’s Royal Palace, he cannot control the fact that he was born as a single child. Furthermore, Demigod Wu has a humble personality and he has a great reputation in the Tianyuan Continent. You’re going slightly overboard with your words,” someone said, but this person had received a favor from Wu Liguo before. After seeing how Gu Lingzhi had been inconsiderate to Wu Liguo, that person was naturally upset.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, Demigod Wu is an extremely friendly and amicable person and has never committed any crimes. Your words are too much, Lady Gu.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ever since the first person rebutted, so had the rest who supported Wu Liguo. Gu Lingzhi only felt a strong sense of helplessness and she looked at these people who helped to speak up for Wu Liguo, not remembering how furious they had been earlier on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Pan Family’s plan on ruling over the Tianyuan Continent was too intricate and far-sighted. Their power had permeated the society for a few thousand years, allowing them to gain the support of many by sending out disciples that were loyal to them. In this situation, Wu Liguo could rely on his popularity to make a comeback, but what about others?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it was not for the fact that she had enough evidence on hand, people would continue holding the Pan Family in high regard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“In order to get evidence against the ambitious North Qiu Kingdom, Lingzhi risked her life alone in the Royal Palace so that she could infiltrate the Secret Chamber. Yet, this is what she gets in return. If that’s the case, then she no longer has to release the list of spies to all of you. Anyway, the spies are part of the Pan Family, and they cannot control which family they were born in, so they shall continue infiltrating your societies then. When the North Qiu Kingdom finally deploys their troops, we’ll see if they beg for mercy on your behalf.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rong Yuan finished his sentence in one breath, and the faces of the other people immediately darkened. When they thought about the list of spies that Rong Yuan had mentioned, they had no choice but to swallow their unhappiness. However, they were determined to deal with Rong Yuan another time, after they had gotten their hands on the list of spies that was now with Gu Lingzhi.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Did he really think that he could be disrespectful to his elders just because he was known as a talented Martial Artist?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone who had managed to become a Demigod became a well-known figure amongst their peers. Even though Rong Yuan had the reputation of being the Martial Artist that was most likely to be a True God, to these elders, he was just another young Martial Artist that possessed slightly more talent than his peers. Becoming a God was an extremely difficult feat. There had not been a True God in the Tianyuan Continent for more than a few hundred thousand years. Even if he did have a chance at becoming a True God, he was still a mere Martial Lord now and could easily be trampled by them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Knowing that Rong Yuan was standing up for her, Gu Lingzhi stealthily grabbed his hand and squeezed it slightly, not wanting him to say any more. Using her other hand, she retrieved a few letters from her Storage Ring. Wu Liguo’s eyes widened when she passed all of the letters to Mei Ying who was standing beside her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Elder Mei, these are the letters that Wu Liguo had been sending back to the North Qiu Kingdom these few years. There are a few interesting things that I’ve read in here. Elder Fan, I’ll have to trouble you to distribute these letters out to the other elders,” Gu Lingzhi briefly commented, before returning to Rong Yuan’s side. She rubbed his hand gently as she looked at him, silently telling him that the next few moments would be interesting to watch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Gu Lingzhi’s tiny movement made Rong Yuan’s heart leap, the only thing that he wanted right now was to give her a kiss. However, with an audience here, he could only rub her hand in response. However, his action was different from Gu Lingzhi’s one – it was a slow stroke – which made Gu Lingzhi’s face redden instantly and she glared at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other hand, Mei Ying distributed the letters that Gu Lingzhi had passed to him. All Martial Artists had the ability to understand the contents of a huge chunk of text by merely glancing at it. Everyone’s faces changed in an instant. In particular, those people who had previously spoken up for Wu Liguo felt like they had gotten a slap in the face after reading the letters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These letters were situation reports of the Muji Kingdom. As a spy, it was no surprise that such letters were being sent back to the North Qiu Kingdom. However, what made them angry was the attitude of the words that were on the letters. In these letters, Wu Liguo exuberated an arrogant persona, he did not bother to hide his contempt towards the people around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people who had stood up for him and thought that he was a kind man, had been described by him as people with low intelligence. To Wu Liguo, he did not have to spend a lot of effort to gain their favor and loyalty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The people who had supported him all along found it unbelievable. They did not expect that someone whom they had respected and agreed with all along had such a cunning and evil heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where do you think you’re going?” Mei Ying suddenly shouted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Liguo had been trying to escape while everyone had been reading the letters. However, Mei Ying had been keeping an eye on him the entire time and managed to stop him before he could escape. The rest had finally recovered from their state of disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Gu Lingzhi, how did you get your hands on these letters?” Wu Liguo could only snap at her whilst he was glued to the ground, his powers suppressed. After advancing to a Martial Sage, he had become the most important informant to the North Qiu Kingdom. Everything that could be traced back to him was hidden in the most concealed and impenetrable Secret Chamber.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How exactly did Gu Lingzhi get her hands on those letters? Could there be a traitor amongst the Pan Family?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even until that moment, Wu Liguo refused to believe that Gu Lingzhi had gotten those secret letters by relying on her own capabilities. In other words, he simply could not believe that she had gotten those letters at all, because if that was the case, it would be a huge hit to the Pan Family. He could not imagine the Pan Family’s plan, that had been a few thousand years in the making, falling apart because of one fatal mistake. He did not even dare to think about how the other Kingdoms would rebel against the North Qiu Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did you seduce Pan En and get the letters from him? I always knew that he was unreliable! The Pan Family is getting worse and worse at selecting the next kings!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“Shut up! Lingzhi is nothing like you filthy animals!” Rong Yuan could not help but burst out in anger after hearing Wu Liguo try to stain her reputation. He was already thinking about how he would punish Wu Liguo and get information about the Pan Family out of him. Even though he had more than enough information about the North Qiu Kingdom’s power structure from Gu Lingzhi’s resources, he would make use of this opportunity to torture Wu Liguo as much as he could.</span></p>

If she did not seduce him, how would it be possible for her to get her hands on those secret documents using her own capabilities?” Wu Liguo challenged Rong Yuan.</span></p>

If a Martial Practitioner can infiltrate into the Secret Chamber, it’s just a matter of time before the North Qiu Kingdom’s Royal Palace collapses,” Rong Yuan continued to challenge Wu Liguo. In his heart, he had already decided on how he would torture Wu Liguo.</span></p>

Seeing the smile on Rong Yuan’s face only made him angrier such that he forgot what he had wanted to say.</span></p>

However, Gu Lingzhi had other plans. She slowly took out another set of documents from her Storage Ring.</span></p>

As she saw everyone’s curious gazes, she smiled plainly, “I’ve forgotten to tell all of you that that isn’t all of the documents that I had managed to get from the North Qiu Kingdom’s Secret Chamber. These letters include all the information that the North Qiu Kingdom managed to get from their spies that were planted in the different Kingdoms. There are a total of 362 spies covering every single Kingdom in the Tianyuan Continent. I’ve already arranged these letters according to the different Kingdoms. If all of you do not mind, please find the letters that correspond to the Kingdom you’re from and take a look, then you’ll know that I’m not lying.”</span></p>

Now, she was telling them that she had far more information that they had previously thought, including all of the information regarding the spies. They were no longer simply surprised, they were shaken!</span></p>

These secret messages must have enabled them to have a stronghold over other Kingdoms for so long.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With all this information laid out in front of them, they could not help but think to themselves whether the North Qiu Kingdom had a traitor in their midst.</span></p>

When she had given out all these letters to them, was it not so that they could report it back to the rulers of their respective Kingdoms?</span></p>
