<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Just as Feng An had finished talking, he was immediately speechless when he saw who had replaced him as the first on the list.</p>
 <p>He rubbed his eyes, unable to believe what he was seeing.</p>
 <p>“There must be something wrong with my eyesight, how can someone be better than me?”</p>
 <p>He rubbed his eyes until it was sore, yet Gu Lingzhi’s name still lingered there on the position where his name once was. As for his name, where he had worked for the past few months to finally get to the top of the list, was below Gu Lingzhi’s name.</p>
 <p>“How is this possible? Gu Lingzhi? Isn’t she the one who relied on the Third Prince to get into the Royal School? How could she climb up to the top of the list in such a short amount of time?”</p>
 <p>“Even if it’s hard to believe, it is the truth.” Being at the top of the list, Feng An had always ridiculed many students around him. Now, they were not afraid to speak up and mock him, letting him have a taste of his own medicine. Whoever said that did not care who was first on the list, as long as it was not the arrogant Feng An.</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, Gu Lingzhi appeared at the entrance of the tower, ready to leave.</p>
 <p>“Look, it’s Gu Lingzhi. She’s leaving the Alchemy Tower?” The moment she took a step out of the tower, someone had noticed and cried out in surprise.</p>
 <p>Everyone followed the sound to look towards Gu Lingzhi. Gu Lingzhi subconsciously retreated a few steps. She was instantly alarmed and got ready to fend off any attacks.</p>
 <p>“You’re Gu Lingzhi?” someone slowly raised their voice, dragging an angry and indignant Feng An to the front.</p>
 <p><em>This was… Feng An who was previously on the top of the list?</em></p>
 <p>When she glanced over at the Stone Tablet, Gu Lingzhi immediately understood why she was being treated so nastily. For a moment, she hated that she had placed herself in the spotlight.</p>
 <p><em>However, this was not completely her fault. How would she have known that she would be ranked first in the Alchemy Tower after completing all five stages? If she had known earlier, she would have made a mistake in the earlier tests on purpose to reduce her overall score.</em></p>
 <p>“So? I’m asking you a question. Are you mute?” Feng An scolded rudely, when he did not get a reply from Gu Lingzhi. “No matter what tricks you’ve used to get to first place, I’ll definitely expose you! Just you wait!”</p>
 <p>Feng An then walked past Gu Lingzhi and entered the Alchemy Tower. He seemed to have a rather big presence here, as many people followed him into the Tower, and amongst them, several had pretty high rankings on the Stone Tablet as well.</p>
 <p><em>What was wrong with them?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi blinked, unable to comprehend why these people were so eager to follow him everywhere he went.</p>
 <p>Passing the stages in the Alchemy Tower was really helpful for her, she felt that the previous time she had been practicing Alchemy, she managed to finally understand some problems that she had been struggling with for a while. She wanted to take this time to go home and practice Alchemy in peace.</p>
 <p>The news of Gu Lingzhi overtaking Feng An as the top-ranking alchemist in the Alchemy Tower for Yellow-Level Alchemists soon spread all over the school. It elicited many different reactions, from shock, amazement, anger to disbelief.</p>
 <p>People who did not believe that she had become the top-ranked alchemist went to take a look for themselves. When they saw it for themselves on the Stone Tablet, they had no choice but to believe that the rumors were true.</p>
 <p>“Damn it! What kind of luck does Gu Lingzhi have in order to become the top-ranking Yellow-Level Alchemist?! Could it be that the Alchemy Tower has spoiled because it’s too old?”</p>
 <p>Tianfeng Wei who was standing at the auditorium of the hostel, took many deep breaths to calm herself down. She was afraid that she would not be able to control herself and may just go up to Gu Lingzhi and attack her.</p>
 <p><em>Why? Why are all these girls always getting in the way of her and the Third Prince?</em></p>
 <p><em>The Third Prince had previously admitted himself that he had special feelings for the Black Thorn. Now, he is also expressing feelings towards Gu Lingzhi?</em></p>
 <p>Everyone always believed that the Third Prince stopped bothering Gu Lingzhi because he had lost feelings for her, but Tianfeng Wei, who had been his fiancée for so long, knew what the Third Prince was like. From the fact that the Third Prince had been willing to come teach at the Royal School, it was clear to her that he treated Gu Lingzhi differently from the others.</p>
 <p>Although she did not know what problems arose between them which caused the Third Prince to suddenly stop asking about Gu Lingzhi’s whereabouts, the Third Prince never stopped teaching for even a day. This was evident that Gu Lingzhi’s place in his heart had not changed.</p>
 <p>“No, I can’t let this go on. The more I wait, the more powerful she gets and the harder it will be for me to target her in the Royal School.”</p>
 <p>Tianfeng Wei immediately ordered Cai Wei to call for her spy to enter the Royal School. She then told her plan on how to get at Gu Lingzhi before the Third Prince could develop any more feelings for her.</p>
 <p>“Regarding this matter, you don’t actually have to execute the plan yourself.”</p>
 <p>Ding Rou, who was standing on the staircase leading to the second floor had watched how Tianfeng Wei’s anger unfold. She regarded Tianfeng Wei with a sly expression, her eyebrows raised. She had an allure that was different from other girls which had attracted many suitors in the Royal School. A pity she did not fancy anyone.</p>
 <p>“Doesn’t she have a sister? From what I know, her relationship with her sister isn’t that great,” Ding Rou commented before she turned and went back to her room. As for Tianfeng Wei, she knew how to read between the lines. She would not have to make decisions on her own and yet she would be able to get the outcome that she wanted.</p>
 <p>“Gu Lingzhi’s younger sister… Gu Linglong?” Tianfeng Wei exclaimed in surprise, her eyes shining with delight.</p>
 <p>As for Gu Lingzhi, she went back to her room and began practicing Alchemy the moment she returned from the Alchemy Tower.</p>
 <p>After passing the fifth stage, she finally realized that you could not rely solely on the books to practice Alchemy. Most of the time, you had to rely on intuition.</p>
 <p>At the last moment when she was combining the ingredients, if it was not for the fact that she had gained the inspiration at the last minute to convert the liquid medicine into a gaseous form, she might have failed once again.</p>
 <p>“It’s certainly not easy to come up with your own recipes for medicine,” Gu Lingzhi read her thoughts aloud, before taking out a bunch of ingredients out from her Storage Ring.</p>
 <p><em>What she was going to do now is to try and change the original recipes!</em></p>
 <p>At the stage she was at, it was still very difficult for her to come up with a recipe of her own. However, she knew how to change the recipe to raise the level of the medicine to make them more effective.</p>
 <p>“I guess it’s a good time to try changing the recipe of the Spirit Essence Bath since it is no longer as effective on me,” Gu Lingzhi muttered to herself.</p>
 <p>She picked out the ingredients needed to make a Spirit Essence Bath from her Storage Ring and examined them.</p>
 <p>She used to examine the ingredients to find out what was the best way for each of them to exert their fullest potential. Now, other than looking at their individual components, she also had to analyze the possibility of one ingredient combining with the others.</p>
