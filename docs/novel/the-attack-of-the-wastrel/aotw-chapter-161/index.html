<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Tao Qian was much more flexible than Rong Yuan had thought.</p>
 <p>She did not beg Rong Yuan to let her go just because she knew some information. All she asked was to change the punishment to forgoing one cultivation level and leaving the Royal School.</p>
 <p>As for Gu Linglong, she was determined not to admit to her mistakes and got thrown out of the capital city after being fed two pills of Fantasy Drugs and stripped of her clothes. From then on, Gu Linglong seemed to vanish from the surface of the earth.</p>
 <p>With regard to Gu Linglong, Gu Lingzhi was not at all interested to find out what happened to her. At this very moment, she was headed to the Tianfeng Family’s residence in the capital city.</p>
 <p>According to Tao Qian, the masked lady that gave Gu Linglong the drug was Mu Niansi. Mu Niansi had long ago declared loyalty to Tianfeng Wei and it was clear who she received orders from. In addition, Rong Yuan had sent his subordinates to investigate and received news that the masked woman that met up with Gu Linglong had a figure resembling Mu Niansi. With this information, Rong Yuan did not hesitate to command a few of his subordinates to follow him to the Tianfeng Family’s residence to demand an answer.</p>
 <p>At the Tianfeng Family’s residence, they were warmly invited in due to the presence of the Third Prince. The one that greeted them at the door was coincidentally the leader of the Tianfeng Family, Tianfeng Yi, Tianfeng Wei’s father.</p>
 <p>“Third Prince, may I know what brings you here today?” Although he spoke courteously, Tianfeng Yi was confused. Ever since the engagement between the Third Prince and his daughter was broken, the two families had never made any contact. <em>Could it be that the Third Prince had changed his mind and is hence, here to reinstate the engagement? That would be great news!</em></p>
 <p>Rong Yuan ignored the glimmer of hope in Tianfeng Yi’s eyes as he waved Tao Qian to step forward. He instructed her to repeat whatever happened today once more.</p>
 <p>In front of him, Tianfeng Yi’s face became blacker as he heard what Tao Qian had to say. Rong Yuan took a sip of spiritual tea as he said calmly, “With regard to today’s matter, Lady Tianfeng has gone overboard. However, considering our previous relationship, I am able to overlook this matter.”</p>
 <p>Tianfeng Yi was expecting the worst before he heard this and was stunned. His spirits lifted slightly before he heard what Rong Yuan had to say next, “However… I do not want to see anything similar to this happening again. To prevent Lady Tianfeng from possibly causing any harm to Lingzhi in the future, I feel that… we should find something for her to do so as to occupy her time?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was frowning as she heard the first line but her frown smoothen out as she continued to hear what the Third Prince had to say.</p>
 <p>“I wonder… what you have in mind for Lady Tianfeng?” He knew that there was no room for discussion the minute Rong Yuan said that. Tianfeng Yi was calm as he asked Rong Yuan what he intended. However, in his mind, he had already berated this useless daughter of his once over. <em>As if it was not enough that she had failed to capture Rong Yuan’s heart. Even after getting rejected, she did not know her limits and offended him by attempting to harm Gu Lingzhi with some lousy scheme. What was the point of him hiring so many teachers to teach her?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>At this very moment, Tianfeng Wei was still unaware that her plan had failed and was feeling satisfied as she waited for good news to arrive.</p>
 <p>She had already thought of several stories and scenarios to spread. The minute there was any news on Gu Lingzhi, she would spread the rumours and completely and utterly ruined her reputation.</p>
 <p>The only thing the capital city did not lack was gossipers. The minute the rumours were loose, the blow would be too much for her to bear. Even if Gu Lingzhi had the courage to continue living, she would never be able to rise from the shame, much less continue to be with the Third Prince.</p>
 <p>She was only able to gloat for a short while before she was interrupted by a figure rushing to report to her.</p>
 <p>“Tianfeng Wei, are you the one that instructed people to set Gu Lingzhi up?” Lang Jingchen immediately questioned the minute he entered Tianfeng Wei’s quarters.</p>
 <p>“What? What happened to Gu Lingzhi?” Tianfeng Wei asked, pretending not to know anything.</p>
 <p>Seeing her expression, Lang Jingchen immediately guessed the truth and started to reprimand her, “Ridiculous! How many times have I told you to clean up the loose ends every time you do something? The Third Prince has now brought people to our house and will be coming to find you any minute now. You should quickly think of an excuse for yourself!”</p>
 <p>“How is this possible?” Tianfeng Wei was in disbelief, “I instructed Mu Niansi to hide her face. How can the Third Prince know it was me?”</p>
 <p>“It doesn’t matter how he knows. Now, the most important thing is to figure out how to clear your name.”</p>
 <p>Registering Lang Jingchen’s serious expression, Tianfeng Wei knew she was in serious trouble and started to panic, “I… I don’t know what to do! If I fervently deny being involved, the Third Prince can’t pin the blame on me right?”</p>
 <p>“What do you think?” Lang Jinchen had to control his anger.</p>
 <p>This woman in front of him was someone that he had a crush on since he was young. In order to match up to her, he had put in an immense amount of effort training. <em>Who knew that the Third Prince would suddenly appear and crush his hopes?</em> With a few simple words from Consort Rong, Tianfeng Wei belonged to the Third Prince.</p>
 <p>He would have stopped his wishful thinking if Tianfeng Wei had indeed married the Third Prince. But who knew that Gu Lingzhi would appear and make Tianfeng Wei, who was always on the edge, even more suspicious of everything. In order to appease her, Lang Jingchen had even ordered people to try to get rid of Gu Lingzhi. Unfortunately, Gu Lingzhi was able to survive and even made the Third Prince truly fall in love with her.</p>
 <p>He had thought that Tianfeng Wei would give up after having her heart crushed a few times, he never thought that she would attempt something so stupid. <em>Now that this has happened, what can he do to help her?</em></p>
 <p>“Where is Mu Niansi?” Forcing himself to calm down and think, Lang Jinchen suddenly thought of Mu Niansi.</p>
 <p>“She is in her room.” Tianfeng Wei replied absent-mindedly. Her entire mind was filled with how to get herself out of the situation.</p>
 <p>“Ask her to come over.” Seeing the confusion in Tianfeng Wei’s eyes, Lang Jinchen gave a sinister smile, “I heard that she has a younger brother currently studying in Qingshan School. I suppose that if we say Mu Niansi has never gotten along with Gu Lingzhi and hated her, it would be believable right? And it would then be natural to assume that she would do something to Gu Lingzhi?”</p>
 <p>Tianfeng Wei’s eyes lit up as she understood what he meant.</p>
 <p>Where Gu Lingzhi was, Tianfeng Yi stood anxiously as he waited for the Third Prince to say what he intended to do with Tianfeng Wei. What he heard next caused him to turn pale.</p>
 <p>“Since Lady Tianfeng likes to be busy, how about we let her have some kids to take care of? With her own children, she will then stop trying to meddle in other people’s business.”</p>
 <p>“What! Tianfeng Wei has yet to get married, how can she have children?”</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, Tianfeng Yi understood what he meant as he looked into the cold depths of the Third Prince’s eyes. This was how the Third Prince wanted to solve the problem with Tianfeng Wei once and for all.</p>
 <p>In order to have children, one would first have to get intimate. Once she gave her body to someone else, Tianfeng Wei would then no longer have the face to chase the Third Prince.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi and Yan Liang had no choice but to admire Rong Yuan for coming up with this. He could actually think of something so wicked.</p>
 <p>“Leader Tianfeng, this is not a suggestion, but an order. Within a year, if Tianfeng Wei is still not pregnant, do not blame me for not considering the relationship between my mother and your wife. It is a huge sin to plot against the Royal Family!”</p>
