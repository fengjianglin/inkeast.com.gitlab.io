 <p>Gu Lingzhi immediately felt guilty. Because of what happened with Rong Yuan yesterday, she had left early. She did not think that Su Nian would remember her competition number and come early.</p>
 <p>Before Gu Lingzhi could think of how to explain what happened yesterday, she saw Yan Liang heading towards her from behind Su Nian. Worry was etched all over his face.</p>
 <p>“Lingzhi, are you okay?” He was as straightforward as usual.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi intentionally distorted his meaning and replied, “I am okay, my left arm is almost fully recovered and will not hinder my performance today.”</p>
 <p>Yan Liang opened his mouth and proceeded to shut it. He guessed that Gu Lingzhi did not want others to see how much she was hurting. This made his hatred for Rong Yuan grow even more in his heart.</p>
 <p><em>Even if he could not cherish her, why did he provoke her?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Sitting with Ding Rou, Rong Yuan suddenly sneezed. He looked gloomily at Ding Rou who was eating her breakfast and thought silently: <em>Lingzhi must be thinking of me.</em></p>
 <p>On Gu Lingzhi’s side, she purposely diverted the conversation and did not talk about what happened the previous day. Everyone silently believed that Gu Lingzhi must not want to bring up upsetting news and stopped asking.</p>
 <p>The number that Gu Lingzhi had drawn was number 17, which placed her in the ninth group to compete. It was not long before it was time for her to compete.</p>
 <p>Before she went up, Tianfeng Jin cheered her on. Gu Lingzhi smiled and nodded her head and she flew up to the battle arena.</p>
 <p>“I’m Gu Lingzhi from the Royal School of the Xia Kingdom, I look forward to duelling with you.” As per normal, Gu Lingzhi reported her name before taking out her new Spiritual Sword – the Fengwu Sword.</p>
 <p>Although it had a beautiful sounding name, as usual, it was a weird-looking Earth-Level Spiritual Sword.</p>
 <p>The reason why it had this name was because the sword possessed all five Spiritual Roots. If Gu Lingzhi were to summon all its energy at once, the originally unimpressive-looking sword would suddenly emit five different-colored spiritual energies, looking absolutely stunning.</p>
 <p>“<em>Hmph</em>, I didn’t think you would still have the mood to compete. Why are you still here? Did you finally realise you cannot beat our Princess so you’ve decided to earn yourself some brownie points by winning duels?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi properly assessed her competitor and thought back to the crowd that was watching as she was stopped by the guards in front of the Dayin Kingdom’s dorm. It seemed like this person was there and he was called Liang Xiao.</p>
 <p>People were certainly destined to meet their enemies.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi quickly put on a mask and prevented him from reading her emotions.</p>
 <p>She was still contemplating on how to teach a lesson to those that were laughing at her that day. <em>To think that he showed up in front of her of his own accord. Was she lucky or was Liang Xiao unlucky?</em></p>
 <p><em>That’s right, she could use this person to show off her Fengwu Sword!</em></p>
 <p>Holding her sword in her right hand, she lightly caressed the surface of her Fengwu Sword using her left hand. Gu Lingzhi lifted her head and gave an angry yet indignant expression. Looking at her opponent, she said faintly, “Why can’t I compete? I’m not the shameless one that’s trying to steal someone else’s fiancé. Also… Rong Yuan has always belonged to me, so I’m not stealing anything.”</p>
 <p>“You talk too much. I suggest that after this match is over, you should make the first move and dissolve your engagement with the Third Prince. If not, you will just become a laughing stock when His Highness dumps you.”</p>
 <p>“Oh really? I hope when the time comes, you can still laugh.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi lost interest in continuing to banter and raised her sword, starting her attack.</p>
 <p>To be able to make it all the way to the finals, it was certain that he would be skilled.</p>
 <p>Her move that caused her opponent in the preliminary rounds to be caught off guard, did not have any effect here as Liang Xiao easily dodged her attack.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi had expected this and was not disappointed. Her hand twitched as her sword knocked away her opponent’s sword. She had managed to block his attack. Gu Lingzhi summoned a water wall in front of her, forming a barrier between her and Liang Xiao. Using the water wall to hide, she launched a few attacks against him.</p>
 <p>“<em>Tsk</em>, with this little ability, how did you even get into the final rounds? Did you… bribe your opponents?”</p>
 <p>As Liang Xiao blocked Gu Lingzhi’s attacks, he did not forget to taunt her. <em>If only he could trigger her so much that she would not be able to perform as well.</em></p>
 <p>“You’re narrow-minded,” Gu Lingzhi retorted as the water wall between the two of them fell apart, filling the air with mist.</p>
 <p>“Huh? What is this?”</p>
 <p>The audience let out a cry.</p>
 <p><em>No one had ever seen anyone turn a water wall into mist. Could Gu Lingzhi be using some kind of Spiritual Talisman? However, no one was allowed to use anything other than Spiritual Weapons during the competition. Did Gu Lingzhi lose her mind because of Liang Xiao?</em></p>
 <p>They looked at the judges of the competition and none of them made a move to stop Gu Lingzhi. This meant that Gu Lingzhi had not broken any rules. Then how did this mist form?</p>
 <p>Liang Xiao was similarly stupefied.</p>
 <p>He had thought that Gu Lingzhi formed the water wall to block his line of sight and never thought that that was not all. Under the thick mist, it was extremely difficult for Liang Xiao to see and he could only rely on his hearing to figure out where Gu Lingzhi was.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi had already predicted this. With a simple flick of her finger, ten water balls carrying Spiritual Energy flew towards Liang Xiao from different directions. She made use of the water flying through the air to disrupt Liang Xiao’s ability to hear. On her side, she changed her movement technique, using the Moon Stride movement technique to slowly get closer to Liang Xiao. Lifting her Fengwu Sword, she simply fired a bolt of Fire Spiritual Energy towards his right leg.</p>
 <p>“Ah…” Liang Xiao grunted as he quickly turned and took a stab in her direction.</p>
 <p><em>If he was injured, how could she not suffer as well?</em></p>
 <p>Alas, in the direction which he had received the blow from, he could hear Gu Lingzhi groan. Liang Xiao’s eyes lit up as he rushed without thinking twice towards the direction of her voice.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi’s left elbow had been injured by Liang Xiao’s sword and she seemed to be unable to perform due to the pain. She was actually being cornered by Liang Xiao. Biting her lip, she seemed to have weakened.</p>
 <p>“Tsk, I thought Gu Lingzhi was actually capable. I guess it was all talk. She transformed the water wall into mist but still got caught by Liang Xiao. Alas, she is only good at seducing men. This white mist must be something useful to flirt with,” the audience burst into laughter as they looked at Gu Lingzhi vulgarly.</p>
 <p>“Liang Xiao is also such a boring person. If it were up to me, I would just rape her in the white mist. After all, she’s trashy. For all you know, she has already lost her virginity.”</p>
 <p>He suddenly felt an icy feeling up the back of his neck as a cold voice murmured into his ear, “Say one more word and I will make sure you are no longer a man.”</p>
 <p>He suddenly felt a chill at the bottom part of his body as if something was pressing onto him.</p>
 <p>The man lowered his head only to see an eerie looking sword on top of his precious thing.</p>
 <p>“You…what are you trying to do?”</p>
 <p>“Nothing, I just want to remind you that misfortune starts from the mouth.” Xin Yi smiled faintly. Xin Yi has always been extremely good looking, but as he smiled, it made this guy forget what kind of situation he was in as his eyes lit up.</p>
 <p><em>Xin Yi was such a beauty. He didn’t care if it was a guy!</em></p>
 <p>“Do you want to die?” Xin Yi’s eyes hardened as he lifted his leg and kicked the guy’s lower body.</p>
 <p>The guy cried out as he rolled on the floor in pain. From how pale he looked, it was possible that he would not be able to use that thing of his for the rest of his life.</p>
 <p>On stage, after Gu Lingzhi continually dodged Liang Xiao’s attack, Liang Xiao seemed to start to lose interest in prolonging the fight. His stance changed as he slowed his attacks, allowing Gu Lingzhi some time to breathe.</p>
 <p>However, she did not lower her guard just because her opponent slowed down but instead became even more cautious.</p>
 <p>The fact that Liang Xiao made it to the final rounds was not just because of his sword. It was because of his ultimate move, ‘Ten Thousand Swords to One’.</p>
 <p>He had the golden Spiritual Root, causing his spiritual energy to have a thick and heavy feeling to them. When he slowed down, it meant that he was preparing for something huge.</p>
 <p>At last, after a few attacks, Liang Xiao’s eyes lit up as if victory was surely his and declared eerily, “How dare you steal someone from our Princess? Go to hell!”</p>
 <p>As his words died down, the space around Gu Lingzhi was suddenly filled with numerous swords. They were all pointing directly at her, forcing her to stay exactly where she was. She could do nothing but watch what Liang Xiao was doing.</p>
 <p>“Liang Xiao’s move is really terrifying. He can make so many swords appear in such a short time. If it were me, it would be hard to escape that,” a man sighed.</p>
 <p>Just as he stopped talking, his mouth suddenly fell open.</p>
 <p>“How…how is this possible?”</p>
 <p>As the swords surrounded Gu Lingzhi, forcing her to stay where she was, Liang Xiao was ready for his final step. He was going to make the swords pierce through her head and through her entire body. But alas, this was a competition and unless there was a special circumstance, they were not allowed to kill.</p>
 <p>Hence, where the swords should have entered through her skull, they were directed to just her right arm.</p>
 <p>If the swords were to pierce her, Gu Lingzhi’s right arm would be completely useless.</p>
 <p>Although no deaths were allowed, injuries could happen and there were instances where people became completely disabled. In every Inter-school Competition, there would always be a few unlucky ones that become permanently disabled. Gu Lingzhi would suffer the same fate!</p>
 <p>As Liang Xiao flew with his sword above Gu Lingzhi, he was already thinking of how he would be rewarded by the Princess when he crippled Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>Just as he was dreaming, he saw Gu Lingzhi suddenly raise her sword and aim it directly at his sword tip. A fleeting smile appeared on her lips, causing his heart to jump as he suddenly had an ominous feeling.</p>
 <p><em>She was trying to trick him!</em></p>
 <p>Liang Xiao immediately brushed the feeling aside. <em>So, what if she raised her sword? At the position she is in, she wanted to fight against him? She was really delusional.</em></p>
 <p>The next scene would have been extremely long to describe but could be summarized into two major events.</p>
 <p>In order to prove that the feeling he had was wrong, Liang Xiao increased the speed he was falling and charged towards Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>Everyone that was watching was imagining the next scene where Gu Lingzhi would be covered in blood, her right arm severed.</p>
 <p>However, something unbelievable happened.</p>
 <p>The minute Liang Xiao’s sword touched her, it did not sever her arm as expected. On the other hand, his sword was the one that was split in half and his falling body landed right into Gu Lingzhi’s arms.</p>
 <p>“Rip----”</p>
 <p>The sound of flesh being torn apart filled the air. In the next second, Liang Xiao lost consciousness.</p>
