 <p>In fact, it was not just him. Most of the people were already on the brink of collapsing. It had been such a long journey, and they were mentally stretched taut. After encountering several small-scale attacks by the beasts, one after another, their hearts were in despair. The Crescent Moon City collapsed upon the first blow even with the protection of city walls. Now, they were completely exposed to the beasts, so how long could they last?</p>
 <p>"These beasts are controlled by a creature. If we can find that creature and attack it, these beasts would leave." Rong Yuan found Guan Yue and told him about his guess. Guan Yue was stunned for a moment and said, "A creature?”</p>
 <p>"You can regard it as a creature with the strength of a Demigod that can dominate a whole group of beasts. "</p>
 <p>Guan Yue took a breath, no wonder the Crescent Moon City had collapsed so quickly. <em>He was well aware of how powerful Rong Yuan was as a Demigod. However, if that creature also had the strength of a Demigod, coupled with an endless army of beasts, it could definitely do whatever it wanted to. In fact, this creature had already taken action.</em></p>
 <p>Guan Yue sternly said, "If it’s a Demigod, there should be a way to defeat it. If there’s anything you need me to do, please feel free to speak up.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan also did not use formalities and replied, "Find some clever people and ask them to pay attention to a strange worm. If it is found, don't act alone. Immediately notify me."</p>
 <p><em>The creature was actually a worm?</em></p>
 <p>Guan Yue frowned and passed down the order. Glancing at Rong Yuan who was walking towards Gu Lingzhi after talking, he knew that now was not the time to seek for answers.</p>
 <p>"What were you and the Chancellor talking about?" As soon as Rong Yuan approached, Gu Lingzhi asked. She wondered what kind of talk could make Guan Yue look even more perplexed in this situation.</p>
 <p>"I told him that these beasts were likely to be controlled by a creature, and ordered him to get people to pay attention to where it was." Rong Yuan replied with a lowered voice. There were a few flying beasts that were approaching.</p>
 <p>"What? A creature?" Gu Ling was startled, raising her voice uncontrollably. Realising that she had lost her self-control, she immediately closed her mouth, looking at Rong Yuan, her eyes filled with shock.</p>
 <p><em>Even with one creature, they were already getting beaten black and blue. With more of them, it was hard to say what the outcome would be.</em></p>
 <p>"You should just stay by my side. If it is able to control so many beasts at the same time, this creature has got to be at a peak level of a Martial Sage." Rong Yuan continued, "This creature is not like any other beasts. Like a Bat Beast, it has the ability to directly attack people mentally.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi narrowed her eyes and thought about why this setup seemed so familiar. <em>Not long ago, she had encountered a wave of mind attacks that far exceeded the strength of a Bat Beast. Was the Mother Worm the one responsible for this?</em></p>
 <p>While thinking of it, Gu Lingzhi was fighting within the group of beasts, while relaying the story of the previous attack by the bat beasts. Rong Yuan immediately confirmed it, it was that one attack mixed within the other attacks from the group of Bat Beasts that was initiated by the creature. <em>When he was fighting with that creature in the Spirit City, he was often attacked in the same way. However, he was trained and thus could fend it off. Being attacked without preparation, it must have hurt Gu Lingzhi. She even had to urgently hide in the Inheritance Space.</em></p>
 <p>Rong Yuan, while being extremely busy, pulled her hand as his heart ached, and stroked Gu Lingzhi's face in comfort. Gu Lingzhi's face turned dark and flicked his hand away.</p>
 <p><em>Shouldn’t the focus be on the beast’s motive to suddenly attack Gu Lingzhi?</em></p>
 <p>"I think I might be able to try and make the beast attack voluntarily again." <em>As long as the beast attacked, Rong Yuan would be able to find its location.</em> Rong Yuan shook his head firmly, "No!"</p>
 <p>"Why?" Gu Lingzhi was puzzled.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan looked stern. "It will hurt you."</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi reacted by rolling her eyes, and then recalled the scene when the beast had attacked, while she was using her Phoenix Sword within the group of beasts, shoving and pushing.</p>
 <p>Compared to the beast earlier that had the powers of a peak level Martial Sage, Gu Lingzhi could deal with this group of beasts that had an average power equivalent to a Silver Warrior easily.</p>
 <p>Then, Gu Lingzhi unleashed her realm to fight against the beasts. All the beasts that were in her realm did not take long to become a corpse, piling above each other. Every step she took, would result in a small splash of blood. Rong Yuan looked and laughed. He tried to find whether there was any trace of the powerful Insect Beast. Fighting to find the creature before Gu Lingzhi aroused the Insect Beast’s intention to kill, could prevent Gu Lingzhi from having to encounter it again.</p>
 <p>The areas surrounding Gu Lingzhi was like a graveyard for Insect Beasts. However, in areas that did not have any expert Warriors or Martial Artists, it was a graveyard for human beings instead. There had been countless people who had collapsed from the beasts’ attacks. Obviously, based on their power, they were a lot stronger than the beasts, but because the beasts outnumbered them, they were at a disadvantage. In addition, there were some who were too frightened to know how to react. Quickly, the people from the Forgotten City seemed to be at the losing end.</p>
 <p><em>She had already killed so many beasts, so why hadn't the creature targeted her? Had she not killed enough?</em> Watching the number of deaths increase, Gu Lingzhi was secretly anxious.</p>
 <p>However, the Insect Beast’s small body was too inconspicuous among the group of beasts. If it did not reveal itself, it would be very hard to find where it is.</p>
 <p><em>Hiss-</em></p>
 <p>Just when Gu Lingzhi was considering whether to kill the beasts in a more eye-catching way, a familiar pain crept upon her brain. This attack was much stronger than the one previously, when it was hidden in the group of bat beasts. It seems like this creature really wanted to take her life.</p>
 <p><em>There it is!</em></p>
 <p>At the same time, Rong Yuan also locked the position of the creature from the trace of the mental attack. He dashed towards the creature that resembled a cow and a horse.</p>
 <p>On the top of a beast's head was a milky white worm that was the length of a palm, two fingers thick, with a translucent body. Its appearance made it hard to imagine that the culprit responsible for this situation was actually a bug that seemed like it had no power.</p>
 <p>Seeing Rong Yuan rushing at a high speed towards the beast it was perched on, the Insect Beast tilted its head slightly and made a somewhat cute action, before slowly opening its mouth. It radiated formless ripples towards Rong Yuan, passing through the scalp, becoming an attack that could claim a life. Rong Yuan went into a moment of trance. Taking advantage of this situation, the Insect Beast wriggled its body, quickly jumping off the beast’s head, towards another beast with hair so thick that it could bury itself in. When Rong Yuan managed to resist the wave of mental attack, he only looked up to see the bare head of the beast together with a group of unnamed beasts.</p>
 <p>"Do you think I can't find you like this?" Rong Yuan sneered. He pointed his sword, summoning a string of flames that enveloped all the nearby beasts. Then, the flames became fire dragons, lapped across every beast’s body.</p>
 <p>The creature that was hiding under the thick hair was unlucky this time. As the hair of the beast was burned, its soft body was also scorched by the fire, and it painfully curled its body into a circle. The creature finally stopped trying to hide and decided to come face-to-face with Rong Yuan in the next second. A giant worm that was about two-meters long and as thick as a water bucket appeared in the field.</p>
 <p>Without waiting for Rong Yuan to strike, the creature took the chance to launch a mental attack and hissed silently towards the sky.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan was already prepared for a long time, and would not suffer a second loss. Using the spiritual energy to build several lines of defence around his brain, he raised his sword and directly thrusted it.</p>
 <p>Seeing that its mental attack did not work, the creature panicked and let out another hiss.</p>
 <p>With its cries, the beasts who were attacking other people around it, immediately gave up on the opponents in front of them and rushed towards Rong Yuan. One by one, they tried to block Rong Yuan's movements.</p>
 <p>Watching this scene, everyone else understood what was going on. Rong Yuan must have found a good way to deal with the beasts! Guan Yue’s first response was to quickly help Rong Yuan deal with the beasts that were heading for Rong Yuan. However, it was still too late.</p>
 <p>If it was one or two, it would not matter. However, all of a sudden, being faced with so many beasts, Rong Yuan had no time to care. In the midst of the chaos, he only had time to slash the creature once before he was drowned in the group of beasts.</p>
 <p>Having taken a strike, the creature fell to the ground, rolling in pain. The fire spirit energy attached to Rong Yuan's sword gave it an infinite amount of pain.</p>
 <p>This seemed long, but in fact it took only ten seconds since the attack on Gu Lingzhi till the stab by Rong Yuan. When Gu Lingzhi recovered from the severe pain of the creature’s mental attack, she saw a group of beasts retreating backwards. The creature was already long gone, hidden on another beast’s body.</p>
 <p>"Have you succeeded?" Gu Lingzhi asked Rong Yuan who emerged from the group of beasts.</p>
 <p>"No," Rong Yuan said, scowling. That annoying Insect Beast even knew how to let other beasts cover for itself. If it weren't for the suicidal attacks of those few beasts, he could definitely take down that Female Worm. However, they can only watch them run away in front of their eyes.</p>
 <p>"It’s alright that you didn’t kill it. At least now the group of beasts have retreated. This gives us some time to breathe." Guan Yue who was equally not convinced smiled bitterly. He could only use this to comfort himself.</p>
 <p>She did not know of the situation when they were fighting, and when it stopped, Gu Lingzhi discovered that the situation of people of the Forgotten City was worse than she had expected it to be. At a glance, countless human bodies lay on the ground. Some of the bodies had been bitten by the beasts, dilapidated. The whole ground was dyed black and brown by the blood of humans and beasts. Thinking of picking out the human corpses from the pile to give them a proper burial was not possible. Gu Lingzhi hesitated for a moment and then took out the Corpse Disintegrating Liquid and sprayed it.</p>
 <p>Guan Yue watched, his lips moving but said nothing. With so many corpses, if they were not handled quickly, diseases could spread easily. It was undoubtedly the right choice to destroy all the corpses.</p>
 <p>The process of melting the corpses was heavy. The officials of the Forgotten City took this time to count the number of people. When the last of the number of people who had survived was reported to Guan Yue, even if he was mentally prepared, it still felt terrible.</p>
