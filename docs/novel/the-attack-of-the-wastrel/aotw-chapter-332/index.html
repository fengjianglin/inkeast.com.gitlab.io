 <p>No one had imagined that the situation would turn suddenly. Under such men who saved him.</p>
 <p>“Junior Mao, you……” Lord Fashen swallowed in a breath and felt at a loss for words. He exerted so much effort to save Mao Dingling only for his student’s life to be in danger. Pan Yue was right. The outside world was too dangerous, he should have closed himself in cultivation in the deep mountains and forest.</p>
 <p>“Mao Dingling! What are you doing?” Rong Huachang scolded, her attention diverted. The attack that was released from her hand came out a second late and she almost got hit by the enemy’s attack.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan also turned around at the commotion, disbelief and confusion filling their eyes. They had not cared whether Mao Dingling would live or die previously after he committed such heinous acts. <em>Was he really a Demigod of the Alliance? So what if he was? Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan couldn’t care less about that after all that Mao Dingling had done.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>However, in just a few days, Mao Dingling once again targeted a sword towards his side!</p>
 <p>“Don’t blame me for not being grateful.” Mao Dingling bit his lip, “I don’t want to do this either. However, they force fed me pills and if I do not do as they say, I would not live any longer. After so many years of cultivation, I cannot die just like that.”</p>
 <p>As soon as he finished, Pan Yue, held tightly within Mao Dingling’s grasp, choked. “So you take advantage of others instead?”</p>
 <p>After consuming the pill that he originally intended to give Mao Dingling and with the revelation of the betrayal, Pan Yue wanted to stab himself in the stomach. The grey-colored pill was a medication that Gu Lingzhi had made during her spare time. It tortured the person who consumed it and pain shot through Pan Yue’s body. He grimaced in excruciation and he regretted asking Gu Lingzhi for the pill. The person that he wanted to torture was safe but he was not.</p>
 <p>Mao Dingling grabbed Pan Yue’s throat, hate shooting through his eyes.</p>
 <p>“If Senior Fashen does not stop, your disciple will die.” Lord Fashen had only slowed down his battle against the other Demigods and the North Qiu army was still at a disadvantage. Mao Dingling tightened his grip around Pan Yue’s neck and warned coldly, “Senior Fashen, if you do not stop now, I cannot guarantee what I will do with him.”</p>
 <p>Lord Fashen’s expression darkened and he stole a glance at Pan Yue’s painful expression. He slowly retracted himself and retrieved his attacking stance.</p>
 <p>“No…Master…” Pan Yue choked through pain. The drug he had consumed was at its full effects and the pain in his body made it hard for him to breathe. As expected of a drug made by Gu Lingzhi, it was effective indeed.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, you can’t even save yourself and you are caring for others?” Mao DIngling softened his grip slightly and as he took in Pan Yue’s pain, he felt a strange sense of satisfaction overwhelming his heart.</p>
 <p><em>So what if he betrayed his kingdom? He was only doing as he was told.</em></p>
 <p>“How dare you, Mao Dingling!” Fashen caught Mao Dingling’s actions and immediately screamed, “If you still consider yourself a member of the Alliance, let Pan Yue go and I will turn a blind eye to the events today. You know that the Sacred Weapon is with us and it is only a matter of time before the Empire falls. I can find an antidote for you…”</p>
 <p>“Forget it.” Mao Dingling cut Lord Fashen off. He coldly glared at Lord Fashen and glowered “Senior, do you think that obtaining the Sacred Weapon grants you the entire world? The roots of North Qiu Kingdom extends far beyond that…” A spark of greed crossed Mao Dingling’s eyes as he revealed this. He was power hungry.</p>
 <p>He had never imagined that the Royal Family of the North Qiu Kingdom could communicate with the Deity King in the Realm of the Gods.</p>
 <p>After he found out how the North Qiu Kingdom managed to grow so strong in the continent, Mao Dingling was blinded by greed. He understood more about the Grandmaster from the Demigods that held him captive and realized that the Deity King would give the Pan Family more Sacred Weapons. Mao Dingling did not have to think twice before he switched sides.</p>
 <p>The Alliance only seemed to be gaining the advantage on the surface after stealing the Sacred Weapon. However, what was a Sacred Weapon compared to a Deity King overlooking the Pan Family?</p>
 <p>Hence when he knew that the North Qiu Kingdom’s Royal Family intended to use him as hostage to threaten Lord Fashen, he showed his resilience and determination, successfully convincing the North Qiu Kingdom that he would join them.</p>
 <p>Lord Fashen did not dare to make any rash actions as he was concerned about Pan Yue’s safety. He nervously stood rooted to his spot as he retracted all his attacks against the North Qiu Demigods.</p>
 <p>Pan Yue was his only student whom he treated like his own son. Otherwise, Lord Fashen would not have relieved Pan Yue off the surface limitation of the slave seal on him. This was also the reason why Pan Yue could go against the will of the Deity King time and time again despite bearing the slave seal.</p>
 <p>“Master…don’t bother about me.” Seeing the hesitation in Lord Fashen’s eyes, Pan Yue struggled to speak. Mao Dingling mercilessly slapped him once again and Pan Yue felt as though his neck was about to be crushed. By then, his face had turned purple and he seemed to be at death’s door.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was standing on pins and needles as well and she did not know what she could do to help as the Demigod that she and Rong Yuan were fighting did not show any signs of exhaustion. They felt helpless and powerless knowing that they were being controlled by Mao Dingling’s threats to them.</p>
 <p>The Demigod retreated backward continuously, drawing Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan to chase after him. Gradually, they pulled distance between themselves and the initial battleground. By the time, he realized it, it was too late and the couple could no longer see Lord Fashen and the rest.</p>
 <p>“Shit, we fell for their trick!” Rong Yuan cursed and his expression darkened.</p>
 <p>“Hehe, it is too late even if you realized it now!” The Demigod who lured the pair away from their group snickered to himself.</p>
 <p>“It is not too late.” Glaring coldly at the Demigod, Gu Lingzhi said, “If we kill you, we can return to them.”</p>
 <p>The Demigod instantly frowned, his beady eyes stared at Gu Lingzhi like a prey eyeing its snake. He glowered, “I am afraid that you guys do not have the chance.”</p>
 <p>He thought that Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan could not overpower and kill him.</p>
 <p>From the battle, he understood the difference between talented and ordinary people. The couple before him were considered outstanding talents who surpassed their ranks. Even if the difference between a Demigod and a Martial Sage was large, it could be bridged by talents.</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, fierce winds blew around him, signalling the onset of a tornado. Thunder boomed through the sky and a dozen attacks zipped through the sky towards him. Multiple Martial Sages had suddenly appeared!</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi cursed and immediately opened the Inheritance Space as she tried to pull Rong Yuan in it. However, Rong Yuan had no intentions of escaping through the Inheritance Space. As the energy wrapped around him, he violently rejected it and stopped himself from being pulled into it.</p>
 <p>“I will not let you face danger alone again!” Previously, Rong Yuan had no way to leave the Inheritance Space. However, he was not in the Inheritance Space then, how could he openly watch Gu Lingzhi being surrounded by enemies while he hid in safety?</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was surprised by Rong Yuan but she broke into a sweet smile, “Then we will face them together.”</p>
 <p>At the very most, she could pull Rong Yuan into the Inheritance Space at a dangerous moment. After all, she controlled the Inheritance Space and she could enter it any time she wanted.</p>
 <p>However, her optimism was not justified as the Inheritance Space did not grant her invincibility. Although no one in the continent could break through her Inheritance Space, there were ways from other realms that could block her from assessing the Inheritance Space by her free will.</p>
 <p>The enemies that surrounded them had come prepared and there were even more men who chased after Fashen. It was obvious what the people were targeting as they sealed off the exit path of the two. Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan did not lament their current plight but with great teamwork, they exchanged a look before they dashed in another direction, away from Lord Fashen.</p>
 <p>They had not chosen a breakthrough way that involved defeating the least number of people. That direction was to the Alliance territory and anyone would know that the North Qiu army would not allow them to do such a predictable move. Who knew what other dangers and ambushes awaited them? As such, the direction where there was the second least number of guards was where Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan mutually agreed to break through.</p>
 <p>Without need for verbal communication, the two unleashed their ultimate strikes towards the Demigod to force him to retreat. One of them was in charge of opening the way for them while the other focused on deflecting incoming attacks as they made their escape.</p>
 <p>The North Qiu army had not expected that the two would choose that route and they were stunned for a moment before they smirked to themselves.</p>
 <p>They were overly confident, thinking they could break through an ambush set up by so many people.</p>
 <p><em>Boom!</em> Fire spiritual energy gathered in the sky and exploded with a bang. Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan were surrounded by flames.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi’s eyes flashed and she released her legendary space-dimension realm.</p>
 <p>The instant the realm was released, the flames were sucked into it like a black hole. Before their attacker could breathe, a terrifying suction force pulled and crushed him.</p>
 <p>“You are not going anywhere!” The North Qiu army shouted and one of them released his own realm. It was a boundless desert.</p>
 <p>Once that realm was released, many others surrounding the couple released their own realm They were all realms that were compatible with the initial fire domain. These realms that were released all at once surrounded the couple and left them with nowhere else to run.</p>
 <p>With Gu Lingzhi under pressure from the realms unleashed by his opponents, Rong Yuan released his realm and relieved the pressure of her. Before Gu Lingzhi could heave a sigh of relief, a crushing force filled the domains.</p>
 <p>The Demigod had caught up to them!</p>
 <p>With a few dozen Martial Sages surrounding them and a Demigod on their tail, the two were in a precarious situation.</p>
