 <p>Wei Hanzi stood beside Gu Lingzhi. After pondering for a while, she subtly held her hand in front of her and sent out a message.</p>
 <p>Everyone was calmly waiting for Xin Yi to respond. Xin Yi tilted his head to the side as he smiled and looked at the guard, “What if I don’t?”</p>
 <p>Mei Yingxiong laughed sinisterly, “No? Then prepare to lose your life!”</p>
 <p>“What a pity, I don’t intend to lose my life over someone as insignificant as him,” Xin Yi shrugged.</p>
 <p>“Teacher, why are you still wasting your effort talking to him? Just chop off his hands already. The people of the First School won’t dare to do anything to you,” the man’s teeth were chattering as he looked at Xin Yi, his face filled with fury. Xin Yi has caused him to lose his chance for happiness and now he wanted to ruin Xin Yi!</p>
 <p>As he said this, the faces of everyone that was not from the North Qiu Kingdom, changed. The meaning behind this was… very frightening.</p>
 <p>The guard’s face darkened as he heard this too. Although what the man said was true, but the fact that he said this in front of everyone…was he trying to ruin the First School’s reputation?</p>
 <p>Similarly, Mei Yingxiong was protecting this useless disciple of his. To think that the disciple had so easily been dismembered and was completely useless in protecting himself. Now, he even said such inappropriate words. Even if he wanted to help him and find someone to secretly get rid of Xin Yi, it would be extremely suspicious.</p>
 <p>Alas, Xin Yi looked towards the guard mockingly, “So this is what you people call maintaining security of the arena and ensuring that participants are safe, when really, it’s just favoritism. Also, you did not even bother to ask me what had happened before demanding me to chop off my own hands. Don’t you think this is too negligent of you?”</p>
 <p>The lead guard spoke softly, “Senior Mei’s disciple was dismembered by you and the proof is right there. Isn’t that enough?”</p>
 <p>“Of course not. If someone were to insult and demean your Royal Family and even look at you vulgarly, would you allow yourself to be treated like that and have no reaction?”</p>
 <p>This caused a commotion as everyone started to look at Ling Yizhe with disdain, a complete change from the looks of sympathy they had given him earlier. He even lusted over a man. Dismembering him was considered a relatively light punishment already.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi looked at Ling Yizhe irately as she wished she could also disable another leg of him. Although Xin Yi did not state explicitly, but everyone knew that the only Royal family that Ling Yizhe would be insulting now was Gu Lingzhi and no one else.</p>
 <p>“This…” The lead guard was rendered speechless as he silently cursed at what an idiot Ling Yizhe was. He then pretended to interrogate him, “Is what he is saying true? Did you really… look at him frivolously?”</p>
 <p>The lead guard’s face turned slightly red as he said this. No matter how beautiful Xin Yi looked, he was ultimately still a man and if Ling Yizhe did not even care about this and still lusted over him, it is no wonder that Xin Yi cut off his manhood.</p>
 <p>“I did not!” Ling Yizhe held his neck as he lied without blinking. Under this kind of situation, how could he admit to it?</p>
 <p>“He is defaming me to get out of this!”</p>
 <p>The lead guard silently led out a sigh of relief, at least Ling Yizhe was not dumb enough to admit. “As you can see, Senior Mei’s disciple did not do what you said, you…”</p>
 <p>“Aren’t you missing the point? If he only looked at me vulgarly, I would not have cut off his manhood. I did it because he insulted the Xia Kingdom’s Royal Family!” Xin Yi cut off the nonsensical blabber that the guard was trying to say and accused him coldly.</p>
 <p>Bearing the obscure looks that his teacher and the guard was throwing him, Ling Yizhe rushed to deny, “You are lying, I did not insult the Xia Kingdom’s Royal Family.”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Although Yizhe is playful, he knows his boundaries, he…”</p>
 <p>“Although we are in the North Qiu Kingdom, you cannot look down on our Royal Family. Maybe I will have to make a trip to the Royal Palace and ask your Emperor to be the judge of this,” Rong Yuan’s voice interrupted. Seeing him appear, everyone from the Royal School breathed a sigh of relief as they leaned towards Rong Yuan for support.</p>
 <p>It was always good to have someone to rely on. If only they could get rid of Ding Rou behind him.</p>
 <p>Mei Yingxiong was mildly startled as he saw Rong Yuan. He thought of what had happened earlier. Other than Xin Yi and Ling Yizhe who knew exactly what happened, no one else had seen the entire scene. Even if this matter was brought up to the king, there would be no evidence and since his disciple was the one that was injured, Xin Yi would definitely not have an advantage. He then said darkly, “The Third Prince of the Xia Kingdom is certainly petty by trying to bring our Emperor into this. But even so, my disciple will not be wrongly accused. I want to see just who our Emperor will believe!”</p>
 <p>It sounds like this matter was going to be brought up to the North Qiu Kingdom’s Emperor.</p>
 <p>No one had thought that such a simple matter would be escalated. Even Xin Yi, who had caused the situation, did not think this would happen and frowned.</p>
 <p>“Wait- wait a minute. I saw what happened and can be the witness,” Just as the group was about to head to the Royal Palace, a timid voice spoke out.</p>
 <p>Everyone looked towards the direction of the voice and saw a sweet-looking girl standing timidly.</p>
 <p>“You should think through this carefully. Did you really see what had happened?” Mei Yingxiong’s heart suddenly skipped. He did not think that there would be a witness and lowered his voice as he threatened slightly.</p>
 <p>“Er… I- I…” The girl was startled by the threat in his eyes and could not help but take a step back. Her eyes filled up with tears.</p>
 <p>Standing not far behind her, another beautiful lady immediately jumped out in front of the girl and stated angrily, “Mei Yingxiong, don’t cross the line! Although our Fengyuan Kingdom is small, we will not be bullied by you!”</p>
 <p>The Fengyuan Kingdom was about as powerful as the Xia Kingdom. This lady was the teacher-in-charge of the students that were participating in the competition from the Fengli School. The Fengli School was the national school built by the Fengyuan Kingdom’s Royal Family. She could not stand back and see the student that she was proud of being bullied.</p>
 <p>Behind the protection of this lady, the shy girl then recounted what she had seen.</p>
 <p>She was one of the students representing Fengli School in the competition this time but was unfortunately eliminated before the final rounds. Today, she came with the intention to learn and never thought that she would witness what she had seen. Initially, she was too afraid to stand out but seeing how they wanted to bring this up to the North Qiu Kingdom’s Royal Family, she decided to speak out.</p>
 <p>“…This- this was what happened. This man was speaking vulgarly and insulted the girl that was competing on stage. I was angered by what he said so I turned around. That was when I saw him look frivolously at this other student here.”</p>
 <p>The truth was out. With the recount by this girl who had no affiliation to either side, it was enough for everyone to believe what had happened.</p>
 <p>Mei Yingxiong’s face darkened as he glared at his disciple, “You’re embarrassing, how dare you speak so foully!”</p>
 <p>After he scolded his disciple, he then turned to Rong Yuan, “Although it is my disciple’s fault and he should not have insulted your fiancée, but this man here is too harsh. What he caused my disciple to lose is directly related to a man’s happiness. How are you going to answer to this?”</p>
 <p>Slyly, Mei Yingxiong changed the focus, intentionally overlooking his disciple’s mistake and emphasizing that Xin Yi was the problem. However, he was not as confident as before.</p>
 <p>After all, it was a fact that Ling Yizhe was at fault and if the matter was brought up to the Emperor, he might even be punished. He was trying to find the upper hand and resolving this matter now.</p>
 <p>It was not long until the end of the Inter-school Competition and he was not worried about being unable to find a time to take revenge for his disciple.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan lifted his eyebrows as he reached and took out a Storage Ring filled with spirit stones, not saying another word. He then threw it at Ling Yizhe, “There are one hundred thousand spirit stones as well as one Earthly Spirit Gem. It is enough to compensate you.”</p>
 <p>Behind him, Yuan Zheng turned his head away as he silently cursed.</p>
 <p>Right in the beginning, his master had used this Earthly Spirit Gem as a wager and made a bet with him in the Gu Clan. In the end, he had lost this Green Spiritual Gem that he had spent effort obtaining. Now, he used this Earthly Spirit Gem as a bait against Ling Yizhe. This gemstone was certainly being used well.</p>
 <p>Alas, as Mei Yingxiong heard the three words Earthly Spirit Gem, his eyes shone. He had been trying to find an Earthly Spirit Gem to upgrade his weapon for a while now. He never would have thought of obtaining one in this manner. He could not be bothered about his grief-stricken disciple and went ahead to take the Storage Ring. He then quickly brought his disciple and left.</p>
 <p>Once Mei Yingxiong left, Ding Rou shouted, “Liang Xiao, what happened to your arm?”</p>
 <p>She then walked quickly to Liang Xiao who was being carried by a few others.</p>
 <p>“Princess, you must help me…” Liang Xiao pleaded sorrowfully as he pointed at Gu Lingzhi, “This evil woman chopped off my right arm. I am afraid I can no longer serve you anymore, Princess!”</p>
 <p>Ding Rou then looked at Gu Lingzhi in shock, “Did you just say that Lingzhi cut off your arm? Could you be mistaken? Lingzhi does not seem like such a cruel person.”</p>
 <p>“I am very sure, Princess! Everyone saw it. If you don’t believe, you can ask the prince, he was watching the entire time.”</p>
 <p>Ding Wei then spoke up angrily, “That’s right, Liang Xiao’s arm was cut off by Gu Lingzhi. Rong Yuan, shouldn’t you give us an explanation?”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan’s eyelid twitched slightly as he glanced at Gu Lingzhi and said coldly, “What happened? Did you really cut off his arm?”</p>
 <p><em>Not bad, there was an improvement. This time, he did not immediately blame everything on her.</em> Gu Lingzhi bit down on her lip as she put on a regretful and scared face as she explained, “I didn't mean to. It was just that he was targeting me and I don’t know what’s wrong with his Spiritual Weapon but it failed to cut off my arm so it went for his own instead.”</p>
 <p><em>What did she mean by “but it failed to cut off my arm so it went for his own instead”? Was she mocking Liang Xiao for failing?</em></p>
 <p>As Gu Lingzhi said this in an innocent and pitiful voice, it made Liang Xiao so angry he fainted once again.</p>
