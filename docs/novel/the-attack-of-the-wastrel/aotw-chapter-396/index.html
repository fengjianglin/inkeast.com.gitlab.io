 <p>“The worm is too cunning, if we were to approach it directly, it would surely avoid us, why don’t we…”</p>
 <p>Before Gu Lingzhi could finish her statement, she was interrupted by a terrifying cry, “Insect Beast! It’s the Giant Insect Beast! Why did they appear again?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi flew up into the air to take a look. Her pupils shrank upon seeing several giant Insect Beasts approaching in the distance. If she had remembered correctly, Rong Yuan and her did not see any additional Giant Insect Beasts when they flew over the entire herd of beasts earlier. Where did these few Giant Insect Beasts come from?</p>
 <p>But now was not the time to comprehend this for they had to find the worm first. Looking at the Giant Insect Beasts getting closer and closer, Gu Lingzhi revealed a sly smile. These few Giant Insect Beasts had given them a good reason to leave.</p>
 <p>Thinking of this, Gu Lingzhi did not pester Guan Yue further and directly signalled Rong Yuan and Bian Cheng before the three of them jumped from the “city wall” and headed in three directions to kill the Giant Insect Beasts.</p>
 <p>There were a total of four Giant Insect Beasts this time. Gu Lingzhi settled one of them and hurried to the remaining ones. Rong Yuan and Bian Cheng did not return to the city after killing the Insect Beasts. Instead, they stepped on their bodies and launched an attack on the surrounding fierce Beasts. Gu Lingzhi also did not return upon killing the last one. She learnt the ways of Rong Yuan and Bian Cheng and stood on the body of the Insect Beast to attack the surrounding fierce beasts.</p>
 <p>This method successfully angered the beasts and caused some of them to give up on attacking the “city wall” but charged towards the three of them instead. As the fierce beasts grew in numbers, Gu Lingzhi had to come down from the Giant Insect Beast’s shell and attack them from the sky. It was the same for Rong Yuan and Bian Cheng. The three of them were unable to ward off the overwhelming numbers and they unconsciously penetrated into the middle of the herd.</p>
 <p>“This is bad, they are trapped in the middle of the herd. I’m going to save them!” Jiang Xinghai said. He was stopped by Lu Yuan before he could move an inch.</p>
 <p>“What are you going to do there? If Seventh Brother and Eighth Sister are unable to handle it, you will definitely die if you go over.”</p>
 <p><em>His words were merciless.</em></p>
 <p>Xing Mei’er covered her mouth and laughed lightly, “That’s right, Sixth Brother. You’re a little over worried. Seventh Brother and Eighth Sister just took a spin in the middle of the herd of Beasts, did you see them getting injured?”</p>
 <p>Jiang Xinghai rebutted, “But they were flying over the beasts just now. This time they are facing them directly.”</p>
 <p>“So?” Xing Mei’er squinted her eyes, “They were able to fly earlier, are they unable to do so now?”</p>
 <p>Jiang Xinghai opened and closed his mouth before smacking his forehead. Just as what Xing Mei’er had said, he was overly worried. He knew just how strong Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan were. Ordinary beasts could never hurt them and even if they were in trouble, they could always hide in the Inheritance Space. There was no need for him to be worried.</p>
 <p>He blamed the situation earlier for being too dangerous such that he forgot for a moment that these two people’s safety were the least of his concerns in the entire Lost Lands. Since this was the case, why were Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan looking so anxious and frightened when fighting off the fierce beasts?</p>
 <p>Unless…</p>
 <p>Jiang Xinghai thought of a reason and his eyes lit up. He stared fixedly towards the direction at which Rong Yuan was “engulfed” by the beasts.</p>
 <p>The “Rong Yuan” that was engulfed by the beasts was not looking as good as they thought he would be. In actual fact, it was Bian Cheng that had disguised himself as Rong Yuan. It seemed that the beasts knew that Rong Yuan was the strongest person here. After besieging him, they began to launch attacks one after another suicidally. As his cultivation was of a Martial Sage, Bian Cheng could not hold on for long. He could only pray in his heart that Rong Yuan, who had used the Yirong Pill to disguise himself as Bian Cheng, could find the Female Worm quickly.</p>
 <p>Besides, the real Rong Yuan had deliberately brought the beasts, who were chasing after him, to sway left and right upon being submerged by them. This angered quite a few of the beasts.</p>
 <p>Damn, where was the Female Worm hiding? Rong Yuan thought as he dragged a long line of beasts across the entire herd while trying to identify the familiar aura of the Female Worm. With every second delayed, several people were being sacrificed at the base camp.</p>
 <p>After beating and throwing aside the beast in front of him, Rong Yuan continued to evade the beasts that were following him like a tail. Suddenly, the aura belonging to the Female Worm floated faintly from a nearby distance.</p>
 <p><em>It was finally found!</em> Rong Yuan’s eyes twinkled and continued to perform with utmost professionalism. He pretended to be flustered while staggering from side to side into the direction at which the Female Worm was sensed.</p>
 <p>The Female Worm was lying on the back of a normal-sized Insect Beast twisting its fat body. There was a faint scar on the tail of its shiny body. This was left behind when it was attacked by Rong Yuan two days ago. Normally, it would have taken only one or two days for the wound to heal. However, it took ten days this time to completely heal the wound. Upon having the wound healed yesterday, it could no longer wait further and ordered the beasts to attack the base camp once again.</p>
 <p>This was also the reason as to why the beasts had not appeared and harassed the people for quite a while.</p>
 <p>Upon noticing that the human being chased by the beast was heading towards its direction, the offspring moved slightly but did not hurry away immediately like how it would in the past when it saw Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>It was only afraid of Rong Yuan, but “Rong Yuan” was being isolated on the other side of the herd, so it had no reason to be afraid.</p>
 <p>Still disguised as Bian Cheng, Rong Yuan’s eyes lit up further as the worm had no sign of retreating even though it had sensed his approach. His sharp vision enabled him to spot the worm that was lying on the shell of the Insect Beast.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan, who had already failed once, would not give the offspring another chance to escape. When he was only a few feet away from the offspring, he released his realm suddenly.</p>
 <p>In an instant, the space around him was divided into countless small spaces. Using the spiritual power from space-dimension techniques, Rong Yuan appeared in the small space whereby the worm was located. Before the worm could react, Rong Yuan flipped his palm and a palm-sized box appeared. <em>Boom</em>! It trapped the Female Worm that was still in a daze. Rong Yuan then covered the lid quickly.</p>
 <p>Just as Rong Yuan placed the Female Worm into the box, everyone who was fighting the beasts could feel a change in them. The most instinctual ones was the herd of Beasts that were rushing towards the base camp. They were charging towards the people but had suddenly stopped in their tracks. Countless beasts had also stood rooted to the ground and were seemingly looking for something anxiously. <em>The Female Worm who had been leading them in their consciousness had suddenly disappeared.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>The people who had sensed the anomaly did not want to miss this opportunity. Regardless of the reason as to why the beasts had suddenly stopped, they seized the chance to kill more of them.</p>
 <p>“You’ve succeeded?” Gu Lingzhi, who had discovered that there was something wrong with the herd, flew over to Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Rong Yuan smiled and handed over the black box containing the Female Worm to Gu Lingzhi. Gu Lingzhi swiftly transferred the box into the Inheritance Space.</p>
 <p>This black box was made by Gu Lingzhi by melting the mask that helped disguise her as the Black Thorn. It was a pity that she had never chance upon such material again after accidentally obtaining a piece of it.</p>
 <p>“Without the control of the Female Worm, the herd of beasts are no longer as coordinated. Let us return.”</p>
 <p>Rong yuan pulled Gu Lingzhi back to the base camp after he had finished speaking. Bian Cheng had been ordered by Gu Lingzhi and had already returned to the base camp as well. There was nothing special to note upon seeing the two returned while holding hands. On the other hand, Guan Yue, Lu Heng and a few others were speechless when they saw Gu Lingzhi and “Bian Cheng” returning hand in hand. Astonishment, shock, sympathy and anger flashed in their eyes which eventually turned into a complex expression.</p>
 <p>“What happened to you all?” Gu Lingzhi questioned. She felt that they were looking strangely at “Bian Cheng” and her.</p>
 <p>“Eighth Sister, quickly apologise to Seventh Brother!” Jiang Xinghai stared at “Bian Cheng” fiercely and took a few steps towards Gu Lingzhi before speaking in a low voice.</p>
 <p>“Apologise?” Gu Lingzhi was puzzled, “Did I do something wrong?”</p>
 <p>Jiang Xinghai heard and looked at her in disbelief, as if she had just said something incomprehensible. He pointed at her and nagged several times before stomping his feet, “Shouldn’t you be afraid that Rong Yuan would misunderstand you flirting openly with other men?”</p>
 <p>Jiang Xinghai’s words were implicit but saved Gu Lingzhi’s face simultaneously.</p>
 <p>As for Gu Lingzhi’s current actions with “Bian Cheng”, they were more than pulling and flirting around. They were practically cuddling and holding each other. Half of her arms were habitually held closely by “Bian Cheng”. Those who had seen this scene casted a sympathetic look at “Rong Yuan” and were standing alone at one side. His rigid and expressionless look was the definition of one who had just been betrayed by their lover.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing Jiang Xinghai’s allegations, “Bian Cheng” blinked and simply rested his chin on Gu Lingzhi’s shoulders. He blinked innocently and asked, “Why would I misunderstand?”</p>
 <p>“What else would it be? You both are simply…” Before he finished, Jiang Xinghai suddenly coughed a few times and looked at “Bian Cheng” inexplicably.</p>
 <p>“You, you’re Rong Yuan?”</p>
 <p>“If not?” “Bian Cheng” rolled his eyes.</p>
 <p>Apart from him, who else would be able to stand beside Gu Lingzhi in this world? To be precise, apart from him, which other man would Gu Lingzhi let so close to her?</p>
 <p>Apparently, they did not think twice about Rong Yuan’s temperament. There was no way he could be so calm upon seeing Gu Lingzhi with another man. It was not his style to be feeling dejected silently. Gu Lingzhi was also not the kind of woman to flirt with other men. He was the only man that could get close to her.</p>
 <p>Even though Rong Yuan did not say anything affectionate, Jiang Xinghai still felt that he was displaying his affection. He embarrassingly made way for Gu Lingzhi and “Bian Cheng” before jumping off the “city wall” to kill the herd of beasts.</p>
 <p>Without their main pillar, the beasts were much easier to deal with than before. Soon after, the beasts that managed to break into the “city walls” were all massacred. Having no one to control the beasts outside the city wall, their interest in attacking the base camp was lost. Instead, they grew an appetite for the beasts around them that were weaker than themselves. After waiting for a while and hearing no further commands from the Female Worm, the beasts could no longer control themselves and threw themselves at the prey they had been eyeing.</p>
