 <p>Zhu Yonghao was definitely someone worthy of the Emblem of the Brave. Whether it was his control of his spiritual energy or his Martial Skills, they were all better than the average Martial Artist.</p>
 <p>Using her sword wrapped with fire spiritual energy, Gu Lingzhi feigned a few attacks, taking the chance to get close to him in order to engage in close combat.</p>
 <p>However, Zhu Yonghao could easily read her mind and as he waved his sword, he blocked Gu Lingzhi’s attack. He then pushed off the floor and shot backwards, widening the distance between him and Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>He had watched Gu Lingzhi’s battles before and knew that she was quick and nimble. Naturally, he would not want to fight in close combat with her.</p>
 <p>Using his pike, he hacked, poked, picked and stabbed, forcing Gu Lingzhi to remain at a distance.</p>
 <p>“From what I see, the Black Thorn is sure to lose this battle! After all, it hasn’t been long since she advanced into this stage, it is inevitable that she loses to Zhu Yonghao,” someone in the audience stated his opinion with a hint of pity in his voice.</p>
 <p>The Black Thorn had only appeared about a year ago and already moved from a Level Five Martial Student to a Peak Level Martial Practitioner. Her crazy speed of advancement and unique techniques had long been the talk of the town.</p>
 <p>Naturally, seeing how Gu Lingzhi might lose had caused some of them to feel regretful.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. Although Zhu Yonghao is not from the Royal School, he is amongst the top of the Martial Practitioners. How could Gu Lingzhi who had just broken through, be his match?” another person said sourly.</p>
 <p>Talents would always have fans as well as haters.</p>
 <p>“<em>Ah!</em> Who hit me?” The sour man shouted in surprise as a hand imprint appeared by his mouth. Looking around him, he could not identify anyone suspicious.</p>
 <p>Everyone around was startled, for someone to slap him amongst so many others and not be detected, that person had to at least be the rank of a Martial Lord.</p>
 <p>“If you don’t want your tongue to be removed, then you should shut your mouth.” A cold voice floated into the man’s ear, causing the guy to stop looking around and fear to be written on his face.</p>
 <p>A Secretive Voiceover was a technique that only Martial Lords could master. Knowing that someone was helping defend Gu Lingzhi, the guy immediately shut up, fearing for his life.</p>
 <p>Seeing the guy shut up and there was no one else around that was speaking bad about Gu Lingzhi, Rong Yuan nodded in satisfaction. He was starting to appreciate Yuan Zheng more, he knew what to do without even being instructed.</p>
 <p>Who knew that when the prince brought Pan Yue to view the battles at the Town of the Brave, they would chance upon Gu Lingzhi’s battle? They were really fated.</p>
 <p>Looking at Gu Lingzhi in the battle arena, Rong Yuan’s gaze was soft as he did not think that Gu Lingzhi would lose. <em>Although Zhu Yonghao was strong, his woman was even stronger!</em></p>
 <p>Beside him, Pan Yue was also looking at Gu Lingzhi. However, different from Rong Yuan’s soft gaze, Pan Yue was scrutinizing her. Concentrating fully, he analysed every action that Gu Lingzhi made as if he found out something about her.</p>
 <p>On Gu Lingzhi’s side, after her numerous attempts for close combat failed, a sly look crossed her eyes.</p>
 <p><em>Did he think that she would not be able to do anything from a distance?</em> She pointed the Qingfeng Sword in her hand towards the heavens as golden spiritual energy engulfed the sword. The bluish-black colour of the sword quickly changed into a stunning golden colour. To everyone’s surprise, tens of golden rays shot out from the sword as if a million golden needles were aimed at Zhu Yonghao.</p>
 <p><em>Clang, clang, clang…</em></p>
 <p>It was the sound of metal clashing.</p>
 <p>Zhu Yonghao looked slightly dishevelled as he held up his pike to block the attacks. However, numerous golden rays still managed to get through and stab at his body.</p>
 <p>With an anguish cry, Zhu Yonghao quickly retreated.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi’s eyes flashed as she quickly created a two-finger wide vine in his path.</p>
 <p>“God, since when was she able to create the Fantasy Vine?” exclaimed some of the audience as they recognised the vine she created.</p>
 <p>The Fantasy Vine was a high-grade Yellow-Level spiritual plant that had a narcotic effect. For anyone below the Martial Practitioner rank, they would momentarily lose the ability to move. Although there was not much of an effect on Peak Level Martial Practitioners, it would still cause them to move slower for a period of time. While this short period may not seem very useful to most, but to Gu Lingzhi who had the Earth-Level Moon Stride movement technique, this snippet of time was enough for her to get closer to Zhu Yonghao.</p>
 <p>The next moment was exactly like Gu Linngzhi had planned. As Zhu Yonghao used a pike, which was a long stick, his weakness was in close combat. Using her agility, she weaved around him causing him to be unable to use his pike. He was defeated within the next fifteen minutes.</p>
 <p>“Lady Black Thorn is undoubtedly the fastest person to obtain the Emblem of the Brave in a 100 years. Your abilities are extraordinary,” Zhu Yonghao sighed as he left the battle arena.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi smiled slightly and was about to jump off the battle arena when she suddenly had the instinct to look towards Rong Yuan. Catching his eye, he gave her a coquettish glance.</p>
 <p>“…” He was really audacious.</p>
 <p>Not intending to meet him, Gu Lingzhi walked directly to the resting area behind the battle arena and found somewhere to sit down.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan looked at Pan Yue and decided not to bother Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>He did not want to bring this lecher to Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>However, just because he did not want to bring Pan Yue over did not mean that Pan Yue could not be interested in her. Seeing Gu Lingzhi sit down at the resting area, Pan Yue asked Rong Yuan curiously, “I heard that you are pretty close to the Black Thorn and once chased after her. She must be a beauty right?”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan immediately raised his guard as he gave him a look silently, “That’s right, I did chase her for a period of time. A pity I regretted my actions after seeing her real face. Under the mask, she isn’t that pretty.”</p>
 <p><em>In his heart, Gu Lingzhi’s beauty was even greater than angels. How could he simply use the word pretty to describe her?</em></p>
 <p>“That is such a pity.” Without really understanding, Pan Yue let out a sigh, “I was thinking to myself that if she was pretty, you could take her as a concubine.”</p>
 <p>“Ha… ha, it really is a pity,” Rong Yuan said, not meaning it. Behind Pan Yue’s back, he gave him a murderous look that seemed like he wanted to tear Pan Yue to pieces.</p>
 <p>“There is nothing much to see here in the Martial Practitioner Arena. If you are interested, we could go to the higher level arenas to take a look?” He wanted to prevent the Fifth prince from getting any wild ideas and hitting on Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>“Okay, I heard that you managed to obtain the Gold Emblem after winning a thousand consecutive matches here in the Martial Lord Arena. I wonder if the Martial Lords here are as bold as the ones we have back in the North Qiu Kingdom? Haha…”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan’s eyelids twitched upon hearing this. He pretended not to hear the ridicule in his voice as he led the way, “We will just have to see if they are as good as the ones you have back at home, won’t we?”</p>
 <p>With a sympathetic look, Yuan Zheng looked at Pan Yue. <em>How did he dare to imply that obtaining the Gold Emblem was not impressive?</em> Once they got to the Martial Lord arena, he would know.</p>
 <p>The next day, Rong Yuan accompanied Pan Yue after class to roam around the capital. This time, he asked Gu Lingzhi to go along with him to watch the fights at the Town of the Brave.</p>
 <p>“Don’t you want to see how Martial Lords of the North Qiu Kingdom fight?” Rong Yuan’s gaze drifted over to the bodyguards behind Pan Yue.</p>
 <p>“Yesterday, after watching the battles by our kingdom, we decided on having a battle exchange and registered all his bodyguards to fight at the Town of the Brave. It is such a big event, it will be a pity if you missed it.”</p>
 <p><em>Was it just that simple?&nbsp;</em>Gu Lingzhi looked at him suspiciously, not believing that it was as simple as he said.<em>&nbsp;If it was just what he said, would he have such a mischievous look on his face?</em></p>
 <p>But looking at Pan Yue, who could not stop winking at her, Gu Lingzhi nodded her head without saying more.</p>
 <p><em>If someone wanted to put on a show for her, it would be impolite of her to reject them.</em></p>
 <p>Upon reaching the Town of the Brave, Rong Yuan brought them directly to the Martial Lord Arena. There were two battles ongoing at that time. Seeing Rong Yuan enter, the caretaker of the battle arena, Elder Qi smiled as his gaze landed on Gu Lingzhi. Stroking his beard, he grinned, “Not bad, not bad. Things are getting interesting.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi looked at Rong Yuan in bewilderment but was only met with his radiant smile as he shook his head. He indicated that the focus for today was on Pan Yue’s bodyguards and they did not want to steal the limelight.</p>
 <p>Alas, before they even stepped into the arena, Pan Yue’s arrogant voice sounded out, “Old man, is there anyone that wants to fight? There is no need to randomise the battles, just assign whoever that hasn't fought to my men.”</p>
 <p>“I can’t do that.” Elder Qi was not at all triggered by him but continued to maintain a good-natured smile, “There are rules in the Town of the Brave and I can’t break them. Since you all are here, you have to follow the rules.”</p>
 <p>“Heh, old man, we’re doing you a favor here by registering our names yesterday. If you don’t let us compete now, are you asking me to find people to come and tear your business down?”</p>
 <p>“No, but if Your Highness really wishes to destroy our business, you will have to first ask Lord Fashen.”</p>
 <p>Elder Qi’s simple sentence managed to cause Pan Yue to shut his arrogant mouth.</p>
 <p>Although the North Qiu Kingdom was a big country and had three Demigods, but anyone of status would know that even with the three of them, they might not even be able to take on Lord Fashen who was the one in-charge of both the Town of the Brave and the Mercenary Guild.</p>
 <p>It was rumoured that Lord Fashen had been alive for over three thousand years and was very close to becoming a True God. He was indisputably the strongest person in the entire Tianyuan Continent. You could offend anybody, but him.</p>
 <p>Hence, Pan Yue’s threat to tear down the Town of the Brave was as good as going against him.</p>
 <p>Evidently, Pan Yue had really overextended himself this time.</p>
 <p>Initially, when Rong Yuan said that Pan Yue’s attitude could possibly be him pretending to be dumb, Gu Lingzhi did not believe it. Now, she was inclined to agree with him.</p>
