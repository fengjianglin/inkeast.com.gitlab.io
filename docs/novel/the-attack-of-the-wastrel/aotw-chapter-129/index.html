<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>The truth was Lu Feng’s intuition was right. At this very moment, what Yan Liang felt was completely different from what he was showing.</p>
 <p>Ever since he witnessed Gu Lingzhi defeat Fan Xiang, every time he saw Gu Lingzhi, like now, he had an unexplainable feeling of his heart seeming to want to jump out of his chest.</p>
 <p>This was a feeling that he has never felt before but oddly, he did not dislike this feeling. As his eyes came across the fresh flowers by the side of the road, Yan Liang started to wonder. <em>Was it too boring to always send red and blue roses all the time? How about the wild flowers by the side of the road…</em></p>
 <p>On the battle stage, Gu Lingzhi was completely oblivious to the fact that her mysterious flower sender was walking further and further away. She was determined as she scrunched her lips and faced her opponent.</p>
 <p><em>Now!</em></p>
 <p>Utilising the opportunity when Cai Lan attacked, Gu Lingzhi’s vigor suddenly changed. A crazy amount of spiritual energy shot out of her body making it difficult for even her to control. She almost lost control of the fireball in her hands.</p>
 <p>“She has…broken through?” A disbelieving voice could be heard from the audience.</p>
 <p>“My god, hasn’t it been less than a year since she awakened her Spiritual Roots? She is already a Level Five Martial Student! Do you think that she could be more talented than the Third Prince?”</p>
 <p>The reason why Rong Yuan was labelled as the person most likely to become a True God was due to his extreme talent and the speed at which he trained and broke through each level. But even so, it took a year for him to become a Level Five Martial Student with his abilities. Gu Lingzhi was still faster than him, this…</p>
 <p>“I think I know why the Third Prince fell for her,” a young girl said despondently.</p>
 <p>The people that heard this displayed varying expressions. The only thing similar was maybe the fear in their heart. What if they were to know that Gu Lingzhi’s true cultivation level was not that of a Level Five Martial Student but a Level Six one?</p>
 <p>“You... you actually broke through!” Sensing the change in Gu Lingzhi’s spiritual energy, Cai Lan’s face darkened.</p>
 <p>When Gu Lingzhi had not broken through, she was already having some difficulty holding her back. <em>Now that Gu Lingzhi has become a Level Five Martial Student in the midst of their battle, would she still be able to win?</em></p>
 <p><em>No, maybe she would still have a chance!</em></p>
 <p>Cai Lan’s eyes suddenly lit up. When Martial Artists had just broken through, there would be a period where they were unable to control their sudden increase in spiritual energy and have a moment of weakness. From the unstable fluctuations of spiritual energy emitting from Gu Lingzhi, it showed her weakness. As long as she found the right opportunity, she might actually win!</p>
 <p>Thinking till here, Cai Lan’s attacks quickened as she emitted spiritual energy in all directions, not caring where they ended up. Each attack consisted of five or six thumb-sized fireballs being shot at Gu Lingzhi. A few mud mounts appeared at Gu Lingzhi’s feet simultaneously, affecting her movement.</p>
 <p><em>Dual Spiritual Roots of fire and earth.&nbsp;</em>Gu Lingzhi laughed to herself internally.<em>&nbsp;Even if she had three spiritual roots, it would not make a difference. She was bound to lose!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>In the next second, Cai Lan who was filled with confidence, realised that all her attacks were lost mid-air. Even the mud mounts hardly restricted Gu Lingzhi’s movements.</p>
 <p>Following a loud bang, Cai Lan’s body flew off the battle stage and fell onto the ground causing dust to fly up around her.</p>
 <p><em>How could it be?&nbsp;</em>Cai Lan looked at Gu Lingzhi indignantly. <em>She clearly was not yet in control of her spiritual energy, how could she have defeated her in one blow?</em></p>
 <p>Before she could figure out what happened, her head tilted to the side as she fainted.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi did not hold back when she gave that last kick. Although she had yet to figure out why she found Cai Lan familiar, it did not prevent her from sensing the malicious intentions that Cai Lan had towards her. Since she was an enemy, there was no need to have mercy. That one kick was sufficient to put her in bed for the next seven to eight days.</p>
 <p>“Sorry, I’ve just broken through and haven’t gotten used to controlling my spiritual energy. I momentarily lost control. I will send her to the infirmary now.” Seeing Cai Lan faint, Gu Lingzhi pretended to be guilty as she apologised. She then carried Cai Lan and headed towards the infirmary.</p>
 <p>The infirmary was similar to the last time when she was here. In it lay a few students who were scattered around, having gotten injured either from fighting or accomplishing missions.</p>
 <p>“How did she injure herself? Place her on the bed over there. I will call the teacher in-charge right away.” A nurse on duty instructed as she saw Gu Lingzhi enter with Cai Lan, guiding her to an empty room.</p>
 <p>Having brought Cai Lan to the infirmary, it can be said that Gu Lingzhi did her part. She placed Cai Lan down on the bed slightly roughly as she turned to leave.</p>
 <p>Before she could reach the door, she bumped into Wen Liao who was the teacher in charge that day.</p>
 <p>“Don’t you want to know how she is doing?”</p>
 <p>“No.” <em>She was the one that caused the injury, what was there to see?</em></p>
 <p>Wen Liao shrugged, knowing that he had slightly crossed the line when he made fun of her the previous time. It caused Gu Lingzhi to always give him a bad look whenever they bumped into each other.</p>
 <p>Seeing how Gu Lingzhi started to leave once again, Wen Liao massaged the dark circles under his eyes as he yawned, leaning against the door, “Have you found the person that set you up last semester? It has been a while since school started, I am sure you would have bumped into her?”</p>
 <p>“No.” Gu Lingzhi was slightly impatient as she replied. She had thought that she memorised the silhouette of the person that set her up and would be able to recognise them at first glance. However, it has been so long and she had yet to find out anything. This has resulted in her memory of the figure fading. Any longer and she believed that even if the person stood in front of her, she would not be able to recognise her.</p>
 <p><em>That’s right, that figure…</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi abruptly turned to the bed as she looked past Wen Liao to the figure lying on the bed unconscious.</p>
 <p><em>It was no wonder that she felt that Cai Lan’s figure was familiar but could not recall where she had seen it. No wonder when Cai Lan first saw her, she looked as if she had wanted to hide. It was because she was guilty…</em></p>
 <p>“Found you.” Looking at Cai Lan, the corners of Gu Lingzhi’s mouth twisted up into a smile. A bone-chilling smile.</p>
 <p>“Why? Don’t tell me that she was the one that caused you to be injured the last time.” Observing the sudden change in Gu Lingzhi’s expression, Wen Liao twisted his mouth. However, the gaze that he gave Cai Lan was not much better than the one Gu Lingzhi was giving.</p>
 <p><em>If she dared to sabotage other students in the Royal School, then she should have the courage to face the consequences of her actions!</em></p>
 <p>“I hope that you will allow me to deal with her myself.” Knowing that Wen Liao was thinking of using the school’s authority to punish Cai Lan, Gu Lingzhi immediately made her request.</p>
 <p>Revenge was only satisfying when she could carry it out herself.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Gu Lingzhi was not someone to be trifled with, Wen Liao waved his hand as he reminded her, “Be careful when you do anything. If you are caught, I won’t be able to protect you.”</p>
 <p>He left immediately after saying this. <em>As for Cai Lan’s injury - she was about to face death, what was the difference whether she was healed or not?</em></p>
