 <p>“Rong Yuan?” Gu Lingzhi called in confusion.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan’s attitude was not very friendly and there was an obvious look of disdain in his eyes. His tone even carried a hint of pity. Could it be…</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi immediately straightened out her expression as she looked at Rong Yuan seriously.</p>
 <p>“Are you unhappy with the way I am doing things?”</p>
 <p>“It’s not that I am unhappy, it’s just that…” Rong Yuan frowned as he thought about what words to use. He then sighed, “After all, Xiao Yu is a lady and should…”</p>
 <p>“So, you are blaming me?” Without waiting for Rong Yuan to complete his sentence, Gu Lingzhi snorted. She then turned to leave without giving Rong Yuan a chance to explain, “Good! I am an evil woman; I won’t interrupt the both of you!”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan immediately rushed to chase after her, “Lingzhi, don’t be angry, I’m just sparing a thought for your reputation? If the word spreads that you are neglecting Xiao Yu it won’t be good too, right? Give me a chance to explain…”</p>
 <p>“Go away, I don’t want to hear it! You can go talk to Xiao Yu!”</p>
 <p>The sound of their argument became distant. In the living room, as she saw her ideal couple quarrel, Chun Tao was stunned. After a while, she gave a shriek, “The Little Chancellor actually quarreled with Demigod Rong!” She had to quickly go tell the Chancellor this, in case Little Governor was bullied by Demigod Rong.</p>
 <p>Chun Tao took two steps out before stopping as she thought of something. Turning around abruptly she pointed to Le Yao, “You have to leave! We don’t welcome you here!”</p>
 <p>Looking at Xiao Yu who was sobbing, she could not bring herself to chase her away.</p>
 <p>It was weird. Chun Tao was always firm towards anyone who tried to hit on her master. However, when it came to Xiao Yu, her heart always melted. Even when something like just now happened where Gu Lingzhi suspected Rong Yuan to be attracted to Xiao Yu, Chun Tao still could not bring herself to say anything mean. She pointed at Xiao Yu for a long time before forcing out the words, “You- you should go back and rest. If you have nothing to do, you shouldn’t appear in front of the Little Governor and Demigod Rong for a few days.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yu lifted her head and looked at her sadly, her almond shaped eyes filled with tears, “Why? I just wanted to do something for them. Can’t I do that?”</p>
 <p>“It is not that you can’t, it is just that…sigh, just listen to me and stay in for a few days.”</p>
 <p>On the other side, as Gu Lingzhi stormed out, Rong Yuan chased after her trying his very best to persuade her. Everyone that saw them turned to look in surprise, wondering if their eyes were playing tricks on them. <em>Since when did they quarrel with each other? This was really strange.</em></p>
 <p>Unknowingly, the two of them had reached the Chancellor’s Manor. As the guards saw Gu Lingzhi, they immediately made way for her. The two of them then entered the Chancellor’s Manor without a hitch.</p>
 <p>Lin Chongyuan was currently in a meeting with several officials from the Spirit City. They were discussing matters regarding how to deal with the beasts. Seeing Gu Lingzhi enter with a solemn look and how Rong Yuan seemed to lean over and make himself smaller, he knew that the two of them had quarreled and did not really bother about them. When he was done discussing official matters and everyone left to do their duty, he then asked the two of them what happened.</p>
 <p>With reddened eyes, Gu Lingzhi stubbornly insisted that there was nothing wrong. On the other hand, Rong Yuan was slightly troubled as he told him what had happened. This caused Lin Chongyuan to shake his head and laugh. Sighing, he lamented about how good it was to be young, no matter how big or small a matter was, they could quarrel about it.</p>
 <p>Perhaps Gu Lingzhi’s sulkiness that day gave Rong Yuan a warning, but in the following days, no matter how coldly Gu Lingzhi treated Xiao Yu, Rong Yuan did not dare to stand up for Xiao Yu. This caused Xiao Yu to become all the more pitiful.</p>
 <p>Under such an atmosphere, the beasts that had retreated, regrouped and came back even stronger. They surrounded the entire Spirit City.</p>
 <p>“How are you still not able to find the Female Worm? Aren’t you a peak Demigod? Why can’t you do something as simple as this?” Gu Lingzhi rubbed her throbbing temples and complained.</p>
 <p>This was the third day that the beasts had surrounded the city. Having to defend the city, everyone was starting to feel exhausted. Gu Lingzhi thought of how easy it was to deal with the beasts in the past and could not help but complain to Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>“Why are you so useless? You can’t even manage an insect. You are making everyone in the city anxious, can’t you think of a way?”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan explained helplessly, “The Female Worm is hiding itself from me and I have no choice, I can’t…”</p>
 <p>“…Stop finding excuses for your shortcomings!” Gu Lingzhi interrupted him impatiently. She then realised how bad her tone was. However, she could not bring herself to apologize. Pursing her lips, she threw down a sentence, “I am going to Grandfather’s side to take a look.” She then turned and left.</p>
 <p>“Lingzhi…sigh.” Rong Yuan kept his hand that was about to reach out to her and sat back on the chair dejectedly. He stared blankly at the teacup in front of him.</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, a soft hand grabbed the teacup and poured fragrant hot tea into the cup. In a soft voice, Xiao Yu said, “Brother Rong, have a sip.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan instinctively took a sip to quench his thirst before realizing who had poured him the cup of tea. Anxiously he glanced at the main door to see if there was anyone and said blankly, “Xiao Yu, you should return to your room.”</p>
 <p>He never thought that Xiao Yu, who usually did not have any opinions would suddenly reject him, “I won’t!”</p>
 <p>“Why?” Rong Yuan was unhappy, “Are you not even going to listen to my orders?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yu quickly replied, “I will do whatever you want me to. It’s just that…” Xiao Yu hesitated as she looked sadly at Rong Yuan and continued, “It is just that I can’t bear to see you look so dejected. The attack of the beasts is not one person’s duty, even if you can’t find the Female Worm, it isn’t your fault. I feel really bad for you!”</p>
 <p>“What is so sad about it?” Rong Yuan breathed deeply, “As the strongest person in the Lost Lands, I have to take on a bigger responsibility than those around me. Whatever Lingzhi said is right, I am useless. If I were stronger, I wouldn't…”</p>
 <p>“Shh…this isn’t your fault.” Xiao Yu reached out and placed a finger on Rong Yuan’s lips, “I said before that defending the city against the beasts is not one person’s duty. How can we push all the blame on you? Brother Rong, you haven’t slept for three days to ensure that the Spirit City is safe. It wasn’t easy for the beast horde to retreat, you shouldn’t think of unhappy things and should get some rest.”</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yu…” Rong Yuan sighed and removed Xiao Yu’s finger from his lips, “If only Lingzhi was as thoughtful as you.”</p>
 <p>Seeing her finger being grabbed by Rong Yuan made her laugh embarrassedly, “The Little Chancellor did not choose her words carefully because she was anxious. That is why she might have said words that hurt you, Xiao Yu believes that she did not mean it…”</p>
 <p>“Tsk, you’re the most understanding person.” Outside the door, Gu Lingzhi’s ears perked up as she eavesdropped on them.</p>
 <p>Shaking her head, she criticized, “Why have I never realised how good Pan Wen was at acting before? The helpless look on his face makes even me feel heartbroken.”</p>
 <p>“You can’t feel heartbroken!” Gu Lingzhi’s eyes were immediately covered by a large hand as Rong Yuan’s voice spoke over her, “You can only feel heartbroken because of me.”</p>
 <p>The corners of Gu Lingzhi’s mouth twitched as she removed Rong Yuan’s hand from her eyes, she then said monotonously, “Stop playing around.”</p>
 <p>“I won’t stop.” Rong Yuan said as he placed his hands over Gu Lingzhi’s eyes once again.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi rolled her eyes and her long lashes brushed across Rong Yuan’s palm. It tickled. Seeing the red lips so close to him, Rong Yuan could not help but lower his head and lightly kiss her.</p>
 <p>The conversation in the room was still continuing. The “Rong Yuan” that Xiao Yu was talking to was actually Pan Wen, who was still in the midst of hearing beautifully phrased words. Naturally, something romantic would happen. Having had a taste of Gu Lingzhi’s gentle lips, the real Rong Yuan had no interest in watching any further as he bent over and carried Gu Lingzhi in his arms. He then rushed to the master bedroom.</p>
 <p>In the following days, Gu Lingzhi and ‘Rong Yuan’ continued to have a cold war.</p>
 <p>‘Rong Yuan’ was not someone who would lower himself to apologize. Him giving in to Gu Lingzhi was his way of adoring her. However, Gu Lingzhi’s actions this time were too hurtful as she did not even put herself in his position and considered what he might be feeling. Especially with Xiao Yu around, who excelled in comforting people, it made Gu Lingzhi seem even more nonsensical. After his attempts at reconciling failed a few times, ‘Rong Yuan’ had given up and the two of them simply existed beside each other. It made Chun Tao who was observing them, panic. She could not help but inform Lin Chongyuan of this matter.</p>
 <p>As anyone would imagine, Lin Chongyuan who doted on his granddaughter, was extremely furious and immediately brought Chu Jiang to barge into their house. He lectured and warned ‘Rong Yuan’ to treat his granddaughter better and not to let Gu Lingzhi get hurt. If not, he would disregard his own life and make ‘Rong Yuan’ pay for his actions. ‘Rong Yuan’s’ expression fluctuated as he spoke. When Lin Chongyuan left, he flipped a table in frustration. His eyes were red as he bellowed, “I am not the one at fault. Why should I be the one who apologizes?”</p>
 <p>“Brother Rong…” Xiao Yu covered her mouth as tears welled up in her eyes, “You should go apologise to the Little Chancellor, a couple should not hold a grudge for too long. The Little Chancellor must also want to reconcile with you that is why she asked the Chancellor to come and persuade you. You should apologise to her.”</p>
 <p>“Why should I be the one apologizing?” ‘Rong Yuan’ gritted his teeth, “She is the one making things difficult.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yu choked over her emotions, “You can’t become enemies with the entire Spirit City. The Chancellor will not let you go.”</p>
 <p>“This woman is really impressive. This is the true way to kill a person without drawing blood. She can insult someone without even saying a single bad thing about the person. Why did I ever think she was innocent and gullible? She is obviously a poisonous snake. If she eats someone, she won’t even spit out their bones. Even after she kills you, you will feel grateful.” Chu Jiang gasped as he heard the voice from the room.</p>
