 <p>Gu Lingzhi no longer knew what happened afterwards. The stoneman took them away from the stone pillars and ran wildly.</p>
 <p>Pan Luming wanted to send more Demigods to intercept but was delayed by Lord Fashen who shouted at the both of them, “Go!”</p>
 <p>The strong Demigods sent by the North Qiu Kingdom were all deployed by Pan Luming to surround them. No one has expected that they would be able to break free. Thus, there were only two Demigods chasing after Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan in which Lord Fashen had missed.</p>
 <p>The stoneman did not feel any pain due to its thick skin so it did not pay attention to the two’s attack. It only cared about the two people it was holding and escaping.</p>
 <p>While fleeing, Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan did not remain idle. They kept releasing spiritual power to attack in hopes of hurting the two behind them. The stoneman could only last for a quarter of an hour. When the stoneman disappeared, they could only rely on themselves.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, a quarter of an hour had passed. Just when the two thought that the stoneman was about to disappear, the strength holding them both suddenly tightened. The stoneman raised its two arms and threw the both of them as far away as possible as if it was throwing sandbags. It then turned around and hugged fiercely onto one of the two chasing it before slamming into the other who was still caught in a surprise.</p>
 <p><em>Boom</em><em>–</em></p>
 <p>The sound of the explosion was deafening. At the very last moment, the stoneman had actually exploded while carrying the both of them!</p>
 <p>Before they could be taken by surprise, a familiar figure appeared in the sight of the two. It was Rong Huashang who had acted separately from Lord Fashen.</p>
 <p>It turned out that when Lord Fashen had seen the two in crisis, he had considered that Pan Luming might trap them by all means. He had deliberately left Rong Huashang outside to support in which she could now replace the stoneman in protecting them.</p>
 <p>However, Rong Huashang was not in a good condition herself either. When the stoneman holding onto Pan Yue had disappeared, she could only act as a temporary nanny. She carried Pan Yue who was a head taller than herself while being surrounded by a group of Martial Artists. It was an awkward and funny sight.</p>
 <p>“The troops are increasing in numbers, let’s go.” Seeing the unfavourable situation, Rong Yuan coughed weakly and said, “Without us here, Lord Fashen can then better exhibit his cultivation.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi and Rong Huashang were thinking about the same thing and they looked anxiously at the place where Lord Fashen was. They then carried Rong Yuan and Pan Yue each before making a breakthrough.</p>
 <p>Without the obstructions of the Demigods, the four quickly broke through and moved towards the direction with fewer people. In order to alleviate the weight on Gu Lingzhi and Rong Huachang, Gu Lingzhi kept trying to bring the two “patients”, Rong Yuan and Pan Yue, into the Inheritance Space after running for a distance. Just when they had run about ten miles, the space that had been stagnant had finally opened again, letting the both of them in. Gu Lingzhi and Rong Huashang then continued to fight while fleeing.</p>
 <p>After fleeing for three hours, they had finally shaken away the people that were chasing behind. Gu Lingzhi and Rong Huashang both slumped like mud onto the ground and panted heavily.</p>
 <p>When their breaths became smoother, Rong Huashang then tilted her head and asked Gu Lingzhi, “Don’t you have the Inheritance Space? Why do you have to run like this instead of hiding inside?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi laughed bitterly and explained how the North Qiu Kingdom had already known about the Inheritance Space’s shortcomings and the method of restraint. Rong Huashang sighed and said, “The space can no longer be utilised so easily.”</p>
 <p>God knows what would be waiting for them outside after the troops had seen the location in which they had entered the space.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, the golden flag could only function from the outside. It did not prevent Gu Lingzhi from moving things out of the space, otherwise, she could only watch as Rong Yuan was struck dead by Pan Luming.</p>
 <p>After resting for a while, Gu Lingzhi handed Rong Huashang a Yirong Pill and told her how to use it. Gu Lingzhi then took one herself and changed into a young man of about thirty years old. Rong Huashang was marveled at the effect of the Yirong Pill. She swallowed one and became a little girl who was around fifteen years old with big watery eyes, lovely and cute.</p>
 <p>Rong Huashang, who had turned into a little girl, seemed to have also shrunk in age. She began to ask Gu Lingzhi with a series of questions while bearing the huge pair of eyes. No one would think that such an innocent and lovely girl was actually a senior who had lived more than a thousand years.</p>
 <p>“How is it? Lingzhi, do I look weird like this? Will anybody spot any flaws?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi looked at the child-like Rong Huashang who was excitedly holding onto the edge of her dress while asking non-stop. She was silent for a few seconds before she said sincerely, “No, Grand-aunt. There is nothing wrong with you dressed like this.”</p>
 <p>Someone once heard that within every old lady lies a little girl in her heart. Sure enough, the saying was not false. Rong Huashang behaved exactly like an adorable little girl now.</p>
 <p>Rong Huashang kept looking at her new look with excitement. When she had finally contained her excitement, Gu Lingzhi then asked, “Grand-aunt, what shall we do now?”</p>
 <p>The smile on Rong Huashang’s face briefly paused as she awakened from her pink fantasy of a beautiful young girl. She frowned for a moment before speaking slowly, “Lord Fashen has the Sacred Weapon in hand, he will certainly be fine. Let’s find somewhere first to inquire about the news before deciding on our journey.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi replied, “Okay.” before deciding on a direction with Rong Huashang to head towards.</p>
 <p>A few hours later, the two arrived at a city called Gan Nai that lay on the east side of North Qiu. They managed to follow the crowd and sneaked into the city. Gu Lingzhi and Rong Huashang stayed in a pleasant-looking inn before beginning to inquire about the neighbouring situation.</p>
 <p>It was only a day’s journey away from the place where Pan Luming had ordered people to besiege them. If something were to really happen, it would be easy to find out.</p>
 <p>Soon, it was time for dinner. Gu Lingzhi simply ordered an impressive spread for the waiter to deliver to their room. She then released Rong Yuan from the space. As for Pan Yue, he was still in a coma and was estimated to wake up in three to five days time. The three of them did not know whether to worry or feel fortunate that the drug had already expired. The quality of the Spiritual Medicine created by Gu Lingzhi was surprisingly good.</p>
 <p>“Rong Yuan, are you okay?” Rong Huashang was worried upon seeing Rong Yuan’s pale face. Pan Luming’s blow was not easy to handle. Even she would be hurt if she were to be careless, let alone Rong Yuan who was still a Martial Sage.</p>
 <p>“It is no longer a problem after taking some medicine.” Rong Yuan smiled lightly, “It’s Pan Yue’s injuries that is frightening. He may need to cultivate for a year and a half before recovering.”</p>
 <p>Rong Huashang did not know if she was imagining things but she had always felt a tinge of gloat in Rong Yuan’s tone. She spoke as both a warning and a reminder, “The Fifth Prince of North Qiu is the only apprentice of Lord Fashen. Put down any grievances that you both have as now is not the time to fight with each other.”</p>
 <p>“I know, Grand-aunt. I know when to stop.” Rong Yuan answered with a laugh before turning to look at Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>They were almost separated forever, however, their emotions were unexpectedly calm. In each others’ eyes, they saw the same obsession – live together, die together!</p>
 <p>They have already been in love for decades such that their original love had long been transformed into a deeper and more complex relationship. It was like water flowing through the apex of the heart and soul, becoming one existence.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan stared at Gu Lingzhi for a while before suddenly shaking his head and laughed, laughing at his moment of stupidity.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry,” Rong Yuan said, apologising for acting on his own.</p>
 <p>He should have known of Gu Lingzhi’s affection for him from a long time, yet he still acted foolishly and wanted to break and leave everything behind. He had almost caused Gu Lingzhi to be worried for nothing. His heart ached and his breaths became unstable when he recalled the scene whereby Gu Lingzhi shouted his name desperately. <em>How much pain did she feel at that moment? How could he come up with such a method against Gu Lingzhi?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi did not scruple as she accepted his apology firmly, “I hope that you can consider my feelings before doing something dangerous next time.”</p>
 <p>“I won’t do it again.”</p>
 <p>Rong Huashang looked at the both of them in perplexity as she could not understand what was going on. But upon seeing Gu Lingzhi’s usual look while the affection in Rong Yuan’s eyes became stronger than before, she quietly swallowed the question that was about to pop out from her mouth.</p>
 <p>It was simply love between young couples and her as a lonely old woman, should stay out of this and not make herself uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>Just at this moment, the dishes they ordered were also delivered. All three of their gazes landed on the waiter who had delivered the dishes. The waiter was puzzled as it was only a man and a woman who had checked into the room. When did another person suddenly appear? He then heard a crisp and pleasant voice of a young girl, “Brother, can I inquire something from you?”</p>
 <p>As a waiter of the inn, he had come into contact with many people from the North Qiu Kingdom throughout the day. It was natural that he would have heard many things. If they were to begin inquiring from him, they might get some unexpected surprises.</p>
 <p>When the waiter saw that it was a little girl with big eyes who was inquiring, the professional smile on his face became more sincere immediately. “Of course you may. As long as it's not of something important, feel free to ask.”</p>
 <p>“Then I’ll begin asking.” Rong Huashang laughed while blinking her big eyes. Her blinks almost melted the waiter’s heart.</p>
 <p>“It isn’t something that big of a deal. It’s my first time coming to this Gan Nai City with my two older brothers. We do not know what is fun here, can you introduce any interesting places to us?”</p>
 <p>The waiter heaved a sigh of relief. He was really afraid that Rong Huashang might ask something inappropriate. After placing down the dishes, he seriously introduced the situation of Gan Nai City to Rong Huashang before recommending a few attractions. He then retreated after taking the money.</p>
 <p>“Although this Gan Nai City may be small, it is still a good place to stay and rest.” Rong Yuan smiled while looking at the closed door.</p>
 <p>The few questions that Rong Huashang had asked previously may seem normal, but they were skillfully asked to illustrate the military deployment as well as the surrounding terrain. This led them to have a general understanding of Gan Nai City. Pan Luming’s movements were huge. As long as they were to wait patiently for two days, news would definitely reach them.</p>
