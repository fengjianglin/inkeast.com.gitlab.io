 <p>By the side, Yuan Zheng had witnessed the entire farce and sighed. He wanted very much to tell everyone that Rong Yuan was acting so unusual today because he had drunk too much last night and was still a little drunk today. His abnormal reactions were entirely the results of him being drunk, it was not as wonderful as they had thought it was.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi listened to those few girls spewing out various punishments for Mo Bingyi, with someone even suggesting that they completely burn Mo Bingyi’s hair and clothes as well. She could not bear it any longer and stood up.</p>
 <p>“I was the one who burned your clothes, not her.” Gu Lingzhi looked at the girl who had suggested returning an eye for an eye. She had burned the clothes on this girl.</p>
 <p>Instantly, silence reigned. Several people looked at Gu Lingzhi as though they were looking at an idiot.</p>
 <p><em>There was already someone who had confessed. At this point of time, Gu Lingzhi just had to admit it herself too, why was she being an idiot?</em></p>
 <p>“Ah, no wonder both the Third Prince and Yan Liang would harbour such special feelings for her. The average person wouldn’t be able to use such measures,” a girl muttered sourly. Evidently, she had assumed Gu Lingzhi had jumped out at this point of time to garner Mo Bingyi’s favour.</p>
 <p>Her hair immediately started to burn once she had finished talking. Almost instantly, her hair had burned to ashes. Before she could even scream, she had become bald.</p>
 <p>“You were disrespectful to the Royal Family. This time, your hair was burned as a warning. If it happens again…”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan did not finish his sentence, but everyone could understand the threat in his eyes.</p>
 <p>All the students who had initially wanted to say something, all quietly kept their mouths shut. Stunned at the scene, Gu Lingzhi looked at Rong Yuan in surprise. She never thought that Rong Yuan’s threat would be so effective that he could shut everyone up with just a few simple sentences.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan noticed Gu Lingzhi’s gaze and raised his brow. He softly whispered in her ear, “You think that just anyone can become the War God? You’re the only one who thinks little of me.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan whined, his voice sounded as though he felt wronged.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi coughed, she regretted not having a Recording Crystal on hand at the moment. <em>How would others feel when they find out that this was how the War God they admired and respected so deeply was like?</em></p>
 <p>In the end, this farce that started with fireballs, ended with Rong Yuan personally taking action. He assigned Mo Bingyi and Gu Lingzhi each with writing a three-hundred-word reflection. His act of favouritism was obviously blatant.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan announced the end of class after he finished giving out the punishment. He completely overlooked the plaintive looks of the female students and gazed gently at Gu Lingzhi, “Is the three-hundred-word reflection too much? Should I find someone to help you write it?”</p>
 <p>“…There’s no need.” She had burned someone’s clothes and hair, exposing their whole body to others, but only had to write a three-hundred-word reflection. Gu Lingzhi finally understood why so many people tried so desperately to get Rong Yuan’s attention. Compared to the punishment that Mo Bingyi would have received, this result was very satisfactory!</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan’s blatant act of favouritism had spread throughout the entirety of the Royal School by noon.</p>
 <p>In the principal’s office, Rong Zhisheng was having a headache as he looked at the girls in front of him. Although he disapproved of his nephew’s act of favouritism, his face was gentle and amiable, “Regarding the issue brought up by you all, I will verify with the Third Prince. If he really did do such a thing, I will punish him accordingly.” However, what the punishment would consist, was his business.</p>
 <p>“Principal, I think Gu Lingzhi should be expelled for her actions today. She used fire to burn our hair off today. Who knows what else she would do next time? Her actions are sufficient reasons to expel her, right?”</p>
 <p>“Ah, that is not possible.” Rong Zhisheng replied sincerely, “You did not receive any substantial bodily harm, only your hair and clothes are gone. This can only be considered as a private dispute. At most, I can only deduct ten points from her. Don’t worry, the school will definitely not be partial towards anyone. After this, I will get someone to deduct ten credits from Gu Lingzhi.”</p>
 <p><em>This was considered being partial? Their delicate bodies had all been completely exposed in front of others, several people had seen them. This had caused them grievous psychological damage. Some of the more unfortunate ones even had all their hair completely burned off. They would only be able to revert to their original appearances in four or five years. They had suffered such great embarrassment, but this matter would be resolved with just deducting ten credits?</em></p>
 <p>Rong Zhisheng noticed the shock in their eyes and sighed heavily, “I know you all have been embarrassed, but rules are rules. Since none of you have suffered any substantial bodily damage, the heaviest punishment I can give is to deduct ten credits. As for what kind of punishment will be given to your tutor, the Third Prince, it is his business. Although I am the principal, I cannot override his authority to manage his students. This is not fair to the tutor. Furthermore, the Third Prince is a new tutor in the Royal School, yet he has achieved promising results with his teaching. Therefore, I am powerless to interfere with his teaching.”</p>
 <p>At first, the female students had thought that it was not easy to be the principal, but towards the end, their eyeballs looked as though it would fall out soon. <em>Those who could enrol in the Royal School were not idiots, how would they be unable to discern Rong Zhisheng’s protection of the Third Prince and Gu Lingzhi?</em></p>
 <p>They could accept that the Third Prince was protecting Gu Lingzhi, but even the Principal was doing so.</p>
 <p><em>Did they really have no hope at all? Had Gu Lingzhi already attained the favour and approval of the Royal Family? Even Tianfeng Wei had never received such treatment.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>While the girls were still in shock over his words, Rong Zhisheng took the opportunity to signal to the guards outside his office. A group of men wearing the armor of the Royal School Guards entered the office and physically removed the girls who still had the intention of arguing further.</p>
 <p>In front of true authority, it was useless to speak of fairness. As the Principal, why would he give them the chance to continue speaking? Furthermore, he had said nothing wrong.</p>
 <p>Although it seemed like Rong Yuan had no limits in his style of teaching and was simply playing around with his students, the results from the Battle Arena in this period of time indicated otherwise. Rong Yuan’s students had outstanding performances in comparison to the students from other classes. They were much more versatile in the control of their spiritual power and also kept calm in battles, unlike the students who did not seem to have had much fighting experience. This caused several other teachers to imitate his classes, but none of them were able to achieve results as promising as the Third Prince. <em>Simply put, the Third Prince was much more effective!</em></p>
 <p>They considered pushing the limits of their students just like the Third Prince, but quickly banished the notion. <em>How could they ever compare with the Third Prince? If they were to accidentally offend a young master, even the Royal School would not be able to protect them!</em></p>
