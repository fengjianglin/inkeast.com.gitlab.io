 <p>To prevent Xiao Yu from playing any tricks, Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan fulfilled her wish and took her back to where they lived. If Xiao Yu really had any other intentions, it was much safer to have her under their eyelids.</p>
 <p>When Lin Rong saw Xiao Yu who was behind them, she could not help but ask about her out of curiosity. Not long later, she was allured by Xiao Yu’s innocence and appearance and acknowledged her as her sister. She even invited Xiao Yu to live in her yard but was quickly rejected by Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>“Aunt, she has just arrived and is not familiar with this place yet. Wouldn’t it be better for her to stay with me for a while?”</p>
 <p>“It’s the same for her to stay with me.” Lin Rong held onto Xiao Yu’s hand, “You two are so busy and don’t have the time to accompany Xiao Yu. It’s better for her to stay with me and keep me company.”</p>
 <p>“No, no, Xiao Yu is afraid of unfamiliarity. How many times has she met you? Don’t scare her off.” Gu Lingzhi pursed her lips and chuckled before separating their hands unobtrusively. She took Xiao Yu’s hand and said, “We’ve brought back everyone we could from nearby and won’t be leaving anytime soon, I can take you to familiarise the Spirit City’s environment. How about I find you another place to stay when you have familiarised yourself?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yu looked at Gu Lingzhi before looking at Lin Rong. She bowed her head and spoke timidly, “Okay.”</p>
 <p>“So obedient.” Gu Lingzhi unconsciously used a word meant for pampering. She laughed bitterly in her heart. The appearance of Xiao Yu was not just deceptive in general. She knew that the other party had a conspiracy yet she could not help but to pity her a little. Fortunately, Rong Yuan did not fall for this. If he was to be influenced by Xiao Yu and talk to her so gently, she had no idea how jealous she would be.</p>
 <p>“Alright, Little Aunt. Go back first if there is nothing else. Lingzhi and I are tired after a day of journey and would like to go back and rest.” Rong Yuan directly asked her to leave before pulling Gu Lingzhi into the house such that Lin Rong had no opportunity to take Xiao Yu away. Gu Lingzhi’s other hand held onto Xiao Yu and waved apologetically at Lin Rong before entering the house.</p>
 <p>“Hey…Wait, if you two want to rest, you can leave Xiao Yu with me. You guys…”</p>
 <p><em>Bang.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>The door closed mercilessly in front of Lin Rong, almost hitting her elegantly straight nose, “I just wanted someone to accompany me, do they have to be so protective of her? People who do not know of this might mistaken her as a mistress. <em>Ah</em>!”</p>
 <p>Lin Rong covered her mouth immediately and thought of a terrible possibility. <em>Could Xiao Yu possibly be Rong Yuan’s mistress?</em></p>
 <p>But Gu Lingzhi’s reaction was too calm. And judging by their attitude towards Xiao Yu, Rong Yuan clearly did not pay any attention to her. It was Gu Lingzhi who was protective all along. <em>Could it be that…Xiao Yu was the Gu Lingzhi’s mistress instead?</em></p>
 <p>“No way, not possible, that’s definitely not possible!” If this was the case, Xiao Yu would have already been shredded into a thousand pieces by Rong Yuan. Lin Rong’s head shook around like a rattle drum.</p>
 <p><em>So…why were the two of them so protective of Xiao Yu?</em></p>
 <p>Not only was Lin Rong in doubt, Gu Lingzhi herself did not understand as to why she wanted to bring Xiao Yu to live in her residence with Rong Yuan. Why had she not considered that Rong Yuan might be Xiao Yu’s goal?</p>
 <p>Looking at the pair of shy eyes and delicate voice of Xiao Yu enquiring solicitously about Rong Yuan’s well-being, Gu Lingzhi felt a throbbing pain in her head.</p>
 <p>“Brother Rong, come and try this jade cake that I’ve made.” Xiao Yu looked at Rong Yuan expectantly and shyly with a plate of exquisite pastries.</p>
 <p>“It’s okay, I don’t like desserts.” Rong Yuan rejected coldly.</p>
 <p>“I’ve spent a long time making it, do take a bite.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan pursed her lips, “Since you took such a long time to make it, you don’t have to do it again.”</p>
 <p>“How can I do that?” Xiao Yu looked at him pitifully. “As long as I can make the dessert which Brother Rong likes, I’ll be willing to make it no matter how long it’ll take.”</p>
 <p><em>Tsk</em>, <em>that was rather heartfelt and sincere.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi pouted her lips and lowered her head to select the material to be used to refine the Spiritual Weapon for Lin Chongyuan among a bunch of minerals.</p>
 <p>Although Lin Chongyuan also had some good quality Spiritual Weapons left by their ancestors, they were all not suitable for his usage. Fortunately, they had found a suitable piece of material earlier during the rescue. Thus, she wanted to combine with the other materials to make a handy spiritual weapon for Lin Chongyuan.</p>
 <p>“But I’m unwilling.” A smile flashed across Rong Yuan’s eyes as he sensed that Gu Lingzhi was a little jealous. He rejected Xiao Yu’s offer numerous times and went to choose the material with Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>“Brother Rong, I just want you to have a taste of my culinary skills, why are you always reluctant…” Xiao Yu bit her lower lip and grieved.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan frowned, “I’m just unwilling to, why do I have to give you a reason?”</p>
 <p>If not for investigating Xiao Yu’s purpose, how could he possibly allow her to stay around for so long and cause Gu Lingzhi to be unhappy? If he was the reason why Xiao Yu was sticking around, then he could just chase her away now.</p>
 <p>While thinking of that, a series of rapid footsteps could be heard coming from outside suddenly. Soon after, Qiao Yeshu’s voice sounded hurriedly, “Oh no, Little Chancellor, Demigod Rong, the beasts are here again!”</p>
 <p>“What? The beasts are here again?” Gu Lingzhi was startled and stopped her actions.</p>
 <p>“The beasts had suddenly gathered outside and were planning to attack the city. You and Demigod Rong should go and take a look.”</p>
 <p>“Okay, we’ll head over there now.” With a wave of her hand, Gu Lingzhi stored the table full of materials into the Storage Ring and left with Rong Yuan hurriedly towards the city gate.</p>
 <p>Upon looking at the three figures leaving in a hurry, Xiao Yu tilted her head and blinked her eyes. She pursed her lips and laughed quietly. Her expressions and movements looked harmless but the gaze in her eyes was cold and sinister.</p>
 <p>On the other side, Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan had arrived at the city wall hurriedly and saw the herd of beasts approaching from a distance. Their surging figures had stirred up a sky full of yellow sand.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan only took one glance before turning his head, “Wait for me here, I’ll go and take a quick look.”</p>
 <p>With that, his figure vanished rapidly into the herd of beasts. Gu Lingzhi, Lin Chongyuan and the rest were watching from the city wall. Chu Jiang then smiled and said, “Look at Demigod Rong. His techniques are not very different from our Spirit Tribe’s Heaven-Level techniques. Looks like there are still some good things being passed down in this Tianyuan Continent.”</p>
 <p>“Indeed.” Gu Lingzhi answered, “Even though Pan Luo had deliberately caused the loss of many Heaven-Level techniques in the Continent and many of the remaining techniques could not be cultivated due to various reasons, some things have not stopped flowing nevertheless. Particularly, the Royal Families and clans of the few kingdoms, their respective roots are deep.”</p>
 <p>Chu Jiang listened carefully, “These families might become our assistance in the future.”</p>
 <p>“Yes. Those prestigious families are not fools either. They are not content in being trapped on the Tianyuan Continent for the rest of their lives upon knowing that a True God can no longer be produced.”</p>
 <p>Being able to nurture sufficient numbers of Demigods to open the channel connecting to the Tianyuan Continent has already begun. Once the channel successfully opened, it would surely attract Pan Luo’s attention. Undoubtedly, it was not reliable to fight against the whole Realm of the Gods with just the power of the Spirit Tribe. At this time, the other forces on the Tianyuan Continent would play a critical role.</p>
 <p>These days, Chu Jiang and Lin Chongyuan have learned a lot from the outside world through Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan. That was also why they had made such a remark.</p>
 <p>“Look, the beasts are starting to devour each other!” Wei Lingshu, who has been paying attention to the beasts the entire time, laughed, “Little Chancellor is really our lucky star. Not only has she brought us hope but also resolved this crisis.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was almost numb to this kind of appreciation and replied skillfully, “The Spirit Tribe is my home, it is incumbent for me to protect my homeland.”</p>
 <p>Wei Lingshu was teased by her, “You…”</p>
 <p>“How did Brother Rong kill them?”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Xiao Yu’s voice was inserted into their conversation. Gu Lingzhi turned around and looked behind.</p>
 <p>“Why did you come here?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yu smiled timidly, “I heard that the beasts are coming and came here to take a look. How did Brother Rong cause them to enter a state of confusion?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi smirked, “It can be done by finding and killing the Female Worm that controls the beasts.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yu tilted her head, “Kill it? How?”</p>
 <p>“Just kill it naturally.” Gu Lingzhi vaguely explained.</p>
 <p>It was at this time where Rong Yuan returned. Once he stepped into the city wall, he headed to Gu Lingzhi’s side and asked, “Kill what naturally?”</p>
 <p>“How did you kill the Female Worm?” Xiao Yu asked before Gu Lingzhi could reply. She seemed to be persistent on the answer.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan glanced at her suspiciously and thought that his method of attracting the Female Worm to expose itself before killing it was not a secret. He did not think much about it and said, “You just have to attract the Female Worm and cause it to initiate an attack such that its exact location will be known.”</p>
 <p>“I see…” Xiao Yu replied while looking pensive. She then left again as quietly as how she came.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi looked at Xiao Yu as she departed and somehow, felt a sense of calamity in her heart.</p>
 <p>This time when the beasts attacked the city, it did not take long before the Female Worm was killed.</p>
 <p>In the remaining time, the Spirit City recovered to its calm state. If there was anything different, it was Xiao Yu’s transformation.</p>
 <p>Ever since the day where the beasts attacked the city, Xiao Yu seemed to have been enlightened. She no longer pestered Rong Yuan and hid in the room all day long, uncertain of what she was up to. Xiao Yu no longer bothered them, thus, Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan did not think of driving her away and continued to let her stay.</p>
 <p>On this day, Gu Lingzhi had a sudden impulse and pulled Rong Yuan to the west side of the city. She wanted to see the lives of the people they had brought back.</p>
 <p>When they reached the temporary residence of Chen Dong and Qi Mengjia, Qi Mengjia pulled them into the house mysteriously. Chen Dong looked around to make sure no one had noticed them and entered the house before closing the door.</p>
 <p>Once they had entered the house, Gu Lingzhi discovered that there were a lot of people present, all of whom were rescued together with Chen Dong. Before Gu Lingzhi could question what was going on, she heard a “<em>plop</em>” followed by Qi Mengjia kneeling on her knees and hugging her thighs. She wailed, “Little Chancellor, please save us!”</p>
