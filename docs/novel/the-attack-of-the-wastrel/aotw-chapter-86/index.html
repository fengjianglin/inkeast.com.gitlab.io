 <p>“Your Highness, may I help you?”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan immediately swept his feelings aside and said, “I’ve heard that there is a new shop in town selling weapons, do you want to go and see?”</p>
 <p>“Oh?” This had indeed piqued the interest of Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>These few days, whenever she had time, she would go into her Inheritance Space to try and forge weapons, so she had gained some knowledge about weapons in general. Rong Yuan’s suggestion was exactly what she was interested in. She could learn more by looking at the weapons that others have created.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go then.”</p>
 <p>“Not battling anymore?” Rong Yuan raised his brows. He remembered that she had to fight three battles every day before she was willing to leave. Even if she did not get picked to fight, she would wait until the Town of the Brave had closed its gates before she left.</p>
 <p>“No, I’ve learnt enough from my battle with Pei Wen. I’ll come back tomorrow.”</p>
 <p>“Alright,” Rong Yuan nodded his head. “Pei Wen is a strong opponent, battling with him is enough for one day.”</p>
 <p>They then left the arena, with Rong Yuan leading the way, Gu Lingzhi following closely behind.</p>
 <p>Though Rong Yuan had said that it was a new shop selling weapons, but they sold other things like Spiritual Medicine, Spiritual Scrolls and other precious artifacts.</p>
 <p>Following Rong Yuan into the store, Gu Lingzhi went straight to the weapons section. Rong Yuan laughed before he went upstairs to look at the higher-level weapons that would suit his rank and watched Gu Lingzhi from afar.</p>
 <p>On the first floor were lower-level weapons suitable for Martial Students and Martial Practitioners. The smelting methods for these weapons were not comparable to those for high-level weapons. However, Gu Lingzhi was not eyeing any high-level weapons, she merely wanted to examine them.</p>
 <p>This weapon shop was huge and there were many weapons hanging on the walls. Gu Lingzhi examined them one by one, taking note of their shapes, additional features and materials they were made of. The shop assistant patiently explained the features of each weapon to Gu Lingzhi. Gu Lingzhi felt bad and purchased two Spiritual Swords that were more uniquely made than the others.</p>
 <p>When Gu Lingzhi was done with the first floor, she was about to head up to the second floor when she heard a voice.</p>
 <p>“By any chance, do you have any weapons here that have a feature that can externalize spiritual energy?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi paused, she also wanted to know if there was such a weapon that was sold here.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry, but we don’t seem to have what you want,” the shop assistant smiled forcefully as she replied. Externalizing spiritual energy was an indication that someone was a Martial Practitioner and was not classified as a feature that a weapon could possess, thus there would not be such a weapon on sale.</p>
 <p>“Why don’t you look at the other weapons that we have? Our store just opened, there are many artifacts available, I’m sure you can find something that you like.”</p>
 <p>“I only want a weapon that can externalize spiritual energy.” The person who asked this question earlier seemed fixated on getting such a weapon and his tone was getting impolite. “Since you have many artifacts available, why don’t you have what I want? This shop is too lacking if it does not even have the weapon that I want.”</p>
 <p>“This… is indeed our mistake. If there is really such a weapon that you have mentioned, then I will report to my superiors and get my boss to bring in the stock for that weapon.”</p>
 <p>The man was getting more upset and seeing that the shop assistant would not dare to upset her customer, he continued to raise his voice, “What a big store this is, and such fanciful names that you have picked for your weapons, yet you do not even have a weapon that I want. What a load of crap!”</p>
 <p>“This…” the shop assistant opened her mouth to retort but decided not to say anything. She thought of the possibility that this young man could be sent from another weapons store to disrupt the order of things, since it was their first day of business.</p>
 <p>The purpose of a weapon is to help its owner to save as much energy as possible so that this energy could be spent on other skills. As such, most weapons only had very ordinary features. Only a few high-quality weapons had the ability to exceed the Martial Artist’s skills to produce another attacking skill.</p>
 <p>At the end of the day, however, it all boiled down to one’s martial skills.</p>
 <p>Externalizing one’s spiritual energy was not a Martial Skill so it cannot be put into a weapon as a feature. The young man was looking for a weapon that simply did not exist, if he was not trying to disrupt the store, what other motive could he possibly have?</p>
 <p>“Your store should not be called the Store of Many Treasures, it should be called the Store of Unnecessary Treasures. You can’t even coordinate your weapons, what’s the point of opening a store?”</p>
 <p>The more upset the man got, the more people started to look over.</p>
 <p>“I want to talk to your supervisor. How is your store even operating if you don’t even have the weapon that I want?”</p>
 <p>“I am the supervisor here, can I help you?” A middle-aged man wearing a green martial outfit asked.</p>
 <p>He was the branch manager of the store, Qin Boyu. He had taken notice of the commotion the moment the young man raised his voice. He only came over when he was completely sure that the young man was from another store that was trying to disrupt their sales.</p>
 <p>After hearing the voice, the young man tilted his body to look at Qin Boyu with a proud look on his face.</p>
 <p>“You’re the supervisor here? Is this how you manage the store? You don’t even have a Martial Student tiered weapon, and you dare to call yourselves the Store of Many Treasures?”</p>
 <p>Qin Boyu calmly stated, “The world is huge, there are bound to be some areas that our shop is unable to attend to. It is normal for us to not have one or two weapons. As for the weapon that you are talking about, I have not heard about it in my many years of experience working at a weapons store. Are you sure such a weapon even exists?”</p>
 <p>Qin Boyu tried to sound more intimidating, making use of the fact that he was of a higher rank than the young man was. He was also trying to get the young man to admit that he was only here to cause trouble.</p>
 <p>On the contrary, the young man only looked more displeased. He turned to point at Gu Lingzhi who was standing near the staircase in the show.</p>
 <p>“Her weapon was able to externalize her spiritual energy.”</p>
 <p>Qin Boyu and the crowd that had gathered at this commotion all looked towards Gu Lingzhi. Those who had frequented the Town of the Brave immediately recognized her and her mask.</p>
 <p>It seemed that the Store of Many Treasures would not have a smooth opening day today.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was stunned for a moment, unable to believe that she got dragged into a commotion when she had only been a witness to it. Swiftly, she tried to escape to the second floor.</p>
 <p>The young man, on the other hand, did not give her the chance to do so. He ran up even faster and blocked her route.</p>
 <p>“Black Thorn, can you let them see your weapon? These people are too ignorant and inexperienced, they have never even heard of your weapon.”</p>
 <p>Under everybody’s scrutiny, Gu Lingzhi pursed her lips and had a look of annoyance but it was hidden by the mask.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry but my weapon does not have such a feature, I think you got the wrong person.”</p>
