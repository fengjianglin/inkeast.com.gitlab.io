 <p>The small blue black electric sparks in the sky gave Rong Yuan an extremely bad feeling. From that, he felt the same feeling as when he faced the formation in the Endless Sea Realm. Without needing to be hit by it, he already knew how dangerous it would be to be struck by one of the blue black electric bolts. <em>And what did Wei Lingshu say? They had to go to the centre of the black fog? Aren’t they afraid of getting struck by the electric bolts?</em></p>
 <p>Seeing Rong Yuan’s questioning look, Wei Lingshu consoled, “Elder, please do not worry. This is just an extension of the formation in the Endless Sea Realm and the danger this poses to Martial Artists above the Demigod rank is not much. You will be fine as long as you don’t touch it.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan did not ask him how he knew that he was of the Demigod rank but narrowed his eyes at him, “Then what will happen to those who are below the Demigod rank?”</p>
 <p>“That…” Wei Lingshu hesitated before speaking truthfully, “If it is a light injury, their consciousness will just be affected. However, a serious damage will result in their soul being destroyed.”</p>
 <p>“Ha.” Rong Yuan chuckled coldly. He turned around and grabbed Gu Lingzhi’s hand starting to walk away, “We won’t do this task anymore.”</p>
 <p>Even if they did not have spiritual energy, they could function perfectly well here. They did not need to take the risk.</p>
 <p>“Elders, please wait, please wait!” Wei Lingshu shouted as he chased after them, “Although the blue black electric bolts are dangerous but it is not like we can’t deal with it. As long as you wear these spiritual clothes made by one of our Weapon Forgers from the Spirit City, nothing will happen even if you are struck by the blue black electric bolts. As long as you are careful, there won’t be any danger.”</p>
 <p>Hearing this, Rong Yuan turned back abruptly as he stared at him with a long face, “Since you had this spiritual clothes, why didn’t you take it out earlier?”</p>
 <p><em>Of course it was to get onto your good side by taking it out only when you are met with danger.</em></p>
 <p>However, Wei Lingshu obviously could not say this and could only insist, “I wanted to give the spiritual clothes to you two after I finish explaining about the Heavenly Lands. Who knew…”</p>
 <p>Wei Lingshu did not complete his sentence, but everyone knew what he was intending to say. Rong Yuan sniggered, “So it is my fault.”</p>
 <p>“How can that be? It is definitely my fault for not considering your feelings and not explaining things clearly. There is nothing wrong with you being careful.”</p>
 <p>Wei Lingshu’s heart bled as he handed the silver robes over to Rong Yuan, silently observing a moment of silence for his lost opportunity to get into Rong Yuan’s good books.</p>
 <p>If he knew this would happen, he would have taken out the Anti-lightning Robe beforehand. Now, he had given it away without gaining anything. Wei Lingshu was so depressed he wanted to cough up blood. However, he maintained a polite smile on his face as he could not afford to be careless. Looking at the others, who were also looking unhappy, he tried to bring up the spirits, “Having rushed for a month, everyone must be tired. We should all rest for today and head in tomorrow.”</p>
 <p>The minute Wei Lingshu finished speaking, Rong Yuan behaved extremely naturally as he retrieved a simple tent from his Storage Ring. Choosing a relatively clean spot, he set up the tent. During their journey these few days, they had spent most of their time sleeping in the wild and Rong Yuan was already extremely practiced with the act of setting up the tent.</p>
 <p>Quickly setting up the tent, Rong Yuan went in and laid a thick blanket on the floor before placing bed sheets and more blankets around. Before long, a simple yet warm tent had been set up. Standing at the entrance of the tent, Rong Yuan checked that he did not miss anything out before facing Gu Lingzhi, who was sitting by the side, eating a fruit. In a loving manner, he waved at her to come over, “It is ready, you can come in.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi then stood up and headed over. Extending her head inside the tent and glancing over the interior set up, she rewarded Rong Yuan with a big smile before bending down and going in. Rong Yuan then followed her, closing the curtains to the entrance as he went in. Before long, low murmurs of sweet-whispered conversations could be heard.</p>
 <p>The group from the Spirit City was already used to this. Seeing the two of them enter the tent, they knew that they would not be seeing the two of them for a while. One of them then went up to Wei Lingshu and complained softly, “Leader, why do you always let the two of them show off in front of you? Even if he really is a Demigod, under the influence of the Spiritual Transformation Clock, he won’t last more than a single blow.”</p>
 <p>Wei Lingshu glanced over him, “Although the Spiritual Transformation Clock is something that can be used to deal with Demigods, the cost to use it is too high. If it’s not necessary, there is no reason why we should quarrel with them and fight against each other. As long as they obediently help us collect spiritual energy, what harm is there in letting them do what they want?” There was a huge difference in doing something willingly and being forced. If not, he would have used force when Rong Yuan threatened to leave previously.</p>
 <p>“But…” Jin Hao was still brooding over how Rong Yuan disrespected Wei Lingshu. <em>Wei Lingshu was his idol, how could anyone bully him?</em></p>
 <p>“There is nothing to argue about. Don’t forget what the Chancellor told us, our…tribe doesn’t have much time left.”</p>
 <p>Jin Hao froze as he thought about their predicament and no longer complained. He could only glare at the tent Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi were in as he silently thought of how to teach them a lesson when they entered.</p>
 <p>The night was silent as the entire group recuperated. They were all filled with energy as they looked at the Heavenly Lands ahead of them. The eagerness to try something new as well as the fear of the unknown was written all over their faces.</p>
 <p>Wei Lingshu waited for everyone to keep their tents and get ready before arranging for Lin Rong to be in the centre of the group. He instructed the people around her to always place her safety as first priority. He then turned to face Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi with a smile, gesturing invitingly to them.</p>
 <p>“Two elders, please follow us.”</p>
 <p>“Mmhm.” Rong Yuan nodded, grabbing Gu Lingzhi beside him. They then followed Wei Lingshu and the rest into the black fog of the Heavenly Lands.</p>
 <p>As soon as they stepped into the Heavenly Lands, Rong Yuan felt his entire body sink. The spiritual energy in his entire body felt as if it was being suppressed. This feeling was the same as when he was in the Endless Sea Realm and all his movements and spiritual energy was being controlled to the minimal. Everyone else had the same expression as they felt their bodies go heavy. The spiritual energy that they could still feel initially had completely disappeared.</p>
 <p>Lin Rong hated this feeling of not being able to control her spiritual energy as she pursed her lips and complained, “Why is our spiritual energy being restricted and why can’t we use them at all?”</p>
 <p>Beside her, Lin Mengyan chuckled and patted her head, “Young miss, don’t worry. Once we get out of this place, your spiritual energy will return. Didn’t I tell you this might happen to us when we entered?”</p>
 <p>“But you didn’t say how terrible it would feel to have my spiritual energy restricted.” Lin Rong whined. However, she only complained for two sentences and stopped expressing her dissatisfaction. Wei Lingshu threw her a satisfied look. Although this young lady had been pampered by the entire tribe and was slightly delicate, she was not arrogant and wilful. Her innocent personality made everyone like her. This was the reason why they were willing to bring her along on this task that was so far away. They wanted to satisfy her curiosity. If the First Mistress was still around, she would probably also love this little sister of hers…</p>
 <p>Thinking about the First Mistress for whom the entire tribe had used their strength to send out of the Lost Lands, Wei Lingshu was slightly absent-minded. They did not know how the First Mistress was doing now, whether she was even alive or not. His absent-mindedness caused him to narrowly miss getting struck by an electric bolt. If not for Yao Teng pulling him away, even if he was wearing the Anti-lightning Robe, his consciousness would still be slightly affected for at least one and a half years. He immediately focused on the road ahead, not daring to let his mind wander.</p>
 <p>The group travelled for about one hour and all of a sudden the pitch black darkness of the black fog started to boil. It started trembling and a sound that caused the hairs on their head to stand floated towards them in all directions. Wei Lingshu’s face changed as he instructed, “Get in formation!”</p>
 <p>Other than Lin Rong, the other eight people immediately went to their designated spot and formed an Eight Trigram Formation. They surrounded all eight directions around Lin Rong, Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi, protecting them. Wei Lingshu then said lowly, “Two elders, we might be surrounded by one of the Insect Beasts in the Heavenly Lands. Later, I hope you would lend us a helping hand to help us chase away the Insect Beasts.”</p>
 <p>“Okay.” Helping out after taking their money is a concept that Rong Yuan still understood. Furthermore, seeing the nervous expression on Wei Lingshu and everyone’s faces, he knew that the Insect Beasts were not something that was easy to deal with. Taking the chance to improve their relationship and proving his capability was not a bad idea anyway.</p>
 <p>Just as they finished speaking, the Insect Beasts that made the hair-raising sound appeared in front of them.</p>
 <p>“God, why are there so many?” Someone paled as he asked. <em>In the past years, when they came in to collect spiritual energy, they had met attacks from similar beasts. But they had never met so many before. Were they going to be able to deal with so many?</em></p>
 <p>Numerous beasts about the size of the palm filled the air, their bodies shone a dark black. They had a hairy triangular head and with their eight pincer sharp legs, they were crawling towards the group. The vast numbers caused the ground in front of them to be completely blanketed. In the depths of the Black Fog, who knew how many more there were.</p>
 <p>Once she saw clearly what was surrounding them, Gu Lingzhi felt her stomach churn as she almost puked out her breakfast. Rong Yuan felt equally queasy as he subconsciously put his hand over Gu Lingzhi’s eyes. His face was gloomy as he said, “Don’t open your eyes. Just stand in the middle of the formation. Once we kill all the Insect Beasts, I will call for you to open your eyes.”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi was about to shake her head when she heard the sound of someone retching. Lady Lin Rong was not able to stand the sight and had puked.</p>
 <p>The sound of her puking was like a signal as the Insect Beasts which were travelling at a medium speed towards them suddenly increased their speed. The one right in front had already spread its wings and was flying towards them.</p>
 <p>“Protect Lin Rong!” Wei Lingshu bellowed. He could not be bothered to check if Lin Rong was alright as his body suddenly shone amethyst and he drew out his sword. Putting on a serious face, he made the first attack. Everyone else was drawn out of their trance as they all whipped out their weapons and faced the beasts. Two of them were Amethyst Class Warriors while six of them were Gold Class Warriors. They were all experts.</p>
 <p>A series of ‘pop’ sounds resounded in the air as the Insect Beasts were struck out of the air by Lin Mengyan’s whip. Her gold-colored body was stained with the blackish-green blood of the Insect Beasts and she looked like a female battle warrior. Everyone else did not hold back as they waved their various weapons at the incoming Insect Beasts.</p>
 <p>Hearing the noise beside her, Gu Lingzhi pushed Rong Yuan’s hand off her face. Her face had gone white as she said, “This is not the time to flirt.”</p>
