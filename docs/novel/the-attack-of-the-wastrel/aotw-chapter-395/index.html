 <p>Rong Yuan’s previous attack must have caused quite a bit of damage to the Female Worm as even after a few days, there were no signs of an attack. It was almost as if the previous fight was done for fun. However, the scouts that were sent out to investigate came back with a warning that the beast horde was staying put about ten kilometers from them. They had no doubt that as long as they made a move, the beasts would immediately come out of their nest in full force.</p>
 <p>Since the beasts were not continuing their attacks, he was happy to let Bian Cheng continue training these people for a few more days.</p>
 <p>Why did he never ever think to train the Warriors like troops? In just three days, he could feel the obvious difference.</p>
 <p>Using the example of battle formation, initially, the Warriors only knew how to group within their own groups and leave out anyone who was not a part of them, resulting in a huge loss of manpower. Under Bian Cheng’s guidance, it created the most significant difference in the strength of the entire group. Compared to the segregation previously, their battle strength had significantly improved.</p>
 <p>Of course, there were quite a few criticisms directed at him as well. They were all criticising Guan Yue on why he was just taking orders from Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan. The beasts had all retreated, why were they still remaining put and training? Were they waiting for the beasts to come back and devour them?</p>
 <p>In response to these comments, Rong Yuan merely remained stoic and informed those that did not wish to train that they could head back to the Forgotten City by themselves. With that, the voices of opposition died down. Simple and brutal, yet extremely effective. It allowed Guan Yue to learn a lot about leadership.</p>
 <p>Ten days later, the beasts who had been resting for quite a while started to make a move again. They were heading for the people. Hearing the reports from the scouts, Guan Yue immediately notified Rong Yuan and quickly returned to their base camp. When everyone that was training outside returned back to the base camp that had been built in a rush and only had four walls, the silhouettes of the beasts appeared on the horizon.</p>
 <p>Everyone grabbed their weapons tightly and looked nervously at the black shadows of the beasts that were slowly appearing and spreading all over the wilderness.</p>
 <p>“Wait, wait…” Jiang Xinghai suddenly cried out as he saw the beast horde, “What is that?”</p>
 <p>Amidst the numerous beasts there were five giant looking bodies. The five giant bodies looked like insect beasts that resembled moving small mountains.</p>
 <p>“Giant Insect Beasts? How can it be? The scouts did not inform me that there were Giant Insect Beasts amongst the group.” Guan Yue was slightly flustered as he saw the Insect Beasts. Ever since the destruction of the Crescent Moon City, the situation with the Giant Insect Beasts had spread all over the Lost Lands. They were beasts that could easily knock down city walls and were the nightmares of everyone that had seen them.</p>
 <p>Jiang Qing started to panic as the beasts got closer, “What should we do, Chancellor? I heard that these Giant Insect Beasts are extremely powerful and even Glaze Class Fighters are no match for them. Will these walls that were built in a frenzy be able to withstand their attacks?”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi waved her Fengwu Sword, “Who cares if it can withstand the Giant Insect Beasts, it won’t matter as long as the they don’t get near the walls right?”</p>
 <p>The beasts were now only about one thousand meters away and Gu Lingzhi felt like the time was about right. Exchanging glances with Rong Yuan, they both flew into the air and headed in the direction of the beast gang. This caused everyone to exclaim. Guan Yue wanted to follow along to help but in the short moment of hesitance, the two of them had already flown quite a distance away. When compared to his own speed, he decided to remain put and support the majority of the people.</p>
 <p>“That’s the remarkable ability of Martial Artists,” Guan Yue exclaimed.</p>
 <p>The previous time when Gu Lingzhi came to meet them, she had also flown. At that time, as they were running for their lives, no one had seen how Gu Lingzhi came over. Now that he saw her fly, it made the people from the Forgotten City extremely jealous.</p>
 <p>Jiang Xinghai heard the jealousy in his voice and nudged Lu Yuan with his shoulder. Looking at him suggestively he said, “I heard from Seventh Brother that once you become a Martial Sage, you will be able to fly.”</p>
 <p>Lu Yuan threw him a glance and did not wish to dash his hopes at a time like this<em>. Was becoming a Martial Sage so easy? Seventh Brother and Eighth Sister said that there weren’t many Martial Sages in the entire Tianyuan Continent? Did he have too high expectations of his own abilities?</em></p>
 <p>However, it really made people dream of being able to fly one day. <em>Maybe one day he will…</em></p>
 <p>“Sigh, they’re being so pretentious. When their spiritual energy is exhausted, I will see how they return later on,” Jiang Qing said sinisterly. It was obvious that he was jealous. Jiang Xinghai lit up when he heard this, “You don’t have to worry, our Seventh Brother and Eighth Sister may not have other things, but they have a lot of spiritual energy. When their energy depletes, they can just recharge.”</p>
 <p>“How can it be so easy?” Jiang Qing scoffed, “Even if they brought a lot of things to replenish their spiritual energy, there will be a day where they will run out of it. When the time comes, I will see what they can do to replenish their energy?”</p>
 <p>“Toad in a well.” Jiang Xinnghai laughed, not bothering to bicker with him anymore as the beasts were nearing them extremely soon. It was at most a matter of minutes before they charged against the ‘walls’. The Giant Insect Beasts that were causing a headache to everyone would be dealt with by Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>“Prepare for battle! Brothers, whether we live to reach the Spirit City will depend on this battle!” Guan Yue shouted at the top of his lungs before the beasts came into the range of their arrows. Following that, he positioned his arrow and bent his bow. The arrow that he released was headed straight for the beast that was right in front. <em>Pop!&nbsp;</em>The arrow shot through the mouth of the beast and flew out from the back of its head, hitting the eyes of the beast behind. It was only then that the beast stopped.</p>
 <p>Guan Yue’s arrow drew first blood and hit quite a number of beasts. The Warriors that were positioned on the ‘walls’ followed along, forming the first wave of defense against these beasts. All these arrows were made by the old and frail of the Forgotten City that were not able to participate in the fight in the past few days. Although there were many of them that were using arrows for the first time, there were a lot of beasts and they need not worry that their shots would not be accurate. In addition, the strength of the Warriors were sufficient such that all their arrows were shot sharply. Even if the beasts that were shot did not die from the arrow, they would get trampled by the beasts behind them.</p>
 <p><em>Sss, sss, sss—</em></p>
 <p>Following the rain of arrows, the row of beasts that were running at the forefront quickly fell and were trampled upon by the beasts behind.</p>
 <p>After Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan solved the problem of the Giant Insect Beasts, they did not return to the ‘wall’ but instead remained with the troop of beasts that seemed to form a rug over the land and were searching amongst them.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan had to be within a hundred meters of the worm in order to sense it. This required him to move through the crowd of beasts. He did not know whether the worm did not come today or did it become smart. After searching through the entire throng of beasts, Rong Yuan still did not sense the worm.</p>
 <p>“The worm must be in the group of beasts. If not, it will not be able to control this group of beasts from so far away.”</p>
 <p>The group of beasts was extremely huge. If the worm sensed that Rong Yuan had done something to it and purposely avoided him, it would not be easy to find it. What they lacked now was time. For every second that passed, it meant the deaths of numerous people under the claws of the beasts.</p>
 <p>“This can’t do. Your motive is too obvious, let’s head back first.” Gu Lingzhi said as she flew next to Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan pursed his lips and nodded slightly.</p>
 <p>At one side of the base camp, the temporary wall was already crawling with beasts, especially the Insect Beasts. As they were small and in large numbers, they could easily follow and climb up the wall. However, their abilities were not as strong as the larger beasts. What made the people scared was the Bat Beasts.</p>
 <p>With wings, they did not need to fear the wall and could easily fly over it. Opening their sharp mouths, they spat out the mind attacks that could not be physically heard but created quite a lot of trouble.</p>
 <p>“This group of beasts are becoming smarter!” Looking at the Bat Beasts, Gu Lingzhi cursed as she saw that they were helping to carry smaller beasts over the ‘wall’.</p>
 <p>“Little Chancellor, have you both killed the Female Worm?” Guan Yue rushed to ask as he saw the two of them return. Receiving a negative reply, he paled.</p>
 <p>The reason why they agreed to train for ten days and face the Insects Beasts once again was because Rong Yuan said that he had a way to deal with the Female Worm. <em>But now he had not dealt with the worm.</em></p>
 <p>That’s right, there were so many beasts and the only one that could effectively deal with the Female Worm was Rong Yuan. With the enemy in the dark and Rong Yuan exposed, the Female Worm could easily avoid Rong Yuan whenever Rong Yuan neared and move in another direction.</p>
 <p>“Now what can we do? If we can’t find the worm, will we let it continue to control these beasts? We will not be able to last if we were to fight them head-to-head!” In his anxiousness, a hint of reproach could be heard in Guan Yue’s voice.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan massaged his forehead. This overlook was his fault. He did not expect the Female Worm to be so smart. However, he did have a back-up plan.</p>
 <p>“You have to calm the people first. I have other ways of finding the Female Worm.” Without caring how the expressions of the people around them had turned sour, Rong Yuan pulled Gu Lingzhi into the tent. Guan Yue was dumbfounded.<em>&nbsp;How was there time to still talk? Were they even treating this situation seriously?</em></p>
 <p>Before he could do anything rude, Rong Yuan appeared from the tent and called Bian Cheng, who was taking charge of a group, into the tent. In a short span of time, the three of them emerged from the room.</p>
 <p><em>Thankfully, they were not completely ignorant of what was going on now.</em></p>
 <p>In the time where he hesitated, he heard Gu Lingzhi declare, “Chancellor Guan, I need a group of troops to come out with me to the outside of the wall to kill the beasts.”</p>
 <p>“What?” <em>Move out of the base camp? Did he hear wrongly? With so many beasts, one step outside would mean getting drowned out by beasts. Who would dare to go with her? Guan Yue had heavy suspicions. Was Rong Yuan trying to find a way to escape now that he could not think of a way to find the offspring?</em></p>
 <p>Thinking that Guan Yue did not hear her clearly, Gu Lingzhi repeated herself once again. Guan Yue looked at her squarely, “Give me a good reason why I should do that.”</p>
 <p>The people that they were to bring out, were definitely not going to be able to return. Without a good enough reason, he would not let them have anyone.</p>
