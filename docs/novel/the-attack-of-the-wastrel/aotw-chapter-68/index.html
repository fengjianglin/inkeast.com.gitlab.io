 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Two days later, the Flower Hunt began.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Wunian City was usually quiet. However, with the Flower Hunt that occurred every three years, it suddenly bustled with life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Following a group of people from the Gu Clan, Gu Lingzhi made her way to the bottom of the Snow Mountain where the Palm Lotus grew. There were already many people waiting there - with a quick glance, there were an estimated number of ten thousand people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“I never thought that so many people would attend the Flower Hunt,” Gu Lingzhi gasped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Hearing her voice, Gu Linglong mocked, “You simply lack experience. The Yuli Snow Lotus is an extremely precious treasure that can change a person’s physique entirely. Even though the probability of finding it is extremely small, anyone who can afford to enter mountains will do it. After all, anyone who finds it will have a life-changing benefit.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Thank you for your reminder, younger sister,” Gu Lingzhi thanked Gu Linglong happily, seemingly not to be affected by Gu Linglong’s tone that was full of disdain. Gu Linglong, who was waiting for her to retort, had no choice but to hold back what she wanted to say.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As the short conversation between the two of them passed, the group reached the stairs at the base of the Snow Mountain. The other three main clans, the Qin Clan, Tianfeng Clan and Beicheng Clan had already reached and were waiting there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The lord of Wunian City stood at the entrance of the stairs as he briefed first-timers on what to take note of when they entered the mountain. Several youths were also listening to the instructions of the elders from their families.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Those who were too old to consume the Yuli Snow Lotus gathered in a nearby corner as they discussed which Clan would obtain the Palm Lotus this year.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“I think that Tianfeng Jin from the Tianfeng Clan is most likely to get it this year. After all, she is one of the few that has a placing on the Training tower’s Stone Tablet in the Royal School,” one of them said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“I think that Xi Hongru has a higher chance. I heard that he has been lucky since birth and despite being born to an average family, he is still able to rank second on the Stone Tablet. Who knows, maybe this year he will get the Yuli Snow Lotus,” someone else shared their thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“That may not be the case,” someone else interrupted, “He’s searching for it alone. I heard that the Beicheng Clan spent a huge sum of money this year to send all their servants who are of Martial Student ranks to help Beicheng Haoyue find the flower.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Hearing the discussion around him, a skinny old man hit the head of the young man in front of him as his eyes lit up in encouragement, “Do not mind what others are saying, I have faith in you. If not for your bout of sickness two years ago which delayed your enrollment to the school, the Stone Tablet would have your name too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The young man, who was around thirteen to fourteen years old nodded as he laughed, displaying two canines, “Yes grandfather, I will not let you down.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The discussion had changed its course - people were starting to pin their hopes on students from schools other than the Royal School as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">One of the students that stood out was Song Ze from the Langya School. It was rumoured that he had the ability to enter the Royal School but chose to attend the inferior Langya School. In his first year, he had actually defeated several senior students from his school. Even students that dropped out of the Royal School were no match for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Another popular contestant was a young girl from a small clan that did not attend any of the schools.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“If you ask me, everyone that you all mentioned are not the ones with the highest possibility of obtaining the Yuli,” a voice suddenly exclaimed, refuting everyone before him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Don’t you all think that… the First Mistress of the Gu Clan has the biggest chance?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Just as he said this, someone else sneered, “Are you talking about the First Mistress of the Gu Clan that just awoken her Spiritual Roots a few months back? You must be joking, I heard that she is only a level four Martial Student. She’ll probably struggle to reach the peak, how can she possibly obtain the flower?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“You’re wrong,” the one who had raised his opinions in the first place shook his head, “When she first awoken her Spiritual Roots, everyone believed that she wouldn’t amount to anything. Eventually, she was handpicked by the Third Prince to enter the Royal School. Putting aside her performance in school, her performance at the final examinations were spectacular. Who believed that she would survive after being attacked by the Carmine Python? She surprised everyone by killing the Carmine Python instead. If the people that you guys mentioned earlier have a good chance of obtaining the Yuli, then the First Mistress of the Gu Clan would certainly be the dark horse of this Flower Hunt!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The man that had previously sneered no longer had anything to refute.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">It was true that it had been difficult for people to accept the fact that Gu Lingzhi, who had been known as a wastrel, could suddenly awaken her Spiritual Roots. However, she had surprised everyone time and time again. Following this trajectory, it was completely plausible that she would obtain the Yuli Snow Lotus. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Everyone started to delve into deep thought.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">At the bottom of the Snow Mountain, Gu Lingzhi was completely oblivious to what was being discussed about her. As the Lord of Wunian City finished his briefing on all that was to be taken note of, the climb officially began.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Lord officially announced the start of the Flower Hunt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">A few participants immediately dashed out from the crowd. Those that had slower reactions did not want to show any weakness and in less than 15 minutes, the bottom of the mountain had completely emptied out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“What a bunch of idiots. Do they think that they can simply obtain the Yuli if they run faster?” Tianfeng Wei proceeded at a normal pace and thought nothing of those that rushed forth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">It was extremely difficult to find the Yuli - hence the name ‘Flower Hunt’. Every year, it grew in a different place. It could be found at the peak in one of the years and at the bottom of the mountain in the next.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Only those that were unfamiliar with the Flower Hunt would be hasty, thinking that rushing would give them a higher chance of finding it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Did you all bring the Communication Talisman I gave you? Split up once we get on the mountain and whoever finds the Yuli, find a place to hide it and contact me immediately. Whoever finds it will be rewarded well!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Yes, my Lady,” a group of servants chimed, following behind her. They recalled the numerous treasures and jewels that were shown to them just before they left and their eyes twinkled in excitement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">A similar scene played out amongst numerous clans. The Qin family was no exception. Behind Qin Xinran were eight servants that her clan provided to help her find the Palm Lotus. Behind Ye Fei were another twenty servants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">It was no doubt that the Ye family was the biggest conglomerate in the Xia Kingdom. Everything they did was extravagant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Where other families could only get a few people to help out, the Ye Family easily had twenty helpers. The cost to just ascend the mountain was equivalent to a ten-year income of an average family. This was not even taking into consideration the rewards given to everyone after the Palm Lotus was found.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After instructing their helpers to split up and find the Palm Lotus, Ye Fei and Qin Xinran searched together with Tianfeng Jin and Gu Lingzhi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“The place where the Yuli will appear is not fixed. It shall belong to whoever that spots it first,” Ye Fei stated her opinion happily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Gu Lingzhi, Qin Xinran and Tianfeng Jin nodded in agreement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Although it might seem that they had a lower chance of consuming the flower in a group than if they were to go alone, there were currently over ten thousand people searching for the Yuli in the Snow Mountain. There were no restrictions on fighting with others to steal the flower. In this Snow Mountain, there were several young masters and mistresses of high social status, as well as people who harboured evil intentions. Who would not consider such a possibility?</span></p>
