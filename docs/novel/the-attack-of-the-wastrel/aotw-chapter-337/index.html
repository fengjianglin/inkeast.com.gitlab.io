 <p><em>They were discovered so quickly!</em></p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi whispered a curse annoyedly and hurriedly used the Sparrow Wings movement technique. She flew like a bird in the wild, leaping lightly across the crowd.</p>
 <p>“Catch her!” The soldiers suddenly reacted and yelled while chasing after her. All of a sudden, a flash of light appeared in front of them and they felt as though they had landed in a quagmire for they were now unable to control their spiritual power. It was Gu Lingzhi’s realm – the legendary space-dimension realm! It had absorbed all their spiritual power.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Rong Yuan also released his own realm. By superimposing his realm with Gu Lingzhi’s, they had formed a kaleidoscope composed of countless small spaces. This created a distance between Gu Lingzhi and those in pursuit, as if they were separated by countless spaces, seemingly visible yet untouchable.</p>
 <p>As Rong Yuan had exerted a large amount of energy to use the domain, his face has now turned pale. The injuries sustained from the battle earlier were even worse now. When Gu Ligzhi had come to his aid, he did not refuse her help and ran away together.</p>
 <p>Based on the experience earlier, the golden flag was only able to influence the Inheritance Space when it was within a radius of ten meters. The space’s shortcomings had already been discovered by the North Qiu Kingdom. Unless it was a last resort, the two must not enter the space in front of the others or they would know where to wait for them.</p>
 <p>“Still thinking of running?” Just when the both of them were about to rush out of the siege, Pan Yue’er’s mocking voice appeared followed by an unmatched power, hitting the two like a turbulent flow. The small spaces in the domain were continuously broken and reorganised but was still unable to block off Pan Yue’er’s attack. The currents had pushed them back by more than ten meters before it stopped. The troops behind had also caught up at this moment and had formed a fan-shaped formation to trap them both. Those at the tail of the fan-shaped arrangement were the Demigods headed by Pan Yue’er.</p>
 <p>They hoped that Grand-aunt would not act on impulse and rushed out to save them. Gu Lingzhi secretly prayed that she had successfully escaped with Pan Yue.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, Gu Lingzhi’s worry did not occur. Perhaps she had heeded the words of the two for Rong Huashang did not rush out recklessly. While the soldiers were busy rushing towards them, she had already fled a distance with Pan Yue.</p>
 <p>Just as what Rong Yuan said, finding Lord Fashen was the only solution.</p>
 <p>The tide that struck the both of them had just receded but what greeted them next was an insane attack. Pan Yue’er did not care about the fact that they were both Martial Sages and gave her best at every shot.</p>
 <p>The two of them were already having a hard time blocking the blows and were buried by gravels when another Demigod joined in, setting dust all over the sky.</p>
 <p>Pan Yue’er took two steps back in disgust and waved off the dust in front of her before covering her nose. She commanded, “Leave the evil creature from the Spirit Tribe alive and kill off the other.”</p>
 <p>“Yes.” The Demigod that had summoned countless gravels responded before taking a few steps forward. His face was contained with excitement.</p>
 <p>It was Rong Yuan who was buried under the gravels, the one who was the most gifted in the world amongst the younger generation. Being able to personally destroy such a talent had not reduced his level of satisfaction despite having a weaker cultivation.</p>
 <p>Just when Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan had managed to clear and crawl out of the gravels, they came face to face with a blow dealt by Yuan Zhao. The blade was raised above Rong Yuan’s head and was just about to come slamming down.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi’s pupils shrunk and she subsciously went forward to block Rong Yuan from the attack. Yuan Zhao was startled and recalled how Pan Yue’er had ordered him to keep Gu Lingzhi alive. The long sword that was about to fall above Gu Lingzhi’s head turned abruptly and landed onto the ground beside them. Countless pieces of gravel were spattered all over the ground from the force of the sword. He then cursed, “Do you want to die? If not for the fact that you are still somewhat useful, this sword would have splitted you in half!”</p>
 <p>“You can try killing me.” Gu Lingzhi stood in front of Rong Yuan as she was certain that he would not dare to kill her for now. The hand behind her back went to put a Spiritual Medicine into Rong Yuan’s mouth to aid his healing.</p>
 <p>Yuan Zhao was so baffled that he could only laugh, “I have seen people who weren’t afraid of death but I have yet to see someone looking to die so eagerly. Don’t worry, when you are no longer useful, you will be able to reunite with him. Now…hand him over and I can still give him a quick death, or else…”</p>
 <p>“Or else what?” Rong Yuan’s cool voice came from behind Gu Lingzhi, “You are just a dog raised by the Pan Family, yet you still dare to be so smug?”</p>
 <p>“Ridiculous!” Yuan Zhao raged and pointed his long sword behind Gu Lingzhi, “You still dare to be so arrogant while hiding behind a woman’s back, look at me…eh?”</p>
 <p>Before Yuan Zhao could finish his sentence, he felt a strong fluctuation of spiritual power from behind Gu Lingzhi’s back. The pressure felt like that of a…Demigod?</p>
 <p>After coming to his senses on what was happening, Yuan Zhao’s face changed and he stared unbelievably at Gu Lingzhi, “You broke through?”</p>
 <p>What answered him was a sword of hidden intentions. Before his body could react, Rong Yuan’s sword penetrated his body causing thick golden spiritual energy to flow out of his body. The sword destroyed his internals recklessly causing his Elixir Field to be smashed into ashes almost instantly.</p>
 <p>“Demi…Demigod?” Gu Lingzhi watched everything in shock as she could not believe that Rong Yuan would actually breakthrough at this moment.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan smiled at her and blinked mischievously, “Isn't your husband great?”</p>
 <p>“Yes!” Gu Lingzhi nodded fiercely. Within the last hundred thousand years, only Rong Yuan had become a Demigod of less than a hundred years old.</p>
 <p>But now was not the right time for the two of them to celebrate as Pan Yue’er and a group of soldiers were eyeing them fiercely. While holding Gu Lingzhi tightly in his arms, Rong Yuan trotted momentarily before galloping away. This caused Pan Yue’er, who saw that the situation was not going well and took out the golden flag so as to lay the formation and trap them both, to be dumbfounded. It took her three full seconds to react and she spoke anxiously, “What are you all still doing? Go chase them!”</p>
 <p>But how could they possibly have caught up to Rong Yuan who has already ascended into a Demigod? Within an hour, the crowd had completely lost them.</p>
 <p>After shaking off the troops that were chasing them, Rong Yuan continued running for a distance while holding onto Gu Lingzhi. He only stopped when he was certain that there was no one following him. After putting Gu Lingzhi on the ground, he got on his knees and meditated, absorbing the spiritual power from the surrounding air.</p>
 <p>It was not an easy task for a Martial Sage to make a breakthrough and become a Demigod. Not only did one need to have an opportunity, he would also need to have sufficient spiritual power to support himself. After two days of constantly facing life and death, Rong Yuan developed a deeper understanding of the use and mastery of his spiritual power. The barrier that was originally blocking him for a long time, was finally loosened. He had planned to rest for a night before entering the Inheritance Space for the breakthrough. Who knew that Pan Yue’er would arrive so fast such that he had to undergo the breakthrough without any preparation. He struggled to escape for a distance with Gu Lingzhi and was almost at a point where he had exhausted all his energy. Every cell in his body was clamoring as they craved spiritual power for nourishment.</p>
 <p>If the cultivation of a Martial Sage was that of a small sapling, the cultivation of a Demigod would be that of a towering tree. Thus, the water used for small sapling would certainly be insufficient for a towering tree. And Rong Yuan was currently facing such an awkward situation now. There was a serious lack of spiritual power in his body such that his skin was revealing a greyish colour that symbolised a lack of “nutrition”. If he did not receive enough spiritual power for a period of time, Rong Yuan, who was the first Demigod in the past hundred thousand years to have ascended before reaching hundred years old, would starve to death because of this “malnutrition”.</p>
 <p>“Let me send you into the space.” Gu Lingzhi was quick to notice the problem and entered the Inheritance Space together with him after ensuring that there was nobody nearby.</p>
 <p><em>Splash</em>– She had thrown Rong Yuan into the Spiritual Essence Spring.</p>
 <p>The thick mist above the spiritual lake could be seen penetrating immediately into Rong Yuan’s body. In this world, there was no better treasure than the spring water to replenish one’s spiritual power. Even so, Rong Yuan had to absorb for an hour before awakening. He sighed with satisfaction before opening his eyes.</p>
 <p>“How do you feel? Better?” Gu Lingzhi had been sitting by the spring and was observing Rong Yuan’s situation the whole time. Once he opened his eyes, she went forward and asked worryingly.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan clenched his fists and felt his own strength. He looked up and gave her a gentle yet weary smile, “It’s so good that it can’t be any better.”</p>
 <p>One would not know how scary a Demigod was before ascending into one. Every vein in the body would become twice as wide as before. The vigorous spiritual power swam quickly in their veins, sweeping through the body over and over. He was confident that if he were to meet Pan Yue’er again, a battle would ensue.</p>
 <p>“That’s good!” Gu Lingzhi was sincerely happy for him, “You scared me just now. Rong Yuan might really have died if it were not for the spring water.</p>
 <p>Besides, Pan Yue’er had approached with confidence but did not anticipate such a change to happen. Not only did she fail to catch anyone, she had also lost half of her Demigods. This led Pan Yue’er, who wanted to redeem herself, to almost bite and broke off a silver tooth. After hesitating for a long time, she then reported the situation to Pan Luming while trembling.</p>
 <p>After hearing the report, Pan Luming was so angry that he almost kicked the bucket. He laid in the coffin made of Ten Thousand Years Spiritual Wood and took a few heavy breaths before screaming, “I have already told you that Gu Lingzhi is no ordinary person while the Third Prince of the Xia Kingdom should never be underestimated. You actually dared to bring such few Demigods to catch them. Is it because you had too many stable days such that your brains have become rusty?”</p>
 <p>“Chief Duke, please calm down.” Pan Yue’er swallowed her saliva while her old face was intensely tight. Her tight skin had actually made her look a lot younger.</p>
 <p>“Didn’t you say that Gu Lingzhi must not be harmed? We avoided using weapons which was why they could get away.”</p>
 <p>Pan Luming glared at her, “Was it my fault that you failed to catch them?”</p>
 <p>“No, I’m the one at fault.” Pan Yue’er said repeatedly. “It’s just that the Third Prince has already ascended into a Demigod, it will not be easy to catch them again.”</p>
 <p>“This is because you are too useless such that he was given the opportunity to ascend!” Pan Luming scolded even though he knew that these two matters have no correlation. He closed his eyes and thought for a while before speaking slowly, “Disregard Lord Fashen first and deploy all our men back. Let’s follow the Qiankun Flag and catch Gu Lingzhi before deciding our next move.”</p>
 <p>As long as they were to catch Gu Lingzhi, there was no use for Lord Fashen to escape back into the Alliance. Grandmaster could just bestow him a weapon stronger than the Life Whip. There was nothing for them to be afraid of.</p>
