<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>“No wonder Lingzhi does not like you. I am here to find Ye Fei.”</p>
 <p>Ye Fei whose name had been mentioned out of the blue felt wronged, “What has that got to do with me?”</p>
 <p>“It has everything to do with you,” Di Huan commented with a smile, “I want to woo you.”</p>
 <p>Qin Xinran spat out her tea.</p>
 <p>The sword that Tianfeng Jin had been holding on to dropped onto the ground. Everyone in the room looked at Di Huan in disbelief. After some time, Rong Yuan cracked a smile, “There is no happiness for a girl that gets together with another girl.”</p>
 <p>“What did you say?” Di Huan’s smile instantly dropped and was replaced with a furious expression.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan did not mind repeating it again for Di Yuan to hear, “There is no happiness for a girl that gets together with another girl, am I wrong?”</p>
 <p>“Scoundrel, I will fight you!” Di Huan exclaimed with fury before he slapped his palm against his waist which caused a weapon about half a meter to appear in his hands. He charged towards Rong Yuan.</p>
 <p>“Di Huan, if you openly attack a teacher in public, your points will be deducted!”</p>
 <p>“I don’t care!” Di Yuan was sick of being mocked for his appearance and Rong Yuan had done it in front of the girl that he had liked, there was no way he was going to let it slide.</p>
 <p>He lunged forward in one swift movement. Gu Lingzhi and everyone else immediately retreated to avoid being dragged into the conflict. However, before Di Huan’s blow could land on Rong Yuan, it was stopped by Yuan Zheng who blocked the hit easily with his sword. He looked at Di Yuan as if he was a mischievous child that had misbehaved.</p>
 <p>“Young Master Di, as a Martial Teacher, you are attacking someone who is about to become a Martial Sage. Are you sure you did not buy your way into becoming the seventh-ranked Martial Artist on the Golden List?”</p>
 <p>Di Huan clenched his teeth in anger, “If people could buy their way into the Golden List, then the Royal School should not even be operating anymore!”</p>
 <p>Di Huan readied himself to attack once again, even if he could not beat Rong Yuan, he would at least try to annoy him.</p>
 <p>To prevent damage to the hall in the hostel, Yuan Zheng had no choice but to knock Di Huan out in one blow, and sent his unconscious body to Ye Fei.</p>
 <p>“You, take care of him.”</p>
 <p><em>Why should she take care of him?&nbsp;</em>Looking at the shock on Ye Fei’s face, Gu Lingzhi reminded her, “Senior Di Huan said he came here for you.”</p>
 <p><em>It turns out that Ye Fei was the only person who should be responsible for Di Huan.</em></p>
 <p>The corner of Ye Fei’s lips twitched, before she looked at Qin Xinran and remarked, “Just throw him out.”</p>
 <p>The next moment, the unconscious Di Huan was thrown out of the hall by Qin Xinran as if he was a bag of trash. The impact with which he was thrown out made people realise just how strong Qin Xinran was even though she had a small stature.</p>
 <p>“Is his face injured?” <em>It seemed that his face was directly on the ground.</em></p>
 <p>“He’ll be fine, he might even thank you for leaving some scars on his face,” Rong Yuan remarked.</p>
 <p>“That’s good,” Gu Lingzhi turned around to look at the rest of the uninvited guests at her hostel… Rong Yuan, Yuan Zheng, Yan Liang, Lu Feng and Su Nian.</p>
 <p>“If there’s nothing else, shouldn’t you guys get going?”</p>
 <p><em>Was there even any meaning in going down to her hostel every day? Forget about Rong Yuan and Yan Liang, why is Su Nian still here? It was rather admirable that he had still come running to her hostel every day even under the pressure that Rong Yuan was exerting on him.</em></p>
 <p>“That’s right, I want to spend some more time with her, we don’t need any outsiders here,” Rong Yuan followed suit. Gu Lingzhi immediately retaliated, her eyes narrowed, “You should go too!”</p>
 <p>“How could you ask me to go too?” Rong Yuan whined, “It is completely normal for me to be here.”</p>
 <p>Yan Liang, who had been silently looking at Gu Lingzhi from a corner finally spoke up, “You both aren’t even married yet.” He stared at Gu Lingzhi, his eyes looked like he had a lot to say, yet he did not say a single word. He also looked slightly nervous – nervous that Gu Lingzhi would also kick him out.</p>
 <p>Although Lu Feng knew that his friend was not good at expressing himself in words, he did not know the extent of it. <em>In the battlefield of love, how could one win merely by staring at someone?&nbsp;</em>Thinking back to the day when Yan Liang had rushed off to find Gu Lingzhi and threw out a phrase saying “I like you”, after which he just stood there without talking, Lu Feng worried greatly for his friend.</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan gritted his teeth silently as he looked at Yan Liang. Even though Yan Liang did not talk a lot, whenever he spoke up, it had hit Rong Yuan’s sore spot. The most important thing was that his eyes had never left Gu Lingzhi the moment he entered the room. He had let Lu Feng do all the talking while all this time he just stared at Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>The fact that Yan Liang was General Yan Feitian’s son meant that Rong Yuan could not be too harsh on him. However, if he were to be soft on Yan Liang like today, Yan Liang would always be a thorn in his eye.</p>
 <p>“Su Nian, why don’t you go back first?” Gu Lingzhi had no choice but to convince Su Nian to go back home first, seeing that there was no way she could convince the other two boys to go back any time soon.</p>
 <p>She did not think that Su Nian would be determined not to leave. “I’m not leaving, I want to protect you!” There was anger in Su Nian’s eyes as he said that and he looked at Rong Yuan, “If we all leave, who knows what this scoundrel will do to you?”</p>
 <p>The corner of Rong Yuan’s lips twitched. <em>In everyone’s eyes, did he really look like someone without morals?</em></p>
 <p>“That’s right, who knows what you will do to Lingzhi when we leave,” Lu Feng added. He shoved Yan Liang’s back, hinting him to say something as well.</p>
 <p>“…I agree with what Su Nian had said earlier,” Yan Liang looked down. Lu Feng could not help but roll his eyes at what his friend had said.</p>
 <p>“You’re beyond saving.”</p>
 <p>Yan Liang looked at his friend suspiciously, “I’m not injured.”</p>
 <p>Lu Feng was speechless, almost questioning his friend’s intelligence.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi’s head started to ache as she looked at Yan Liang. He had seemed so innocent that it was hard for her to ever chase him off.</p>
 <p>“If you guys aren’t leaving, I will!” Gu Lingzhi announced. She had wanted to practice making weapons today, but she decided to enjoy some peace at the Alchemy Tower instead.</p>
 <p>The moment she stepped out of the door, she received an unexpected guest.</p>
 <p>“Beicheng… Haoyue?”</p>
 <p>There was a cold aura that radiated off her. <em>Who else could it be if it was not the most talented alchemist Beicheng Haoyue?</em></p>
