 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">With the question Gu Lingzhi had posed, Lin Yue-er was suddenly flustered and hesitated for a while before smiling, "That is, of course. Should Lingzhi wish to practice, I will personally make the decision to gift an Eclipse Horse to you and send it along with your sister's horse."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Although Lin Yue-er said all this, she was quite confident that Gu Lingzhi would never be able to show any aptitude for Spiritual Roots. She was very confident of the medicine that she had brought from her hometown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Oh, is that so?" Gu Lingzhi asked once again. Once she received confirmation from Lin Yue-er, Gu Lingzhi turned to Gu Rong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Under Gu Lingzhi's gaze, Gu Rong felt a tinge of guilt. Waving his hand, he said, "Let's go along with what your stepmother said, if you manage to demonstrate any Spiritual Roots, I will arrange for you to have an Eclipse Horse."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">A smile lit up on Gu Lingzhi's face as she retreated to the side without a sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Rong Yuan retracted his gaze and gestured towards the back. After waiting for his personal guard, Yuan Zheng, to bend down, the corner of his mouth turned up as he asked, "Do you want to make a bet? Let's bet to see whether the wastrel First Mistress of the Gu Family will be able to demonstrate any Spiritual Roots?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Yuan Zheng looked at his master silently and felt that he already knew the outcome even without watching. Years ago, when she was first tested for Spiritual Roots, it was already determined that she had no fate of becoming a Martial Artist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Since you are not saying anything, I will take it as you having agreed." Rong Yuan raised his brows as he drummed his fingers on the table, smiling all the while, "I will bet that Gu Lingzhi will be able to show spiritual aptitude. How about we bet on the spiritual green stone that you obtained a while back?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Once again, Yuan Zheng gawked at his master.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">His master was getting more and more bold, even eyeing the things that his subordinates owned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Before waiting for Yuan Zheng to come up with an excuse, Rong Yuan proceeded without a care, "Since you did not object, I will take it as you’ve agreed."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Rong Yuan acted all caring as he patted Yuan Zheng's arm. "Rest assured, I will not let you lose out. If you win, I will give you the Earth gem that we obtained from the previous place."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Yuan Zheng's expression changed.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The Earth gem was an extremely rare material for weapon creation, and far superior than my spiritual green stone. How could my master bear to take it out and use it as a bet? Or rather, would my master bet on something that he had no confidence of winning?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Yuan Zheng thought about his spiritual green stone. If he knew this would happen, he would have incorporated it into his sword already, so as to not let it be desired by his master.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">After a long and complicated ceremony, the clan ceremony entered into the most important event, the aptitude test.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The Gu <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Family</span> had definitely earned its title as one of the five biggest clans in the Xia Dynasty. Just counting the children below ten years of age, intending to test for Spiritual Roots, already brought the numbers up to a few thousand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Initially, it was relatively easy for Martial Artists to train. However, it becomes increasingly difficult to break through to a higher level. In the entire Tianyuan Continent, the number of True God level Martial Artists could be counted on one hand. Furthermore, there were only around 20 Demi-god rank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">At the age of 14, Gu Linglong was already a Level 5 Martial Student with an astounding aptitude. It was not without reason that Gu Rong doted on her so dearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Linglong, surrounded by several bodyguards, turned and headed towards the stone tablet that was used to test a student’s Martial level. Looking at her coldly, Gu Lingzhi then turned to the other side where the stone tablet testing for Spiritual Roots lay.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Rong subconsciously frowned at Gu Lingzhi’s actions as they caused him to lose face. Everyone knew that if one had the aptitude for Spiritual Roots, they would have been able to test it by the age of ten. If they still did not show any signs of Spiritual Roots by the age of twelve, it simply meant that the child had no chance of ever becoming a Martial Artist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Rong recalled the previous times when Gu Lingzhi had gone up to test for Spiritual Roots and the mocking looks he had received from his own opposing clan members when she returned. Gu Rong immediately called for his subordinate. He wanted Gu Lingzhi removed so he would not have to lose face in front of the Third Prince.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">However, before he could give any instructions, the glamorously-dressed young man spoke in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"I have never seen anyone successfully tested for Spiritual Roots past the age of twelve. I wonder if I will have the honor of witnessing that today." Rong Yuan seemed to smile as he looked at Gu Rong, "Leader Gu, what do you think?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"The fact that it could catch your attention is the honor of Lingzhi. However, your subject's daughter is slightly foolish. I fear I will let your hopes down, Third Prince."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Rong Yuan laughed, looking lethargic yet proud, "The results are not out yet, does Leader Gu lack confidence in your own daughter?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Rong laughed awkwardly, knowing that he could no longer get rid of Gu Lingzhi, he had no choice but to go along and say, "Like your subject has said, if that really happens, it is her fortune accumulated from three generations."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Since Gu Lingzhi was walking toward the queue to test for Spiritual Roots, she was certainly not aware of this little scene, as she was only able to concentrate on withstanding the mocking looks and the gazes of pity that she received from around her. In their hearts, none of them believed that Gu Lingzhi would be able to test for Spiritual Roots aptitude at her age.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The test for Spiritual Roots was simply just placing both hands on the stone tablet in the middle of the yard. If the stone tablet senses Spiritual Roots and the aptitude for one to become a Martial artist, it will then give off a glow corresponding to the type of Spiritual Roots that one has.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Lingzhi silently looked at the direction of the stone tablet. Everytime the stone glowed, the child tested for his or her talent would cry out in happiness. Their parents and friends standing outside the yard would also be happy beyond belief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">However, if the stone tablet had no reaction, it would be a huge shock to the candidate and their relatives outside the yard would also be very disappointed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">One step to climb to heaven, one to fall to the ground!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">This was the difference between a Martial Artist and a commoner on the Tianyuan Continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">As time trickled by, the number of children queueing in front of Gu Lingzhi shrank. Out of every ten children tested, there would be one or two that would possess Spiritual Roots. With this result, the officer standing beside the stone tablet seemed very pleased.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">These children that possessed the potential to become Martial Artists were the pillar stones of the Gu Clan. However, when the officer saw Gu Lingzhi in the queue, his eyes flashed with disdain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">It is just a wastrel born from a dirty woman, she’s already tried so many times yet still has skin thick enough to fight for a spot among the children. She should really look at the position she is in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">As the result of each test was very quickly obtained, it was soon Gu Lingzhi's turn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">In her previous life, no matter how many times she pleaded and hoped, the stone had never lit up for her. Looking at it now, Gu Lingzhi's eyes were filled with an unknown depth and conflicting feelings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Just as she took a deep breath and prepared to place her hands on the stone tablet, excited screams could be heard from the stone tablet used to test for Martial student levels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"Oh bless, Miss Linglong has already become a Level Six Martial student? Isn't she only 14 years old?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">"At this speed of training, even compared to the devilishly talented students from the Royal school, she would be considered of higher aptitude."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">A series of surprised shrieks resounded from across the room. Gu Lingzhi leaned her head only to see Gu Linglong's proud and pejorative expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Gu Linglong was definitely doing this to entertain herself...</span></p>
