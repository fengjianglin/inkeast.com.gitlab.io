 <p>Two days later, Rong Yuan and Gu Lingzhi followed the Langya Troop back to the Forgotten City.</p>
 <p>While spiritual energy was sparse in the Lost Lands, it had a large area. The space under Endless Sea Realm was the entire area of the Lost Lands. From the Luochuan Town to Forgotten City was a half a month’s journey even on the fastest Dragon Horse.</p>
 <p>When others were around them, the two did not head into Inheritance Space to cultivate. They sat on the Dragon Horse carriage and took in the sights around them. The carriage was very spacious and aside from Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan, four other Langya Troop members could squeeze into it.</p>
 <p>Perhaps due to the fact that the entire world was blue in color, the demon beasts in the Lost Lands were also blue in color. The Dragon Horse that ferried them to Forgotten City was a wildebeest that had a deep blue color fur.</p>
 <p>When she was tired of sightseeing, Gu Lingzhi shifted her attention to the book in her hands. In bright bold words, ‘Physical Body Cultivation Manual’ was written on the cover of the book.</p>
 <p>This book was given to her by Lu Heng before they left and it explained how physical body cultivation worked in the Lost Lands. When the two made contributions to the troop in the future, they would be rewarded for these achievements with manuals that explained stronger techniques.</p>
 <p>“Interesting, the Lost Lands has a special technique that helps one train the physical body.” Gu Lingzhi smiled to herself as she read the book.</p>
 <p>“Of course. Otherwise we would have died from hunger in the Lost Lands a long time ago.” Lu Heng proudly proclaimed.</p>
 <p>Although spiritual energy was sparse in the Lost Lands formed under the Endless Sea Realm, it brought about opportunities as well. Blue Crystals were items that helped a Warrior train his body. While it could not be taken in like spiritual energy, it was effective for physical body cultivation. It was a deep blue color like the color of the Endless Sea Realm.</p>
 <p><em>Du, du, du, du.</em></p>
 <p>The sound of horse hooves hitting the ground clamoured along as the Dragon Horse trotted along. All of a sudden, silver arrow heads appeared in the view in front of the group.</p>
 <p>“I knew they would not let us off!” Lu Heng cursed as he jumped out of the carriage. In a second, everyone jumped off their carriages and armed themselves with their weapons.</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi and Rong Yuan were just about to head off the carriage to take a look at the scene when they heard Lu Heng’s voice, “Don’t come off the carriage. Their objective is to drain you off your spiritual energy. You cannot fall for their tricks.”</p>
 <p>The two were stunned momentarily but against Lu Heng’s command, they jumped off the carriage and stared at the men outside.</p>
 <p>Outside the carriage, a wondrous sight greeted them. A sea of silver- and bronze-colored bodies held bronze and silver swords. These were Warriors had undergone physical cultivation of their bodies.</p>
 <p>The color of the skin of the Warriors showed their cultivation ranks.</p>
 <p>To their surprise, Lu Heng was a Gold Class Warrior although he looked young. Many people who had shared the same carriage as them had silver-colored skin. When the bodies of the Warriors collided, metallic clangs would reverberate through the air. At the same time, tiny sparks flew as the Warriors readied themselves and their bodies changed color.</p>
 <p>“Young brat, you cannot protect them. Let me take them away. If I am happy, I might just give you a piece of the cake.” Bao Wenhao, a Gold Class Warrior that confronted Lu Heng, smirked.</p>
 <p>Lu Heng scoffed, “Dream on! The Langya Troop will not betray our members!”</p>
 <p>He increased the intensity of his attacks as he spoke. Lu Heng could become the second-in-command in the Langya Troop not only because of his relationship with the captain, but based on his own skills. Previously he had been powerless against Tao Yi because Tao Yi was a cultivation rank higher than him, whereby Tao Yi was an Amethyst Class Warrior. At the same time, the palm strike had happened in the blink of an eye and Lu Heng did not have time to react.</p>
 <p>“Don’t blame me for being merciless since you turned down my offer.” Bao Wenhao narrowed his eyes as his expression darkened. He stretched his fingers out in a claw-like manner and suddenly, his fingers extended to three feet long. He fiercely struck it at Lu Heng’s chest</p>
 <p>Lu Heng jumped in surprise but he stomped down hard on his right foot and jumped into the air, successfully avoiding the claw.</p>
 <p>However, Bao Wenhao had played a trick. His real target was Gu Lingzhi!</p>
 <p>From what Tao Yi reported the previous day, the man had a strong cultivation rank but the lady hid behind the man and she seemed to be a gold digger. As long as she could be captured, the man would naturally follow along.</p>
 <p>Bao Wenhao’s actions were fast and before Lu Heng could turn back, he closed down on Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, he was wrong. The lady that hid behind the man was no damsel in distress but a strong fighter that lived through all kinds of hardships.</p>
 <p>In the moment his golden palm was about to hit Gu Lingzhi, a bright light flashed through his eyes and a sharp spiritual sword blocked his way. It was the Fengwu Sword.</p>
 <p>A loud metallic clang rang through the air as the Fengwu Sword drew across the sky and swiftly struck down on Bao Wenhao’s arm. As the arm was sliced off Bao Wenhao’s body, the golden color of his skin returned to its original pale color and a stream of blood shot out.</p>
 <p>Bao Wenhao was stunned for a few seconds before he screamed, “My arm!”</p>
 <p>Gu Lingzhi calmly withdrew her sword and smiled, “So the arm returns back to its original state once it is separated from the body.”</p>
 <p>Rong Yuan ruffled her hair and cooed, “It is alright. The next time you can take down his head and have a closer look.”</p>
 <p>Standing at his spot afar, Lu Heng gaped at Gu Lingzhi. Was that a Martial Artist? She had casually taken down her enemy in such a smooth way without having her muscles bulged up like a bodybuilder. No wonder after so many years, there were still people in the Lost Lands who wanted to return to the Tianyuan Continent. The couple were both very strong.</p>
 <p>It was a pity that this would be up to Lu Heng’s imagination.</p>
 <p>As he thought of this, Lu Heng sighed sadly before he instructed, “Leave the rest to me. You should try not to take action in case…”</p>
 <p>Before Lu Heng could finish, Gu Lingzhi took the next move. Her petite body flew through the air gracefully and with hateful eyes, she slammed her arm down on Bao Wenhao’s chest.</p>
 <p>“Asshole!” Bao Wenhao shouted in rage as golden light glimmered from his body. His remaining hand curled into a fist and he brought it up towards Gu Lingzhi.</p>
 <p>He thought that Gu Lingzhi’s petite body was supported by her spiritual energy and he underestimated the strength of her fist since it did not change color like his.</p>
 <p>“Bam!” In the next instant, Bao Wenhao realized the consequences of underestimating his opponent. As Gu Lingzhi brought down her arm onto Bao Wenhao’s chest, he was thrown backward from the momentum. Blood spewed out his mouth and he was a complete mess.</p>
 <p><em>How could that be? How could her tiny hand muster up so much strength?</em> He was a renowned Gold Class Warrior, how could he be defeated so easily? Bao Wenhao was not the only one surprised by what happened. Everyone in the vicinity gaped blankly at Gu Lingzhi’s strength.</p>
 <p>They thought that the beautiful lady that appeared weak and frail could not do anything, but she defeated Bao Wenhao in the blink of an eye. Without hesitation, Gu Lingzhi brought her feet down on Bao Wenhao’s chest in a triumphant way.</p>
 <p><em>Boom!</em></p>
 <p>Bao Wenhao’s body was ruthlessly stomped down by Gu Lingzhi’s leg and he sunk a few feet into the ground. This showed others how much force was in that blow.</p>
 <p>Before anyone could react, Gu Lingzhi went for the other assassins and took them down at lightning speed. Only gasps could be heard as she flew and zipped through the air and struck down her enemies one by one.</p>
 <p>The Amethyst Class Warrior that fought against Lu Yuan shifted his fear-filled eyes and took in the plight of his members. Without wasting another second, he threw an object down to the ground before he took off.</p>
 <p>Smoke filled the air quickly and the Tanlang Troop members took off. Gu Lingzhi’s sudden display of power shocked not only her enemies but her allies as well and she gained a newfound respect among the group. Once the group collected the spoils and items off their enemies, they set off on their way again.</p>
 <p>The sudden ambush had a completely unexpected outcome.</p>
 <p>With all eyes trained on her, Gu Lingzhi chuckled slightly, “I am not used to using my physical body to fight and I might not have controlled my strength properly.”</p>
 <p>If that was Gu Lingzhi in an uncomfortable battle, then what was she like when she fought properly?</p>
 <p>Many people stared at Gu Lingzhi’s beautiful but calm face before they turned to the calm Rong Yuan beside her. They fell into deep thought.</p>
 <p><em>Gu Lingzhi alone was so powerful. What about Rong Yuan?</em></p>
 <p>If a Gold Class Warrior stood no chance against Gu Lingzhi, what about an Amethyst Class or even a Glaze Class Warrior?</p>
 <p><em>Many dismissed that thought.</em></p>
 <p>Living men had arrived from the outside world before but these men became ordinary men once their spiritual energy was exhausted. The strongest person could at most fight against Gold Class Warriors. If Gu Lingzhi could take on a Gold Class Warrior so easily, what about Amethyst Class and Glaze Class Warriors?</p>
 <p>The club members tried to convince themselves. Rong Yuan pulled Gu Lingzhi into his arms and massaged her muscles. Softly, he said, “Don’t worry, I heard that there are a few Amethyst Class Warriors and even a Glaze Class Warrior in the Forgotten City. I will just capture them for you so that you can train against them and get used to using your physical strength.”</p>
