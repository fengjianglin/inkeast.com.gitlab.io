<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>The Black Dragon Mountain was considered a volcanic belt. Within the mountains, there were many concealed hot springs. Although the space wasn’t big, for someone like Lin Shan, it was a saviour for her soul. For someone who was used to living in the modern world, not bathing on a regular basis was a nightmare.</p>
 <p>Actually, Lian Feng found out from his subordinates that Lin Shan had been looking for a place to bath days ago.. However, since he had been busy with work, he only had time to search for a place whenever he was walking up the mountain.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, he found a place. Yet, he didn’t realize Lin Shan’s desire to bath was so strong that she started stripping in front of him the moment they arrived.</p>
 <p>The steam from the hot spring was overbearing, and Lian Feng felt his cheeks heat up. He unnaturally tried to turn away.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan was undressing at a super speed. She took off her outer garment and inner garment. She was about to go further when she abruptly realized that Lian Feng was still next to her. Lin Shan bashfully whimpered: “Umm.. how about you…”</p>
 <p>“I’m going to wait outside and guard for you.” Lian Feng bluntly replied. He didn’t allow her to finish her sentence as he quickly rushed out without taking a look back.</p>
 <p>Poor Lin Shan was left alone to stare blankly. A few moments later, she mumbled in his direction: “I was going to ask you if you wanted to bathe together! Why are you so flustered? It’s not like you haven’t seen me naked before…..” She knew Lian Feng had changed her clothes while she was unconscious.</p>
 <p>The temperature of the hot spring was very high, and within a few moments, Lin Shan’s face had turned bright red. All her muscles relaxed and her arteries and veins were flowing very smoothly. Lin Shan felt awesome.</p>
 <p>At that moment, as the MC from the future, Lin Shan felt like she had to sing her “bath song” — “I love to take a bath! My mood is great! La la la la la!!!!!”</p>
 <p>In her opinion, the scientific law of the future is that: The female MC will sing a song from the future, and the male MC will hear it. It will shock the male MC and from then on, he will love the female MC even more…till death do us part!</p>
 <p>When she thought about this, Lin Shan sang even louder and more cheerfully. Infinite amount of birds were startled.</p>
 <p>As for Lian Feng, he was standing behind a rock. All he could think about was Lin Shan taking off her clothes. He recalled seeing her delicate white neck, being separated by the steamy smoke from the hot spring.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t help but imagined the unlimited scene beyond the clothes….at that moment, he felt his body heat up. It seemed like the heat was heading to a specific area of his body. Lian Feng tightened his fists as he attempted to control himself.</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, he heard Lin Shan’s out of tune voice. It sounded like ghosts wailing or wolves howling. Instantly, it was as if Lian Feng had taken a sedative; the lust he felt in his body was extinguished.</p>
 <p>Wow, what an awful voice. She’s ruining my scenery!</p>
 <p>Lin Shan was still singing. She sang so loudly that she was about to lose her voice. However, in her mind, this would be a classic scene in novels!</p>
 <p>Perhaps my song isn’t intense enough? Not a problem. I have another one!</p>
 <p>“Oh oh oh OHHHHHH… oh oh oh OHHHHHHHH!” The song from the World Cup! That must be intense enough!?</p>
 <p>From the outside, the meditating Lian Feng’s mouth twitched.</p>
 <p>He suddenly had an urge to become a monk.</p>
 <p>From history until now, Lin Shan was probably the only person whose voice could cause a person to clear his heart and lose desire. She was truly one of a kind.</p>
 <p>Just when Lian Feng felt like he was being tortured by Lin Shan’s voice, her voice unexpectedly stopped.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan’s voice was horrible and she was causing Lian Feng distress. However, Lian Feng didn’t expect her to suddenly stop. He was curious and tried to listen more closely; yet he couldn’t hear any activity.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng was worried. Lin Shan was not the type to stay quiet. How could she suddenly be so quiet? Could she have gotten into an accident? He started to feel anxious and called her name.</p>
 <p>There was no reply.</p>
 <p>At that moment, his heart felt very unstable and he couldn’t wait any longer as he rushed back to the hot spring.</p>
 <p>It was a captivating sight. The dense steam from the hot spring was rising as it enveloped around the petite figure that was lying on a rock. Lin Shan was totally naked as her black hair spilled out like black ink on her fair tender shoulders.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan’s arm was motionless as she laid her upper body on the rock. It looked like she fell asleep.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng felt a rush of heat from his body going straight into his brain; it was so intense that he could feel his cold mask turning warm.</p>
 <p>Shouldn’t she know she could faint from being in a hot spring for too long? How could she fall asleep? Lian Feng felt a bit hopeless. He clenched his teeth as he tried to subdue the warm flow that was running through his body. Lian Feng walked over to her.</p>
 <p>Currently, Lin Shan was in such a deep sleep that the sky could collapse and she wouldn’t even know. We cannot blame her though. The reason why she was like this was because of the poisonous flowers from the Black Moon Gang.</p>
 <p>Although Lin Shan didn’t know martial arts, she did inhale quite a bit. At the time, symptoms didn’t show. But the hot temperature from the hot spring had activated the poison.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Lin Shan had fallen into a deep slumber. She was totally oblivious to her surroundings.</p>
 <p>There was a saying that goes “Things appear more beautiful from a distance”. It was very true. From behind the rock, Lian Feng felt Lin Shan was as alluring as a goddess. He almost lost his cool.</p>
 <p>However, when he got closer, he noticed his goddess was snoring with her mouth half opened and drooling at the same time. Lian Feng didn’t know whether he should laugh or cry.</p>
 <p>How could there be a woman who didn’t give a damn about her image? Yet, because Lin Shan was the way she was, it made her so adorable. She was full of surprises and energy.</p>
 <p>Without knowing, her presence made Lian Feng’s heart stir.</p>
 <p>“Song Luo!” Lian Feng bent down as he called her.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan didn’t move. She continued sleeping as if nothing had happened.</p>
 <p>“The Sun is about to set. If you don’t wake up now, we can’t leave the mountains.” Lian Feng tried again.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan didn’t budge.</p>
 <p>Finally, Lian Feng used his trump card: “If we don’t leave the mountains, there will be no dinner.”</p>
 <p>Logically, this sentence should have woken Lin Shan up regardless of how deep her sleep was. But it was strange because it didn’t work today. Lin Shan was sleeping too soundly, as if she would never wake up….</p>
 <p>This thought flashed through Lian Feng’s mind and he instantly realized something was wrong. He reached out his hand as he nudged Lin Shan. He kept calling her name but still had no response.</p>
 <p>Then, he checked her pulse.</p>
 <p>Oh my goodness! Lian Feng was afraid. He was now aware that Lin Shan wasn’t simply snoozing.</p>
 <p>Since it was a critical moment, Lian Feng wasn’t able to take too many things in consideration. With two hands, he effortlessly pulled Lin Shan out of the hot spring.</p>
 <p>This huge commotion still did not wake Lin Shan. Her wet body was soft and weak. The moment she was ashore, her body tumbled into Lian Feng’s arms.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan’s soft body was red from the steam. She looked like a very delicious meal. However, Lian Feng didn’t have the mood to think of that stuff right now. He draped Lin Shan’s clothes on her &nbsp;back as he gathered all his internal energy in the hollow of his palms. He had his palms on her back as he started to transfer energy to her.</p>
 <p>This was an extremely challenging mental process. A few seconds could feel like forever when you were watching the woman you love remain unconscious.</p>
 <p>After the internal energy had circulated once around Lin Shan’s body, there was finally some movement. Lin Shan’s finger slightly moved and she started mumbling something.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng immediately stopped his transfer and embraced Lin Shan. He kept yelling her name: “Song Luo! Song Luo!”</p>
