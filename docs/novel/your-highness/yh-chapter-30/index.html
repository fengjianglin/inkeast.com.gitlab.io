 <p>While Lin Shan was being upset over her identity, there were also three men who were suffering in the Palace.</p>
 <p>First, the third Prince, Du Jing. His plan would have worked if it weren’t for Lin Shan. All of his plans were destroyed by her. Originally, he would have easily gotten the Heaven stone. Now that someone else has it, how could he be alright?</p>
 <p>“Master, according to your subordinate’s research, Song Luo has the Heaven stone. However, since the Princess has heavy security, if we were to go and grab it, we will probably…..”</p>
 <p>“I know.” Du Jing cuts her off. “I’ll think of a way to get to Song Luo. Go and report your mission first.”</p>
 <p>“Your subordinate accepts your order.” With a blink of an eye, Gui Mei disappeared into the night.</p>
 <p>At the same time, in the East Palace, Du Hao was also feeling frustrated with Lin Shan’s situation.</p>
 <p>“Gu Zuo”</p>
 <p>“Your subordinate is here.”</p>
 <p>“Have you done the research I told you to do?”</p>
 <p>“Your Highness, ever since we came back, your subordinate has gotten many to search for the lady that you have mentioned. However, we haven’t heard anything back. I have a feeling she might have left the Capital.”</p>
 <p>“No. Keep searching.”</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Gu Zuo accepted the order but remained where he was.</p>
 <p>“Is there anything else?” Du Hao looked at him.</p>
 <p>“There’s something your subordinate wishes to say, but isn’t sure if he should.”</p>
 <p>“Say it.”</p>
 <p>“Based on my opinion, it has been two years since your Highness last saw the lady. Even if she is still in the Capital, she is most likely married. Your subordinate is confused as to why you would want to find her so badly….”</p>
 <p>“Say no more!” Du Hao cuts him off. “I know what I am doing. Just do what you’re told. Leave now.”</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Gu Zuo knows Du Hao’s temper and decided to say no more and courteously left. As he walked out, his face revealed a hopeless expression. This Crown Prince was not the same as the wise and cool headed Crown Prince he had always known.</p>
 <p>Then again, how would Gu Zuo know what Du Hao is really feeling?</p>
 <p>Two years ago, he was just twenty years old. Based on talent, EQ, IQ, he was definitely far from his elder brother Du Ye. Therefore, many Imperial officials had issues about his position as the Crown Prince. Although he was the son of the Empress, they doubted his abilities to become the future Emperor.</p>
 <p>Therefore, the Emperor decided to send him to fight the enemy in order to calm the situation. It was a great way for him to train his willpower, as well as increase his reputation in the Palace. In addition, the Emperor also sent Du Ye away in fears that they would destroy each other in the future.</p>
 <p>At the time, Du Hao was a spoiled prince who had never been through hardship. When he heard his father’s decision. He was so upset he wanted to run away from home. That was when he met the woman who he fell in love with.</p>
 <p>That glance helped him endure the two years of army life. He was young back then. It was the first time he had experienced such a stunning beauty. The harsh life of the military made the lady even more unforgettable in his mind.</p>
 <p>Two years had gone by, and he had grown up. He had returned in armour and with triumph. He was about to experience the most glorious days of his life, and had forgotten about those hard days, when Song Luo appeared and created a ripple in his heart. It was something that none of the other concubines were able to do.</p>
 <p>As someone who had always viewed himself to be highly, he suddenly realized he had feelings towards a man. It wasn’t surprising that Gu Zuo thought he lost his cool. It could not be helped.</p>
 <p>While Du Hao was having a conflicted battle within his heart, another man with the same face (Lian Feng) was also in distress.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan’s clothes were changed by him. That day, if he didn’t do it, someone else might have found out the secret. The result would have been inconceivable.</p>
 <p>Although many days had past, the naked body of a woman remained in his mind. Lian Feng felt extremely guilty. He didn’t know how to face Lin Shan.</p>
 <p>According to his subordinates, Song Luo had already returned back to the Palace yesterday. She was healing quite well. He felt relieved but at the same time, his heart was very conflicted. Knowing Song Luo, within a day or two, she will hunt him down and question him. If Song Luo knew that he knew her secret, as well as damaged her purity, what would she think? Would she still talk to him?</p>
 <p>As he was feeling troubled, the Emperor sent an Imperial edict and ordered him to eliminate mountain thieves that were on the increase nearby the Capital. He was told to set off immediately with no delay.</p>
 <p>Therefore, when Lin Shan came looking for Lian Feng, she was told he had gone to fight crime.</p>
 <p>-------</p>
 <p>Ever since the treasure hunt contest, Lin Shan’s popularity had skyrocketed. Many nobles and high ranked officials wanted to get on her good side. This was comforting to her since her spirit had been damaged from the Heaven stone.</p>
 <p>“Prince Consort, a few days ago, Imperial Uncle Liu sent a jade Buddha and the Sixth Prince sent a golden Buddha hand. The sale resulted in a thousand silver taels. These are in banknotes. You can count it.” Xiao Lu handed Lin Shan a pile of banknotes.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan took the banknotes and her eyes shone. She recounted the amount a couple of times before putting the banknotes inside the embroidered box where she kept all her secret money.</p>
 <p>Xiao Lu watched from the side and couldn’t help but blurted: “Prince Consort. Please do not mind your servant. But in the Palace, we never have to worry about food or clothes. Why do you need to have so much money?”</p>
 <p>“You don’t understand.” Lin Shan put away her secret box and lowered her voice: “You think I’m really going to remain as a man in the Palace forever? Eventually, my disguise will be revealed. I have to plan an escape route.”</p>
 <p>“Are you saying you’re going to leave the Palace?” Xiao Lu looked at Lin Shan shockingly.</p>
