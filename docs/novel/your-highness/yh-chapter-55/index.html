 <p>Lin Shan didn’t notice the change in Du Hao’s gazes. Currently, she was too focused on eating the yummy dishes in front of her. She had bits of pastry powder stuck on her lips and she extended her tongue to lick it. She smiled with satisfaction as she reached out to take a second piece.</p>
 <p>“There’s more.” Du Hao suddenly spoke up without thinking.</p>
 <p>Huh? Lin Shan looked curiously at him.</p>
 <p>“There.” Du Hao pointed to the corner of her mouth.</p>
 <p>Ohhh! Lin Shan extended her tongue again. She caught the pastry powder into her tongue and enjoyed the savory taste. Hence, she continued to lick happily….until Du Hao’s finger touched the corner of her mouth. He wanted to get rid of the remaining bits.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan was caught off guard. Her tongue ended up licking Du Hao’s finger instead. At that moment, they were both shocked.</p>
 <p>Du Hao’s finger lingered on her mouth and his eyes deepened. It was as if there was something that wanted to pop out from his heart. He had always been the type that did whatever he wanted. He only thought about it for half a second, then he made his move.</p>
 <p>The finger that was on Lin Shan’s mouth slid down to her cheek and onto her chin. He lifted her chin and using another hand, he grabbed onto her nape.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan felt a strong force hurling her forward. The next moment, her lips were firmly seized.</p>
 <p>Du Hao’s kiss was much more experienced compared to Lian Feng’s. He lightly sucked her lips, and used his tongue to explore. The tip of his tongue was pressing against her pearly white teeth.</p>
 <p>If Du Hao was less demanding, Lin Shan would probably still have been in a confused state. Just when she was about to pry open her mouth and accept the fiery kiss, she realized the one kissing her was Du Hao!</p>
 <p>Therefore, she immediately rebelled and shoved Du Hao.</p>
 <p>Since Du Hao was already in the moment, he wasn’t going to let this opportunity go. Although Lin Shan was rejecting him, he didn’t care. He used more force to make Lin Shan remain tightly in his embrace. However, that did not stop Lin Shan from fighting back. She refused to open her mouth no matter what.</p>
 <p>Du Hao was starting to become frustrated. He decided to use one hand to pinch her cheeks together. There was no way Lin Shan could keep her mouth closed if he did that.</p>
 <p>But the next moment, Lin Shan ruthlessly bit his lips.</p>
 <p>Du Hao tasted blood and felt pain. He backed off and before he knew what was happening, Lin Shan slapped him. Although she didn’t slap him very hard, this was the first time anyone had ever slapped him in his twenty something years. Therefore, it left a very profound impression. He froze.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan had already gotten up from her seat. Her eyes were brimming with tears. She violently pushed Du Hao and said: “I hate you!” This was the first time she said a word for many days. As a result, although her voice was husky, it was filled with hatred.</p>
 <p>Right after, Lin Shan turned around and ran out of the room in tears.</p>
 <p>-------</p>
 <p>Lin Shan ran back and hid in her room right after the incident.</p>
 <p>Although she seemed carefree and random, she was very serious when it came to relationships. She hated to be forced into doing something she didn’t want. She despised Du Hao for not respecting her.</p>
 <p>Love isn’t something that belonged to you just because you have power. You think you can dominate everything simply because you have authority? No!</p>
 <p>After all, Lin Shan had been a modern person for twenty years. Her modern mindset was deeply rooted. Not only did Du Hao’s kiss failed to get to her comply, it evoked a lot of negative emotions.</p>
 <p>F*** you, Crown Prince! Lin Shan slammed the table. She wiped the tear stains off her face and yelled at herself: “Why the f*** are you crying? He has already kissed you. Are you going to chop off your mouth? Instead of crying, figure out a way to escape!”</p>
 <p>That’s correct! There’s no way I’m staying here anymore. I’m leaving now!</p>
 <p>At that moment, Lin Shan had made up her mind. She quickly lifted her mood and started packing her belongings.</p>
 <p>By now, the sky was totally dark. Although the possibility of Du Hao coming was slim, the two Imperial guards were still guarding her room. Escaping will not be an easy task.</p>
 <p>However, that wasn’t going to stop Lin Shan. If she can’t leave through the door, she will climb out from the windows. As long as she could escape from the Crown Prince, she would even dig through a dog hole!</p>
 <p>Lin Shan had suffered through a traumatic experience and did not care anymore. She packed up everything and waited in the room. When the Imperial bodyguards were switching shifts, it would be her opportunity to leave.</p>
 <p>Outside the window was a garden. Currently, there were no guards patrolling because they were switching shifts. This was the optimal time to escape. Lin Shan was betting on the fact that she was tiny. Therefore, she was able to easily slip out from the window. After swiftly looking around her surroundings, she decided to follow the walls and headed north.</p>
 <p>Honestly, Lin Shan was quite sensitive to her surroundings. By following the walls of the garden, there were many items for her to hid behind whenever she came across the guards. She managed to stay undetected due to her alertness.</p>
 <p>By now, she was near the lotus pond from this morning. There was a huge tree by the wall.</p>
 <p>Actually, Lin Shan noticed this tree earlier today. It was big and close enough to the wall. If she climbed on the tree, she could probably flip herself over the wall. Once she was outside the wall, it would no longer be part of the Crown Prince’s residence. She would be free.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan lifted her sleeves and started to climb.</p>
 <p>This was not the first time Lin Shan climbed onto a tree. Her first time was at school. That day, she was late for class. Therefore, she tried to enter from the back by climbing onto a big tree as she flipped herself over the wall. However, the moment she landed, the Principal was standing right behind her.</p>
 <p>The Principal laughed at her in a mocking manner and said: “Student. Your skills are quite good. Are you interested in performing during morning practice?”</p>
 <p>Of course, that was all in the past. Elementary school was a long time ago, but her climbing skills were still sharp.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan skillfully leaped from the tree branch onto the wall. However, she didn’t realize that the wall from the Ancient times were made of different materials. Instead of stepping onto the flat surface of a modern wall, she stepped onto the wall tile. Her feet slipped and she tumbled down.</p>
 <p>But at this crucial moment, someone strong suddenly caught her. Lin Shan only saw the sky spun. By the time she realized what had happened, she was in the air and a familiar scent went up her nose. It smelt like….</p>
 <p>It was as if something was jabbing her heart. She widen her eyes and saw the crescent moon above the head. Underneath the hazy moonlight was a silver mask. The moonlight made it look extra unique.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng?</p>
 <p>Lin Shan thought she was dreaming. She pinched herself and felt pain. However, she still didn’t believe it. She reached out to touch Lian Feng’s face.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng felt a bit awkward by Lin Shan’s boldness and lightly placed her down. After hesitating for a slight moment, he reached out to fix her messy hair.</p>
 <p>When his fingers touched her forehead, it felt warm and familiar. Lin Shan finally accepted that Lian Feng was in front of her. Her nose tingled and she flung her body against his and hugged him tightly.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng was stiff because he didn’t expect such a reaction. His heart felt touched because he could sense the warmth and the trust from Lin Shan. He calmly patted her twice on the back and quietly said: “Don’t worry. I’m here.”</p>
 <p>But Lin Shan hugged him even tighter. Her face was still against his chest. He began to hear soft sounds of weeping.</p>
 <p>She was crying? Lian Feng was shocked. He quickly held onto her two shoulders and pulled her into an embrace: “What’s wrong?”</p>
 <p>Lin Shan inhaled and wiped away her tears. She pulled onto Lian Feng’s hand and said: “Take me away. I want to leave this place.”</p>
