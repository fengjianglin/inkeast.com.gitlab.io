 <p>Lian Feng’s words caused Wang Hei Hu’s facial expression to change. Lin Shan could tell things were heading down the wrong direction. She quickly spoke up: “We can talk it over! Talk it over!” She awkwardly smiled at Lian Feng and said, “Just let me return. I’ve been living with them for half a month now. The brothers treat me well. They’re not bad people. Don’t worry about me!”</p>
 <p>“No means no!” Lian Feng coldly replied. His mind was set as he firmly held onto her hand and wouldn’t let go.</p>
 <p>“Hey, what’s wrong with your brain? I already said it’s fine!” Lin Shan was annoyed. “Look at you, you’re hurt! You still want to fight with them? You’re not going to have an advantage anyway! So why don’t you just let me go back? If Big bro Wang eats his words, he will never be able to find a wife, ok?”</p>
 <p>Wang Hei Hu’s mouth twitched as he stiffly nodded.</p>
 <p>“See? Big bro Wang is thirty five years old and he has the courage to make such a cruel pledge. It’ll be fine.” Lin Shan consoled Lian Feng.</p>
 <p>At this moment, there was just a tiny bit of sunset left. The sky was filling up with stars, and the gorgeous night was reflecting off Lin Shan’s watery eyes. The sight caused Lian Feng’s heart to soften.</p>
 <p>“Fine.” He nodded. However, he still wouldn’t release her hand. “But I’m coming with you.”</p>
 <p>Since Lian Feng was so persistent, Wang Hei Hu decided to let him have his way and allowed Lian Feng to come up the mountains with them.</p>
 <p>However, Lian Feng’s subordinate Yang Xin was very worried.</p>
 <p>“Superior, this is extremely dangerous. Please do not allow a woman to ruin our duties!”</p>
 <p>“I know what I’m doing. Do not worry, I’ll take responsibility for whatever happens.” Lian Feng replied. Then he looked at Lin Shan and said: “Let’s go!” He didn’t hesitate at all as he went up the mountain.</p>
 <p>Yang Xin shook his head from below as he lightly sighed: “A beauty can destroy us all… a beauty can destroy us all…..”</p>
 <p>Anyhow, Lin Shan was feeling extremely uncomfortable at this moment. Honestly, she would feel less nervous if she had just gone back with He Lao San and the others. For some reason, now that Lian Feng was by her side, she felt very tense.</p>
 <p>The moment Lian Feng saw her, she could tell he had recognized her immediately. How could he recognize her so quickly from a glance?</p>
 <p>There could only be one explanation. He must have known she was a woman early on.</p>
 <p>This caused Lin Shan to think back to the Du Hao incident. That day, Lian Feng must have been the person who helped her changed clothes. Thinking of this, she turned scarlet.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng was following Lin Shan when she suddenly stopped and turned around to glare at him. He was confused, but he noticed her flushed cheeks as they made eye contact.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng couldn’t help but noticed how cute Lin Shan looked as a woman. He felt helpless as he didn’t know how to react.</p>
 <p>This slight moment caught the eyes of He Lao San and he was super jealous. That f**ker. How dare he try to send love signals along the way? He simply didn’t care about my existence? Thus, he rushed ahead and eagerly said to Lin Shan: “Dear, the mountainous roads are not easy to walk on. Please watch out.”</p>
 <p>Umm, my body had already been seen by someone! Watch? Watch your ass! Lin Shan didn’t say a word but gave him a death stare as she ran up, leaving poor Lao San by himself. Once again, his self esteem was shaken. Then, he turned and grabbed hold of Lian Feng, who was trying to avoid contact with him.</p>
 <p>“I’m telling you, don’t you dare hit on my woman! Or else…”</p>
 <p>“Get out of my way.” Lian Feng icily responded. He used his internal strength and pushed He Lao San’s hand off himself. Lian Feng didn’t take another glance at him as he followed Lin Shan.</p>
 <p>Poor He Lao San. It was as if his self esteem had evaporated. Yet, Wang Hei Hu wouldn’t let him fight back: “Big bro…..” he whined.</p>
 <p>“Bro what?” This is a crucial time. Don’t allow a woman to cause trouble for us!” Wang Hei Hu yelled as he walked away.</p>
 <p>Behind him, a bunch of the brothers took turns patting He Lao San on the back:</p>
 <p>“Second boss, don’t be too sad. That guy looks better than you with a mask on. Just accept it and move on.”</p>
 <p>“Second boss, put the fan in a safe spot. I’m sure it will be useful in the future.”</p>
 <p>“Second boss. You should be more like big boss. He’s thirty five and not in a rush. Why are you rushing?”</p>
 <p>Wang Hei Hu heard them from the front, and almost fell flat on his face.</p>
 <p>By the time they got back to the campsite, the sky was totally black. Although Wang Hei Hu had poor upbringing, he was an honest man and kept his word. He also treated Lian Feng very politely.</p>
 <p>“Superior. We brothers do not live as well as you Generals. Tonight, I will have to trouble you to stay in my room. Tomorrow morning, after we have our discussion, I will personally send you both down the mountains.”</p>
 <p>“Big boss, thank you. But tonight, I’m staying with her.” Lian Feng replied as he looked at Lin Shan.</p>
 <p>What? Lin Shan was appalled: “Y-you you… why are you staying with me? I need to sleep!”</p>
 <p>She thought about how Lian Feng changed her, and her two cheeks turned pink.</p>
 <p>Wang Hei Hu felt awkward: “Superior, logically you can sleep anywhere you want. But you and Miss Song….”</p>
 <p>“No need to say anymore. It has been decided.” Lian Feng cuts him off. Before Lin Shan could object, he grabbed her by her hand and led her up the stairs.</p>
 <p>“Hey! Big bro, you can’t let them….” He Lao San was furious and about to rush up with his blade, but he was blocked by Wang Hei Hu.</p>
 <p>“What are you doing? Put the blade down!”</p>
 <p>“Big brother!” He Lao San was so anxious, he wanted to cry, “C-can’t you see that Lin Shan is unwilling?”</p>
 <p>“Willing or not, it’s not up to you! This is call flirting! The little Miss likes her man bossy and controlling. Unlike you. You turn red just looking at her! Plus, you stutter so much. What kind of woman would want to marry you!?”</p>
 <p>“Oh….!” The brothers exclaimed as they all seemed to be enlightened.</p>
 <p>So this was what flirting is like! Big Brother sure had lots of experience. He didn’t waste his thirty five years after all!</p>
 <p>“Let go! I’m telling you to let go!” Lin Shan had known Lian Feng for a while now, but she had never seen this side of him. She was irked because he refused to let go. Therefore, Lin Shan threw herself on him as she bit his hand.</p>
 <p>She didn’t bite lightly. Bloody veins were visible, but Lian Feng seemed to disregard it. He still refused to let go.</p>
 <p>Finally, Lin Shan gave up as she whined: “Lian big brother. Lian Superior. Lian big boss. Please let go?? My hand is about to break off….”</p>
 <p>Before she could complete her sentence, Lian Feng miraculously let go as he turned around to look at her.</p>
 <p>As Lin Shan was massaging her wrist, she was cursing. Suddenly, she felt a glance and she lifted her head to see Lian Feng openly staring at her. It looked as if he was trying to see right through her.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan felt a bit guilty and her facial expression was stiff. She pointed up ahead and said: “My room is that way!” Then, while Lian Feng was slightly distracted, she ran towards the door to get herself in.</p>
 <p>Before she could close the door, a hand stopped her. Her bitten teeth marks were still visible, and Lin Shan felt even more guilty. Next thing she knew, the door was flung opened and Lian Feng walked right in.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan was shocked, and she took a couple steps back. She wanted to run but she was too slow. Lian Feng seized her by the collar and using hardly any strength, he easily pulled her towards him.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan felt her waist tighten as her body spun in the air. Behind the entrance, she was firmly pressed onto the ground.</p>
 <p>Since the floor hadn’t been fixed in years, it made a creaking sound. Lin Shan felt a scorching heat within reach. Lian Feng’s two long legs were inching closer, and she was entirely covered by his shadow.</p>
 <p>The silver mask looked very cold in this unlit room. It was exactly the opposite of his fiery eyes. There was a distinct contrast.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Lin Shan thought to herself: This old grandma is going to give herself to you. If you dare to kiss me, I’ll let you have me!</p>
 <p>With a giddy heart, she shut her eyes.</p>
