 <p>A few moments later, a person walked out from behind the fake mountain. The misty moonlight was shining on both their faces. Aside from their facial expression, they looked exactly the same. One of them looked calm, while the other looked grave.</p>
 <p>“You saw us?” Before Du Hao said a word, Lian Feng voiced.</p>
 <p>“If you purposely wanted me to see, why are you asking, Lian Superior. No! I should call you brother, shouldn’t I?” Du Hao’s complexion was cold, and there was a hint of hatred in his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Your Highness, there is no need to make a big deal. You should be very clear about my intentions.” Lian Feng calmly stated.</p>
 <p>“That may not necessarily be true. Why don’t you state it openly?”</p>
 <p>Lian Feng looked at Du Hao in the eye: “I want to do an exchange with you. I’ll give you the world in exchange for a person.”</p>
 <p>——-</p>
 <p>The moonlight was covered by the clouds again. Lin Shan looked out the window and mumbled: “So many clouds. It’s probably going to rain tomorrow….”</p>
 <p>Xiao Lu yawned and murmured: “Master, go to bed. Even if it rains tomorrow, you will be in the Palace. Why are you worried?”</p>
 <p>“What do you know!?” Lin Shan rolled her eyes at Xiao Lu as she turned over to continue looking at the sky. A few moments later, Xiao Lu had fallen asleep again. Soon, the whole room was filled with her snoring. Xiao Lu snored like a pig and it was driving Lin Shan nuts.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan threw a pillow at Xiao Lu, but Xiao Lu grabbed it and started rubbing her saliva all over it.</p>
 <p>Poor Lin Shan had no pillow to sleep on now. Therefore, she decided not to sleep. She got onto her stomach and rested her face on both her hands as she thought about her first encounter with Lian Feng. As she thought about all their moments together, she couldn’t help but grin like a fool. She spent the entire night grinning foolishly. If Xiao Lu had seen her, she would probably have been terrified.</p>
 <p>By the time all the snapshots of their moments have appeared in her mind, it was morning. Lin Shan didn’t sleep the entire night. Yet, surprisingly, she felt very awake. She decided to bid Lian Feng goodbye at the Palace gate. Although he had insisted her not to go, as a woman from the modern world, why would she submit to his authority?</p>
 <p>Lin Shan rolled herself off the bed and conveniently dragged Xiao Lu with her. However, Xiao Lu was still in a drowsy state. She looked like a ghost who had died unjustly. On their way out, many servants were frightened by her face.</p>
 <p>At this time, the gloomy sky had started drizzling and made the early morning slightly chilly. Xiao Lu sneezed and became more awake. She hurried over to cover Lin Shan with her umbrella as she complained: “Master, why are we up so early? There’s barely anyone out here!”</p>
 <p>“What do you know?” Lin Shan mumbled as she continued heading towards the Palace gate.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know. I don’t know.. you always say I don’t know…” Xiao Lu muttered. “Actually, I do know! You want the owner of the golden sabre. You want his sabre and his body. You are so corrupted!”</p>
 <p>Lin Shan nearly tripped. She looked at Xiao Lu resentfully: This little punk is too mainstream! You’re from the modern world, aren’t you?</p>
 <p>Xiao Lu blushed: “Master. Don’t look at me like that. It makes me shy….”</p>
 <p>“….” Lin Shan almost spat out blood.</p>
 <p>The two of them continued to tease each other back and forth. Finally, they arrived at the palace gate. By now, the Sun had just came up. As expected, there was already a team present. Since finding the antidote was an urgent matter, Lian Feng didn’t bring a lot of people with him. They weren’t bring a lot with them either because they plan to hurry back.</p>
 <p>Xiao Lu had sharp eyes and pointed out from amongst the group: “Master, I see him. He’s over there!”</p>
 <p>“Shhh. Lower your voice!” Lin Shan quickly grabbed Xiao Lu and pulled her behind a sculpture.</p>
 <p>Xiao Lu didn’t understand: “Master. You’re already here. Why are you afraid to let him see you? Oh, I know! You’re shy!!”</p>
 <p>“Shy your sister!” Lin Shan flicked Xiao Lu on the forehead.</p>
 <p>Last night, she personally said she wasn’t coming. If Lian Feng saw her going back on her words, she would lose face. Therefore, she definitely didn’t want him to notice her!</p>
 <p>Currently, all the horses and people were ready. Lian Feng stood in front of them. His tall and straight figure looked very bold in this drizzly weather.</p>
 <p>Wow, how can a man look so good? The more Lin Shan looked, the more excited she became. Honestly, she wanted to run towards him and leap into his arms.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Du Hao arrived. Surprisingly, he had no one with him. But he was in formal attires and looked extremely intimidating. Aside from Lian Feng, everyone knelt down. However, Lian Feng only nodded. He did not show any signs of fear.</p>
 <p>“Woah! Lian Superior looks so manly!” Xiao Lu looked smitten.</p>
 <p>Of course….wait a second! Are you checking out my man? You don’t want to live anymore, eh? Lin Shan gave Xiao Lu the death glare and Xiao Lu quickly altered her words: “Your servant meant to say, the Crown Prince is so manly!”</p>
 <p>Are you implying that my man is less manly? Lin Shan’s eyes darkened.</p>
 <p>Xiao Lu realized she said something wrong again and immediately changed the subject: “Look! They’re leaving!”</p>
 <p>Lin Shan turned her attention towards the palace gate again. They were ready. Lian Feng leaped onto Wu Ying and Wu Ying neighed. The Palace was surrounded by the echoes of horses as the gates opened up. “Set off!” Lian Feng commanded.</p>
 <p>The rest of the guards followed, and soon, there was only Du Hao left. He looked deep in thought as he watched them depart. He remained in the same position until the gates closed.</p>
 <p>It suddenly started to rain harder. Lin Shan felt very cold and empty. She wasn’t sure if the reason was because Lian Feng left, or the rain: “Let’s go.” She looked at Xiao Lu. But instead, she noticed Xiao Lu looking fearfully in front of her. Lin Shan was curious and turned around.</p>
 <p>She was astonished because Du Hao had directed his glance towards them. He clearly saw them as they made eye contact.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan noticed Du Hao’s stare was a bit different today. It looked extremely dignified and cold. It was the type of look that would cause someone to be mentally stressed. It reminded her of their first encounter; making it impossible for her to lightly greet him.</p>
 <p>Umm… I just woke up early to say farewell. I didn’t break any rules, right? Why are you looking at me like that? There are no words on my face… ai ya! Please, stop looking at me! You’re making my heart tremble!!</p>
 <p>“Master, the Crown Prince doesn’t have an umbrella.” Xiao Lu noted.</p>
 <p>Oh, true! He must want our umbrella! Although it was raining harder, she rushed Xiao Lu: “Go! Bring the umbrella to the Crown Prince!”</p>
 <p>I’m begging you. Take the umbrella and leave. My glass heart cannot handle the way you’re staring at me!</p>
 <p>“Huh?” Xiao Lu looked like she wanted to cry: “Master, do I have to go?” Clearly, her impression of Du Hao was quite bad.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan looked annoyed: “Are you telling me to go instead?” Then she lifted her head: What? Where did he go?&nbsp; It turned out that while they were talking, Du Hao had already left. Only his rear view could be seen from a distance. It gradually disappeared from sight.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Lin Shan had another strange feeling. It was as if….she would never see Du Hao again. Lin Shan was shocked by her pessimistic thought and quickly snapped out of it. She called Xiao Lu and was about to leave when another voice stopped her.</p>
 <p>“Prince Consort sure wakes up early.”</p>
