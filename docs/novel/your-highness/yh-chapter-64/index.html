<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Lin Shan was shocked. She could see Lian Feng smiling ever so slightly. Despite being covered by a mask, she could still feel the power of the smile. In this world, Lian Feng had the coldest mask but he gave her the warmest feeling. She suddenly felt touched in an indescribable way.</p>
 <p>Was this happiness? Her nose tingled and her eyes turned red.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng didn’t expect Lin Shan to tear up in front of him. He felt helpless. At this moment, Lin Shan reached out to try to take his mask off.</p>
 <p>Years of practice made him automatically take a couple steps back.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan’s hand paused half way. She looked slightly uncomfortable: “Don’t misunderstand… I suddenly just really wanted to see your face….”</p>
 <p>It was true. When he smiled at her, her heart felt like it was being lifted. Lian Feng was definitely not suitable for this cold mask. Why must he have to hide all his emotions? In her eyes, there was only one Lian Feng. Even if a person had a face that looked like his, he wouldn’t be able to replace Lian Feng’s special place within her heart.</p>
 <p>They made eye contact and Lian Feng was touched by Lin Shan’s sincerity. Perhaps he was too used to wearing the mask and never considered his partner’s feelings. It must be unpleasant for Lin Shan to kiss and hug a man with a mask all the time. He was being unfair to her.</p>
 <p>Now that Lian Feng wasn’t backing away anymore, Lin Shan bravely proceeded forward. She carefully reached out her hand and her fingers gently touched the mask. Oddly enough, her hands were somewhat shaky. It wasn’t like she had never seen his face before, but for some reason she was nervous. She was worried she would upset Lian Feng by accident.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng didn’t move. He watched and allowed Lin Shan to touch his mask. She was about to slowly take it off.</p>
 <p>At that crucial moment, Lian Feng heard a conversation heading their way. Lian Feng quickly pulled Lin Shan into his arms and covered her mouth as they crouched down.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan’s hand was still on his mask when he suddenly pulled her in. She was stunned as she stared at Lian Feng in astonishment. Lian Feng did a “don’t you dare make a sound” gesture as he pointed towards his ear.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan was bright enough to realize that Lian Feng wanted her to listen. Therefore, she became silent. In no time, she heard an argument entering her ears. It was getting closer and clearer by the second.</p>
 <p>“Are you done with your tantrums, woman? Watch me smack you!”</p>
 <p>“How dare you be rude to the Princess? I’m going to chop off your dick!”</p>
 <p>“Why wouldn’t I dare? If you have the ability, then try! You bad tempered woman! You only know how to talk big… Mother!!! You’re biting me again! I’m going to beat you up!”</p>
 <p>“Wah! Bullying a defenceless woman. You asshole! You have no shame! Beat me! Beat me to death! Poor me. I have a bad life. It led me to you. Wah…..” She wailed.</p>
 <p>“Aiii.. don’t cry! I’m an asshole! I don’t have shame. Please, I’m begging you. Stop crying!” He pleaded.</p>
 <p>“Wah…..!!”</p>
 <p>“Don’t cry! How about I cook you a roasted pig?”</p>
 <p>“Wah! I don’t want a roasted pig! I want a roasted rabbit!”</p>
 <p>“Okay okay.. Roasted rabbit it is….”</p>
 <p>That voice clearly belonged to Du Ming Yue! Lin Shan felt a mixture of joy and anger. She felt joy because Du Ming Yue was finally found! But also anger because she had gone through so much mental stress, yet this woman here still had the option to choose between a roasted pig or rabbit. That was ridiculous and unacceptable!</p>
 <p>Lin Shan was boiling. She was about to rush out to seize her target when Lian Feng stopped her.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng gave her a “keep calm, don’t get excited” look. At the same time, he firmly grasped his sabre as he focused straight ahead. He was literally like a leopard waiting for its pray.</p>
 <p>While they were waiting, a big and small figure entered their field of view. The moment Lin Shan saw them, she almost shrieked.</p>
 <p>What the hell!? Isn’t that He Lao San? Why is the mountain thief with Du Ming Yue? Did he miss his old job and decided to go into the Palace to kidnap someone again?</p>
 <p>While Lin Shan was being confused, Lian Feng had already drew out his sabre and dashed out.</p>
 <p>He Lao San didn’t expect a person to pop out from the middle of the forest. He was shocked. When he took a closer look, his soul nearly flew away.</p>
 <p>Why is it that mask guy again? Last time, he took my future wife away. This time, he wants to take this angry woman too?? He’s not giving me a place to live!</p>
 <p>He Lao San was sharp and didn’t take out his weapon. Instead, he promptly picked up Du Ming Yue and ran.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan was stunned. Are you freaking kidding me? He must be born from the year of the rabbit. Although he looks as bulky as a bear, he runs faster than a rabbit!</p>
 <p>Du Ming Yue was almost out of sight. Lin Shan finally reacted and decided to break into a run.</p>
 <p>“Just stay here!” Lian Feng immediately stopped her. He leaped into the air and headed towards He Lao San’s direction. Within a few seconds, he was gone.</p>
 <p>Since Lin Shan had no martial arts abilities, she could only be obedient and listen to Lian Feng. she stayed where she was and prayed that Lian Feng will bring Du Ming Yue back. If not, she was doomed.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, although Lian Feng’s flying abilities were around the same level as He Lao San’s, he wasn’t as familiar with the forest. Remember, He Lao San had lived here as a mountain thief for over a decade. He recognized the entire mountain; every grass and every tree. Running away was definitely an easy task for him.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng chased for half a day but still couldn’t find He Lao San. He wanted to continue searching, but the Sun was starting to set. The black forest couldn’t be compared to the Capital. Once the Sun sets, beasts will come out. Lin Shan was alone, so it was quite dangerous for her. Thinking of this, Lian Feng decided to return and find Lin Shan.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Lin Shan was currently panicking under a tree. The sky was getting darker and darker, and the light around the forest was getting dimmer and dimmer. All the plants around her were starting to be wrapped in darkness. Yet, Lian Feng was still nowhere to be seen.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan was scared as she held onto Wu Ying’s reins. She started to count.</p>
 <p>After counting to a hundred, Lian Feng appeared.</p>
 <p>The moment she saw Lian Feng, Lin Shan rushed towards him: “Did you find them?”</p>
 <p>Lian Feng shook his head.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan’s mood hit rock bottom. Did the Heavens really want her to die? It was like a duck that had already reached one’s lips running away. She had clearly almost completed her mission, but Du Ming Yue got away!</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. He Lao San might have ran off, but now that we know he’s the one who kidnapped the Princess, we will get him.” Lian Feng consoled.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan remained depressed: “But we’re not going to be able to find them by tomorrow. The Emperor is definitely not going to let my family go. What are we going to do… what are we going to do….”</p>
 <p>“Don’t be like this. There might still be hope….” Lian Feng wanted to comfort her. Suddenly, shining fireworks lit up the air. That was a signal from their search teams.</p>
 <p>Could they have located Du Ming Yue? Once again, hope flared within Lin Shan’s heart. She looked into Lian Feng’s eyes and both of them decided to head back to meet up with the teams.</p>
 <p>Surprisingly, the signal wasn’t because of Du Ming Yue. Instead, it was a messenger from the Palace. The Emperor was critically ill!</p>
 <p>The Emperor was critically ill? What? That was too sudden! Initially, Lin Shan didn’t believe it. It wasn’t until they got back to the Palace and witnessed the chaotic scenes amongst the Imperial physicians did they realized the Emperor was actually severely sick.</p>
 <p>But then again, how did the Emperor get so sick out of nowhere? Right before she left the Palace, the Emperor had summoned her and shrieked at her. At the time, he didn’t seem sick at all. Could something fishy be going on?</p>
 <p>Despite the doubt in Lin Shan’s heart, she was also relieved because the Emperor was too sick to deal with anything. All searches were temporarily stopped.</p>
 <p>According to Xiao Lu, the Emperor’s illness came very suddenly. He got sick the night they left the Capital. By the next day, he didn’t even have the strength to walk. His condition continued to worsen and by yesterday, the Emperor had fallen into a coma.</p>
 <p>Hearing Xiao Lu’s words, Lin Shan had mixed feelings. On one hand, she was happy because now her father wouldn’t have to be banished. On the other hand, she was concerned because the Emperor was Lian Feng’s dad. If something actually happened to him, Lian Feng would suffer emotionally.</p>
 <p>In addition, Lin Shan had a very strange feeling towards the Emperor’s illness. Perhaps there was some sort of conspiracy going on. Anything was possible. Danger usually strikes at the most unexpected times. Being a bit cautious couldn’t be a bad thing.</p>
