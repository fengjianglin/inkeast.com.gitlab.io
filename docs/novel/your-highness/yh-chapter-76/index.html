 <p style="margin-left: 20px;"><em>Ji Yunshu was an outstanding anthropologist who was transmigrated into the body of a mistreated young girl. To survive in her new circumstances, she could only rely on her wits and the knowledge she had accumulated in her...</em></p>

<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan was stunned by the man and the dog. She immediately shrank back like a quail as she mumbled to herself: You are not interested in beautiful women nor men. What do you like then? At this moment, her glance landed on the fierce dog. She froze.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Woah, bro. Your taste is too strong!</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">The way Lin Shan looked at the man caused him to feel goose bumps all over his body. He yelled: “Song Luo!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan was about to say something, when the dog barked in response. Then, the dog obediently went back to its corner.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan was flabbergasted. It took her a while to react. But when she finally did, she looked super pissed: Are you kidding me? You named your dog that? Couldn’t you at least find a decent looking one? Oh my goodness! This one is a tragic sight. A tragic sight, I tell you!</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Just as Lin Shan was steaming from anger, the man suddenly smiled cunningly at her: “Miss Song, are you hungry?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">This smile caused Lin Shan’s danger radar to beep. Despite being very hungry, she refused like an honourable woman: “Not hungry!” But at that moment, her stomach started to growl. The sound was so loud, it drowned her voice.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan was so embarrassed that she looked down and pretended to be dead (not literally).</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“I’ll let you eat if you want.” The man lightly laughed and waved his sleeve. Somehow, the thick rope that was around Lin Shan’s wrists came loose. Lin Shan rubbed her sore wrists as she stared oddly at the man.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“Eat. Aren’t you hungry?” A bowl of red braised pork was pushed in front of Lin Shan. It had just the right amount of fat on it. The sweet aroma went up her nose and caused Lin Shan to feel a strong craving.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Usually, under these type of circumstances, Lin Shan would think to herself, “I’m going to die regardless I eat or not. So why don’t I just eat and fill my stomach first?” But for some strange reason, this time, her mind decided to casually ask: “Did you add poison to it?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“Of course.” The man actually nodded. He looked at her expectedly.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan’s chopsticks froze in mid air as she gawked at the man. Her face looked troubled: Bro, are you toying with me? If there’s poison, why are you telling me? If you tell me, do you think I would eat it?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“You’re toying with me, aren’t you?” Lin Shan said with a stiff face.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“I told you there’s poison in the meat, yet you think I’m toying with you. What if I told you, there’s poison in the wine, and all the dishes? Even the seat you’re still on has poison on it. Do you still think I’m toying with you?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan trembled and the meat from her chopsticks fell onto the ground.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“Song Luo” instantly went after it and swallowed the entire piece. Immediately, “Song Luo” fell over and started throwing up white foam. It started to twitch and struggled for a few seconds, and then took its last breath. The entire incident happened within five seconds. Lin Shan’s eyes and mouth were wide opened from shock.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“You…. monster!” She nearly jumped out of her seat as she pointed at the man, “Although the dog was ugly, you didn’t have to be so cruel. Are you human?! You….”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“Don’t worry.” The man calmly responded, “It will be your turn next. Calm down.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Right away, Lin Shan stopped talking. Tiny beads of sweat started forming on her forehead. Her heart started to beat furiously. Oh God, does this person really plan to kill her? What would he gain from it though?</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Just as she was panicking, the man murmured: “What? Are you afraid? If you want to die a better death, why don’t we do an exchange?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">By now, Lin Shan’s back was drenched from fear. Yet, she pretended like she was fine: “You… what do you want?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">The man absentmindedly smiled: “I heard the Emperor bestowed you the Heaven stone?” He said this in a very casual manner. He was entirely different from the monster he was a second ago. In addition, he was tapping the table with a rhythm.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">At this moment, a shocking thought appeared in Lin Shan’s mind. She didn’t even think twice as she blurted out: “Du Jing? You are Du Jing!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">When her accusations came out, the man looked astonished for a moment. But he quickly composed himself. The smile deepened on his face: “Not bad. You could still tell. I guess I have no choice but to kill you….”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan’s gut feeling was correct. Based on his actions and words, plus his split personality, it was totally aligned with Du Jing. Furthermore, this guy even admitted it himself. Therefore, it was definitely Du Jing. But how come his face looked different?</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“Confused, eh?” The man looked amused, “Have you heard of the technique of face changing?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan nodded to show that she had.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“Then have you heard of the world’s best face changer? Jiang Hu’s hundred face scholar, Ji Bai Yu?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan shook her head.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">The guy raised his eyebrows: “What?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan was so scared that she quickly nodded: “Yes I have. I have…”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">The man looked satisfied as he continued: “That’s right. I am the young Master of the Red Phosphorous Hall, Ji Bai Yu!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">To be honest, Lin Shan had never heard of the name Ji Bai Yu. However, she had heard of Red Phosphorous Hall from Xiao Lu numerous times. Apparently, the Red Phosphorous Hall was a secret organization that had recently appeared in Jiang Hu. Those from this organization were poison experts and their martial arts were also very unique.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">The most well known figure was the Mistress of this place, Ji Hong Lin. Although she was a woman, she was vicious and merciless. She practiced all sorts of poison martial arts and had killed many martial artists. Even the Clan leader of Shaolin was once injured because of her.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">At this moment, Lin Shan realized how dangerous her situation was. This was not simply a personal issue between her and Ji Bai Yu. Instead, it was much deeper than that. Somehow, she got involved with the legendary monstrous Red Phosphorous Hall, and there was most likely a huge conspiracy behind this. Whatever it was, it had something to do with the shitty rock she almost threw out.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Mother! It’s a piece of shitty rock. What kind of secret could it hold? Lin Shan honestly couldn’t think of anything.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">The only thing she was sure of, though, was that Ji Bai Yu went all out for it. He even disguised as Du Jing in order to get it. This meant that the Heaven stone meant a lot to him. Based on the fate of the dog, he would probably kill her right after he found out the location of it. For her life’s sake, Lin Shan decided to lie.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“I don’t know.” Lin Shan stated.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“I knew you would be tight lipped.” Ji Bai Yu had clearly anticipated this result. He smiled, “That’s why I have prepared these dishes for you, Miss Song.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan looked at the dead dog and broke into cold sweats.</p>
