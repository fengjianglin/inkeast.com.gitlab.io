 <p>As the seven women talked amongst themselves, Lin Shan started to feel more unease. It didn’t sound like they were talking about Lian Feng. How come it sounded like they were talking about her instead?? Lin Shan suddenly realized: Oh my mother!!! These women have their eyes on me??</p>
 <p>Before she could react, she heard Liu Qiao Yue: “We can talk about that stuff later. First, let’s get him!” Then, she instantly flew towards her as a long thin piece of white silk came out of her sleeves like a water snake and wrapped around her body.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan was petrified and about to scream for help, when Lian Feng swung his sabre. There was a flash of light, and the white silk was immediately torn apart. The cutting edge of the sabre was so powerful that it caused Liu Qiao Yue to take several steps back.</p>
 <p>“Are you alright?” Lian Feng asked as he placed Lin Shan behind him.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha. So it turns out this government official likes men as well! I guess I will need backup!” Liu Qiao Yue laughed devilishly as she suddenly signaled with her hand; the rest of the white figures started flying towards Lian Feng and Lin Shan.</p>
 <p>Currently, there were countless of white silk flying everywhere in the air. It was blocking everyone’s sight. Lin Shan felt a strong impact on her arm. Next thing she knew, she had been pushed aside by Lian Feng. He was using the sabre as he sliced all the silk into pieces. Endless amount of thin silk was raining down on them.</p>
 <p>“Impressive!” Liu Qiao Yue praised. “Sisters, I think we have met our match today. No need to be courteous. Attack!” Another wave of attack was about to strike Lian Feng.</p>
 <p>Seeing Lian Feng being attacked, the Imperial guards didn’t want to hold back any longer. They all raised their weapons as they decided to assist Lian Feng. However, a couple steps later, all of them went weak.</p>
 <p>“There is something wrong with these flowers….”</p>
 <p>Lin Shan was speechless as she quickly looked at Lian Feng. Fortunately, he was still able to focus on his style and movements. However, since it was one against seven, he seemed to be having a hard time.</p>
 <p>Damn it! They’re too much! Not only are they a team of seven picking on one, they are poisoning us. Even I’m not this cunning!</p>
 <p>Lin Shan was raging as her eyes wandered around her surroundings.</p>
 <p>She noticed a bucket of fertilizer that was supposedly used for the flowers at a corner.</p>
 <p>On one side, Lian Feng was still fighting with the seven female thieves. It wasn’t that he didn’t have the ability to beat them, but they were truly too evil. Not only did they plant poisonous plants, they also hid many concealed weapons up their sleeves. It made it an impossible task for him to defeat them.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Lian Feng heard Lin Shan yelling: “Get out of my way!”</p>
 <p>His instincts immediately told him to leap out of the way. Next thing he knew, a bucket that reeked of manure splashed everywhere.</p>
 <p>The sexual Black Moon Seven were now the smelly Black Moon Seven. The name will spread far and wide. From now on, that is what they would be known as.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan’s action startled the Heavens and the Earth. The seven female thieves who initially thought they were undefeatable froze. Then, they released a cry that was more frightening than monsters; countless of birds were jolted and flew away.</p>
 <p>As for the Imperial guards that lost their strength from the fragrance of the flowers, the smell of the feces was so disgusting that they couldn’t help but vomit.</p>
 <p>Surprisingly, after vomiting, they realized that they had regained their strength; their minds were no longer dizzy and all the poison had been dissolved.</p>
 <p>In less than the time it took to burn an incense, the table had been turned. This was a historical moment. The most difficult gang from Black Dragon Mountain had thoroughly been uprooted by Lin Shan’s contribution. They have been defeated.</p>
 <p>Seeing this unravel in front of his eyes, the usual calm Lian Feng didn’t know whether he should laugh or cry. He was impressed. He couldn’t help but turn to look at the “manure hero” Lin Shan. However, he was faced with her frowning face. Lin Shan looked as if she wanted to cry.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Lian Feng went up to her.</p>
 <p>“This is so disgusting! So smelly…..” Although Lin Shan didn’t splash the manure on herself, her hand still touched it slightly. It was so sickening that Lin Shan wanted to puke.</p>
 <p>While she was fanning her hands in the air and scowling miserably, Lian Feng suddenly grabbed onto her wrist and took out a handkerchief from his breast area. He lowered his head and gently wiped her hand. In addition, he was being very attentive; he made sure to get every spot and didn’t look grossed out at all.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Lin Shan was stunned. Her hands were covered with the Earth’s dirtiest filth, yet in front of her, stood the world’s gentlest man. When Lian Feng’s fingers made contact with her palm, her heart felt like it was melting.</p>
 <p>After Lian Feng finished wiping her hand, he didn’t hesitate at all as he grabbed onto her other hand. By now, the white handkerchief had turned brown, but it didn’t bother him the slightest.</p>
 <p>Instead, he began to wipe even more specifically. After he finished wiping Lin Shan’s hands, he started wiping the dirty spots on her clothes. Lin Shan felt like a puppet as Lian Feng wiped away all the stains…</p>
 <p>Lin Shan suddenly felt like the bucket of manure was worth it.</p>
 <p>“Do you feel better?” Lian Feng spoke up.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan couldn’t get her words out. She foolishly nodded. It took her awhile before she uttered: “Umm… your handkerchief is …dirty now…”</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry about it.” Lian Feng replied as he folded the handkerchief neatly and placed it back where he took it from.</p>
 <p>“Don’t!” Lin Shan stopped him, “It’s dirty…I’ll give it back to you after I wash it!” Then, she snatched the handkerchief away from Lian Feng.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng appeared to want to say something; his lips moved but no words came out. After a few moments, he stated: “Let’s go. I’ll take you somewhere to take a bath.”</p>
 <p>Bath?</p>
 <p>Hearing this statement, Lin Shan’s eyes shone. She totally forgot about being shy and chirped: “Really?? Don’t lie to me! I want hot water and a big tub. I want a very very very big tub!” Lin Shan made an exaggerated gesture, as if she hadn’t taken a bath in years.</p>
 <p>But honestly, Lin Shan hasn’t taken a good bath in a very long time. The Black Dragon Mountain was incomparable to the Palace. The conditions were extremely poor and there weren’t any hotels or suitable accommodations around here. Hence, Lin Shan was curious as to where Lian Feng could find her hot water and a huge tub.</p>
 <p>“Come.” Lian Feng gestured.</p>
 <p>Huh? Don’t we need to get off the mountains to take a bath? Why is he leading me up the mountains? Lin Shan felt grim but she obediently caught up to him.</p>
 <p>The two of them walked through the thick jungle of the mountains and took many twists and turns. After some time has passed, Lin Shan still didn’t see any hot water nor tub. She was tired and started to become impatient.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan pulled on the corner of Lian Feng’s garment: “Hey, how much longer is it? My legs feel like they’re going to break.”</p>
 <p>“We have arrived.” Lian Feng said as he pointed up ahead.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan looked towards the direction Lian Feng was pointing to. All she could see was a faint smoke coming out from the middle of the jungle.</p>
 <p>Something snapped in Lin Shan’s mind. Could the hot water and tub that Lian Feng mentioned…be a hot spring?!?!!</p>
 <p>Holy shit! There’s a hot spring here!!!</p>
 <p>At that moment, Lin Shan felt like her blood was surging like the heat from the hot spring. She gripped Lian Feng’s hand and ran towards the hot spring.</p>
