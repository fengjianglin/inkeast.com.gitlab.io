<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Song Lin Feng crinkled his brows: “Hold it.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“No!” Lin Shan angrily retorted. “You’re a man. You can pee anywhere. I’m a woman. I’ve already held it in for the entire day. If I continue holding it in, I will damage my internals. I need to pee. I need to pee… I need to pee!!!!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“Oh my goodness. You’re such a brat!” Song Lin Feng frowned and then waved his arm. “Hurry up and go. Don’t even think of doing anything silly. The forest is dangerous at night.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan stuck out her tongue: The competition was almost over. I bet my treasures have already been found by others. Why would I go and look for them now? She thought as she went to a dense part of the forest to relieve herself.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Just as she squatted down, she saw a familiar figure.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Du Hao?!?</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan froze for a second, but quickly reacted. She quickly finished her business and grabbed her hidden slingshot from her waist.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">For a nobleman to get revenge, ten years is not too long. For a woman to get revenge, she will show you tomorrow!!!</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan developed her slingshot skills back when she was a little girl in her grandmother’s village. At the time, she would go play with a bunch of other children to capture sparrows. As long as she had her slingshot, she was invincible. Since she possesses this amazing technique, she was full of confidence as she lifted her slingshot. She swears to God that she will get revenge for what Du Hao has done to her the past few times.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">The Sun was setting and the sky was starting to darken. Lin Shan was ambushing behind a shrub, watching Du Hao as he paced back and forth. All of a sudden, he stopped to look up at the sky.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">I must take advantage of this opportunity!</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan immediately lifted her slingshot and aimed at a crucial spot. She didn’t hesitate at all as she striked.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">She expected to hear a cry of pain, but instead, Du Hao disappeared without a trace.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan was dumbfounded. Where did he go?</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">She was very confused. How come he was here a second ago, and disappeared within a blink? Did he discover her? She felt tense and didn’t dare to make another move in case she exposed herself. Therefore, she squatted behind the shrub until she felt like Du Hao was gone.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan cautiously stood up, planning to head back and find her brother.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">The moment she stood up, there was sounds of rustling leaves and Du Hao reappeared to capture the person that had ambushed him. He placed a dagger on Lin Shan’s neck.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan was caught off guard and slowly turned around as they both made eye contact. Both of them were appalled.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Du Hao frowned: “How come it’s….”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Before he could finish, Lin Shan knew she was in trouble. She loudly yelled: “Look at that!” And while Du Hao’s attention was divided, she turned around and ran as fast as she could.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">This type of trick would never fool Du Hao. He easily grabbed hold of Lin Shan’s collar and pulled her back. He had a devilish smile on his face: “Still think you can run?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">His voice made Lin Shan tremble although she wasn’t cold. Currently, all she can sense was danger. They say when dogs are panicking, they may jump over walls. Well, when Lin Shan is panicking, she will also do things she wouldn’t normally do.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan turned around and without thinking, she lifted her leg like a reflex and ruthlessly kicked Du Hao in the groin.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">This kick was definitely the most unforgettable experience of Du Hao’s twenty two years. He was in so much pain, he could’t even stand steadily. However, he wouldn’t let go of Lin Shan. He gritted his teeth and exerted all his force and ferociously detained Lin Shan by seizing her by the waist.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">This was the difference between a man and a woman. Even if a man was injured, he still had the strength to suppress a woman so that she wouldn’t be able to move a single step.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan didn’t expect Du Hao to grab hold of her. The more she thought about it, the more frightened she became. She quickly decided to unleash another kick.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">But this time, Du Hao had smarten up. He managed to avoid her kick, but his pain from before was still making his legs weak. At the same time, the person he had around by the waist was squirming to escape. This continued for a bit until suddenly the ground gave in and they fell into a trap. Neither of them paid attention and without warning, they both fell into the hole.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan was originally struggling to escape, yet suddenly the sky spun in front of her and she felt a harsh impact. All her organs felt like they had fallen out and she was terribly dizzy. One of her legs was in so much pain, it felt numb. But fortunately, her arms were ok. She bit her teeth and felt her surroundings..hmmm?? How come it’s so soft???</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Below her, a voice growled: “How much longer are you going to touch?”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Huh? Lin Shan quickly opened her eyes. After her eyes adjusted to the dim lighting, she could clearly see Du Hao’s extremely annoyed expression. At the same time, she realized that her entire body was on Du Hao, and one of her hands was on his face as she was trying to climb up. Du Hao’s handsome face was started to look deformed from her hand.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan hastily reacted and lifted both her hands in the air. At the same time, she repeated her famous lines: “Your Highness, I know my wrongs!!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Du Hao’s mouth twitched. He was so angry, he wanted to kill someone. Yet the person he wanted to kill was on his body. “If you know you’re wrong, get off! Hurry!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“Oh oh oh!” Lin Shan clumsily got up, while “accidentally” stepping on both Du Hao’s legs. And “coincidentally” stepping on his old injury.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Seeing Du Hao’s furious expression, Lin Shan chirped in: “Your Highness, I didn’t hurt you on purpose. I know my wrongs… ahhh, watch out!” Right when she spoke, a rock fell down and smashed Du Hao on the head.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan wanted to cry for the rock. Rock brother, your self-sacrifice is so touching! I will give you a moment of silence in tribute. Then, she insincerely said: “Your Highness, that was not my fault. I already tried to warn you… ai ya, watch out!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Du Hao tried to avoid the rock, but it came from the side. His handsome face had been striked.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Du Hao’s mind was spinning as he heard a voice talking: “I already said to be careful. Seriously… and you’re the Crown Prince…” Lin Shan was trying not to laugh.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">An unexpected indescribable anger came rushing up, and Du Hao got up and pressed Lin Shan against the wall.</p>
