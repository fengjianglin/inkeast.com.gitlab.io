 <p>He Lao San decided to give it his all. He leaped towards Lian Feng again as he swung his blade.</p>
 <p>The Black Tiger Gang didn’t expect their second boss to suddenly start fighting the leader of the soldiers. The brothers exchanged eye contacts with each other and decided: Well, what are we waiting for? They all raised their weapons and started to charge towards the soldiers.</p>
 <p>The opponents also raised their arrows.</p>
 <p>“Don’t release the arrows!”</p>
 <p>“Don’t move!”</p>
 <p>Lian Feng and He Lao San nearly said those words in unison. At the same time, they both looked at Lin Shan. They didn’t want her to suffer from any harm.</p>
 <p>“Damn it! How dare he look at my woman’s hand?” He Lao San didn’t expect Lian Feng to react the same way he did, and instantly drowned in jealousy. He swung his blade again.</p>
 <p>Although Lian Feng’s blade was fast and his style was sharp, he was not physically as strong as He Lao San. After a few moves, neither of them were winning.</p>
 <p>Just like that, the two of them fought and fought. Lin Shan watched from the side and felt like she was watching an ancient drama. All she could see were the reflection of the blades and the sounds of metal hitting against each other. Bing bing bing bing. It was so magical.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, she seemed to have realized something and slapped her thigh: Oh my goodness! At this rate, the golden sabre will be damaged!!!!</p>
 <p>She quickly shouted: “Stop fighting! Stop fighting!! I’m telling you to stop!!”</p>
 <p>Hearing Lin Shan’s voice distracted Lian Feng, and his movement slowed down slightly. He tried to avoid He Lao San’s blade, but he was one step too late. His arm got slashed, and fresh blood started spilling out.</p>
 <p>Seeing Lian Feng injured, all those soldiers who put down the arrows immediately raised up their arrows again; facing He Lao San. If He Lao San dares to take another step, he will most likely end up looking like a hedgehog.</p>
 <p>The situation was tense, and the gang members couldn’t hold back either as they raised their weapons.</p>
 <p>At this crucial moment, Lin Shan went in between He Lao San and Lian Feng.</p>
 <p>“Are you alright?” Lin Shan was panicking. Originally, she only cared about the golden sabre, but seeing Lian Feng injured, she was even more worried. She didn’t have second thoughts as she rushed towards him.</p>
 <p>“I’m fine.” Lian Feng shook his head, as blood continuously poured out from his wound.</p>
 <p>“What? How are you alright? Look at how much blood you’re losing?!!” Lin Shan was so worried, she wanted to cry. She ripped off a corner of her clothes and quickly used it to wrap around his wound.</p>
 <p>What an astonishing moment. Underneath the sunset, between the sharp blades of two groups of men, was an unarmed and defenseless girl who was wrapping up a wound for a man. Her movements were clumsy, and her hands were shaking, but she did not back off at all.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng felt like it was surreal. He was used to seeing blood, and he had slaughter many with his blade; but the woman in front of him has never dealt with blood, and probably never came across death. Yet, she was trying so hard to overcome her fear as she tried to help him stop the bleeding with her clean hands.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Lian Feng felt like his injury was worth it.</p>
 <p>-------</p>
 <p>He Lao San was holding on his breath. From the moment the leader of the soldiers held Lin Shan’s hand, he was already resentful towards him. Now that Lin Shan was helping that guy wrap his wound in front of everyone, it was a severe blow to his self esteem.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t take it anymore, and rushed towards Lian Feng with his blade despite the fact Lin Shan was by his side.</p>
 <p>Seeing He Lao San attacking again, Lian Feng quickly used his uninjured hand to push Lin Shan behind him. He tightly held onto his sabre as he blocked He Lao San’s attack. Immediately, fresh blood seeped through the wrapped wound.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan was furious and came out from behind Lian Feng as she screeched: “Stop fighting this second!”</p>
 <p>Her tone frightened He Lao San and he actually stopped attacking. He turned and looked at Lin Shan astonishingly.</p>
 <p>“Fight fight fight! All you guys know is how to fight! What’s the point? What if you win? Are you guys honestly planning to be mountain thieves forever? Mountain thieves in your teens. Mountain thieves in your twenties. Perhaps by the time you guys are in your seventies and eighties, you’ll still be mountain thieves! Even if you’re proud, others do not know how to react. Come on and use your brains! Stop complaining and whining you cannot find wives. What kind of woman would want to marry a mountain thief? This is common sense. You guys are not getting any younger!”</p>
 <p>Lin Shan’s words seemed to have caught the gang off guard. All of them looked dumbfounded; especially He Lao San; all his remaining self esteem had thoroughly been wiped out.</p>
 <p>As for Wang Hei Hu, he had been a mountain thief for years. Based on his experiences, he could tell right away Lin Shan wasn’t simply a female servant. He was impressed by her and asked: “Then tell us what we could do instead?”</p>
 <p>“Enlist in the army for forgiveness!” Lin Shan blurted out.</p>
 <p>“Enlist in the army for forgiveness?”</p>
 <p>“That’s correct. There are nearly a hundred gang members who are physically strong and able. None of you are missing an arm or a leg. Why must you guys be mountain thieves? Why not become soldiers? You can choose to defend your country or rob and steal. Which do you think is the better choice?”</p>
 <p>Lin Shan’s words caused Wang Hei Hu to ponder deeply. When he first started out as a mountain thief, it was because he had no other option. For the last couple of years, he had constantly been worrying for the gang’s future.</p>
 <p>If they must be sneaky and live in fear for life, why not do as Lin Shan says and choose a peaceful path instead?</p>
 <p>“I can consider your suggestion. But even if we are willing to enlist in the army, would the Imperial Court accept us?” Wang Hei Hu turned his glance towards the silent Lian Feng.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng didn’t directly respond, but turned to look at Lin Shan; he wanted to see her perspective.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan nodded, indicated that he could trust them. She had been living with the gang for half a month. She knew that deep down, they were not bad people; most of them didn’t purposely choose to become a mountain thief.</p>
 <p>“Alright.” Lian Feng calmly replied: “If you guys are willing to change and help our country, we would not treat you unfairly.”</p>
 <p>“Allow us to discuss with our brothers for a night. Tomorrow morning, I will come down by myself to give you an answer. Fair?”</p>
 <p>“Fair. But I’m taking her with me.” Lian Feng grabbed onto Lin Shan’s wrist. He grasped her so tightly that Lin Shan lost balance and took two steps back; her body was against his now.</p>
 <p>“No!” At that moment, He Lao San seemed to have snapped out of his misery and ran towards them. He couldn’t bear to see Lian Feng take away his Lin Shan, and was ready to fight.</p>
 <p>“Lao San!” Wang Hei Hu hollered. “Don’t allow your recklessness to destroy everyone else’s lives!”</p>
 <p>Since the big boss spoke up, He Lao San released his blade, but he was still boiling from anger. He gave Lian Feng the death stare as he unwillingly backed off.</p>
 <p>Seeing He Lao San retreat, Wang Hei Hu faced Lian Feng and spoke in a very calm manner: “Sir, it’s not that we do not trust you. However, I’ve been in this field for years now. We cannot afford not to watch out for ourselves. Therefore, we are going to tell Miss Song to return with us. Tomorrow, I will personally bring her back down to see you after our discussion. Alright?</p>
 <p>“No!” Lian Feng firmly stated, “I’m not going to lie to you guys. And she is not leaving with you guys. There is nothing to talk over.”</p>
