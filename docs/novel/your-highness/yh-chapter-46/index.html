<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Lin Shan was silently yelling on the inside, but she didn’t dare to shout at Lian Feng. Although Lian Feng and Du Hao had different temperaments, they were still twins. When they were angry, both of them possessed an aura where no one dared to get near.</p>
 <p>What’s there to be done? Apparently, when a man’s erection gets interrupted, his body could be in a disarray…if Lian Feng isn’t careful, perhaps he could practice the “Sunflower treasury*” without castrating!</p>
 <p>Thinking of this, Lin Shan became more and more afraid of talking to Lian Feng. All she did was quicken her steps in order to catch up with him.</p>
 <p>As for Lian Feng, he was indeed sexually frustrated. Any healthy man in his place would be upset if he had to stop midway. Also, Lian Feng was worried if he got near her again, he wouldn’t be able to control himself. Therefore, he avoided any contact with Lin Shan and kept walking ahead.</p>
 <p>After a while, Lian Feng felt his logic slowly returning back to his body. Thus, he decided to slow down to wait for Lin Shan.</p>
 <p>However, since Lian Feng was so much taller and bigger than Lin Shan, she was pretty much running and hopping in order to keep up with him. Lin Shan didn’t expect Lian Feng to suddenly stop like an emergency brake, and she crashed straight into him.</p>
 <p>Nothing good can result from a tiny woman bumping into a strong man who had practiced martial arts for twenty years. Lin Shan felt as if she had crashed into a wall; her world spun and she saw stars.</p>
 <p>It took her a few seconds to regain control of her movements, then she realized she has sprained her ankle.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng was speechless. This girl must have been reincarnated from a troublesome soul; he only took his eyes off her for a moment, and she ended up&nbsp;in messy situations.</p>
 <p>However, although he was frustrated at her, his heart couldn’t help but soften when he saw her injured expression on the ground. Lian Feng crouched down to help her up.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan had sprained her ankle. She was hurting so much, as if she had a cracked tooth inside her mouth. Thinking how Lian Feng was ignoring her previously, she made a “humph” sound and flung her head. She ignored Lian Feng’s offer to help her up.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng had never been in a situation like this before. He didn’t know what to do. Therefore, he continued holding his hand out as he watched her attentively.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan was planning on throwing a fit to get back some “face”, but instead of getting an apology from Lian Feng, he was staring fixedly at her.</p>
 <p>In no time, Lin Shan felt her guilty conscience kick in.</p>
 <p>One of them was crouching down and the other was sitting down. It was like a staring contest.</p>
 <p>At the end, Lin Shan admitted defeat and reached out her hand awkwardly. The moment she reached out her hand, Lian Feng grasped it and she felt a surge of strength pulling her up from the ground.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan’s legs were unsteady, and she pressed against Lian Feng. The two of them froze as they recalled the incident from the hot spring. It was a bit unsettling.</p>
 <p>“Can you walk?” Lian Feng broke the silence.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan nodded. However, the moment her ankle touched the ground, her brows wrinkled. She howled: “Pain, pain, pain….!!!!”</p>
 <p>“Let me take a look.” Lian Feng crouched again and took off Lin Shan’s shoe as he used his hand to firmly press her ankle.</p>
 <p>“Ai ya!” Lin Shan shrieked as if she was a pig being slaughtered. This was revenge! Totally revenge! She was in so much pain that tears were coming out.</p>
 <p>“It’s not broken, just sprained.” Lian Feng stated as he helped her put her shoe back on. Due to the mountainous road, the shoe was covered in mud. However, Lian Feng didn’t mind at all.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng patiently helped Lin Shan fix her sock and shoe. When his hand held onto her ankle, Lin Shan felt a warm feeling stirring in her heart. Subconsciously, she became silent.</p>
 <p>Deep down, Lin Shan knew she was being unreasonable. However, she felt wronged and wanted to get back some face. But clearly, that type of behaviour did not work on Lian Feng. Instead, it made her look spoiled. She felt a twinge of guilt and finally stopped making a fuss.</p>
 <p>Seeing how she seemed calm now, Lian Feng felt relived. He turned around with his back facing her, he gently said: “Get on. I’ll carry you down.”</p>
 <p>Lin Shan was obedient now. She didn’t hesitate at all as she swiftly climbed onto Lian Feng’s back. Her arms were around his neck for support, and her body instantly went from cold to warm. She felt at ease, and she couldn’t help but want to get closer.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng didn’t expect Lin Shan to get on his back so quickly. At that moment, he felt trusted. It was an indescribable feeling; when the woman you love trusts you, carrying her was like being responsible for her life. He never wanted to let go….</p>
 <p>Lin Shan suddenly felt the atmosphere change. Although they weren’t saying anything, it seemed like there were a lot waiting to be said. Yet, nothing came out when they opened their mouths.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Lin Shan decided to remain silent and just held on tighter. The heat from Lian Feng’s body was very comforting.</p>
 <p>It didn’t seem like a bad option if they kept on walking like this…</p>
 <p>This thought flashed through Lin Shan’s mind and she suddenly forgot about the Palace, her identity, Lian Feng’s past, and everything else. She wanted to do something very impulsive.</p>
 <p>“Lian Feng.” Her voice was light and soft, very different from her usual voice.</p>
 <p>“What is it?” He asked.</p>
 <p>“If… I’m saying if…” She paused. “If we don’t return to the Palace…what do you think?”</p>
 <p>Her voice was light, but it was enough to make Lian Feng freeze.</p>
 <p>The night was dark, and the moon was hanging from the sky. The mountainous wind blew across the black forest and the sound of rustling leaves could be heard.</p>
 <p>The stillness of the night was very evident, but Lin Shan’s heart couldn’t remain still. It was pounding very loudly. She longed to hear a particular answer from Lian Feng.</p>
 <p>But she didn’t get a reply.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Lin Shan didn’t know what to feel. She was kind of angry and disappointed at the same time. Her fingers were holding onto Lian Feng so tightly that her joints were turning white. Still, no words were spoken.</p>
 <p>The silence dragged on. Lian Feng finally spoke up after a very long time: “You’re not Song Luo, &nbsp;am I correct?”</p>
 <p>This abrupt question caught Lin Shan off guard. She could have denied it, but she didn’t.</p>
 <p>“What’s your real name?” Lian Feng asked.</p>
 <p>“Lin Shan….” She murmured in a low tone.</p>
 <p>“Lin Shan….” Lian Feng repeated her name. Then he said to himself: “Sounds better than Song Luo…”</p>
 <p>Lin Shan felt powerless for the first time. Initially, she was upset at Lian Feng for not giving her a straight answer. But now, she realized that he didn’t give her a reply because he knew she was lying to him. He didn’t know her past, he didn’t know her life, he didn’t even know her real name.</p>
 <p>Shouldn’t a relationship be based on trust? Yet, she hid so much from him.</p>
 <p>“Actually, I….” She suddenly wanted to explain everything.</p>
 <p>“The Palace has sent out many secret agents to look for you.” Lian Feng cuts her off.</p>
 <p>What? Lin Shan was stunned. The words that she wanted to say were stuck in her throat.</p>
 <p>“Have you ever thought about what would happen if they found you, and found out that you are actually not Song Luo? In fact, not even a man? Have you ever thought about the consequences?”</p>
 <p>“I….” Lin Shan didn’t know what to say. Of course she had thought about it before, “I thought as long as I leave, it would be…”</p>
 <p>“…it would be okay? You’re too naive. You honestly think the Emperor is a fool? It is not easy for him to get to his position today. Plus, the secret agents went through massive amounts of training. If they want to find a person, they will be able to find the person.”</p>
 <p>Lin Shan was stupefied.</p>
 <p>They could find me no matter what? Does this mean I can never leave the Palace? Does this mean I have to hide my&nbsp;true identity forever? Does this mean I have to pretend to be someone else for the rest of my life?</p>
 <p>“No….” Lin Shan shook her head as she whimpered, “It shouldn’t be like this. I don’t want this to continue… I want to be myself.. I….”</p>
 <p>“Of course you want to be yourself!” Lian Feng suddenly puts her down, as he quickly turned around to steady Lin Shan.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan’s eyes were unfocused and she looked lost.</p>
 <p>“The only way Lin Shan can live, is if Song Luo dies.” said Lian Feng.</p>
 <p>*For the “Sunflower Treasury”, apparently it’s a fictional martial arts instructional book that can made a person stronger. However, the user must first castrate himself beforehand, or he could turn crazy!? (something like that). In the dramas I have watched previously, the men all becomes very feminine. Sorry for the confusing description. I’m not too knowledgeable about this.</p>
