<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Sure enough, the very next day, there was a huge rainstorm. It was raining so hard that the entire Palace was submerged in water vapor. Despite that, the Kingdom&nbsp;minister and his wife rushed into the Palace to see their daughter the moment they received news that Song Luo had been found.</p>
 <p>The moment they saw Song Luo, streams of tears poured from the mother’s eyes. She grabbed Lin Shan’s hand and refused to let go regardless of what was being said.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan couldn’t help but feel a tingle in her nose. Although she had said that she wanted to leave the Palace forever, there were also things she didn’t want to part with. The love her parents had for her was definitely no less than the love she had received from her previous parents. If her current parents were suffering because of her, she will never be able to die contently.</p>
 <p>Thinking of this, Lin Shan couldn’t help but started to worry about her identity again. Based on how Du Hao acted the day before, she was unsure of how long he will keep her secret.</p>
 <p>But if she told her parents that that Du Hao had already discovered she was a woman, knowing her father’s character, he would definitely run to the Emperor to beg for mercy. Plus, her mother would most likely faint from the news.</p>
 <p>No! Definitely not! Lin Shan thought about it and decided the best thing to do was to talk to her brother first.</p>
 <p>She asked about Song Lin Feng, and found out that he had been sent away to deal with some urgent matter. At the present moment, there was no set return date.</p>
 <p>What? Her brother is gone? What about Lian Feng? Shouldn’t he be with her brother? Lin Shan was surprised and immediately asked Xiao Lu to investigate.</p>
 <p>Xiao Lu quickly found out that the Emperor believed the soldier station was set on fire by some mountainous thieves who refused to work alongside with the Imperial Court. Thus, Lian Feng was ordered to go back to the Black Dragon Mountain to do some investigation.</p>
 <p>Does that mean Lian Feng was currently at the Black Dragon Mountain? At this moment, Lin Shan realized she was isolated without help. Now, she could only count on herself to deal with Du Hao.</p>
 <p>-------</p>
 <p>After Lin Shan’s parents left, Lin Shan worked very hard to recuperate for three days straight. She had to be prepared to deal with Du Hao at any moment. From morning until night, she would think of many combat plans. After all, she had to be prepared in case Du Hao unleashed a sudden attack!</p>
 <p>Oddly enough, Du Hao seemed to have vanished. There was totally no movement from his side. Instead, there was another person driving Lin Shan nuts; that person was the clueless Du Ming Yue.</p>
 <p>Du Ming Yue’s love life experience was truly a tragedy.</p>
 <p>Before she was three years old, her goal was to marry her father one day. However, she later found out that the Emperor wasn’t someone she could marry. Therefore, she decided to fall for her eldest brother, Du Ye.</p>
 <p>She relied on Du Ye for everything; and whenever she got in trouble, he would back her up. This crush lasted until she was twelve. One day, her mother ruthlessly told her that she could never marry her brother.</p>
 <p>Poor Du Ming Yue was broken hearted. Hence, she turned to the servant that served Du Ye. That relationship only lasted for three months. The servant had a mental breakdown and personally transferred to another department to become a eunuch.</p>
 <p>Afterwards, Du Ming Yue found out eunuchs were not marriageable either. This was a severe blow to her, and she decided to stop falling in love.</p>
 <p>But the year she turned sixteen, Du Ming Yue met Song Lin Feng, the eldest master from the Song family, and fell in love. Finally, she had met a suitable/normal match! Being the bashful teenager she was, it took her a while to summon up the courage to confess. In the end, she gave her father a note, indicating her love interest.</p>
 <p>Yet, she was one step too late. Song Lin Feng had married Yang Bi Yuan, and she somehow ended up with the second brother, Song Luo.</p>
 <p>Instead of getting her ideal handsome manly man, she was now left with a feminine weakling. Du Ming Yue threw a fit and prepared a rope to commit suicide, but the Emperor’s words were final.</p>
 <p>The marriage was going to happen, and she had no choice.</p>
 <p>The moment they got married, Du Ming Yue had total confidence that she would be able to scare Song Luo away. Yet, despite looking like a frail little twerp, Song Luo wasn’t intimidated by her the slightest bit.</p>
 <p>As a matter of fact, she was the one who always ended up in a disadvantage position. Du Ming Yue had never met a match like this. She was frustrated and embarrassed. Slowly, she developed feelings for Song Luo.</p>
 <p>Honestly, Song Luo wasn’t that bad. When he tried to save her from falling onto the broken vase, that was quite a manly move. Plus, he had saved her brother, the Crown Prince.</p>
 <p>When Song Luo went missing, she was actually worried…. just like that Du Ming Yue’s love life had taken another step towards tragedy.</p>
 <p>If Du Ming Yue found out she fell in love with a woman, she would probably crash her head against a tree and commit suicide. However, currently, she was still clueless.</p>
 <p>Her teenage heart was stirring and she started to appear around Lin Shan all the time.</p>
 <p>“Song Luo, why are you not drinking your medicine?”</p>
 <p>“Song Luo, if you don’t drink your medicine, I will personally send your maid to the Leaning Vermilion House!”</p>
 <p>“Song Luo, you do not have the permission to flirt with your maid!”</p>
 <p>“Song Luo, I want to go to the park. You’re coming with me!”</p>
 <p>“Song Luo, my back feels sore. Give me a massage.”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>“Song Luo, tonight, I’m sleeping with you!”</p>
 <p>The wind howled. The horses hissed. And Lin Shan crumbled.</p>
 <p>“Master, where are you running off to?” Xiao Lu asked as Lin Shan dragged her to hide with her.</p>
 <p>It doesn’t matter where we go. Anywhere is better than sleeping with Du Ming Yue, ok? Who knows what she’s going to do in the middle of the night. What if she becomes a beast and starts tearing off my clothes?</p>
 <p>Lin Shan didn’t say a word, but she rolled her eyes at Xiao Lu.</p>
 <p>“Master, they say that those who kill pigs will reincarnate as a pig in the next life. You must have committed a lot of crimes in your previous life. That’s why in this life, so many people want to commit crimes to you.”</p>
 <p>Lin Shan nearly tripped on the bulging flagstone. She stared at Xiao Lu with resentment. You’re from the future, aren’t you?</p>
 <p>At that moment, Xiao Luo suddenly exclaimed: “Ai ya! Master, it looks like it’s going to rain!”</p>
 <p>Immediately after, the sky flashed…followed by the explosive sound of thunder. Huge droplets of rain started pounding down on them.</p>
 <p>Do you have a mouth of a crow? Lin Shan wanted to give Xiao Lu a dirty look but realized she had disappeared. She looked to her left and right and found Xiao Lu shaking at the corner of the garden.</p>
 <p>Oh yeah! Xiao Lu was afraid of lightning. Lin Shan decided to go over to comfort her.</p>
 <p>At that moment, another blast of lightning flashed through the sky and the thunder echoed through the air.</p>
 <p>Xiao Luo couldn’t handle it anymore and screamed, “Ah!”. She fled from the scene like a crazy woman.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan was stunned. She rushed to follow, but since her ankle was still injured, she had to stop after a couple of steps. By the time she looked up, there was no trace of Xiao Lu.</p>
 <p>Are you kidding me? I have to stay out by myself tonight? Lin Shan started feeling sorry for herself. The rain was falling harder. I guess the best thing was to find a place to avoid the rain.</p>
 <p>In order to hide from Du Ming Yue, Lin Shan basically ran to wherever that was remote. Now that she chased Xiao Lu for a bit, she was totally lost. The sky was dark, and there wasn’t a single person in sight. She was surrounded by plants, and they all looked the same.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, it looked like there was a ge lou* nearby. Since this was such a remote area, there were probably nobody living there. Lin Shan didn’t hesitate &nbsp;and ran straight towards the ge lou.</p>
