 <p>Lian Feng didn’t expect Lin Shan to suddenly shut her eyes. He felt a bit helpless.</p>
 <p>There was a bit of light seeping in from the door, and it made Lin Shan looked a bit hazy. Having never experienced love, Lian Feng could feel his heart stirring. It was trying to push its way out. He honestly wanted to kiss her, but his logical side was trying to restrain his urge.</p>
 <p>Kiss me! Why are you not kissing? If you’re not going to kiss me, watch, I’m going to kiss you! Inside, Lin Shan was yelping. Finally, she couldn’t wait any longer and opened her eyes.</p>
 <p>The second she opened her eyes, Lian Feng had released her and turned to the table to light the lamp.</p>
 <p>Once the lamp was lit, the entire room was bright. The lust Lin Shan felt was immediately replaced by rage. What the hell!?! First you changed my clothes, and then you hid from me. Now, you took advantage of me, pushed me onto the ground but didn’t kiss me? Do you f**king like me or not??!</p>
 <p>There was a saying that understand a woman’s heart was like looking for a needle under the bottom of the ocean. But Lin Shan believed that statement should be used to describe men instead.</p>
 <p>You can’t fish it up, and you can’t feel it. Just when you think you have caught it, it slips away in a blink of an eye…. what is that feeling?</p>
 <p>She couldn’t even explain it herself. All she felt was frustration. It annoyed her that she couldn’t read any of his expressions with his mask on.</p>
 <p>“I’m tired. I need to sleep.” She angrily stated.</p>
 <p>“Alright.” Lian Feng abruptly replied.</p>
 <p>“I said I need to sleep!” Lin Shan raised her voice. “Please get out.”</p>
 <p>“For your own safety, I’m not leaving this room.” said Lian Feng calmly.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan was even more agitated by his calm response as she refuted: “You are a man. I am a woman. There is no relationship between us. Why are you in my room if I’m sleeping? Please get out!”</p>
 <p>“You still remember you’re a woman?” Lian Feng countered, “You weren’t afraid of living with a big group of men for such a long period of time. Yet, you’re afraid of me?”</p>
 <p>“You!” Lin Shan was so irritated that she couldn’t think of any arguments. “Fine! If you want to stay, then stay! Stay as long as you want! I don’t care about you!” Then she stormed off to her bed.</p>
 <p>It was very difficult for Lin Shan to fall asleep because there were so many people living underneath the same roof. Plus, the moment she closed her eyes, she would think of that particular person. After tossing and turning for a long time, she tried to hear movements with her ears.</p>
 <p>Finally, she couldn’t fight her curiosity anymore and opened her eyes to look at her surroundings.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan saw Lian Feng sitting by the table in an upright position. It looked like he was asleep, because he was motionless.</p>
 <p>Oh you jerk! I can’t sleep because of you, yet you can sleep sitting down! Sleep, sleep, sleep! Sleep to your death! Lin Shan made a face at him and she wanted to throw her pillow at him. But thinking how she only has one pillow, it wasn’t a good idea.</p>
 <p>After contemplating for awhile, she madly turned around with the pillow: Humph! If you can sleep, I can sleep! Let’s see who’s the better sleeper!</p>
 <p>Her “bet” actually allowed her to fall asleep.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan was dreaming. She dreamt that she had became a donkey and was chasing after a carrot. Run, run, run! She ran until she exhausted all her strength. Finally, she threw herself onto the carrot and caught it!</p>
 <p>She was so happy. Just as she was about to bite onto the carrot, she noticed that there was a string attached to it. And the person holding the string was Lian Feng. He was waving at her.</p>
 <p>Holy shit! Lin Shan woke up from her dream in astonishment. When she opened her eyes, the sky was starting to light up. She got up from her bed and looked at Lian Feng.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng was still in the same position as he was last night. It looked as if he didn’t move an inch. By his side was his golden sabre that never leaves his hand.</p>
 <p>Perhaps it was because of the lighting or due to her being half asleep, Lin Shan suddenly felt like the sabre was an enormous carrot. She wanted to get closer to see if she was seeing things…</p>
 <p>While Lin Shan was dreaming, Lian Feng also had a dream. He dreamt of last night’s scenario. The face he had been thinking day and night was inching closer and closer; her eyes were tightly shut, and her small and exquisite nose was creasing due to nervousness; her mouth was slightly parted and pouty.</p>
 <p>It was too inviting and irresistible. Lian Feng couldn’t hold back any longer. He gently kissed her.</p>
 <p>What a beautiful moment. Oh, those soft, moist, sweet lips. It honestly didn’t feel like a dream. He had never kissed a woman before, therefore, he lightly tested with his tongue. The tip of his tongue quickly came across those pearly white teeth as he slowly pry them open….</p>
 <p>“Mmmm” A moaning sound entered his ear. Lian Feng instantly opened his eyes and realized he was actually kissing Lin Shan in real life!!! He was stunned and quickly pulled back.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan was originally focusing on the golden sabre, but somehow, her eyes ended up on Lian Feng’s face. At that moment, he suddenly leaned in and that was how their first kiss naturally happened.</p>
 <p>There was no resistance at all. There was only bliss. This was how it was supposed to happen! But Lin Shan didn’t expect Lian Feng to end the kiss half way. Losing that luscious kiss annoyed her to the max.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan was truly Lin Shan. She wrapped her arms around Lian Feng’s neck and without the slightest hesitation, she savagely kissed him.</p>
 <p>-------</p>
 <p>Lian Feng didn’t expect Lin Shan to voluntarily kiss him. He was taken aback, but was able to adapt quickly. All the emotions he had suppressed for so long suddenly erupted. He didn’t want to hold back any longer. His next move was something that even Lin Shan herself hasn’t thought of yet.</p>
 <p>He placed one hand around her waist, and the other on her neck as he pulled her closer.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan was surprised by his boldness as her body soften. She took this opportunity to sit on his lap as her breasts touched his chest. Her entire body felt like it was on fire.</p>
 <p>Although she was from the future, the intensity of this gesture caused her cheeks to flush and her heart to skip a beat. Her body was reacting as if the kiss was going to suck everything out of her. Her mind started to fuzz, and all of her four limbs were going soft.</p>
 <p>To prevent herself from going limp, she tightly held onto Lian Feng’s clothes.</p>
 <p>Just like that, their kiss deepen. From the looks of it, there was no turning back. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. Immediately following was Wang Hei Hu’s voice.</p>
 <p>“Superior, Miss Song, are you guys awake? I have something to discuss with you two.”</p>
 <p>The moment Lin Shan heard the voice, she bounced from Lian Feng like a guilty thief. Her head was lowered and she couldn’t stop blushing.</p>
 <p>“Alright. Give us a moment.” Lian Feng replied. His eyes never left Lin Shan as he reached out to straighten out her clothes and gently fixed her messy hair. When his finger brushed against her flushed cheeks, both of them were stumped for words. Lin Shan’s cheeks turned even more red, like a flower about to burst open.</p>
 <p>“Umm. err… I-I…..” She stuttered.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng smoothly placed his finger on her lips: “Anything you want to say, say it when we’re off the mountains.”</p>
