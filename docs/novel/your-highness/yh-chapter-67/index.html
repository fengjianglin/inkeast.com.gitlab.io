 <p>In order to find the antidote for the strange illness as soon as possible, that very night, Du Hao gathered his personal army to coordinate with Lian Feng to enter the black forest.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan wasn’t allowed to go, so she was fuming in her bed. She was so close to getting that thousand golden taels, and now, it had slipped out of her grasp. She continuously tossed and turned.</p>
 <p>Strangely, her heart suddenly felt very uneasy. Something seemed to be fishy. However, after thinking for a long time, she still couldn’t figure it out. Instead, it was getting even harder to sleep. Could it be because Lian Feng was leaving tomorrow? As a result, she was feeling this odd sensation in advanced?</p>
 <p>Lin Shan tossed and turned a few more times before she decided to go and secretly visit Lian Feng.</p>
 <p>As her personal maid, Xiao Lu usually slept in the same room as her. Xiao Lu rubbed her eyes and asked: “Master. It’s so late. Where are you going?”</p>
 <p>“I’m going to see how Lian Superior’s preparation is coming along.”</p>
 <p>“Pssh. You just can’t forget the golden sabre, eh? Master, you need to grow up….” Xiao Lu turned over as she continued sleeping before Lin Shan could rage at her.</p>
 <p>“Watch me send you to the Leaning Vermilion House to sweep!” Lin Shan muttered as she sneaked out.</p>
 <p>Although it was only the end of summer, the night breeze was already starting to feel cool. Lin Shan was wearing a thin layer and shortly felt chilly. She hugged herself tighter as she headed towards Lian Feng’s residence.</p>
 <p>She was very familiar with the path, and arrived at Lian Feng’s in no time. However, no light could be seen from outside. Most likely, he was asleep. Lin Shan was worried if she walked right in, Lian Feng would mistaken her as a thief and pull out his sabre to stab her. For her safety’s sake she decided to knock on the window.</p>
 <p>“Lian Feng? Xiao Feng? Lian Lian? Feng Feng? Xiao Feng Feng….”</p>
 <p>There was a movement from behind her and Lin Shan quickly turned around. To her surprise, Lian Feng was actually there. Underneath the mask, his mouth could be seen twitching.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan was appalled. She almost let out a punch. Fortunately, the mask was too symbolic so she reacted in time: “Why were you standing behind me without saying a word? You want to scare me to death? ….huh? Why are you not sleeping?”</p>
 <p>“I was about to come find you.” said Lian Feng.</p>
 <p>“Oh.” Lin Shan was curious. “Why were you going to find me?”</p>
 <p>Lian Feng didn’t answer her question. Instead, he asked: “Why did you come find me?”</p>
 <p>Me? Lin Shan thought about it. She couldn’t think of a reason. Therefore, she said: “I don’t know. I couldn’t sleep. I just wanted to see you…could it be you felt the same? Ha! Our minds have telepathic powers!” Lin Shan looked as if she had discovered the New World. She patted Lian Feng on the shoulder.</p>
 <p>Since the wind was quite strong, her hand was cold. Her fingers accidentally touched Lian Feng’s neck, and Lian Feng frowned as he grabbed onto her hand.</p>
 <p>“Why are you so cold?” He asked.</p>
 <p>That move was too sudden and Lin Shan felt a bit bashful. She sheepishly replied: “uh…. I am feeling kind of cold….” Before her sentence was finished, Lian Feng had already taken off his robe without the slightest hesitation. He wrapped her in his body temperature robe and Lin Shan felt her heart pound.</p>
 <p>“It’s cold outside. Let’s go in and talk.” Lian Feng was about to lead her inside when suddenly he felt a push and took a few steps backwards. Coincidentally, there was a wall behind him. “You….” Before he could react, Lin Shan had already thrown herself on him and kissed him hard.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">This position was very odd. Imagine a tall male being shoved against the wall while a tiny female stood on tiptoes to kiss him. Underneath the starry and breezy night, on this long passageway, the moonlight shone on the both of them and made them look rather hazy. This scenario was as alluring as a painting.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Behind the fake mountain in the courtyard, someone happened to pause.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan was still kissing. She didn’t know where she got her courage from. The irritability she felt from tossing and turning instantaneously disappeared. Currently, she felt refreshed and carefree. She became increasingly unrestrained and started to lift her hand to take off Lian Feng’s mask.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Originally, Lian Feng was hesitating. But in the end, he didn’t stop her. In no time, the mask was off. Without the mask between them, their kiss was deeper than it had ever been. Lin Shan felt like her legs were going weak. In order to prevent herself from losing balance, she wrapped her arms around Lian Feng’s neck; like a koala hanging from a tree.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">They were both filled with lust as they continued making out. Suddenly, the black cloud covered the moonlight and a guard was patrolling towards their direction.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lian Feng embraced Lin Shan and hid behind the shadows of a pillar. Fortunately, the guard did not notice them. He walked around a circle and left. Lin Shan saw how serious and worried Lian Feng looked, and thought it was adorable. The guard hadn’t gone far, but she had already stood on her tiptoes again as she mischievously started licking Lian Feng’s lips like a little kitten.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lian Feng could barely resist Lin Shan’s soft and wet lip. But at the same time, he was worried the guard would discover them, therefore, he covered Lin Shan’s mouth.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan wouldn’t give in and started nibbling on his palm. Her hands were also restless as she started to feel around in the dark. Finally, she touched something hard and stiff.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lian Feng let out a growl and shoved Lin Shan against the pillar as he ferociously kissed her.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">The passionate kiss blew Lin Shan away. She was lightly panting against Lian Feng. A ray of moonlight was suddenly revealed by the gloomy cloud. The hazy moonlight made her look extremely mesmerizing.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lian Feng reached out his hand and tried to fix her hair. However, his fingers didn’t want to leave her smooth luscious face. He continued to slowly stroke her cheeks with his fingers.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">It was somewhat unbelievable to him that his hands had killed hundreds before, yet they were the same hands that were touching the woman he loved. His cold sabre had never given him such&nbsp;satisfaction before.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan was currently very well behaved. She quietly allowed Lian Feng to caress her as she pressed her face against his chest. She greedily listened to his steady heartbeat and felt like all her problems had disappeared: “When you come back, let’s figure out a way to leave this place.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lian Feng’s hand stopped moving. He didn’t say a word.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“What’s wrong?” Lin Shan lifted her head to look at him, but Lian Feng pressed her head back against his chest.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“Alright.” He promised.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lin Shan felt a sweetness she couldn’t describe. It was as if her heart had eaten honey. She had her arms around his waist as she continued: “You have to leave early and come back early. You’re not allowed to look at other women on the way!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“Ok.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“You’re not allowed to look at men either!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“……”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“You’re not allowed to look at Wu Ying either!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“……”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Just like that, Lin Shan continued talking gibberish to Lian Feng as she hugged him.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">From a distance, Xiao Lu’s voice could be heard: “Prince Consort! Prince Consort!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“Ah!” Lin Shan was shocked as she bounced off Lian Feng, “Xiao Lu must have woken up and noticed I went missing. She is looking for me! I must hurry back. Sleep soon! I’ll come say goodbye tomorrow!”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“No need.” Lian Feng shook his head. “I’m leaving the moment the Sun rises. Don’t come. I want to avoid gossip.”</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Hummph! Keep pretending! You kissed me against the pillar in the middle of the night and you’re afraid of gossip? Men are full of shit! Lin Shan secretly looked down on Lian Feng. By now, Xiao Lu’s voice was getting very close.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“Alright. I’m not going to walk you back to your room! I’m going to go back and sleep!” Lin Shan pouted and looked peeved. Then, she vigilantly looked around her surroundings. Once she confirmed there was no one around, she hopped out from behind the pillar and ran towards the direction of Xiao Lu’s voice.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“Remember to leave quick and come back quick!” From a distance, Lin Shan turned around as she mouthed the words to Lian Feng.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">Lian Feng stood behind the pillar as he watched Lin Shan’s figure gradually disappear. Then, his eyes darkened.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="background: white; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0cm 0cm 18.0pt 0cm;">“Come out.” He stepped out of the shadows.</p>
