 <p>Based on voice, Lin Shan couldn’t tell who it was. She turned and saw the person wearing a white gown with his hair done up. The man looked like a handsome scholar, and for a moment, she couldn’t recall who he was until the man narrowed his eyes when he saw her shocked expression.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Lin Shan remembered and her face turned green.</p>
 <p>Are you kidding me? It’s Du Ye! Why does he look so different without his armour? And why is he talking to me? Does he have a plan up his sleeves?</p>
 <p>Lin Shan saw Du Ye yesterday, and currently she had very conflicting views about this guy. Her mental state was at its limit as she said with a frozen face: “Your servant did not know your Highness was here. I’m sorry for the lack of manners. Please punish me accordingly.”</p>
 <p>“Prince Consort. You’re too serious. I just happened to pass by. There is no lack of manners.” Du Ye was very courteous towards her, but Lin Shan still felt apprehensive towards him.</p>
 <p>Du Ye continued: ” Since we have met by fate, why don’t I invite you over as a guest?”</p>
 <p>The moment Du Ye said this, Lin Shan remembered the saying: “Beware of suspicious folks giving gifts”. Du Ye must have a motive if he was inviting her over. At that moment, Lin Shan felt a bit miserable: I don’t have the golden sabre. I don’t have much meat on me either. My sleeves are clean and I live in a room with four bare walls. Why are you all watching me so attentively? You may not find it tiring, but I do!</p>
 <p>Her expression didn’t look too good as she politely declined: “Your Highness, I appreciate your kind intentions, but the Sun has barely risen and it’s raining. I’m afraid if I pay a visit, it will be troublesome for others. Why don’t we meet on another day? What do you think?”</p>
 <p>She was sure clever. No wonder Du Hao fancied her.</p>
 <p>Du Ye didn’t say a word but gazed deeply at Lin Shan. After a few moments, he responded: “Since Prince Consort has already made up his mind, I’m not going to press. Fortunately, I will be here for a long time. We will have another opportunity, wouldn’t you say?” Du Ye deftly replied.</p>
 <p>Lin Shan felt cold sweats running down her body. Mother! This guy’s position was even higher than Du Hao’s! But the difference was, Du Hao was very open with what he wants, whereas Du Ye had hidden intentions. Du Ye was even more dangerous!</p>
 <p>At this moment, Lin Shan felt like danger was lurking on every corner. The moment she has an opportunity, she will run!</p>
 <p>-------</p>
 <p>The rain continued as the autumn winds blew.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng left the Capital by nighttime and finally arrived at the outskirts of the black forest on the second night. The air was damp and there was a thick fog covering the dense forest. The fog was so thick that the bottom couldn’t be seen.</p>
 <p>Du Hao had sent his assistant Gu Zuo to assist Lian Feng. Gu Zuo circled around the outer edge of the forest and reported back to Lian Feng: “Lian Superior, the Sun had set and the fog around the forest seems very strange. I’m afraid it might be unsafe. Perhaps we should wait until morning before we proceed?”</p>
 <p>“Time is tight. The Emperor cannot wait so long. I have been in this forest before so I’m familiar with the terrain. Let’s split up into two groups. I will lead the way with Chi Fei. You and Chang Yu will be behind us providing support. We must find the antidote before the sunrise!” Lian Feng ordered as he spurred Wu Ying. Wu Ying neighed and stormed into the white misty forest.</p>
 <p>“Follow along!” Gu Zuo hollered. With a blink of an eye, four horses charged into the forest. The creepy forest was like the mouth of a monster. It quickly swallowed the people and the horses; even the echoes disappeared in a flash.</p>
 <p>After a few moments, ten or more shadows dropped from the sky without a sound. They were standing outside of the black forest.</p>
 <p>“Superior. They are inside now.” A dark shadow knelt as he reported.</p>
 <p>The leader of the group looked towards the forest and said in a low voice: “Execute according to plan.”</p>
 <p>His voice was still lingering in the air when the shadows dispersed in all directions. Their kung fu abilities showed no trace of their existence. It was as if they were never there.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Lian Feng and his team had already entered the deep part of the forest. Due to the weather, the fog was very thick. The further they went, the less visibility they had. The horses couldn’t gallop because they couldn’t see. They could only fumble their way through.</p>
 <p>From behind, Gu Zuo and Chang Yu were following precisely as they carefully observed their surroundings.</p>
 <p>There wasn’t even a sound of a single bird. It was oddly quiet.</p>
 <p>“Gu brother. Why is it that I feel like something is wrong?” Chang Yu grew up around a forest. He naturally had a very sharp intuition. “This white mist isn’t poisonous air, yet there isn’t a single bird in sight. I’m afraid there’s trouble!”</p>
 <p>The moment Chang Yu made that statement, Gu Zuo felt increasingly alert and uncomfortable: “You’re right. This forest is too quiet. There’s definitely something wrong. Let’s go and warn Lian Superior. Hurry!” Right after those words were spoken, Wu Ying’s whines could be heard.</p>
 <p>“Oh no!” Gu Zuo yelled. He quickly whipped his horse to catch up, but it was too late. Sounds of weapons clashing cut through the silent forest. The aura of death filled the air.</p>
 <p>These black clothed men were clearly well trained. In addition, they were very familiar with the landscape. They took advantage of the huge plants and trees and ambushed Lian Feng. Furthermore, their breathing were almost abnormal. Lian Feng had never seen anything like it; he couldn’t detect them at all.</p>
 <p>By now, Gu Zuo and Chang Yu had arrived. They both wielded out their swords and joined in the fight. However, things weren’t looking good for them. They were against three times the amount of people, and the enemies were familiar with the area. Plus, the fog was so dense they could barely see.</p>
 <p>They were losing when suddenly Chi Fei, who had grown up around the area, yelled: “Superior. Keep heading forward! The elevation is higher. There will be less fog!”</p>
 <p>The four of them continued to fight as they proceeded forward. As expected, the elevation was higher and the fog started to sink lower. The further up they went, the thinner the fog became. Soon, they were able to see the ground again. As for their enemies, they weren’t able to camouflage between the forest anymore; making them easier to defeat. It looked like the table had turned.</p>
 <p>At this time, they were close to the edge of the cliff. There was a river valley up ahead and the rapid running water sounded like a beast roaring at night. The black clothed men were closing in and five of them attacked Lian Feng from all sides. Every move was meant to be fatal. Step by step, they forced him towards the edge of the cliff. Clearly, they wanted to force him off.</p>
 <p>“Chi Fei, you scoundrel! Where have you led&nbsp;us? Go and assist Lian Feng!” Gu Zuo screamed at Chi Fei.</p>
 <p>Chi Fei responded as he rushed in front of Lian Feng to block the attacks of two black clothed men. He turned around and blared: “Superior. I’m sorry. I’ve led us the wrong way!”</p>
 <p>Lian Feng didn’t reply, but said: “Watch out behind you!” He lifted his sabre and blocked the sword that was heading for Chi Fei’s back. At the same time, he suddenly felt an intense pain. A shining sharp sword had pierced through his chest. Lian Feng’s brows furrowed as he looked up. In front of him was Chi Fei. His simple and honest face had turned cunning and cruel.</p>
 <p>“Superior, you shouldn’t always be worried about your back. The front is equally as dangerous.” Chi Fei wickedly stated as he drew out the sword. Fresh blood spilled out and Chi Fei ruthlessly rammed his palm against Lian Feng’s chest.</p>
 <p>Lian Feng lost his balance and took a couple steps back. But there was no more path, and he fell off the cliff.</p>
 <p>The darkness quickly consumed Lian Feng. All that remained was the bloodstain on the rock.</p>
