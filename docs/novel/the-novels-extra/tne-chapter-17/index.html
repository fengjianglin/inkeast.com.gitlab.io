 <p>[What do you want?]</p>
 <p>I knew Yoo Yeonha would agree. She was the type who couldn’t stand one-sided favors.</p>
 <p>Now, I wondered I should ask for.<br>Asking for money didn’t feel right. It was Yoo Yeonha I was talking about, but she was still a minor. She likely couldn’t freely spend tens of millions of won.</p>
 <p>[It’s simple. I need a weapon.]</p>
 <p>After sending her the above message, I sent her the link to Essential Armory’s Desert Eagle.<br>Yoo Yeonha looked at the link I sent her and looked back up at me. She didn’t seem to have any hostility.</p>
 <p>[I think it’s pretty cheap.]</p>
 <p>[…I understand.]</p>
 <p>Great, she agreed.</p>
 <p>[Is it possible to get it by tomorrow?]</p>
 <p>The quicker it was, the more money I would make. Even if tomorrow was too difficult, I hoped to get it by the end of the week.</p>
 <p>[Yes, I’ll take care of it.]</p>
 <p>Surprisingly, she replied without hesitation, even though her parents should still be in charge of guild work. I was impressed by her decisiveness.</p>
 <p>“Get back to your seats.”</p>
 <p>The break ended at just the right time, as the old professor resumed class after drinking some water.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>Wednesday’s theory class ended. And at 3 P.M., anti-personnel training began.</p>
 <p>In a fairly large training field, each cadet met with others they promised to spar. Meanwhile, I looked for the instructor pitifully.</p>
 <p>“Hey.”</p>
 <p>A sharp voice stabbed my ear from the back. It had to be calling me. I turned around and instantly froze. Chae Nayun was glaring at me with terrifying eyes.</p>
 <p>She asked, “Spar with me.”</p>
 <p>The hostility in her tone bordered on killing intent.<br><em>Gulp.</em> I swallowed a mouthful of saliva.<br>Like the saying, ‘a word causes a debt worth a thousand gold taels,’ I had made a terrifying enemy with a sentence. Indeed, Chae Nayun was too dangerous of a person to have as an enemy. In order to live a peaceful life, I had to mend our relationship even at the cost of kneeling and begging.</p>
 <p>But looking at Chae Nayun, I fell in thought. Would she be able to forgive me for my rash insult just because I apologized?<br>Seeing me silent, Chae Nayun pointed at my gun and spoke.</p>
 <p>“Your gun. Take it out.”</p>
 <p>The first training gun broke when I fought the Djinn. This was a new one. I looked down at my holster, then back up at Chae Nayun.</p>
 <p>“I don’t want to.”</p>
 <p>“…You scared?”</p>
 <p>These two words carried a great echo, causing the eyes on the training field to fall on us.</p>
 <p>“Mm…”</p>
 <p>How should I act in front of Chae Nayun?<br>Without a doubt, the ‘incident’ I was clueless about was well known among all cadets. The original Kim Chundong should have known about it too. So if I apologized now, it might seem like an even greater insult.</p>
 <p>“No.”</p>
 <p>…Furthermore, it might be better for me to remain a bad guy to Chae Nayun. My first and foremost goal and the reason I worked so hard without resting… was all to kill her older brother within a certain amount of time.</p>
 <p>Even if I mended my relationship with Chae Nayun and even became friends, my actions would only leave her with a cruel sense of betrayal and hatred.</p>
 <p>“I’m afraid you might get hurt. This thing uses real bullets, you see.”</p>
 <p>Immediately, the weight of the atmosphere changed. Chae Nayun clenched her bow. I could see the amount of force she put in through the veins popping out of her hand.</p>
 <p>“I don’t think your bullets will hurt me even if they hit.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun forcefully suppressed her anger and retorted with a cold sneer.<br>My response was simple.</p>
 <p>“You won’t get hurt. You’ll die instead.”</p>
 <p>“…Ha, say that again, punk.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun approached me up close. She looked like she would explode at any moment. She was technically 165 while I was 174, but she seemed a lot bigger for some reason.</p>
 <p>“Really, who do you think you are?”</p>
 <p>The atmosphere turned for the worse and more spectators gathered to watch the fight. At that moment…</p>
 <p>“Chae Nayun, get back.”</p>
 <p>The instructor stepped in. I breathed a sigh of relief, thankful that she came before it was too late. Chae Nayun turned towards the instructor.</p>
 <p>“Why should I?”</p>
 <p>“Before he gets a gun for sparring, no one can spar with Kim Hajin cadet.”</p>
 <p>“But I don’t mind.”</p>
 <p>“I mind.”</p>
 <p>“Why—”</p>
 <p>“Failure to heed an instructor’s order will be met with disciplinary action.”</p>
 <p>“…”</p>
 <p>An instructor’s words were absolute. Chae Nayun clenched her teeth with a wronged look. But in the end, she gave me a final glare before leaving. The spectators also dispersed and went back to their training.<br>Everything had returned to normal.</p>
 <p>“Take your gun out.”</p>
 <p>The instructor spoke as she wrapped her hands in bandages. Her name… Park Hyun-Ah, was it? I asked the instructor.</p>
 <p>“Does a gun for sparring even exist?”</p>
 <p>“How the hell would I know?”</p>
 <p><em>Crack, crack.&nbsp;</em>The instructor cracked her knuckles and neck in front of me.</p>
 <p>“Now, come.”</p>
 <p>Then with a smile, she gestured with her finger.</p>
 <p>This person… Did she enjoy this?<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>Thursday was the hunting club’s orientation. But since cadets weren’t required to go to orientations, I decided to skip it for this week. It was partly to avoid Chae Nayun, but the main reason was to test out the weapon I would receive as quickly as possible.</p>
 <p>“Ah, I can’t wait.”</p>
 <p>I was currently at Angel Box, a coffee shop near Seoul. I was waiting for an item at this place. For the record, cadets were able to use Portals 5~6 times a month as long as they filled out a form.</p>
 <p>Time passed by. 5:29:55… 5:29:56… 5:30:00.<br>At exactly the promised time, the shop’s door opened.<br>A man in a black suit and sunglasses walked in with a suitcase. After looking around for a moment, his eyes met mine. I waved my hand happily. The man’s expression didn’t change. Striding with his long legs, he walked up to me.</p>
 <p>“Kim Hajin-ssi?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, that’s me.”</p>
 <p>I felt like I knew who this man was. Only one person popped up in my head when I thought about Yoo Yeonha’s attendant – Jin Sechan.<br>The man presumed to be Jin Sechan placed the suitcase on the table without sitting down.</p>
 <p>“Here’s the item. Please take a look.”</p>
 <p>“Are you in a hurry? You can sit.”</p>
 <p>I pointed at the chair in front of me. Before I received this item, I wanted to do a quick test.</p>
 <p>“…Hm.”</p>
 <p>He sat down without complaint.<br>I took out the laptop I bought from my bag. Yesterday, I made some changes to this laptop. Right, I could use the laptop to modify the laptop itself.</p>
 <p>“Are you doing something?”</p>
 <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
 <p>The man tilted his head.</p>
 <p>“Why are you tapping on air?”</p>
 <p>“…You can’t see this?”</p>
 <p>I lifted up my laptop.</p>
 <p>“…”</p>
 <p>He looked at me as if I was crazy.<br>I see, I had a bit of a suspicion, but it seemed I was right. Only I could see this laptop.</p>
 <p>“Haha, I’m kidding.”</p>
 <p>That was fine with me.<br>I turned the laptop on. The additional setting I put into my laptop was this.</p>
 <p>[When Kim Hajin is within 50m of a target with an altered setting, the content and summary of the change will be sent to Kim Hajin’s laptop.]<br>[*Does not work on targets past a certain level of importance.]</p>
 <p>The reason I added this setting was because I thought it would be more efficient if I was told about a change through an objective medium rather than having to notice it and then being told by the co-author.<br>Either because the co-author didn’t care or because he encouraged the modification I made, I only had to pay 200 SP.</p>
 <p>[A change in setting has been detected.]</p>
 <p>And currently, there was an alert in the laptop as expected.</p>
 <p>[Jin Sechan – His feelings for Yoo Yeonha has been deepened.]</p>
 <p>I didn’t mind this change.</p>
 <p>“Anyways, I’ll take a look now.”</p>
 <p>I opened the suitcase.<br><em>Click. Click.</em><br>With an elegant sound, the case opened. A brilliant light erupted from the inside.</p>
 <p>“…Wow.”</p>
 <p>Sitting on top of a fancy red velvet was a platinum handgun and a magazine. It was even more beautiful than what I saw in the picture.</p>
 <p>“As promised, it’s the Desert Eagle with full attachments and a 60-round magazine of pinnacle grade magic bullets.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you. You can go now.”</p>
 <p>I no longer cared about Jin Sechan. Using my laptop, I checked my new weapon’s setting.<br><br></p>
 <p>===<br>[Desert Eagle]<br>[High rank] [Metal attribute]<br>A masterpiece handgun. Contains several added effects.<br>「Attack Power Amplification – 1/10」<br>「Low rank Weight Reduction Magic」<br>「Intermediate rank Recoil Control Magic」<br>===</p>
 <p>===<br>[Magic Bullet]<br>[Pinnacle grade] [Null attribute]<br>.44 Macon steel mana bullet with condensed high-purity mana.<br>「Attack Power – 4/10」<br>===<br><br></p>
 <p>I felt much better being able to read their descriptions.<br>Without having to modify the gun or the bullet, I felt like I could easily kill a low-intermediate rank monster. I should also be able to take Aether from the devil’s nest in Suwon.</p>
 <p>“Then I’ll be going.”</p>
 <p>“Ah, yes, take care.”</p>
 <p>After sending Jin Sechan off, I checked the amount of SP I had left.</p>
 <p>250.<br>Now, how should I spend this?<br><br></p>
 <p>**<br><br></p>
 <p>After leaving the coffee shop, Jin Sechan contacted Yoo Yeonha. She asked as soon as she picked up the call.</p>
 <p>—Did you deliver the item?</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>—Was there anything special about him?</p>
 <p>“That’s…”</p>
 <p>There wasn’t anything “special”, but there was something he found strange. No matter how much he thought about it, the man’s demeanor wasn’t what a 17 year old should have. Not to mention, it was almost as if he knew who Jin Sechan was…</p>
 <p>—Yes?</p>
 <p>“…No. There wasn’t anything special in particular.”</p>
 <p>But he couldn’t come to a decision with just that short exchange. After all, he was Cube’s cadet. Even Yoo Yeonha had an air of dignity and elegance that didn’t suit her age.</p>
 <p>—Yes, I understand. Thank you for your work, Sechan-ssi.</p>
 <p>“My pleasure.”</p>
 <p>With that, the call ended.<br>Though he wanted to talk a little longer, he decided to be content.</p>
