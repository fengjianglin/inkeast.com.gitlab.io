 <p><br></p>
 <p>The woman’s gaze seemed to be piercing her heart. It was the first time in a while that Jin Sahyuk was up against such formidable hostility. Yet, Jin Sahyuk met her eyes without shaking.</p>
 <p>Time flowed in silence.</p>
 <p>Jin Sahyuk was a fickle person. She might give up on something in one moment then change her mind in the next. As such, Jin Sahyuk spent a long time thinking about what to do. She decided that she couldn’t give up Kim Hajin.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be so mad. I’ll use him for a few years and return him.”</p>
 <p>She wasn’t sure what his exact ability was, but she knew that there was something special about Kim Hajin’s magic power from what she saw in Akatrina. She could tell because she was especially sensitive to magic power. To reconstruct Akatrina, such power was necessary.</p>
 <p>“…I won’t hear any more of this.”</p>
 <p>The woman spoke. Hot magic power stemming from rage and killing intent rose up like a tornado. Jin Sahyuk quickly covered herself with a barrier.</p>
 <p>“I won’t let you leave here alive either.”</p>
 <p>Shadows dyed the woman’s body black. Clear willingness to fight filled the air. Jin Sahyuk genuinely enjoyed this chilling precursor to a heated battle.</p>
 <p>“…Do what you want.”</p>
 <p>Jin Sahyuk had no plans to refuse a fight. Though she wasn’t confident in winning, she didn’t feel like she would lose either. Moreover, Jin Sahyuk wanted to estimate this woman’s strength. This was part of the reason she came to her.</p>
 <p>“If you can, that is.”</p>
 <p>The moment the woman finished her short speech, shadows rose up from the woman’s feet and enveloped the surrounding area. The woman’s ‘Shadow Barrier’ shut off Jin Sahyuk’s path of escape.</p>
 <p>“Pft.”</p>
 <p>Jin Sahyuk smirked and unleashed her magic power. <em>Guooooo…</em> Along with a crimson aura, hundreds of weapons formed in the air.</p>
 <p>A battlefield fiercer and deadlier than the Pandemonium Arena appeared. The two women glared at each other before starting the fight to the death.</p>
 <p>However…</p>
 <p>“…Huh? Boss?”</p>
 <p>A course voice rang out, pouring cold water on their tense bodies. Boss and Jin Sahyuk both turned to the source of the voice.</p>
 <p>“Is my probation over?”</p>
 <p>It was Cheok Jungyeong, who was put on probation inside Boss’ Shadow Barrier last week for killing Terror’s Djinns because they picked a fight with him.</p>
 <p>But Jin Sahyuk didn’t seem worried even when Cheok Jungyeong appeared. She believed the woman in front of her wouldn’t be the type to let someone else join a 1:1 fight.</p>
 <p>Boss spoke, “…Yes, your probation is over.”</p>
 <p>“Ehew~ Thank goodness. Oh right, your barrier is interesting no matter how many times I look at it.”</p>
 <p>Boss’ Shadow Barrier didn’t <em>alter</em> the surrounding space but rather <em>summoned</em> beings into it. This was why Jin Sahyuk and Boss met Cheok Jungyeong in this place.</p>
 <p>“…Gyeong.”</p>
 <p>“Huh?”</p>
 <p>While Boss and Cheok Jungyeong were talking, Jin Sahyuk loosened her muscles by stretching. However, she didn’t feel relaxed for long.</p>
 <p>“Beat her up.”</p>
 <p>“Oho?”</p>
 <p>“…What?”</p>
 <p>Cheok Jungyeong and Jin Sahyuk’s eyes widened. They were surprised for different reasons.</p>
 <p>“T-Two against one isn’t fair!”</p>
 <p>Jin Sahyuk pointed her fingers at Boss while shouting. But Cheok Jungyeong ignored her. He had been on probation for two weeks, during which he had not fought with anyone. He was currently starved for battle and was overjoyed that a worthy opponent was in front of him.</p>
 <p>“Kuhahaha—!”</p>
 <p>Cheok Jungyeong charged forward like a wild beast.</p>
 <p>“Damn it!”</p>
 <p>Jin Sahyuk quickly activated [Reality Manipulation] to try to escape the Shadow Barrier, but Boss and Cheok Jungyeong didn’t let her do as she pleased.<br><em>Kwaaaaa—!</em><br>Cheok Jungyeong’s Energy Blast destroyed the circular pathway Jin Sahyuk forcefully created.</p>
 <p>“Don’t run away—!”</p>
 <p>Cheok Jungyeong shouted happily and shot his fist towards Jin Sahyuk’s face.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>[Orden’s Palace]</p>
 <p>Excluding Toji, the other three humanoid monsters, Tigris, Xphil, and Doloren, returned to Orden’s palace. They had successfully and valiantly completed Orden’s order to cause havoc in specific countries.</p>
 <p>“Ah— I’m bored—”</p>
 <p>But Tigris wasn’t content. The other two humanoid monsters felt the same way. They wanted to have more fun killing humans, displaying their overwhelming strength, and bathing in their sense of superiority.</p>
 <p>“The palace is boring—”</p>
 <p>Orden had ordered their return before they could fulfill even half of their desires. Although they felt annoyed, they had no choice but to follow their king’s command.</p>
 <p>“What the hell happened to Toji?”</p>
 <p>Doloren murmured as she played with a human head she took as a souvenir. The head belonged to Peindal, a high-rank grade-2 Hero.</p>
 <p>“That idiot— I’m sure he fell into a trap— I’m sure he’ll find his way back—”</p>
 <p>“Right? Toji won’t die so easily with his tough body.”</p>
 <p>“I’m tougher and harder to kill—”</p>
 <p>They chatted with each other as they walked towards the king’s court. Standing In front of the large gate before the main court was a praying mantis. It was Kurukuru who had one wing and arm severed.</p>
 <p>“…Ew, gross. It irks me every time I see him. Why does he look like that?”</p>
 <p>“That’s what I wanted to say—”</p>
 <p>Doloren frowned as she stared at Kurukuru. Tigris approached Kurukuru, thinking that he looked grosser up front.<br>Kurukuru muttered as he glared at them.</p>
 <p>“Kururu, kururu….”</p>
 <p>“What is he saying— Retard who can’t even talk—”</p>
 <p>“Kururururu.”</p>
 <p>Doloren translated Kurukuru’s words.</p>
 <p>“Why did you come so late? You should have come the moment King gave his command, is what he’s saying.”</p>
 <p>“…Pft.”</p>
 <p>Tigris sneered.</p>
 <p>“A mere praying mantis, you’re not worthy—”</p>
 <p>Tigris raised his large hand and slapped Kurukuru.<br><em>KWANG—!</em><br>Kurukuru flew to the side and rolled on the floor.</p>
 <p>“A weak, lowly praying mantis that can’t even talk—”</p>
 <p>Tigris snorted and walked into the royal court. Doloren stared at Kurukuru with a small smile before following Tigris inside.</p>
 <p>“…Kururu.”</p>
 <p>“Lord Kurukuru!”</p>
 <p>Servant-level humanoid monsters helped Kurukuru up. After staggering up, Kurukuru stared at the three humanoid monsters standing in front of his king.<br>His king was greeting the arrogant monsters who came late with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Kurururu….”</p>
 <p>Kurukuru clenched his teeth until his jaw swelled.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>[Gangwondo, Underground Bunker]</p>
 <p>The training for the Orden Assassination Mission ended. Inside the simulated Orden’s palace, Team 3 had successfully defeated the Minotaur.</p>
 <p>But their teamwork couldn’t be called perfect. Shen Yuan and Yi Jiyoon were killed before they could even reach the boss, ‘Minotaur’, and Kim Suho ended up defeating the boss on his own.</p>
 <p>“Why are the normal mobs so strong….”</p>
 <p>Yi Jiyoon sighed and massaged her sore muscles. Meanwhile, Shin Jonghak was staring at Chae Nayun. She was busily writing something down on her notebook.</p>
 <p>“Hey, what are you doing?”</p>
 <p>Hearing Shin Jonghak, both Yi Jiyoon and Kim Suho turned around.</p>
 <p>“…Huh?”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun stopped writing, then smirked.</p>
 <p>“I’m talking with Master.”</p>
 <p>“…Master?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, this notebook works like the Tower’s communication letter.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun was using the notebook to communicate with an old man who had become her master before she noticed. Although they usually exchanged chit-chat, there were times when she received valuable advice as well.</p>
 <p>“…Oh? Who’s the person on the other side?”</p>
 <p>Yi Jiyoon’s eyebrows danced playfully.</p>
 <p>“I told you, it’s my master.”</p>
 <p>“Master? Hero Yoo Sihyuk?”</p>
 <p>“No, he’s someone hu~ge that you guys don’t know about.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun wondered how they would react if they found out that her master was Heynckes but decided to withhold the information. She shrugged, then put the notebook away.</p>
 <p>“Oh right, I have to contact Hajin… Ah.”</p>
 <p>Kim Suho’s next few words made Chae Nayun’s heart sink. Kim Suho, who had murmured to himself subconsciously, paused after realizing what he said.</p>
 <p>“…Oh~? What about Kim Hajin~?”</p>
 <p>Yi Jiyoon put on a mysterious smile and skipped over to Kim Suho.</p>
 <p>“Uh, well… nothing.”</p>
 <p>Kim Suho let out a dry cough and gave an evasive answer. He wanted to thank Hajin for all the help he received, but he didn’t have the chance to the last time they met since Yun Seung-Ah was also there.</p>
 <p>“Kuhum, anyways…”</p>
 <p>He turned to Chae Nayun who was staring at him intently.</p>
 <p>“Chae Nayun, don’t let Boss find out about that notebook. She said no electronics, and that’s not that different.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun nodded with a somewhat bad aftertaste.</p>
 <p>“What’s not different from electronics?”</p>
 <p>It was then that their ‘boss’ appeared.<br>Chae Nayun and the rest of Team 3 froze, and before they could react, Yun Seung-Ah released her magic power to snatch Chae Nayun’s notebook.</p>
 <p>“A-Ah! Give it back!”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun, of course, protested strongly.</p>
 <p>“Quiet. Prohibited items will be confiscated on discovery.”</p>
 <p>Yun Seung-Ah easily suppressed all dissent and began to read the notebook with a grin.</p>
 <p>“Let’s see who our Nayun is dating~”</p>
 <p>But Yun Seung-Ah’s smile quickly disappeared because of a certain name written in the notebook.<br><em>Ssk— Ssk—</em><br>She turned a few pages over before raising her head and murmuring in a daze.</p>
 <p>“Heyn… Heynckes? Is this… the Heynckes I know?”<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>[21F – Card Kingdom]</p>
 <p>I used 150,000 TP to pull three 8-star cards and one 9-star card.<br>Because of the setting that ‘8-star and 9-star cards were limited’, I could only get so much even with my luck. Of course, I wasn’t complaining, especially since they were all effective goods.</p>
 <p>“[Anything Checkbook]…”</p>
 <p>I walked through the streets as I read the descriptions of the cards I pulled.</p>
 <p>===<br>[Anything Checkbook] [8-star] ＊Effective Good＊<br>—A checkbook that can pay out anything. The receiver of this check must also carry out what he was paid for.<br>===</p>
 <p>First was the 8-star [Anything Checkbook]. Most checkbooks handled ‘money’, but this magical checkbook was different. Not only did this checkbook handle ‘TP’ and ‘magic power’, but it also handled trust and feelings as something that could be valued and given out.</p>
 <p>‘What do I use this for…?’</p>
 <p>Just as I was pondering…</p>
 <p>“Oooooooh~ Who’s this~?”</p>
 <p>Someone ran up to me while acting all excited.</p>
 <p>“My, if it isn’t our dear master craftsman~”</p>
 <p>With a blooming smile, Medea appeared with a nasally voice.</p>
 <p>“Great~ Perfect timing~”</p>
 <p>Medea acted like our meeting was a complete coincidence, but it didn’t take a genius to figure out that that wasn’t the case.</p>
 <p>“Ah, yes.”</p>
 <p>I looked at Medea with a flustered look. Seeing that she entered the 21st floor with her status as an administrator, it seemed her ‘descent’ into the Phenomenon Realm was happening soon.</p>
 <p>“…What do you need?”</p>
 <p>“Eh~? No~ It’s not like I need something~”</p>
 <p>Medea smiled brightly and handed me a document.</p>
 <p>“Here, take this. I was waiting until you came back.”</p>
 <p>“…?”</p>
 <p>I glanced at the document.<br>The words, [Complete Transfer of Prestige], were written across it.<br>My eyes almost popped out of my eye sockets, but I swallowed hard and calmed myself down.</p>
 <p>“What’s this?”</p>
 <p>“I brought it just for you. I don’t need Prestige anymore.”</p>
 <p>“…You’re descending?”</p>
 <p>“Yep~! Uhuhuhu, uhuhuhu.”</p>
 <p>Medea laughed like she had the world under her feet. She even twirled like a ballerina.</p>
 <p>“So, to finalize my descent, I was wondering if you could make me a magician’s robe and a ceremonial dress to wear underneath it~”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>“I’ll prepare whatever material you need~”</p>
 <p>Medea just looked too happy.<br>I stared at her and pondered. To make a magician’s robe and ceremonial dress that she would be satisfied with, I would have to dedicate 2~3 hours of my time every day for at least one month.<br>Of course, that wasn’t such a difficult task. Medea could also become a powerful ally to humanity once she descended.<br>The problem wasn’t time, but what would happen to Earth if she descended.</p>
 <p>“You will, right~?”</p>
 <p>Medea urged for an answer, and I concluded my thoughts.</p>
 <p>“…I can.”</p>
 <p>“Woaaaa~”</p>
 <p>Medea twirled and giggled like a little kid. Her brain seemed to be missing a screw.</p>
 <p>“But I need you to make a vow.”</p>
 <p>“I’m coming back alive~ alive~ aliiiiive~”</p>
 <p>“…Hello?”</p>
 <p>“Yeees~?”</p>
 <p>I took out the ‘Covenant Dagger’ that Heynckes left with me. Medea’s eyes widened.</p>
 <p>“Eh, what’s up with the blade?”</p>
 <p>“In exchange for the robe and the dress, I want you to make a vow.”</p>
 <p>I unleashed spirit power.</p>
 <p>“Spirit Power Copier.”</p>
 <p>[You activated ‘Miracle – Spirit Power Copier’.]</p>
 <p>Yellow aura condensed in front of me and formed the shape of a copy machine.</p>
 <p>[Summary – a copier that can copy anything.]<br>[Activation Condition – reveal the name of the skill.]<br>[Consumption Value – depends on what is being copied.]<br>[Effect – copies something with spirit power (To copy a living being, you must put the living being inside the copier.)]</p>
 <p>“…What’s that?”</p>
 <p>Medea furrowed her brows.</p>
 <p>“It’s nothing much, so don’t be too worried.”</p>
 <p>I put Heynckes’ dagger into the copier.</p>
 <p>[Attempting to copy ‘Covenant Dagger’…]<br>[Problem occurred! You cannot copy this item with your spirit power.]<br>[Use Stigma Overclocking or set a penalty with Setting Intervention.]</p>
 <p>“Setting Intervention.”</p>
 <p>“…You’re talking to yourself, you know~”</p>
 <p>I added a penalty to the Covenant Dagger.</p>
 <p>First, it can only be used on Medea and Kim Hajin.<br>Second, requires 4 streaks of Stigma.<br>Third, both sides must carry the same weight of the vow.</p>
 <p>[Covenant Dagger has been copied imperfectly.]</p>
 <p>“Mm, there. We just need to feed it our blood and make a vow.”</p>
 <p>Medea’s face returned to what it was in the past. It was the face she had when she was annoyed with me.</p>
 <p>“What vow?”</p>
 <p>“It’s simple.”</p>
 <p>This was necessary to ensure Medea becomes an ally. Without something to tie her down, I didn’t know what she would do once she descended on Earth. With her fickle and curious nature, she might experiment with humans and monsters to operate some kind of a chimera business.</p>
 <p>“My vow will be: ‘I will make Medea the most beautiful robe and ceremonial dress.’”</p>
 <p>“…Most beautiful~?”</p>
 <p>Wariness disappeared from Medea’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“Yes, and yours will be, ‘I will not do anything that will harm humanity if I descend.’”</p>
 <p>I handed the copied Covenant Dagger to Medea.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>On the other hand, in a dark space of an unknown place.</p>
 <p>“…Auu.”</p>
 <p>Jin Sahyuk groaned as she rolled on the ground. Her final attempt to escape seemed to have been successful as she couldn’t feel any presences around her.</p>
 <p>“Haa… haa… huu.”</p>
 <p>She collected her breath and checked her physical condition.<br>Fractured bones, broken ribs, shattered teeth, and flowing blood…<br>Her eyes were also damaged, hindering her vision, but thankfully none of her injuries were life-threatening.</p>
 <p>“Those cowards….”</p>
 <p>She spat out blood and cursed before starting to heal her body. First, she restored her eyes with her Authority, ‘Reality Manipulation’.<br>As she regained clear vision of her surroundings, a raspy voice entered her ears.</p>
 <p>“Coward? You’re an idiot.”</p>
 <p>It wasn’t a voice she recognized. Jin Sahyuk shot her eyes open and turned towards the direction of the voice.<br>Jain was smiling brightly and staring at Jin Sahyuk.</p>
 <p>“…Who are you?”</p>
 <p>“Me? You know me. It’s Rain.”</p>
 <p>“…Rain?”</p>
 <p>“Yep. I guess my face is different from back then. Of course, my real name is a secret.”</p>
 <p>‘Who is this woman?’ Jin Sahyuk wondered when she suddenly remembered something. A woman who introduced herself as Rain had visited Bell long ago.</p>
 <p>“Do you know how hard it was for me to have you live~? I had to convince her by telling her that you’ll be the perfect bait to drag Bell out of hiding~”</p>
 <p>“…What? Bell? Bait?”</p>
 <p>Jin Sahyuk forced herself to get up.<br><em>Crack— Crack—</em><br>Her broken bones screamed in pain, but it wasn’t unbearable.</p>
 <p>“Yep. You have to be alive to bait and kill Bell… Anyways, are you done healing yourself?”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Jin Sahyuk nodded silently. Jain smiled brightly, then quickly moved and twisted Jin Sahyuk’s wrists back.</p>
 <p>“What…!”</p>
 <p>Then, she placed a [Magic Power Suppressor] on her wrists and ankles.</p>
 <p>“You fucker! What are you doing!?”</p>
 <p>“Hm~? Oh, I’m just making you into proper bait~ What bait would be allowed to use magic power~?”</p>
 <p>“You bitch!”</p>
 <p>Jin Sahyuk began to struggle violently, but Jain easily knocked her over by tripping her feet.<br><em>Thud!</em><br>Jin Sahyuk fell face first on the ground. However, she refused to yield and shook her body side to side. She almost looked like a shrimp flopping on dry land.</p>
 <p>“Let go of me!”</p>
 <p><em>Flop, flop. Splash, splash.</em></p>
 <p>“You cowards, 2 on 1 wasn’t enough!?”</p>
 <p><em>Flop, flop. Splash, splash.</em></p>
 <p>Jain looked down and smiled at Jin Sahyuk who was acting like she actually became a bait. Then, she spoke to Boss who she believed was watching from somewhere.</p>
 <p>“Boss, I got a shrimp ready for you.”</p>
