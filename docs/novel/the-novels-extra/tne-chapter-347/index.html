 <p>Eren started as a squire under Puharen’s order of knights as his master had offered a knight’s ‘oath of guarantee’.</p>
 <p>Of course, it wasn’t easy. As a squire, his main duty was cleaning and cooking, and he only had an hour before sleep to practice his sword.</p>
 <p>But Eren didn’t give up. In fact, he saw everything optimistically. Though he was young, his well-built body allowed him to perform menial tasks without getting tired, and he considered watching powerful knights train as a great learning opportunity. Eren gave his all in what little time he had every night to train.</p>
 <p>Thankfully, Puharen’s knights didn’t ignore the boy’s effort. It didn’t take long until Eren was invited to train along with the others.</p>
 <p>Although the knight society was rough and crude, Eren was able to grow quickly because of it.</p>
 <p>But luck was far from Eren’s tale. As if meeting his master used up all his luck, he stopped being graced by it.<br>Soon, Eren found out that his master was sick with an incurable illness. It was why he was pushed away to Eren’s rural village in the first place. Eren’s master had wanted to experience a wider world with the time he had remaining.</p>
 <p>It was during his travels that he found the most perfect disciple and returned to the small world of the capital.</p>
 <p>Although the master was happy, Eren was distressed. Eren was stronger than others his age, but he was still a child at heart. It was too soon for eternal farewells, and he couldn’t hide the pain in his heart.<br>Eren visited his master every night, watching him weaken on what would be his death bed.</p>
 <p>Then one day, as Eren was swallowing his tears next to his master, he met a princess named ‘Prihi’.</p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p>[Earth – Korea]</p>
 <p>I sent Observers all over the world to collect information. It didn’t take long for me to realize that the situation was far worse than what I had imagined.</p>
 <p>—Oi, Black, wait there. Red over here is about to begin an important battle. I’ll contact you later.</p>
 <p>Cheok Jungyeong and Jin Seyeon, who entered Vassago’s Colosseum, seemed to have their own plan. But Earth’s society was crumbling under the great evil that descended.</p>
 <p>[A devil has descended in Tokyo. This bird-shaped devil who calls itself ‘Phenex’ has begun to sing a song of death in Tokyo’s sky…]<br>[‘Vual’ is knocking on the walls of Vladivostok…]</p>
 <p>“Spartan?”</p>
 <p>Spartan appeared as soon as I called him, gently landing on my shoulder. He seemed a bit bigger than the last time I saw him.</p>
 <p>—Prrrrr</p>
 <p>Spartan purred and acted cutely. I smiled bitterly and stroked his head.<br>Unfortunately, I didn’t have the time to play around.</p>
 <p><em>Guooooooo….</em></p>
 <p>A huge amount of magic power began to erupt from Morax’s spot of descent. It wasn’t a devil’s demonic energy, but the clean magic power of nature. This four-colored magic power clashed with Morax’s energy.<br>I instantly knew this was Chae Joochul’s power.</p>
 <p>—Where are you?</p>
 <p>At that moment, Yoo Yeonha’s voice rang out from my smartwatch.</p>
 <p>“I’m watching Morax. What about you?”</p>
 <p>I replied as I took out [Black Lotus’s Bow]</p>
 <p>—I’m in an underground bunker.</p>
 <p>“Did you find out what’s happening?”</p>
 <p>—Mostly. It looks like Earth is on the brink of destruction.</p>
 <p>“…Oh yeah?”</p>
 <p>I chuckled. She wasn’t completely wrong since Baal had once destroyed a world in three days. Since he should have spent the first day summoning his subordinates like he was doing now, the actual time he took the destroy that world was probably less.</p>
 <p>“Huu.”</p>
 <p>I sighed and checked my Stigma. As I thought, I didn’t have even a single ounce of it left.<br>Because of [Time Reversal]’s side-effect, it was slow to recover even with the [Orb of Regeneration]. I could use Overclocking to forcefully create more… but I would have to wait for a good time to do so.</p>
 <p>—How are things on your side? I thought you’d know something.</p>
 <p>“Ah, well… I don’t, really.”</p>
 <p>—Then I guess we’re doomed. Because I can’t think of anything.</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha sent the information she collected over the smartwatch.</p>
 <p>Russia, Vladivostok – Vual<br>Japan, Tokyo – Phenex<br>Spain, Madrid – Astaroth<br>All of Europe – Valac’s Army<br>Korea – Baal and Morax</p>
 <p>Thankfully, Leraje and Vassago seemed less hostile. Other devils were like boss monsters, but these two were like quests.</p>
 <p>“I’m trying to come up with something. I’ll let you know once I do.”</p>
 <p>—Got it.</p>
 <p><em>Kwaaaaa—!</em></p>
 <p>Morax’s arm and the Immortal’s fist clashed. A huge shockwave spread out in all directions, and Aether created a barrier around me automatically.</p>
 <p>Immediately afterward, a golden flash of light and a huge blade of magic power cut through the air. Kim Suho and Chae Nayun had joined the battle.</p>
 <p>I raised [Black Lotus’s Bow] as I continued to watch them. As [Athena’s Mystic Arrow] was destroyed when it toppled Baal’s castle, I nocked a dark ore arrow.</p>
 <p>It was then.</p>
 <p>“Hey.”</p>
 <p>A woman’s voice suddenly flowed into my ears. My head cooled down instantly, and I rolled my eyes over to the side.</p>
 <p>“It’s been a while.”</p>
 <p><em>Gulp.</em> I swallowed hard and checked the woman’s face. Then, I let out a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>“Geez, you surprised me.”</p>
 <p>“Hahaha.”</p>
 <p>The woman laughed playfully as she poked my cheeks. I took a step back and glared at her.</p>
 <p>“What is it?”</p>
 <p>It was Medea.<br>After appearing out of the blue, she handed me a piece of paper.</p>
 <p>“Here, take it.”</p>
 <p>“What’s this? Rather than that, go help them fight Morax. You haven’t forgotten about our contract, right?”</p>
 <p>“It’s a message from Crevon.”</p>
 <p>“…Huh?”</p>
 <p>I looked down at the paper. I quickly snatched it from Medea’s hand and scanned it.</p>
 <p>[Have you been well, Kim Hajin? This is Crevon Empire’s Duchess, Tomer. That’s right, we’re no longer a kingdom, but an empire…]</p>
 <p>Medea spoke as I was reading the message.</p>
 <p>“I read it too. To summarize, Crevon wants to help, but it seems like they’re not in a situation to do so.”</p>
 <p>“W-Why?”</p>
 <p>Medea shrugged her shoulders.</p>
 <p>“They’re powerless. To be exact, they don’t have the energy necessary to leave the Tower and descend on Earth.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>“I spent hundreds of years preparing for my descent. That’s how hard it is to leave that place. How annoying. I came here after all that effort and look at this place….”</p>
 <p>Medea’s explanation quickly devolved into her grumbling about her misfortunes. I, of course, ignored most of it. There was only one thing in my mind at this moment.</p>
 <p>[Dimensional Entropy]</p>
 <p>A source of energy powerful enough to allow Crevon’s army to descend to Earth.</p>
 <p>“What a shame, I thought I’d get to enjoy a longer life this time—”</p>
 <p>Ignoring Medea, who was still complaining away, I called Yoo Yeonha.</p>
 <p>“Yoo Yeonha, are you there?”</p>
 <p>A clattering sound rang out before Yoo Yeonha finally replied.</p>
 <p>—…Yes?</p>
 <p>“What were you doing? Planting an apple tree?”</p>
 <p>—W-What? N-No, do you think I’m an idiot? An apple tree, ha, haha.</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Her strange reaction made me a bit curious, but that wasn’t the important part right now.</p>
 <p>“Alright, listen to me.”</p>
 <p>—Huh? Ah.. okay.</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha quickly became serious. I paused for a moment and turned to Medea.</p>
 <p>“Medea-ssi, can you pass this message to Crevon for me?”</p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p>[Russia – Vladivostok]</p>
 <p>Russia’s city, Vladivostok, was peaceful just yesterday. It was fine even when Valac’s army was invading Europe and Earth was experiencing a rapid Demon Realm Transformation.</p>
 <p>Vladivostok was geographically close to Korea and due to the high number of Dungeons it had, it was a strategic location visited by many of Korea’s large guilds. Recently, people’s assessment of Vladivostok had risen greatly to the point it outclassed Moscow, Russia’s capital. Many key government facilities had even moved to Vladivostok.</p>
 <p>The reason was simple. During the past six months where Earth was wrapped in chaos, Vladivostok became famous as a safe haven.</p>
 <p>Russian Heroes, advanced technology, and the well-known ‘Vladivostok Walls’ weren’t the reason for this change.</p>
 <p>It was because the monsters in its area had been wiped clean by an unknown force. Vladivostok’s residents called this mysterious force their guardian deity. Unsurprisingly, dozens of temples, shrines, and churches had been built in the city to worship this unknown god.</p>
 <p>Vladivostok’s residents and the Russian government wished for these miracles to continue and hoped that this guardian deity would protect them from all evils.</p>
 <p>…However, Russia’s most famous Hero, Gennadi, thought today would be the last day of this mysterious protection.</p>
 <p>“…Sir Gennadi, we’re awaiting your command.”</p>
 <p>Gennadi was looking down from Vladivostok’s impenetrable wall. On the other side were a huge army and a caped devil commanding it.</p>
 <p>“So that’s Vual…”</p>
 <p>Gennadi grit his teeth. He knew there was nothing he could do against such a powerful force. His mind began to imagine Vladivostok being razed by the endless sea of an army in front of him.</p>
 <p>—Open the gate.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the devil’s hoarse voice rang out across the horizon. The voice carried a hint of demonic energy, shaking the walls and causing ordinary soldiers to collapse.</p>
 <p>—I will say it three times only.</p>
 <p>Gennadi fell in thought. He couldn’t imagine Vual sparing them even if they opened the gate.</p>
 <p>—Open the gate.</p>
 <p>Gennadi began to hate himself for his powerlessness.</p>
 <p>—Open the….</p>
 <p>But at that moment, the devil’s eerie voice suddenly cut off.<br>A gust of wind blew, and Gennadi raised his head.</p>
 <p>“…?”</p>
 <p><em>Chwaaaaa—</em><br>The gust was cutting Vual’s army apart. Soon, the gust turned into a storm, and the formation of Vual’s army was thrown into disarray.</p>
 <p><em>Boom—!</em></p>
 <p>Vual’s soldiers screamed in pain as violent winds cut their limbs apart. Even Vual had no choice but to scan the area for a clue.</p>
 <p>“…Hm.”</p>
 <p>In the middle of the battlefield, he found a loach squirming around faster than the speed of sound.</p>
 <p>“A mutt?”</p>
 <p>That’s what Vual thought. He tried to grab the mutt using his demonic energy, but it squirmed away.</p>
 <p>“…You!”</p>
 <p>Vual furrowed his brows. His demonic energy split into multiple branches, chasing after the mutt.<br>The mutt ran but was eventually caught by the demonic energy hurling from all directions. No, that’s what everyone thought at first.</p>
 <p><em>Plunk—!</em></p>
 <p>A thud rang out, and the demonic energy was struck back. Neither magic power nor demonic energy was at work. The ‘mutt’ had only used its ‘strength’ to do so.</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Vual couldn’t understand what he was seeing. He stopped attacking and simply observed the mutt.</p>
 <p>—Krrrr, Krrrr</p>
 <p>He caught a closer glimpse of the mutt – a praying mantis with a strange cry.<br>However, Vual ignored the bipedal insect.</p>
 <p>“You dare look at me with such eyes.”</p>
 <p>Instead, he looked at the existence watching him from behind the mantis. He couldn’t stand the condescending look of that existence.</p>
 <p>“…Answer me.”</p>
 <p>The devil commanded. However, the existence remained silent. Its arrogant eyes also remained unchanged.</p>
 <p>The existence standing behind the mantis was a lonely king with only one vassal – Orden.</p>
