 <p><br></p>
 <p>When I opened my eyes, I saw an unfamiliar ceiling. Rather than unfamiliar, it was more luxurious than anything else. Catholic frescoes adorned the walls and ceilings, and when I focused, the murals’ colors became clearer through resonance of mana.<br>It was quite a mysterious mechanism.</p>
 <p>“You’re up?”</p>
 <p>While I was staring at the frescoes in a daze, a voice rang out. Turning around, I saw Boss sitting on a chair.<br>She sipped on her tea and looked at me.</p>
 <p>“You slept for two days.”</p>
 <p>“…!”</p>
 <p>Hearing these words, I quickly raised my upper body. Many things could have happened in two days.<br>However, Boss was calm.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, the cover up was perfect.”</p>
 <p>There were many things I wanted to ask her but couldn’t. After looking at me for a while, Boss smiled lightly.</p>
 <p>“The funeral is starting today.”</p>
 <p>“Ah….”</p>
 <p>A dazed voice came out of my mouth. At the same time, memories of the moment I pulled the trigger resurfaced.<br>Chae Jinyoon’s funeral.<br>Did I have the right to go there?<br>I clenched my teeth. Suddenly, a strong urge overwhelmed me. I rummaged through my pocket, but I couldn’t find my pack of cigarettes.</p>
 <p>“Your weapon is here.”</p>
 <p>Misunderstanding my motion, Boss pointed at the shelf. My Desert Eagle was sitting on it. I carefully grabbed it. Likely because it was clad in Aether, it wasn’t broken anywhere.</p>
 <p>“…So where are we?”</p>
 <p>As I said that, I put the Desert Eagle into Stigma’s magic power. Seeing the handgun transform into a current of mana and seep into my arm, Boss widened her eyes.</p>
 <p>“That’s quite an interesting storage method.”</p>
 <p>“It’s nothing much.”</p>
 <p>I shrugged. Boss grinned and continued her explanation proudly.</p>
 <p>“This is my mansion built on an island in the East Sea. Ah, just in case you’re misunderstanding, this entire island is my home.”</p>
 <p>“…Wow, that’s amazing.”</p>
 <p>Since Boss liked being praised, I exaggerated a bit.</p>
 <p>“Huhu, why don’t we open the windows?”</p>
 <p>Boss opened the windows proudly. I looked outside at the gem-like ocean, clear sky, and salty breeze.<br>It was indeed a scenery worth bragging about.</p>
 <p>“…Wait, then how do we get back?”</p>
 <p>“Hm? You don’t have a Personal Portal?”</p>
 <p>Boss was clearly bragging.<br>Personal Portal.<br>It was a system for the rich. If I remembered correctly, there was one in Busan.</p>
 <p>“Then I’d like to head home.”</p>
 <p>“…You can stay a bit longer.”</p>
 <p>“There’s someone waiting for me.”</p>
 <p>“I see.”</p>
 <p>Boss reluctantly led me outside.<br>The unknown island I was on had many attendants running about. However, none of them were humans. They were puppets created by Boss’ magic power that could only perform set tasks.<br>Boss was living amidst puppets she created herself.</p>
 <p>“It’s a lonely place.”</p>
 <p>“Sometimes, you need to get used to loneliness.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>I walked through the garden towards Boss’ Personal Portal.<br>After walking for about 10 minutes, enjoying the island’s beautiful scenery, I could see the so-called Personal Portal in the distance.<br>Although it was smaller than what Portal Stations had, it was still a high-tech magical tool that could perform as well as other Portals.</p>
 <p>“I just have to go in?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, it should be connected to Busan. I’ll come with you. There’s something I need to take care of in England.”</p>
 <p>Boss made a call. Soon, the Portal was activated, and we stepped inside.<br>Once we arrived in Busan’s Portal Station, we went through the VIP-only path and stopped at a crossroad.<br>Boss’ destination was England, and mine was Seoul.</p>
 <p>“Then I’ll see you later.”</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>After exchanging a light goodbye, I walked away.<br>Closing my eyes, I felt the magic power of the Portal engulfing my body.<br><em>Shooong—</em><br>When I opened my eyes, I could see the now familiar sight of Seoul Portal Station.<br>I left the station without much thought, then bought three packs of cigarettes at a nearby convenience store.<br>Chae Jinyoon’s funeral should be held in Daehyun’s funeral home. I located it using the Book of Truth and walked there.</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>I could see the silent and somber funeral home.<br>But I couldn’t bring myself to go in.<br>I also didn’t think I could break through the guards standing outside.<br>So, I just decided to watch from the distance. I told myself that I’d go back once my heart calmed down.</p>
 <p>Standing under a nearby tree, I took out a cigarette. After lighting it without a lighter, I took a deep breath. A puff of smoke entered my lungs.<br>One, then two… I subconsciously began to smoke again and again.</p>
 <p>“Hm?”</p>
 <p>Then suddenly, a fourth visitor came to pay respect to the deceased.<br>I saw Yoo Yeonha walking into the funeral home.<br>Although I didn’t meet her eyes, I felt an unknown sense of foreboding. I felt like I had to leave before it was too late.<br>However, it already was too late.</p>
 <p>“…Ah.”</p>
 <p>A dazed voice came out of my mouth.<br>Chae Nayun walked out of the entrance. Looking around the funeral home, our eyes met.<br>Her eyes were filled with tears.<br>When I saw her face, my feet refused to move.</p>
 <p><em>Tap, tap.</em><br>Chae Nayun walked towards me, wearing a mourning dress.<br>Her movements felt slow, and the sound of her footsteps were all too clear.</p>
 <p>“…Kim Hajin.”</p>
 <p>She arrived in front of me before I noticed and called my name.<br>Not knowing what to do, I maintained my silence.</p>
 <p>“How did you find out? Did Yoo Yeonha tell you?”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun smiled forcibly. She was trying hard to pretend like she was fine.</p>
 <p>“By the way, are you a delinquent? Why are you smoking?”</p>
 <p>However, her forced smile made her face look all the more contorted.</p>
 <p>“Why aren’t you answering… hey, let me have that.”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Chae Nayun reached out to take my cigarette.</p>
 <p>“What? Are you crazy?”</p>
 <p>I blurted out subconsciously. I threw the cigarette on the ground and stepped on it. Chae Nayun didn’t look down at the cigarette. Her gaze was fixated on me.</p>
 <p>“Does smoking make it better?”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun suddenly asked.<br>Her voice was shaking, and a stream of tears flowed down from her eyes.<br>Immediately, my vision turned hazy.</p>
 <p>“…Why are you crying?”</p>
 <p>Only when she told me did I realized I was crying.</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>I wiped my tears with one hand.<br>Chae Nayun walked up to me one step at a time.<br>Soon, she was only a single step away from me. Our bodies were practically touching.<br>I had to push her away, but I couldn’t bring myself to do so.<br>My heart couldn’t follow what my brain was telling me to do.<br>Chae Nayun was crying. In front of her tears, my body was frozen and unable to move.</p>
 <p>“What… what should I do now?”</p>
 <p>Sobbing quietly, she lowered her head to hide her flowing tears.<br>Then, her forehead touched my chest.<br>I couldn’t breathe.<br>Suddenly, I remembered what I thought about before.<br>That as long as I wasn’t found out, I could maintain this relationship.</p>
 <p>“I, I….”</p>
 <p>But seeing Chae Nayun crying like a child, I realized that that was impossible in the first place.</p>
 <p>“Huaaang….”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun put her arms around me. Our bodies touched, and she cried in my embrace.<br>I was in pain. It felt like my heart was going to burst. I tried to push her away, but she didn’t let go. In fact, she drew even closer. The pain I felt only grew stronger by the second.</p>
 <p>“What, what do I do about Oppa?”</p>
 <p>She finally burst into tears. Unable to hold herself back any longer, she trembled uncontrollably.</p>
 <p>“Oppa, Oppa, Oppa….”</p>
 <p>Her grief-stricken sobbing became poison that seeped into my body.</p>
 <p>“Poor Oppa… what am I supposed to do… uaang….”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>I couldn’t bear to watch her sorrowful trembling.<br>Her body weighed down on me.<br>I knew all too well that I had no right to comfort her. I was someone who didn’t belong here… However, before I even realized what I was doing, my arms were tightened around her. Chae Nayun dug into my body, as though she was trying to fill the emptiness in her heart with me.</p>
 <p>“If I, if I… Huaaang—”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun’s tears wet my chest.<br>My tears flowed down to her shoulders.<br>The cold winter breeze blew against us, and the bitterness of the cigarette smoke engulfed us.</p>
 <p>“Ah, aaah….”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun wasn’t able to withstand her sadness. Her legs gave out, and soon, she crumbled down from the depths of her heart.<br>It was then that I finally found what I could say.</p>
 <p>“…Sorry.”</p>
 <p>That was the only thing I could tell her.</p>
 <p>“I’m… sorry….”<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>Yoo Yeonha watched the two from a distance.<br>The situation was too melancholic and somber to be called a touching reunion.</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>All sorts of complicated thoughts flashed through Yoo Yeonha’s head.<br>If one day, Chae Nayun found out the truth.<br>If one day, Kim Hajin found out the truth.<br>Would their story come to a sad ending?<br>Or would they overcome all odds and achieve happiness?</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha didn’t try to come up with an answer.<br>She put the matter of the future to rest.</p>
 <p>“…Eh?”</p>
 <p>When she was about to go back to the funeral home, Chae Nayun suddenly lost strength and collapsed.<br>She had undoubtedly fainted.<br>Yoo Yeonha quickly ran up to them.</p>
 <p>“Is she okay?!”</p>
 <p>The moment she yelled out, her eyes met Kim Hajin’s.<br>Yoo Yeonha shuddered inadvertently.<br>His eyes were frighteningly hollow.<br><br></p>
 <p>**<br><br></p>
 <p>Leaving Chae Nayun to Yoo Yeonha, I came back home.<br>An apartment in Seoul’s Seocho District, the home where Evandel and Hayang were waiting.<br>Standing in front of the door, I pressed the password.<br><em>Beebeebeep—</em><br>Before the door even opened, I could hear a bustling sound inside.<br>I didn’t go inside on purpose.</p>
 <p>—Who is it?</p>
 <p>Hearing the password go through but the door remaining closed, Evandel murmured quizzically. I grinned and opened the door.</p>
 <p>“I’m home.”</p>
 <p>From my perspective, not even half a day had passed since I last saw them, but from Evandel’s perspective, she was seeing me for the first time in two days.<br>Evandel smiled brightly and ran into my embrace.</p>
 <p>“Hajin~!”</p>
 <p>I got on my knees and hugged her.<br>Evandel was light and warm.<br>Then, I suddenly wondered.<br>Did I hug Evandel? Or did Evandel hug me?<br>I felt something rising up from the bottom of my heart.<br>I shuddered at the constraining pain.</p>
 <p>“Hajin, why were you so late? I was waiting.”</p>
 <p>“…Sorry, something came up.”</p>
 <p>As Evandel tried to get out of my embrace, I held her tighter.</p>
 <p>“Ak.”</p>
 <p>“Did you eat well?”</p>
 <p>“Un, we ordered food. By the way, it’s getting stuffy.”</p>
 <p>“…I’m glad. And you went out on a walk?”</p>
 <p>I continued to ask. I loosened my arms a bit to not hurt Evandel.</p>
 <p>“I went with Hayang. Oh right, I even built a sand castle with a new friend!”</p>
 <p>“Really?”</p>
 <p>I couldn’t say anything more.<br>Because of the lump in my throat, my voice didn’t come out.</p>
