 <p><br></p>
 <p>We were currently walking through ‘Citizen Boulevard’, one of the main streets in Prestige’s inner city. However, the atmosphere wasn’t as natural and relaxed as before. In fact, there was a heavy and awkward silence blanketing us.<br>—<em>Poke, poke.</em><br>Jain nudged me.</p>
 <p>“What did you do?”</p>
 <p>She asked as she sneaked a peek at Boss.<br>Just like she said, Boss was wearing a grave expression, but I could only shrug helplessly as I had no clue why.</p>
 <p>“I’m not sure.”</p>
 <p>“Did you do something wrong?”</p>
 <p>“It’s only been 30 minutes since we met.”</p>
 <p>“…Right.”</p>
 <p>Jain pondered as she rubbed her chin. Then, she suddenly widened her eyes.</p>
 <p>“Ah, is it that time?”</p>
 <p>“That time?”</p>
 <p>I asked.<br>That day. Was it an anniversary of some sort? Perhaps this was a good opportunity for me to peek at Boss’ past.</p>
 <p>“You know, that time of the month~”</p>
 <p>“…Oh, kuhum.”</p>
 <p>I shook away the silly thought and focused on the task at hand.<br>We were quickly approaching the Professor’s Mansion. Despite being quiet, Boss followed us as well. As such, it didn’t take long for us to reach our destination.</p>
 <p>[Lv.6 Professor’s Mansion]</p>
 <p>“We’re here.”</p>
 <p>An imposing mansion standing tall amidst Prestige’s darkness. This mansion, which looked like a medieval castle, shone with a silvery blue light.</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>“Mm~ so this is the place? How do you want to go about it~?”</p>
 <p>I stared at Jain without answering her.<br>I had no clue how to rob a house, much less a mansion of this scale.<br>Even if I did, I would undoubtedly pale in front of the professional in front of me.</p>
 <p>“…Why are you staring?”</p>
 <p>Jain tilted her head as she met my gaze.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>15 minutes.<br>That was how long it took for us to occupy the Professor’s Mansion.<br>It was rather simple. First, Cheok Jungyeong caused a scene outside the mansion, pulling the attention of the guards and vigilantes away. Meanwhile, Jain and I walked through the front door with the help of her ‘Disguise’ Gift.</p>
 <p>However, it was hard to suppress the [Lv.4 Professor’s Soldiers] with just me and Jain. Using my gun would reveal our presence to the guards outside, and Jain didn’t have a weapon.<br>That’s when Boss stepped in.<br>In her shadow form, she joined us and easily subdued six soldiers.<br>…Well, it wasn’t ‘easy’ per se, since she used 6 magic power potions. Each soldier was powerful, having at least one basic skill.</p>
 <p>“Uup, uuup—!”</p>
 <p>Just like that, we arrived at the professor’s private study.<br>The [Lv.6 Professor] who was reading a book inside was subdued by Boss’ shadow and tied up.<br>Ah, for the record, a high level didn’t necessarily correspond to greater strength. This professor was a high level because of his intelligence.</p>
 <p>“Uuup! Uuuuup!”</p>
 <p>“Stay quiet~”</p>
 <p>“Kek.”</p>
 <p>The professor struggled with his entire body, but Jain simply pressed a few pressure points and shut him up. The professor’s shaking body calmed down as he fainted.<br>Now, the study was quiet.<br>I looked around the study, which was larger than most auditoriums. Even with a cursory glance, I could estimate that the study had at least 10,000 books.</p>
 <p>“There are people dying in the streets and this guy built a castle out of books… People are the same no matter what world they’re from, eh~?”</p>
 <p>Jain muttered as she nudged the fainted professor with her feet.</p>
 <p>“So, Hajin, what are we looking for in here?”</p>
 <p>“Look for skillbooks.”</p>
 <p>“Skillbooks?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>Officially, a skillbook was called a ‘skill acquisition book’. Like in MMORPGs, it let you learn a skill with the click of a button. Of course, improving an acquired skill still required individual effort.</p>
 <p>“What’s a skillbook?”</p>
 <p>Jain asked, staring at the air.</p>
 <p>“Ah~ okay, got it. Thanks.”</p>
 <p>The system must have explained it to her as she happily nodded.</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>However, unlike Jain who looked excited at the prospect of stealing, Boss continued to stare at me silently.<br>I spoke.</p>
 <p>“You should try it too, Boss.”</p>
 <p>“…Try what?”</p>
 <p>Her response was a grumbling, complaint-like mumble.</p>
 <p>“Ask the system what a skillbook is.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Boss mumbled curtly.</p>
 <p>“What’s a skillbook?”</p>
 <p>Then, she stared at the air just like Jain.</p>
 <p>“Aha.”</p>
 <p>“Next…”</p>
 <p>Now that Boss knew what a skillbook was, I clapped my hands and caught their attention.</p>
 <p>“We shouldn’t stay for too long, so let’s search for them for the next 20 minutes.”</p>
 <p>In the original story, the professor used skillbooks as bargaining chips to force Players to do his bidding. So, I planned to take as many skillbooks as I could from this place and release them to the auction house. Of course, at a proper price.</p>
 <p>“Skillbooks are noticeably different from other books, so you should be able to recognize them.”</p>
 <p>“Okay~”</p>
 <p>We began to rummage through the study.<br><em>Drrk— drrk—</em><br>The sound of books moving rang out in the study.</p>
 <p>“Hey, Hajin, I think I found one.”</p>
 <p>Soon, Jain held up a book.</p>
 <p>“Oh? Let me see.”</p>
 <p>“Here~”</p>
 <p>I caught the book she threw and checked its information.</p>
 <p>===<br>[Basic Skill Acquisition Book – Lv.0 Law of Thinking] [Average – Low]<br>○Lv.0 Efficiency – increases the speed of your arithmetic operations.<br>○Lv.0 Intelligence – increases the speed of your calculations.<br>===</p>
 <p>“…Just keep it in your inventory.”</p>
 <p>“Right? I didn’t think it was good either. You can have it.”</p>
 <p>“No, I don’t really… ah, okay, I’ll take it.”</p>
 <p>I could give it to Henry and Kiri. Unlike Players, NPCs couldn’t learn skills with the click of a button. However, they could still acquire skills.<br>I put the skillbook in my inventory.<br>Then, I went back to looking for skillbooks.</p>
 <p>“Hajin, I found another one.”</p>
 <p>“Where?”</p>
 <p>As expected of someone who was nicknamed PhantomThief, she was good at finding hidden treasures.</p>
 <p>“Here.”</p>
 <p>I checked the information on the skillbook she threw.</p>
 <p>===<br>[Basic Skill Acquisition Book – Lv.0 Charging] [Average – Intermediate]<br>○Lv.0 Limit Break – charges forward with your strength doubled.<br>○Lv.0 Flexibility – moves quickly for an instant. Maximum range: 100m.<br>===</p>
 <p>Charging.<br>It was a simple yet useful skill. It was especially useful for someone like Cheok Jungyeong who had high physical stats.</p>
 <p>“Looks like this can go to Cheok Jungyeong.”</p>
 <p>“I agree. I’ll sell it to him for 1000TP.”</p>
 <p>“Does he have money?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, he has a lot. He’s only been hunting the past few days~”</p>
 <p>While were having a friendly conversation, I felt a sudden stinging gaze on me. I glanced to the side.<br>Boss was glaring at us with a somewhat dissatisfied expression.<br>But when our eyes met, she quickly retracted her gaze and went back to looking for skillbooks.</p>
 <p>…After 20 minutes of searching, we found a total of 21 skillbooks, including [Glass Barrier], [Sand Manipulation], [Monster Taming], [Elemental Reinforcement], and [Snatch].<br>However, we couldn’t find what I was looking for.<br>While I was stamping my feet, wondering if we had to go back…</p>
 <p>“Newbie.”</p>
 <p>Boss approached me. Her mood still seemed to be down as she handed me a skillbook.<br>I checked its information.</p>
 <p>===<br>[Basic Skill Acquisition Book – Lv.0 Permanent Materialization] [Rare – High]<br>○Lv.0 Limit Break – permanently materializes a formless existence.<br>===</p>
 <p>“Oh!”</p>
 <p>My eyes shot open.<br>I finally found it, Permanent Materialization.<br>It was the best basic skill I knew. It only had one effect, but that only made it easier to level up.</p>
 <p>“This is the skillbook I was looking for. Thanks, Boss, I’ll use it well.”</p>
 <p>“…I never said I’d give it to you.”</p>
 <p>Boss put out her hand. She was clearly asking me to hand the skillbook back.</p>
 <p>“Come on, I’ll make you a good equipment later.”</p>
 <p>“…Good equipment?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, of course.”</p>
 <p>Before Boss could say anything else, I put the skillbook into my inventory. Boss looked at me suspiciously before turning back.</p>
 <p>“Now let’s hurry. The city’s vigilantes should be charging in any second.”</p>
 <p>“Okay~ by the way, how much is everything we looted?”</p>
 <p>Curious myself, I did a cursory calculation in my head. We stole 25 skillbooks in total. To sell them in the auction house, we would have to wait two weeks for the [stolen good] property to disappear, but in total…</p>
 <p>“Once Players start making money seriously, we should be able to get at least 50000TP.”</p>
 <p>“Wow~”</p>
 <p>Jain smiled happily. At that moment…</p>
 <p>—In here!<br>—Get them!</p>
 <p>A thunderous roar rang out from outside the study. With my Thousand-Mile Eyes peering through the wall, I could see ten vigilantes running over. However, we already had an escape route planned.<br>Boss escaped using ‘Shadow Pool’, instantaneously transforming herself into a liquid. Jain and I disguised as [Lv.4 Professor’s Soldier]s, who we subdued on our way here. Jain thoughtfully made injuries on our bodies.<br>I immediately broke the window.</p>
 <p>“Intruders! Release the professor—!”</p>
 <p>As soon as the vigilantes barged in, I pointed at the shattered window.</p>
 <p>“T-They escaped through the window!”</p>
 <p>“W-What?!”</p>
 <p>“Are you two okay? Your injuries…”</p>
 <p>The vigilantes had terrifying levels.<br>The lowest member was Lv.8, and their leader was Lv.11.</p>
 <p>“We’re fine, so please catch them! They kidnapped the professor!”</p>
 <p>“What?”!</p>
 <p>It was Jain who spoke out next. Hearing her, the vigilantes immediately jumped out of the window.<br>With the vigilantes gone, we leisurely walked out of the mansion’s premise and joined up with Boss at a predetermined meeting spot.<br>There, Cheok Jungyeong was waiting for us, looking sleepy.</p>
 <p>“You’re back.”</p>
 <p>“Hey, Cheok Jungyeong, do you want to buy this~?”</p>
 <p>Jain asked as she handed him the skillbook.</p>
 <p>“What’s this?”</p>
 <p>“A skillbook. It’s perfect for you~”</p>
 <p>“…Skillbook?”</p>
 <p>Cheok Jungyeong stared at the skillbook curiously. As he read the system message, a smile of interest emerged on his face.</p>
 <p>“Oho… how much is it?”</p>
 <p>“2000TP.”</p>
 <p>“…Do you think I’m an idiot?”</p>
 <p>Cheok Jungyeong and Jain started to negotiate, and I sneaked off. There was something I needed to do.</p>
 <p>“Newbie.”</p>
 <p>However, Boss, who just arrived, stopped me. Grabbing my wrist hard, she looked into my eyes with a serious expression. Her eyes were fierce like she wanted to eat me.</p>
 <p>“Y-Yes?”</p>
 <p>“Where are you going?”</p>
 <p>“Ah~ I’m going to go buy something. I’ll be back soon.’</p>
 <p>Before learning [Permanent Materialization], there was something I needed to do. Thankfully, I only needed TP to do it, so it shouldn’t take long.</p>
 <p>“What are you buying?”</p>
 <p>“I’ll tell you later.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Boss clenched her teeth, clearly outlining her jawline.</p>
 <p>“You have lots of secrets.”</p>
 <p>“…Yes? What do you…”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Without replying, Boss walked past me and walked towards Cheok Jungyeong and Jain.</p>
 <p>“Boss?”</p>
 <p>“…Don’t talk to me.”</p>
 <p>…She really was in a foul mood today.<br>It seemed I needed to make her something delicious later.<br>Still, I had to do what I had to do.<br>I faced forward and began to walk towards Medea’s temple.</p>
 <p>[Lv.7 Temple of Medea]</p>
 <p>The temple wasn’t far away.<br>As its name suggested, it was a place where visitors had to be polite and respectful. Naturally, I took off my mask and hood.<br>Kiik—</p>
 <p>[Lv.4 Medea’s Priest]</p>
 <p>As soon as I opened the temple’s door, a priest greeted me with a warm smile.</p>
 <p>“Welcome.”</p>
 <p>“Ah, yes, I came to buy an item.”</p>
 <p>“Our temple sells the following items.”</p>
 <p>The priest snapped his fingers, and a holographic system message popped up in front of me. It was the list of items being sold in this place.<br>I picked three items from the list.</p>
 <p>[Basic Skill Acquisition Book – Lv.0 Synthesis]<br>[Basic Skill Acquisition Book – Lv.0 Extraction]<br>[Lv.0 Basic Skill Consolidation Scroll]</p>
 <p>[Lv.0 Extraction] and [Lv.0 Synthesis].<br>By themselves, they were rather useless.<br>However, after looking through my settings book hundreds of times, I was certain that these skills were the best for me.</p>
 <p>“I’ll take these three.”</p>
 <p>“…That’ll be a total of 15000TP.”</p>
 <p>15000TP.<br>The Temple of Medea was famous for being cost ineffective. In truth, buying skillbooks here was a waste. However, this was what the Book of Truth said.</p>
 <p>[Lv.0 Synthesis and Lv.0 Extraction are only sold in ‘Temple of Medea’.]</p>
 <p>So I didn’t have any other choice. This temple was the only place I could buy them, and it wasn’t like I could create them myself.</p>
 <p>“…Here, 15000TP.”</p>
 <p>I gave the priest 15 1000TP banknotes.<br>The priest took the money with a bright smile and handed over two skillbooks and a scroll.</p>
 <p>“Thank you for your purchase. Ah, would you like to become a member of our temple? If you do…”</p>
 <p>“No, it’s fine.”</p>
 <p>As I said before, the Temple of Medea had terrible cost efficiency. There was no reason to become a member. Rather, I wanted to set it on fire and burn it to the ground.<br>I declined the priest’s offer and left the temple.<br>Then, I moved to my waiting room to begin my ‘work’.</p>
 <p>“…Ah, there’s sunlight in this place.”</p>
 <p>For some reason, there was sunlight in the waiting room unlike in Prestige.<br>I sat down at the edge of my bed and took out the skillbooks I bought.</p>
 <p>[Basic Skill Acquisition Book – Lv.0 Synthesis]<br>[Would you like to learn the Basic Skill – Lv.0 Synthesis?]<br>[Warning! Learning a skill uses up a skill slot. Once used, a skill slot cannot be recovered.]<br>[Warning! The ‘Synthesis’ skill is a half-skill that can only be leveled up with scrolls!]</p>
 <p>“Thank you for worrying about me, but I already know.”</p>
 <p>I went ahead and learned the skill.</p>
 <p>[You acquired the Basic Skill – Lv.0 Synthesis. You can still learn two more skills.]</p>
 <p>===<br>[Basic Skill – Lv.0 Synthesis]<br>○Lv.0 Limitation – you can synthesize Lv.-1 or lower items.<br>===</p>
 <p>‘Lv.-1 or lower’.<br>It was easy to see that it was a trash skill that couldn’t be used without consolidation scrolls.<br>I took out the consolidation scroll I bought and leveled up the Synthesis skill.</p>
 <p>[Lv.0 Basic Skill Consolidation Scroll upgrades your Synthesis skill.]<br>[Lv.1 Synthesis]<br>○Lv.1 Limitation – you can synthesize Lv.0 or lower items.</p>
 <p>“There.”</p>
 <p>Next was the important part.<br>Using Synthesis, I combined the two remaining skillbooks, [Lv.0 Extraction] and [Lv.0 Permanent Materialization].</p>
 <p>[You used Lv.1 Synthesis!]<br>[Warning! The chances of successfully synthesizing a skill are extremely low. Would you like to do it anyway?]</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>As I always said, playing with probability had little meaning to me.</p>
 <p>[Synthesizing!]<br>[What will be the result!? Dudududududu….]</p>
 <p>“…I didn’t know you could be so lively.”</p>
 <p>[…Extrapolating results.]<br>[Synthesis successful!]<br>[With great luck, the two items successfully fused!]<br>[You obtained a new skill, 「Normal Skill Acquisition Scroll – Lv.0 Extraction and Permanent Materialization」].</p>
 <p>Unsurprisingly, the synthesis succeeded.</p>
 <p>“Huu.”</p>
 <p>I breathed a sigh of relief.<br>There was a reason I went through all this trouble to synthesize a skill.</p>
 <p>[Extraction and Permanent Materialization]</p>
 <p>Extraction pulled out the essence of an existence.<br>Next, Materialization provided a form to the formless.<br>Finally, Permanence made the form last for an unlimited time.</p>
 <p>The secret plan I had for this skill was simple and obvious.<br>To materialize my strongest weapon, Stigma’s magic power.<br>That was my first goal.</p>
