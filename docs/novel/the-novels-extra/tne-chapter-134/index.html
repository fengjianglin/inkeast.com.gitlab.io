 <p>“Auu, Chae Nayun, you crazy idiot….”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun scorned herself as she smacked her head. Because of the words she carelessly muttered, the drowsiness she felt disappeared completely.</p>
 <p>“Uuuu… ah, wait.”</p>
 <p>While circling around the room in embarrassment, she suddenly remembered something she had to do.<br>Chae Nayun quickly made a video call to Yoo Yeonha.<br><em>Tuuu— Tuuu—</em></p>
 <p>—Yeah, Nayun.</p>
 <p>As expected, Yoo Yeonha was quick to pick up. Yoo Yeonha usually only slept three hours a day. Since it was only 1 a.m. at the moment, it was unlikely that she was asleep.</p>
 <p>“Hey, Yeonha.”</p>
 <p>—Why did you call… why is your face so red?</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha tilted her head and asked. That was how red Chae Nayun’s face was.</p>
 <p>“Ah, it’s, it’s nothing.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun fanned herself frantically.</p>
 <p>“Here, here.”</p>
 <p>Pushing her hair back nonchalantly, she sent a file over to Yoo Yeonha.<br>[Tattoo.jpg]<br>This evidence was a critical piece of info. Yoo Yeonha opened the file and tilted her head.</p>
 <p>—Tattoo…? What is this?</p>
 <p>“Evidence.”</p>
 <p>—…Evidence?</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun’s voice turned serious.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, this tattoo was on the murderer’s arm.”</p>
 <p>In response, Yoo Yeonha also put on a serious face.</p>
 <p>—Hm….</p>
 <p>Two lines forming a cross and a crescent arc standing over it like an umbrella.<br>Yoo Yeonha scrutinized the tattoo carefully.</p>
 <p>“Is, is it not that useful?”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun asked without confidence.</p>
 <p>—It’s not a conclusive piece of evidence, but it’s still better than not having anything at all. First…</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha began to type on her keyboard like an IT expert. Chae Nayun stared at Yoo Yeonha in awe.</p>
 <p>—I’ll look into arrested criminals or active villains and Djinns.</p>
 <p>“T-Thanks, Yeonha! …Haam.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun then yawned. Now that the tension left her body, drowsiness came over her once again.</p>
 <p>—Are you sleepy?</p>
 <p>“Yeah, I’m going to collapse any moment now.”</p>
 <p>—….</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha grinned.</p>
 <p>—Good, then sleep.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, you shouldn’t overwork yourself either.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun waved her hand through the screen as she walked over to her bed.</p>
 <p>—Okay.</p>
 <p>Although Chae Nayun promptly buried herself in her bed, Yoo Yeonha remained busy on the other side of the call.<br>Pharmaceutical company management, core technology development, information guild monitoring, dungeon research and resource distribution, and Essence of the Strait’s management reformation.<br>She still had too many things to take care of.</p>
 <p>—Hello? Ah, yes, Yi Jin-Ah-ssi.</p>
 <p>At that moment, she received a call.<br>Of the past vice-leader’s subordinates, she was the sole person Yoo Yeonha reached out to. Although she had a personal conflict with Kim Hajin, Yoo Yeonha decided her talent was too important to be wasted.</p>
 <p>—Ah, don’t worry about it. I don’t think you were involved in that incident. No, you don’t need to thank me. Oh, rather than that, I’m going to send you a special tattoo image. I want you to…</p>
 <p>Stopping in the middle of her sentence, Yoo Yeonha looked over to the side.</p>
 <p>—Hold on, I forgot to hang up a video call.</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha waved her hand, and soon—<br>Chweek. The floating hologram screen disappeared.<br>….<br>Just like that, all noise disappeared from Chae Nayun’s room.<br>In this absolute, lonely silence, Chae Nayun fell asleep alone.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>In a desolate park brimming with killing intent and clouds of war, I was hard at work trying to convince Boss.</p>
 <p>“Calm down, Boss. That’s how stocks work.”</p>
 <p>“Ha, that’s how they work?”</p>
 <p>Boss laughed mockingly. At the moment, she was seriously angry. I couldn’t blame her as I could only imagine the amount of money she invested. If she used stock market leverage, even a mere 2% increase should have net her hundreds of millions of won.</p>
 <p>“It will plummet soon. Trust me.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Boss shut her mouth. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath as though to appease her inner fury.<br>Despite her cold personality, she valued her comrades greatly.</p>
 <p>“From now, I don’t think I can trust you deeply. No, I can’t even trust you lightly.”</p>
 <p>However, I couldn’t prevent my credibility from falling. If this matter ended this way, my level of trust would probably fall to F from C.<br>Puuu. Sighing like a kid, Boss turned her back towards me.</p>
 <p>“Ah, wait, since you suffered a loss because of me, I’ll make up for it.”</p>
 <p>I stopped Boss from leaving.</p>
 <p>“I’ll give you some solid information.”</p>
 <p>“…Solid information?”</p>
 <p>Boss’ interested seemed to be piqued as her ears perked up.</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>I nodded confidently. Of course, even I didn’t know what would happen in the future economically.<br>However, I knew a few companies that would rise to the top of the world.</p>
 <p>“If you invest a million, you will become a billionaire. If you invest a billion, you will become the ruler of a country.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>After a brief silence, Boss shook her head. Her perked up ears lost their vitality and drooped down once again.</p>
 <p>“I’ve lived my entire life with skepticism as my core belief. I won’t believe someone who isn’t an expert twice.”</p>
 <p>“Um, I’m the rank 1 cadet in theory.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Rank 1 in theory. It was a position impossible to achieve without extraordinary intelligence. However, Boss still looked doubtful.<br>Without a choice, I showed her my stock portfolio.</p>
 <p>“…Eh?”</p>
 <p>Boss’ mouth immediately opened in shock. That was how much I currently had.<br>The total value of the various stocks I had in my portfolio reached 2.5 billion. In terms of strict profit rate, it was almost 500%.<br>Not to mention, these stocks would all multiply by at least 10 times… no, 20 times in the next 5 years.</p>
 <p>“You see? Now you believe me? Take a seat.”</p>
 <p>I sat down on a bench near me and tapped on the empty seat next to me.</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Boss finally seemed to trust me again as she looked around the park and sat down next to me modestly.</p>
 <p>“…Right, you have to show me proof to get me to trust you.”</p>
 <p>“Makes sense. So, I’ll recommend a few companies you should go for. There’s still one that hasn’t been publicly listed—”</p>
 <p>“Wait.”</p>
 <p>Boss cut me off, then took out a pen and a notebook from her pocket.<br>After getting ready to take notes, her eyes flashed sharply.</p>
 <p>“Go on.”</p>
 <p>“…Right.”</p>
 <p>I cleared my throat and continued.</p>
 <p>“The non-publicly listed company is SH Agency. There’s also Essential Pharmacy, which will go public soon, and Essential Corporation, which is a well-known giant….”</p>
 <p>Boss nodded passionately and frantically took notes.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>My remaining days in Cube flew by. In the blink of an eye, it became the month of cherry blossoms, May.<br>During this time, I maintained an appropriate distance from Chae Nayun. Although I could tell that she was annoyed and confused by it, I believed it to be for the best.<br>That was really the only thing I could do.<br>Because the feelings Chae Nayun had for me were so clear, I felt like I would give in and accept her feelings otherwise.<br>…I knew it was an excuse, but I really didn’t have a choice.<br>The ‘final incident’ in Cube was nearing soon.</p>
 <p>“Today, we are going to sculpt using magic power.”</p>
 <p>Today’s 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. class was [Advanced Magic Power Application].<br>There were two familiar faces in this class – Shin Jonghak and Kim Suho.</p>
 <p>“You will not be given any tools. Using only your magic power, you must sculpt this bronze.”</p>
 <p>50 cadets were given a single lump of bronze. As the instructor explained, we now had to sculpt something using our magic power as carving knives.</p>
 <p>“You’re free to make whatever you want. But don’t think of this as a dumb art class. Dexterity plays an important role in magic power application and harmonization. So, do your best to create the most beautiful sculpture. You can take your results home.”</p>
 <p>I quite enjoyed this female instructor’s relaxed voice.<br>I cracked my fingers and began the training.</p>
 <p>Forming a carving knife with Stigma’s magic power, I held it in one hand.<br>Looking down at the carving knife glowing with a half-transparent blue light, I fell into thought.<br>Who should I use as a model?</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Looking around, someone caught my eyes.<br>Black and two-block pomade hair that strangely resembled mine. A handsome popular boy who looked like a model. With his clear jawline and facial features, he seemed like the ideal model for sculpting.</p>
 <p>‘Alright, I choose you.’</p>
 <p>I began to sculpt, sneaking peeks at Shin Jonghak. My fingers moved mysteriously, transforming the lump of bronze into a modern masterpiece.<br>When it was about halfway finished…</p>
 <p><em>Ding—</em></p>
 <p>It was time for a break. I stealthily moved closer towards Shing Jonghak, who was in the middle of carving something resembling a chimera.</p>
 <p>“Wow, an abstract art.”</p>
 <p>I muttered subconsciously.<br>Shin Jonghak immediately turned back and glared at me intimidatingly.</p>
 <p>“…Kim Hajin?”</p>
 <p>His burning eyes pierced my chest. It was mainly because of the rumors about me and Chae Nayun going around recently.</p>
 <p>“Oh, um, I was just curious. Who is this?”</p>
 <p>“…Leave.”</p>
 <p>Shin Jonghak waved his hand without saying much.</p>
 <p>“Is it Chae Nayun?”</p>
 <p>When I said that, Shin Jonghak flinched and glared at me again with his hawk-like eyes.</p>
 <p>“Tsk.”</p>
 <p>However, he only clicked his tongue and went back to sculpting.</p>
 <p>“…So it is Chae Nayun.”</p>
 <p>“Shut the hell up.”</p>
 <p>“Uwaak!”</p>
 <p>Shin Jonghak changed his carving knife into an axe.<br>I quickly ran back to my seat.<br>Then, I went back to staring at Shin Jonghak.</p>
 <p>“It must look like her.”</p>
 <p>…He was murmuring in satisfaction and focusing on sculpting.</p>
 <p>“…He really did change a lot.”</p>
 <p>I was surprised.<br>The current Shin Jonghak wasn’t as bad as the one I wrote.<br>Many things had changed, and more things were bound to change. Did Chae Jinyoon’s death and Yoo Sihyuk’s hellish training affect him that much?<br>Though, he still was acting like a haughty young master…</p>
 <p>“Well, whatever.”</p>
 <p>Since Jin Sahyuk got herself a mysterious supporter, having Shin Jonghak become an ally would only make things more balanced.</p>
 <p>I unleashed my magic power once again and went back to sculpting. Sssk, sssk. The lump of bronze was nothing more than tofu in front of my knife.<br>After focusing on sculpting for about 30 minutes, I snapped out of my daze. The sculpture was already finished.</p>
 <p>“…Oh.”</p>
 <p>The sculpture in front of me was an unequivocal masterpiece.</p>
 <p>“Wow, amazing job. This gets a perfect score, Cadet Hajin.”</p>
 <p>After getting my grade (although the class still wasn’t over), I took the sculpture and walked over to Shin Jonghak.</p>
 <p>“Hey.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Shin Jonghak was focused on his own sculpture.<br>However, it was already at the point where it was barely recognizable. It certainly couldn’t be used as a gift.<br>I tapped on his arm.</p>
 <p>“Hey.”</p>
 <p>“Argh, what now, you bastard?”</p>
 <p>Shin Jonghak spoke harshly and glared at me.</p>
 <p>“Do you really wanna die…”</p>
 <p>However, he froze when he saw the sculpture in my hand.<br>I named this piece the Shin Jonghak Bronze Bust.<br>Although the model was also handsome, the sculpture was even more handsome than the real person. Just look at this jawline and facial features!</p>
 <p>In any case, Shin Jonghak loved things like this. Although I didn’t make any detailed settings about this, I could make an educated guess from what I knew about his personality.<br>Seeing Shin Jonghak blankly staring at my sculpture, I spoke briefly.</p>
 <p>“You want it?”</p>
 <p>But at that moment.<br><em>Bzzzz—</em><br>A series of messages popped up on my smartwatch.</p>
 <p>[‘Devilish Dexterity’ activates by luck.]<br>[‘Shin Jonghak Bronze Bust’ has been judged to be a low-intermediate rank art. It will receive a fitting special effect.]</p>
 <p>[Special effect – why art is needed in life]<br>—When a person is touched by the beauty of this sculpture, their perseverance will increase by 0.1 point for 24 hours.<br>—The beauty of the sculpture seems to cleanse the heart.</p>
 <p>[Aether reacts to a beautiful object. The perseverance boosting effect has been granted to Aether (24 hours).]</p>
 <p>“…Oh right.”</p>
 <p>My dexterity was at the level of a Gift. Such ‘effect bestowals’ were an inherent power of my Gift.<br>In any case, Shin Jonghak looked back and forth between me and my sculpture. He looked like he wanted it…</p>
 <p>“You don’t want it?”</p>
 <p>“Screw off.”</p>
 <p>However, Shin Jonghak always acted differently than his inner feelings.</p>
 <p>“Really? Then I guess there’s no choice.”</p>
 <p>I had no problem keeping it.</p>
 <p>“Sssp, ehem.”</p>
 <p>But when I was about to leave with the sculpture, Shin Jonghak grabbed my wrist.</p>
 <p>“You can’t. That’s facial rights abuse.”</p>
 <p>“…What?”</p>
 <p>I couldn’t say I didn’t expect it, but I still laughed because it was so childish.</p>
 <p>“Why don’t you just say you want it?”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Shin Jonghak glared at me and squeezed my wrist but didn’t say anything.</p>
 <p>“Fine, I’ll leave it here, so you do what you want.”</p>
 <p>Since this sculpture had an effect of cleansing one’s heart, Shin Jonghak seemed to be the suitable owner with his… anger issues.</p>
 <p><em>Ding—</em></p>
 <p>Just at that moment, the bell signaling the end of class rang.</p>
 <p>“Hey, Kim Suho, let’s go eat.”</p>
 <p>“Huh? Oh, wait a bit, let me get mine graded.”</p>
 <p>I left the classroom with Kim Suho.<br>In Kim Suho’s hand was a sculpture that perfectly resembled Yun Seung-Ah.</p>
 <p>“You sculpted Yun Seung-Ah?”</p>
 <p>“…Huh? Ah~ yeah, I guess it does look like her. But no, it isn’t.”</p>
 <p>“Please, it’s practically a carbon copy.”</p>
 <p>“No, no, it’s not.”</p>
 <p>“…Fine, it’s not.”</p>
 <p>Kim Suho was quite stubborn in his own right.<br>As I walked through the hallway, I turned back and looked through the walls into the classroom I just came out of. It was purely out of curiosity.<br>Everyone else had left, and only Shin Jonghak was left remaining.<br>Whistling to himself, he was loitering around the classroom.<br>Then suddenly! He snatched the sculpture of himself on the table and ran out the door.</p>
 <p>—Uaak!</p>
 <p>However, Kim Horak was standing on the other side.</p>
 <p>—Jonghak, what were you doing not coming out? …What’s that?</p>
 <p>—Ah? What do you mean?</p>
 <p>—That. Oh, it looks like you! Someone made it for you!?</p>
 <p>—I, I guess…? Ah! It, it must have been a fan of mine. Let’s leave. I’m going to stop by my room first, so I’ll meet you at the training center.</p>
 <p>Shin Jonghak gave a half-hearted excuse and began to run away with the sculpture in his embrace.<br>Looking at him, I snickered.</p>
