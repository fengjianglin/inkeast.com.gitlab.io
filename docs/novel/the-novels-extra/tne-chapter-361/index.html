 <p><br></p>
 <p>“You haven’t forgotten my name, right?”</p>
 <p>I asked while holding onto Boss’s hand. She stared at me fixedly before slowly tilting her head. It was as if she was asking what I was talking about. And for a moment, her expressionless face turned to fluster.<br>It was a change I was quite happy about.<br>I pretended to be disappointed and asked again.</p>
 <p>“You forgot?”</p>
 <p>“…Hajin.”</p>
 <p>Boss murmured in a quiet voice with a somewhat dissatisfied look. She seemed to be saying she wasn’t in a mood to joke around.<br>However, I asked again. I couldn’t be comfortable with just hearing my name.</p>
 <p>“My last name too.”</p>
 <p>Boss’s eyebrows perked up. Of course, it was only for a split second, and she soon returned the answer ‘Kim Hajin’.<br>But that was enough evidence. I felt like I understood what the final [???] was.</p>
 <p>“Why are you asking me all of a sudden?”</p>
 <p>“…No reason. Anyways, thanks.”</p>
 <p>I raised Boss’s hand. She flinched as if she didn’t realize I was holding her hands until now.<br>Her cheeks flushed red, but she soon collected her composure and let go.</p>
 <p>“Go. I want to be alone right now.”</p>
 <p>She chased me away like shooing away a fly.<br>I turned back with a bitter smile. Boss glanced at me several times before creating a coffin out of her shadow. Jin Yohan, Arashi, and Jain approached her.<br>I didn’t wait to find out what happened next.<br>I stopped in front of the stronghold, the magic power fortress taking root in the part of the barrier I purified. I looked inside the fortress wavering with magic power. My Thousand-Mile Eyes could peer into even a master artisan’s work.</p>
 <p>—…By the way, who are the people outside?</p>
 <p>—Ah~ You’ve heard of them, right, Nayun? They’re from the ‘Chameleon Troupe’.</p>
 <p>—Yeah, I’ve worked with them during the Orden mission.</p>
 <p>—Yep, that’s them. I hired them.</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha and Chae Nayun were talking with each other. Then, Chae Nayun glanced outside.</p>
 <p>—Then that woman is also from the Chameleon Troupe? She seems to be… rather close to Kim Hajin.</p>
 <p>—Oh, that? Well, you know, Kim Hajin did a lot of work in the shade. They must be acquaintances from that time.</p>
 <p>—They’re too touchy to just be acquaintances though….</p>
 <p>—…Maybe they’re close acquaintances.</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha tricked Chae Nayun without much effort. She lied naturally without even batting an eye.</p>
 <p>“…Whew.”</p>
 <p>Before I entered the stronghold, I took another deep breath and closed my eyes. I checked my Stigma, which was slowly recovering. Thanks to the [Orb of Regeneration], more than two streaks had already been filled.<br>I focused one streak into my eyes.<br>Immediately, my vision shot up into a satellite view. Looking down from a lofty height, I could see everything from a third-person perspective, and I quickly spotted Baal.</p>
 <p>Kim Suho, Chae Joochul, Rachel, Heynckes, Aileen…. Almost all Heroes I knew were fighting Baal. I could even see Shimurin, Harin, and even 'Bell'.</p>
 <p>Even though Baal was right in front of me, I had no choice but to watch from afar. It was funny saying this at this point, but that was the role of an 'extra'. At least for now, my job was simply to assist them from a distance.<br>However, Chae Nayun was different.<br>She would be able to awaken her true worth by facing Baal.</p>
 <p>After thinking this far, I let out a few dry coughs before entering the fortress. At last, Yoo Yeonha and Chae Nayun's chatter stopped.<br>Chae Nayun stood next to Yoo Yeonha and asked while she stole glances at me.</p>
 <p>"…What were you doing?"</p>
 <p>She scratched her head somewhat awkwardly. Yoo Yeonha noticed how Chae Nayun and I were acting and let out a bitter smile.</p>
 <p>I said to her, "You don't need to know that. It's about time we go back."</p>
 <p>"…Y-Yeah, I was just about to…."</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun replied while furrowing her brows. She seemed to be dissatisfied with something.</p>
 <p>"I'll be back soon, Yeonha."</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun got up after tapping Yoo Yeonha's lap a couple times. Yoo Yeonha also tried to get up, but I stopped her.</p>
 <p>"You stay here. You're weaker than even me."</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha immediately pouted. Her protruding lips moved like a bird's beak.</p>
 <p>"At least let me say goodbye."</p>
 <p>She then held Chae Nayun's hand and whispered into her ear. Chae Nayun laughed as if she had been told a joke. Yoo Yeonha then sat back down.</p>
 <p>"Okay, you can take her now."</p>
 <p>I left the stronghold with Chae Nayun. She tried to go right away, but I grabbed her wrist and stopped her.</p>
 <p>"Wha—"</p>
 <p>The moment my hand touched her, Chae Nayun jumped like a cat who stepped on a needle.</p>
 <p>"W-What! What is it!?"</p>
 <p>"I have something to give you."</p>
 <p>I smiled faintly. There was something I needed to give her before she left.</p>
 <p>"G-Give what?"</p>
 <p>I silently took out a necklace from my pocket. A carefully crafted fingernail-sized diamond hung on a blue string.<br>This was an item that would replace what she should have had in the original story. I had crafted this [Magic Power Amplification Blue Diamond Necklace] with care.</p>
 <p>"…."</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun dropped her jaw as she stared at the necklace. Even inside the barrier's darkness, it shone brightly.</p>
 <p>===<br>[Magic Power Amplification Blue Diamond Necklace] [Pinnacle-grade] [Masterpiece]<br>○The work surmised to be crafted by a famous Dwarf. Special magical effects are enchanted on it.<br>—High-rank Magic Power Amplification<br>—High-rank Magic Power Circulation<br>—High-rank Mental Interference Immunity<br>===</p>
 <p>Thanks to using high-quality ingredients, it was equal to or above Homer's Ring in functionality. I gave it a blessing with Stigma's magic power before putting it in Chae Nayun's hand.</p>
 <p>"…."</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun stared at it blankly.<br>I tapped on her shoulder and spoke.</p>
 <p>"You can tell how good it is, right? Be sure to give it back later."</p>
 <p>"Huh?"</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun's gaze shot up before falling on the necklace once again. This time, she seemed to be checking the effects of the necklace rather than its outer appearance. Soon, she smiled and nodded her head.</p>
 <p>"…Right, there's no way something like this would be a gift. Alright, thanks. It should help out a lot."</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun put the necklace on, thinking only about its utility. The change happened immediately.</p>
 <p><em>Guooo….</em> A blue aura rose up around Chae Nayun. The uncontrolled current of magic power escaped in all directions. But, as expected of Chae Nayun, she suppressed the amplified magic power with just a breath.</p>
 <p>"Whew, done. What about you, Kim Hajin?"</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun asked.<br>I tapped on the Desert Eagle in my hand and answered.</p>
 <p>"I'll support you guys with this."</p>
 <p>That was the best thing I could do at the moment. I had to search for an opening to drill the god-slaying bullet into Baal.</p>
 <p>"What a scaredy-cat."</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun grinned.<br>There was no need for me to feel bad. It was true. So, I simply nodded my head.</p>
 <p>"You know me. I always run away or shoot from far away."</p>
 <p>"And you're going to do that until the end?"</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun stared into my eyes. Her big, clear eyes carried her sincere feelings. I answered truthfully as well.</p>
 <p>"…Yeah. But maybe I can stop running away when everything ends."</p>
 <p>"…."</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun silently thought about what I said before tilting her head confusedly.</p>
 <p>"Okay, so you're saying you won't run away after this, right?"</p>
 <p>"Yeah."</p>
 <p><em>I'm okay with that.</em> Chae Nayun murmured before laughing out loud.</p>
 <p>"Then see you later."</p>
 <p>That was the final goodbye.<br>Chae Nayun watched Chae Joochul's nature rising in the distance. In that instant, she ran off without hesitation. She ran without turning back, to that 'final' place.</p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p>The Heroes assumed a loose formation. Since going all out would only result in their death, they wanted to take it slow and understand Baal's attack patterns first.<br>Bell didn't think that was a bad tactic. As Baal had yet to fully descend, his attack patterns were simple, and the Heroes could slowly chip away at him without being sacrificed.</p>
 <p>Bell called this the 'Toothpick Tactic', hoping Baal would eventually fall if he was poked by toothpicks endlessly.</p>
 <p>However, not all toothpicks were the same, and some couldn't even be called toothpicks. Kim Suho was the prime example. He cut apart Baal's demonic energy while directly affecting its true body.</p>
 <p>"Haa…. Haa…."</p>
 <p>But now, Kim Suho was reaching his limit. His body was drenched in sweat, and his hands were barely holding onto his sword. Most importantly, he was running low on magic power.</p>
 <p>Seeing Kim Suho out of energy, Bell clicked his tongue.</p>
 <p>Kim Suho's fuel efficiency simply wasn't good. Because he was trapped within a mental barricade, he was wasting too much magic power, despite only needing a simple change in thinking to face Baal alone.</p>
 <p>That said, Bell couldn't help him with this problem. Kim Suho had to realize this himself for it to have any effect.</p>
 <p>"How troublesome…. I can't see an end to this."</p>
 <p>At that moment, Heynckes muttered softly. Unlike Kim Suho, Heynckes and Chae Joochul weren't efficient in damaging non-physical beings.<br>In fact, there weren't many Heroes who were capable of damaging Baal's true body. Other than Kim Suho, only Rachel and Aileen were worth mentioning. Thankfully, the power of these two women wasn't on the level of a mere toothpick.</p>
 <p>It was then.</p>
 <p>….</p>
 <p>A faint tremor shook the barrier. Some Heroes might not have felt a thing. However, Bell clearly felt it - the quickening of death issued from Baal's heart.</p>
 <p>"…Hm."</p>
 <p>Bell fell in thought. Should he escape to save the finite life he finally reclaimed? Or should he stay to watch the interesting spectacle develop?<br>However, Bell's old friend Baal did not give him any time to decide.</p>
 <p>—Pathetic insects who cannot even touch the edge of true existence.</p>
 <p>His calm murmuring resounded clearly from what seemed to be the mouth of the true body. All Heroes widened their eyes.<br>Baal glared at them with his distant, piercing gaze. His eyes, which had been filled with nothing but vast darkness, now carried a powerful, transcendent power of destruction. Just staring at his eyes caused a few Heroes to collapse.</p>
 <p>—Why struggle so much to continue such pitiful lives?</p>
 <p>The devil so transcendent that he could not exist in the material realm - Baal - finally descended successfully.</p>
 <p>—Death suits you all more.</p>
 <p>This sentence marked the outbreak of war.<br>Baal infused the power of destruction in his breath. A storm of demonic energy brewed from his origin. This was the same 'breath' that had destroyed countless worlds in the past.<br>It swallowed everything inside the barrier.<br>Kim Suho swung his sword with what little power he had left, but it 'looked' like it didn't reach Baal….</p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p>…<em>Tadadak—</em></p>
 <p>A campfire was crackling. The shadow of a fire danced on the ground. Inside a cave filled with deathly silence, Kim Suho was with his king, the ruler of an already-ruined kingdom.<br>Was her name Priha or Praha? Kim Suho didn't care to find out. He currently didn't even know his own name.</p>
 <p>Kim Suho offered the food he cooked on the campfire to his king. It was a simple dish cooked by adding herbs and potatoes in an earthenware pot. As he was lucky that day, he was able to obtain two abandoned potatoes.</p>
 <p>Jin Sahyuk stared at the dish with vacant eyes before grabbing it with her hand and taking a bite. After that, she quickly began to devour it. Kim Suho didn't expect any of the food to come back to him.<br>He thought it was enough if he could help relieve his king's hunger even a little bit.<br>Right, he thought it was enough.</p>
 <p>But when she finished eating, Jin Sahyuk confessed what should have never been said.</p>
 <p>'I killed your master to obtain you. It was all a ploy to cut you off from Puharen and have you offer your loyalty to me. I could have saved your master, but I ended his life to save money. Because with the same amount of money, I could have saved a hundred subordinates.'</p>
 <p>Kim Suho still didn't understand why Jin Sahyuk said this. Was it because she was grateful? Or did she want to confess her sins before death?</p>
 <p>Regardless, Kim Suho became furious. Even though the world fell, rage ignited from the bottom of his heart. No, he raged precisely because the world fell.<br>The concept of a king or a knight no longer existed in this world. Since everything had fallen to ruin, nothing was restricting him from doing whatever he wanted. After all, what use was there talking about the concept of nobility?<br>Kim Suho thought this as his hands trembled. And, in the end, he pounced on Jin Sahyuk, cursing for the first time in his life.</p>
 <p>Their scuffle continued for a long time. The two of them ran out of the cave at one point and eventually reached a dead-end.<br>A frightening cliff was awaiting them. However, the two entangled children failed to notice it.</p>
 <p>Just like that, they fell from the cliff.</p>
 <p>Who killed who in this instance? Did Kim Suho kill Jin Sahyuk? Or did Jin Sahyuk kill Kim Suho?<br>Well, since they both went through reincarnation, it didn't really matter.</p>
 <p>But Kim Suho had to wonder as he fell to his death.<br>Why did he have to feel such pain?<br>Why was there nothing but pain and despair in this world?<br>And why did Jin Sahyuk confess her sins at the end? Wouldn't it have been better for both of them if she kept quiet and died peacefully?</p>
 <p>Kim Suho had no way of finding out, but in reality, the answer was simple. The truth was so surprisingly simple that it made one chuckle. And Kim Suho had found out today.</p>
 <p>The reason was that… this world was a mere 'novel' created by a damned author….</p>
 <p>…This information, this mysterious narration, entered his brain. The voice was too insidious to be a fairytale, but the subdued emptiness was too frightening to be a documentary.</p>
 <p>"…."</p>
 <p>Kim Suho slowly opened his eyes. <em>Tadak, tadak—</em> He could hear the sound of something crackling.</p>
 <p>"Auuk—"</p>
 <p>Kim Suho got up with a groan, and only then was he was able to look around his surroundings.</p>
 <p>"Ah."</p>
 <p>A short mutter escaped his mouth.<br>Everything had been destroyed. The ground burned instead of the campfire, and a fog carrying a scent of death filled the air. The nature created by Chae Joochul had sunk and turned into a swamp of demonic energy, and countless Heroes were collapsed on the ground either dead or unconscious.</p>
 <p>With a single breath, Baal had materialized the word 'destruction' in this space.</p>
 <p>—You've woken up.</p>
 <p>A voice resounded in the barrier. Kim Suho looked up and saw the true body of Baal looking down on him.<br>A black dragon.<br>That's how Kim Suho would describe him. The feeling he got when he first saw him wasn't wrong. That was the Black Dragon, often referred to as the Harbinger of Destruction in legends and myths.</p>
 <p>Baal's reptilian mouth moved.</p>
 <p>—I've received your memories. How painful. You must have received mine too, no?</p>
 <p>Kim Suho fell silent. Just like Baal said, a few pieces of memories had flowed into this brain and taken place naturally.</p>
 <p>—Transmigrator Hero.</p>
 <p>Hearing this voice, Kim Suho's shoulders flinched. His response was almost instinctive. Kim Suho knew what those two words were referring to.</p>
 <p>—For what purpose was that title created?</p>
 <p>Baal's form suddenly grew small. His giant, draconic body quickly became as big as a puppy.<br>Now looking like a cute lizard, Baal walked up to Kim Suho.</p>
 <p>—'Main Character', if you know the answer, I want to ask you.</p>
 <p>The lizard made a joking expression.</p>
 <p>—Are you disappointed? Are you angry? Or are you confused?</p>
 <p>Kim Suho's mouth remained shut.</p>
 <p>—Main Character, you should already know who the author of this world is.</p>
 <p>Kim Suho didn't know, but he found out.<br>Kim Hajin.<br>Information about Kim Hajin poured into his brain. Kim Hajin was Kim Suho's creator. He mapped out Kim Suho's character, wrote everything about his life, and used his misfortunes, happiness, and growth for other people's satisfaction.<br>The existence named 'Kim Suho' had been created for others' enjoyment.</p>
 <p>—Don't tell me you think this is okay? That you can continue to live in this world even if it is a mere novel. Such foolishness will not be tolerated.</p>
 <p>Kim Suho remembered how Kim Hajin was unreasonably kind when he treated him. Kim Suho thought it was due to friendship, but now he understood the real reason.</p>
 <p>—Unfortunately, that is not true. Why? Because if I die, the task of the author will come to an end.</p>
 <p>Kim Suho stared at Baal, who was chattering in front of him.</p>
 <p>—This is the final arc, Kim Suho, the final arc! When the curtain closes to the final arc, this world will come to an end. Everything will stop for eternity.</p>
 <p>Baal spoke with a grin.<br>The final arc. In other words, the conclusion.<br>A novel would end when it reached its conclusion. No matter how curious the readers were of the after story, the world inside the novel wouldn't continue on.</p>
 <p>—But Main Character, I know how to save this world. A method to let this world continue living…. You should know it now too.</p>
 <p>"…."</p>
 <p>When Kim Suho didn't answer, Ball pointed at Kim Suho's hip.</p>
 <p>—That method lies in your sword.</p>
 <p>The god-slaying sword, Misteltein.<br>Baal suggested that Kim Suho point this world at someone else.</p>
 <p>—Entrap the author's soul in this world forever. This world will stop if the author leaves, but it will be a different story if his soul stays. I will split his soul into pieces and scatter them throughout the world. That way, a natural world full of life will continue to exist. The world will not stop and move eternally.</p>
 <p>The core forming the world. Baal thought that this was Kim Hajin's soul. And most likely, it was true.</p>
 <p>—Kim Suho, you can become the sword that slays the god. For the sake of this world, play the role of killing its god. If 'he' dies, we will become complete existences. I will gladly accept you as my equal and bring eternal richness and fertility to your world. Wouldn't that be the true method of protecting and saving this world?</p>
 <p>Baal's long speech ended. He took a few steps back and stared at Kim Suho while floating around in the air.<br>Kim Suho didn't say a word. He stared at Baal without a hint of emotion on his face. Just like that, a long yet short time passed by.</p>
 <p>—…And your answer?</p>
 <p>Baal wanted to know what Kim Suho was thinking. However, even Baal couldn't read Kim Suho's thoughts. He guessed that this was because Kim Suho was the main character.<br>As such, Baal waited for Kim Suho's response. Of course, he didn't care if Kim Suho didn't agree right away.<br>His barrier was still trapping the so-called Creator. As long as the Creator was in this barrier and not his world, Baal felt like he could kill him.<br>So if Kim Suho refused, he planned to end everything here. It was just that convincing Kim Suho was a surer method of doing so.</p>
 <p>…However, what Kim Suho was thinking was completely different than Baal's. No, perhaps they were similar.<br>Kim Suho had a simple desire of wanting to cut Baal's twisted eyes.</p>
 <p>"Haa…."</p>
 <p>Kim Suho took a deep breath and shook off this desire. He remembered the past that he experienced in the form of a dream.</p>
 <p>—You! Let me go! I am your king! You dare….</p>
 <p>—Shut up! You beggar!</p>
 <p>—W-What? Beggar!? I saved you when you were a beggar, yet you dare to say this!?</p>
 <p>Two children were arguing loudly.<br>Kim Suho had failed to protect Puharen and killed Prihi with his own hands. His final memories were of him becoming tainted.</p>
 <p>However, he finally gained the chance to atone for his past sins.</p>
 <p>He didn't want to fail again at protecting what he cherished.</p>
 <p>He still remembered the day over 20 years ago when he was born on Earth as a baby. He didn't have parents in his previous life, but the parents in his current life gave him the name 'Suho'.<br>Suho, meaning, to protect. He felt as if fate was playing a trick on him. Regardless, he didn't want to become a Hero. He simply couldn't see himself as one when he had murdered the very person he swore to protect.</p>
 <p>But as time passed, he felt the invisible hand of fate constrict him. That feeling intensified every time he saw, touched, or swung a sword.<br>The existence known as Kim Suho carried a clear, noble 'will of the sword'.</p>
 <p>Growing up, he came to realize something.<br>That perhaps, this fate began from his name.</p>
 <p>He heard the answer to his suspicion on TV from a well-respected Hero named 'Shin Myungchul'.<br>Shin Myungchul stood in front of a group of boys and girls who would become Heroes in the future and gave a speech Kim Suho could never forget.</p>
 <p>—Everyone, do not forget. A Gift isn't a special right, but a duty. With great power comes great responsibility.</p>
 <p>When Kim Suho heard these words, he chose the path he wanted to take. In a way, it was quite obvious. After all, it was unlikely that he reincarnated in this world for no reason.<br>He didn't think he was 'chosen'.<br>He didn't think he had to become the savior either.<br>It was just that… he thought it was his duty… to protect.<br>The meaning behind protecting wasn't so complex. Protecting someone's family, protecting someone's friends, and protecting oneself…. That was all.</p>
 <p>"…Baal."</p>
 <p>Today, the intent he had carried from that day was ascertained by Baal.<br>From the start— he had been born to 'protect everyone'.</p>
 <p>—How disappointing.</p>
 <p>The moment Kim Suho said his name, Baal realized what decision he made.<br>Baal emitted demonic energy, which was dense and powerful enough to melt a human soul instantly.<br>However, Kim Suho severed it in half just by swinging his sword once. No, perhaps he didn't even take his sword out.</p>
 <p>—…!</p>
 <p>Taken by surprise, Baal shot back and transformed back into his dragon form.<br>But to Kim Suho, his transformation looked like a pufferfish puffing its body in fright.<br>To be frank— he pitied him.</p>
 <p>"Thanks. I found out thanks to you."</p>
 <p>Kim Suho smiled gently.<br>Even if what Baal said was true, or in other words, even if this world was a part of a novel, it didn't matter. Even if he was created by another being, he just had to be thankful of what he had and continue to live.<br>Moreover, he trusted that Kim Hajin wouldn't abandon this world.</p>
 <p>"I… have to defeat you."</p>
 <p>Although he was speaking calmly, he was boiling with rage on the inside. Around him were corpses of countless Heroes or those who were barely breathing.<br>Kim Suho's fury had surpassed his limit, and that made him calmer instead.</p>
 <p>"That way, I can protect this world."</p>
 <p>To actualize his previous thought - to cut Baal's twisted eyes - he swung his sword. Baal made something similar to a smile.</p>
 <p>—You just made the worst possible deci….</p>
 <p>Baal couldn't finish his sentence. Baal was waiting for Kim Suho to attack, but when Kim Suho swung his sword through the air— Baal lost his eye.</p>
 <p>—Ah?</p>
 <p>Rather than pain or rage, he felt doubt.<br>Why? And how?</p>
 <p>"A novel or not, this world isn't something you can destroy as you please. There are people I need to protect. And as long as I can protect them, that's enough for me."</p>
 <p>—…You insufferable mortal!</p>
 <p>His rage arrived late. Baal shouted in anger and shot his demonic energy forward. Even now, Baal didn't think it was possible for him to lose.<br>He had an infinite amount of demonic energy in his barrier. As long as he waited until Kim Suho ran out of magic power, he believed he could win.<br>However….</p>
 <p>"Too light."</p>
 <p>Kim Suho cut Baal's demonic energy too easily. He didn't even need to use his sword. With a single wave of his hand, he erased Baal's demonic energy.</p>
 <p>——!</p>
 <p>Baal roared and increased the amount and intensity of his demonic energy. A storm of demonic energy brewed in the air.<br>A terrifying, great power of destruction shot out. But even against a force capable of devouring a world….</p>
 <p>"Compared to the weight of your existence, you are too light."</p>
 <p>Kim Suho was relaxed.</p>
 <p>—You…!</p>
 <p><em>He's looking down on me!</em><br><em>A mere mortal is looking down on me!</em><br><em>That cannot be tolerated. That MUST not be allowed.</em><br><em>How can a mere human threaten me…!?</em></p>
 <p>For the first time, Baal felt resentment.</p>
 <p>"Let me ask."</p>
 <p>Kim Suho slowly approached Baal.<br>Baal backed off, matching Kim Suho's steps.</p>
 <p>"Were you created to live so pitifully?"</p>
 <p>—….</p>
 <p>At that moment, Baal stopped emitting his demonic energy. Kim Suho's arrogance had stepped over a line that turned his fury into calmness.<br>Baal made his emotions cold and thought how Kim Suho suddenly reached 'Transcendence'.</p>
 <p>It was then.</p>
 <p>"Wait, wait."</p>
 <p>A cheerful voice rang out.</p>
 <p>"I'm here too, Kim Suho~!"</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun called Kim Suho while shaking Balmung in one hand.<br>Kim Suho stared at her with a look of surprise.<br>However, that wasn't the only thing to surprise him.</p>
 <p>"Keuuu—"</p>
 <p>A pain-filled stretching sound rang out. A Hero stood up from the ruined scenery of nature. It was the Hero with his body covered in steel - the Nine Stars' Heynckes.</p>
 <p>"Ah, you were alive, as I thought! Oh! My disciple is here too!"</p>
 <p>Heynckes exclaimed as he looked back and forth between Kim Suho and Chae Nayun.</p>
 <p>"…."</p>
 <p>Soon afterward, Chae Joochul got up without a sound. He straightened out his bent back and neck, then cusped his hands behind his back. Although his traditional uniform was tattered, his skin underneath showed no signs of injury. His body was even more perfect than Kim Suho's, especially considering his age.</p>
 <p>"Aigo, my head…."</p>
 <p>Aileen was the next to get up. She furrowed her brows and pressed down on her temple. Because of the bags under her eyes, she looked like a caterpillar.</p>
 <p>"Thanks, Earth, you saved me."</p>
 <p>Rachel got up next. Earth's barrier had protected her body.</p>
 <p>"Keeeu… Where has my honor as a leader gone?"</p>
 <p>Yun Seung-Ah smiled as she looked at Kim Suho.<br>Kim Suho slowly turned around and stared at them.<br>They weren't the only ones awakening. Many Heroes were getting up one by one.<br>Although a vast majority were still collapsed unconscious, the Heroes had not lost to Baal yet.<br>In other words- there was no reason for Kim Suho to fight alone.</p>
 <p>"Why the hell is he so strong?"<br>"Ah… damn it. I'm out of magic power."<br>"Hey, Kim Suho, are you alright?"</p>
 <p>Hearing the voices of several Heroes, Kim Suho smiled faintly. They approached him one by one.<br>Soon, Kim Suho was surrounded by dozens of Heroes, and they stood together to gaze at Baal. Their will and fighting spirit had not been destroyed in the slightest.</p>
 <p>—…..</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Baal chuckled as he stared at the ant-like Heroes. An unappeasable fury welled up in his heart. This rage had to be bigger than the combined rage of all others in this world.</p>
 <p>…Next, Baal's eyes contorted.</p>
 <p>Kim Suho took out the holy sword containing his will.</p>
 <p>The human and devil began their final fight, thinking of two different conclusions.</p>
