 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Vast Expanse kept both his feet on the ground. There was no need for him to move. His will permeated the ground. Sometimes the earth shot up towards his enemies; other times it spread out in the sky like an umbrella.<br>His Gift was perfect for both attack and defense.<br>Vast Expanse became one with the earth and fought the Chameleon Troupe.</p>
 <p>But the combined strength of the Chameleon Troupe tenaciously countered Vast Expanse’s Gift. Cheok Jungyeong smashed Vast Expanse’s earth barrier with his strength and energy. Boss charred the soil with her hellfire shadow. Hirano Arashi attacked with destruction magic. Kaita’s wires, Jin Yohan’s Eight Serpent Spear, and Setryn’s daggers all rushed to Vast Expanse.</p>
 <p>The explosive fight continued. Magic powers collided with each other, and the clash of the earth and metals caused huge flames to soar. From a distance, it looked as if multiple firecrackers had been lit in a row.</p>
 <p>“…Why don’t we stop here?”</p>
 <p>But they couldn’t afford to take up any more time. When the fight died down a little, Boss requested Vast Expanse for a conversation before launching her ultimate skill.</p>
 <p>“We’ll have to resort to other means if you continue to hinder us.”</p>
 <p>“….” Vast Expanse looked at Boss silently. Suddenly, he gave a small smile. “So that small child who was by Yeonjun’s side has grown this much.”</p>
 <p>Yi Yeonjun.<br>The name of the former boss.<br>Boss clenched her fist as his name was always too painful to hear.</p>
 <p>“Child, why do you want the girl?”</p>
 <p>Vast Expanse pointed at Yi Yuri who was passed out on the ground a short distance away.</p>
 <p>“We want to protect her.”</p>
 <p>“Protect?” Vast Expanse’s expression changed slightly.</p>
 <p>“Right now she’s being used as a tool for political figures. She’ll continue to be exploited that way until she dies. We want to protect her from that.”</p>
 <p>“…And who asked you for such a thing? Was it perhaps the child you call Black Lotus?”</p>
 <p>Boss nodded, “Yes.”</p>
 <p>“Why would he ask for such a thing?”</p>
 <p>“I do not know.”</p>
 <p>“…You know neither his motive nor his purpose, yet you’re still willing to grant his request.” Vast Expanse gave a scornful smile. “That’s not what I taught Yeonjun.”</p>
 <p>“…I know.” Boss shook her head. The relationship between the former boss—Yi Yeonjun—and Vast Expanse was that of master and disciple. Vast Expanse taught Yi Yeonjun about the mindset of a mercenary, which was then passed down to Boss.</p>
 <p>“However, this is a request from the man whom I owe a lifetime of debt.”</p>
 <p>The request of someone who became precious to her.<br>Everyone was here today for the same reason. Boss did not force any of them to take part in this mission. All members voluntarily participated.<br>Before anyone knew it, Kim Hajin had become an important part of the Chameleon Troupe.</p>
 <p>“I can grant his request, because I’m not Yi Yeonjun.”</p>
 <p>Vast Expanse’s face stiffened at Boss’ remark. He sought to find traces of his old disciple in Boss’ face, but her face harbored a similar yet different kind of determination. Vast Expanse’s lips curved into a broad smile.</p>
 <p>“…Junwoo, put down your sword.”</p>
 <p>Kim Junwoo put his sword down. Vast Expanse’s magic power also dissipated.<br>Vast Expanse was planning on letting the Chameleon Troupe go, and the Chameleon Troupe would not refuse his kindness.</p>
 <p>“Thank you.”</p>
 <p>“You don’t have to thank me. I’m only retreating because our goals align,” Vast Expanse said as he turned around. “I shall visit you again in the near future. Keep the girl safe until then.”</p>
 <p>He slowly walked away from them, then suddenly, <em>paat—!</em><br>He disappeared from their sight with a flash of light.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>[Recorded Past, Akatrina]</p>
 <p>The Akatrina Continent was similar in appearance to the ‘fantasy worlds’ found in many novels. Up above the sky were two moon-like satellites and countless stars. The vastness of the celestial bodies lit up the dark sky. I walked amidst the strange yet beautiful scenery of a different world.</p>
 <p>[First goal — reach the capital of Plerion]</p>
 <p>The popup window that had appeared in front of me announced our first goal.<br>I continued to walk with this window fixed in the upper right-hand corner of my view.</p>
 <p>We walked on for about half a day, guided by the Book of Truth.</p>
 <p>“…Mm.”</p>
 <p>A new day dawned, and the sun was already above our heads. We could see a wall in the distance, but it was already horribly damaged and had lost its function. I checked its information.</p>
 <p>===<br>[Outer Wall of Plerion]<br>—The outer wall of ‘Plerion’, the capital of Plerion. It was destroyed in war.<br>===</p>
 <p>"This is the outer wall of Plerion."</p>
 <p>I recited the information to Jin Sahyuk, who was following me from behind. She widened her eyes and checked the wall.</p>
 <p>“…You’re right.”</p>
 <p>We paused in front of the wall. We could see the ruins beyond the destroyed wall. Dry bloodstains dyed the ground reddish-black, and the nasty smell of corpses reeked out. The view was truly gruesome.</p>
 <p>“By year 555, the entire continent was already in ruins. Many wars swept the continent like storms, and monsters came flooding in before we could recover from the aftermath of the war. In 555, the only place in Plerion that was still relatively intact was Count Schupert’s territory, which we just passed by, and Plerion, the capital city. But even those two cities were at odds with each other.”</p>
 <p>Jin Sahyuk explained to me the reason behind this dreary sight. Right now she was clearly different from the way she was on Earth. Perhaps her ‘memory seal’ had weakened.</p>
 <p>"Anyways, let's go.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>We walked past the crumbled wall. There wasn’t a single sign of life inside, only houses that had long been destroyed and countless bodies of the residents and soldiers who guarded the city.</p>
 <p>“It looks like the wall came down recently.”</p>
 <p>Judging from the conditions of the bodies, no more than a week had passed since their deaths. Jin Sahyuk nodded in agreement.</p>
 <p>“Seems so. There must have been a battle not long ago. …Oi, what do you plan to do from here?”</p>
 <p>I was dumbfounded by Jin Sahyuk’s question.<br>‘She clearly doesn’t understand the situation.’ Instead of getting angry, I heaved a sigh, and put my hand on Jin Sahyuk’s shoulder.</p>
 <p>“Why are you asking me that? You’re the one who dragged me here.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Jin Sahyuk’s face warped into a frown. She stared at me with sharp eyes.</p>
 <p>“It’s about time you were honest, you little prick.”</p>
 <p>“What? The hell are you—”</p>
 <p>At that time, <em>drk, drk—</em> the sound of galloping hooves rang out. Though the sound came from many horses, it sounded feeble for some reason.<br>I turned and looked towards the direction of the sound.</p>
 <p>An army of about 300 cavalrymen was approaching us, carrying the royal flag. But the army’s horses were in a terrible condition. It seemed they hadn’t eaten for days….<br>It was, of course, understandable. After all, life on the Akatrina Continent was on the brink of extinction, and its living conditions were virtually post-apocalyptic.</p>
 <p>"…You scoundrels!"</p>
 <p>With a huge yell, the army arrived in front of us. But the moment they saw our unusual clothes, they became perplexed. In the meantime, Jin Sahyuk tried to speak as if she was their King.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, you insolent fools. Who do you think you are talk—”</p>
 <p>“Be quiet. You’re not the King right now.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Jin Sahyuk quickly understood what I meant. She glanced over the calvary with her eyes wide open.</p>
 <p>Amidst the soldiers was a little girl in loose-fitting armor. She looked barely over ten years old. She was the smallest, but she rode the tallest horse.</p>
 <p>“…Whoa whoa.”</p>
 <p>The girl came forward slowly, soothing her horse.<br>We stared at the child.</p>
 <p>Indeed, she looked just like Jin Sahyuk, only 15 years younger. At the same time, they looked completely different from each other, because the girl was blonde and blue-eyed.</p>
 <p>“Who are you?” The girl, who was as cute as a doll, asked as she tried to keep her composure. I could see the grit and tenacity flickering in her eyes even from afar.</p>
 <p>I looked at Jin Sahyuk. She was looking at Plerion’s young ruler in a daze.<br>What would it be like to face myself from the past? Obviously I had no idea.</p>
 <p>“Answer me. If you don’t—!”</p>
 <p>The horse leaped just as the little King was about to shout.</p>
 <p>“Woah, woah. Stay still, you little….”</p>
 <p>A knight dismounted from his horse to hold her reins. Only then did the little King look down at us wholly.</p>
 <p>“Reveal your identities. Did Schupert send you? And also explain your attire.”</p>
 <p>“No, we’re….”</p>
 <p>I glanced at Jin Sahyuk. However, she was in no state to speak.</p>
 <p>“We’re from the temple.”</p>
 <p>“Temple?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>The knights naturally refused to believe me.</p>
 <p>"You fool! Do you know who you’re lying to? The temple is already…?”</p>
 <p>Actions were better than words. I showed them the evidence.<br>The manifestation of sacred power using Stigma. The knights stared blankly at the white lump of light rising from my palm. The light then flew over to a soldier, whose injuries immediately healed.</p>
 <p>“A-Ah, my wounds are gone!”</p>
 <p>“Is this enough?”</p>
 <p>I looked at them with a polite smile.<br>Suddenly, a voice full of joy came from the young Jin Sahyuk.</p>
 <p>“So, so the Temple is not destroyed?”</p>
 <p>I looked at Little Jin Sahyuk.<br>Her grin and big eyes appeared too inexperienced for a King.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>We marched into the inner walls of the city under the convoy of knights. However, the city was not in great shape. The walls were corroded and the people were starving. They paid little attention to the King passing by.</p>
 <p>“…In year 555, hope was already gone.”</p>
 <p>We were now in a guest room at the Plerion Royal Palace.</p>
 <p>“I lost something dear to me in the midst of political strife, and the servants who caused it ran away with food and valuables. The state coffers and stores were being emptied, my servants were disappearing one after another, but even then I was unaware of their betrayal. One day, I woke up and found that all I had left were the knights who had sworn loyalty to me.”</p>
 <p>In a tidy room with two large beds, Jin Sahyuk said with her eyes moist with emotion.</p>
 <p>"And two years later, in 557, I died while running away from monsters and Schupert.”</p>
 <p>"And the last knight you were with was Kim Suho?"</p>
 <p>Jin Sahyuk snorted.</p>
 <p>"He's not my knight. They all died, and he was just the only one who survived. Come to think of it, Kim Suho must be here, too."</p>
 <p>"…Whatever you say.”</p>
 <p>I sprawled out on the bed.<br>A new episode had started all of sudden, but I shouldn’t consider it a bother. This episode could be the most important turning point.</p>
 <p>One of the rewards for this episode was a [Purifying Crystal]. There wasn’t much time left before Earth began its Demon Realm Transformation. I hadn’t hinted at how to stop this transformation in the original story, and now the remake was offering me the solution.<br>‘Purifying Crystal’ was probably an item that could purify and stop the Demon Realm Transformation.</p>
 <p><em>Tiriring—</em></p>
 <p>At that moment, another window popped up in front of me.</p>
 <p>[Second goal — acquire 6 ‘Continental Fragment Pieces’ and partly restore Plerion.]</p>
 <p>"Hey, where's the crystal fragment?"</p>
 <p>I immediately asked Jin Sahyuk.</p>
 <p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
 <p>"The fragment you blew up. Check your pockets."</p>
 <p>"What do you— Hey, are you crazy?!"</p>
 <p>"I said, check your pockets."</p>
 <p><em>Knock knock</em><br>I heard knocks just as I was about to rummage through Jin Sahyuk’s pockets.</p>
 <p>—Come out.</p>
 <p>At the same time, I heard a thick voice.</p>
 <p>“I don’t have it, you little shit!”</p>
 <p>“…Why don’t you? This is annoying. You’re really useless…”</p>
 <p>I opened the door after I made sure Jin Sahyuk didn’t have the crystal fragment. Outside, a young knight was staring at us with a discontented look.</p>
 <p>"The King has generously prepared a dinner for you. Follow me."</p>
 <p>We followed the knight without putting up a fight. The knight led us to the dining room.</p>
 <p>There was a long table in the center of the large dining room. The knights stood in lines on either side of the room. Little Jin Sahyuk, ‘Prihi’, was sitting at the head of the table.</p>
 <p>Prihi greeted us with a nonchalant yet rejoicing expression.</p>
 <p>“I prepared a meal to welcome my honored guests.”</p>
 <p>Smoked pork, a few bowls of soup, salad, and a loaf of brown bread were on the table. It seemed that metal plates had been stolen already as all the cutlery was made of wood.<br>We sat down in our seats.</p>
 <p>“Thank you.”</p>
 <p>“Haha, no need for gratitude. More importantly, is it true that the Temple is still intact?”</p>
 <p>I nodded, trying to appear as divine as possible. I felt as if I was playing house with her.</p>
 <p>"Yes, and the Temple hopes that Plerion will soon regain its former glory.”</p>
 <p>Prihi failed to hide her smile.</p>
 <p>“Kmm. Well, that’s enough chitchat. Please eat.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you.”</p>
 <p>Though Prihi seemed satisfied, the knights surrounding us did not.<br>Apparently this dinner was very luxurious. So luxurious that every single knight had to starve in exchange for this one meal.<br>Prihi asked as she ate the soup, “…Then, should I call you ‘Priest?’”</p>
 <p>“Yes, please call me Priest Kim.”</p>
 <p>“Mm. Priest Kim. And next to you is?”</p>
 <p>“Oh, she’s my servant.”</p>
 <p>“…Wait, what. What? What?”</p>
 <p>Jin Sahyuk, who was looking down at the pork rather plaintively, jolted.<br>Dissatisfied with Jin Sahyuk’s ungraceful response, Prihi shot her future self a discontented look. And it wasn’t just Prihi.</p>
 <p>—Unbelievable.<br>—How is it possible for a mere servant to dine with the King?</p>
 <p>I was only trying to poke fun at Jin Sahyuk, but I ended up offending the knights. They were probably upset that a servant got to eat something even they themselves couldn’t eat.</p>
 <p>“Haha, I’m sorry. I was only joking. This person is a priest as well. She has very special spiritual powers.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, I see. Spiritual powers, you say….”</p>
 <p>Anyway, the meal went on. <em>Clatter clatter</em> I looked around as I moved my spoon.</p>
 <p>—Knight Leot caught that pig.<br>—I was looking forward to eating it.<br>—It can’t be helped. They’re from the Temple.<br>—That’s precisely the reason this is a problem. The Temple crumbled to nothing. Those suckers can’t help us in anyway. They’ll just be eating all our food, claiming they’re divine priests.</p>
 <p>I didn’t eat much. I wasn’t hungry, and since whatever food I left behind would go to the knights, I thought I’d let them have it.</p>
 <p>Instead, I chose to examine Prihi.<br>She was nibbling at the smoked pork with her small hands. She seemed to be enjoying it a lot. The reason the knights weren’t expressing any dissatisfaction to the King was probably because of that face.</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>And Jin Sahyuk was looking at her past self without even laying a finger on her food.</p>
 <p>—At least they’re tactful.<br>—The King doesn’t eat much, so we’ll all probably be able to take a bite or two.<br>—That’s good. <em>Gulp</em></p>
 <p>The dinner continued, and the young King was getting pretty full.<br><em>KWANG—!</em><br>Suddenly, the dining room’s door swished open and a scout rushed in.</p>
 <p>“I have an urgent message! Schupert's soldiers have broken into the inner wall.”</p>
 <p>“What?!”</p>
 <p>Prihi let out a yell. Her cherry lips were greasy with pig oil.</p>
 <p>“Count Schupert is claiming that he captured spies dispatched by your majesty….”</p>
 <p>“Stay here, honored guests. Let’s go-!”</p>
 <p>The King and her knights left the room at once.<br>Placed in an incomprehensible situation, a thought suddenly crossed my mind.</p>
 <p>“Wait, spies?”</p>
 <p>At our first meeting, Prihi had asked us, ‘Did Schupert send you?’</p>
 <p>Which meant Schupert was probably….<br>I got up in a hurry.</p>
 <p>“Hey, come with me. I think there may be other people besides us out there.”</p>
 <p>“I was gonna go anyway.”</p>
 <p>Jin Sahyuk was ready to use her magic power any minute now. We followed the King and her knights.<br>We passed by the terrified citizens and climbed up the wall.</p>
 <p>“Queen! I have brought the spies you sent me!”</p>
 <p>Below the wall was Schupert’s great army, which was actually made up of only about 3000 troops. But it was still big in comparison to the King’s army.</p>
 <p>“I said I’m not a spy!”</p>
 <p>A loud, high-pitched voice came up from below.</p>
 <p>I smiled down at them.</p>
 <p>Down below, Jin Seyeon and Aileen were locked up in a wooden cell. Their hands and feet were tied together with restraints.<br>As expected, they had ended up getting caught in the explosion as well.</p>
 <p>===<br>[Magic Suppressing Shackles]<br>—Inhibits the wearer’s use of magic power.<br>===</p>
 <p>‘Wow, that's a great item,' I thought, when Prihi suddenly shouted out loud.</p>
 <p>"Imbeciles! How dare you defy me, when you have kept your peace by the kindness of the former King?”</p>
 <p>Bloodshot eyes and body trembling with anger.<br>Prihi was enraged, and her anger was directed at the man who was looking up at her from below the wall— ‘Count Schupert’.</p>
 <p>“Haha. Little Queen, even now you bring up the former King! Very pathetic. That is why all of your men have left you!”</p>
 <p>—Hahahahaha! Foolish King! How ridiculous is it for a child to act so arrogantly?</p>
 <p>But the soldiers below only laughed at Prihi.<br>Prihi bit her lips, and the knights hid her behind them.</p>
 <p>“Those bastards…. You’re all dead.”</p>
 <p>Jin Sahyuk took a step forward, venting her rage.</p>
 <p>“Hahaha. We shall depart now, infantile King!”</p>
 <p>But the enemy didn’t seem to want to fight. They began to prepare to depart, leaving Aileen and Jin Seyeon where they were.</p>
 <p>Count Schupert said, “King, I was rather impressed with your scheme to lure monsters with the help of spies. However,”</p>
 <p>At that moment, something dark and red wriggled on the far horizon. Its movement was far too grotesque for a natural phenomenon.</p>
 <p>“…Huh.”</p>
 <p>I had seen something like that before. That was a herd of monsters. An army of monsters were approaching this way.</p>
 <p>“You are too stupid, too weak, and too evil. Accept the reality, Prihi. Plerion has already fallen.”</p>
 <p>“Schupert—!“</p>
 <p>Prihi let out a yell that was too faltering to be considered dignified.</p>
 <p>“Haha. Instead of screaming, you should think about how to repel those monsters first.”</p>
 <p>Schupert turned around, and so did his soldiers.<br>The knights couldn’t stop the enemies from leaving.</p>
 <p>“The number of monsters….”</p>
 <p>Because now, they were also witnessing the slowly advancing monsters from beneath the horizon.<br>Jin Sahyuk asked, “Oi, can you can deal with that?”</p>
 <p>“Probably.”</p>
 <p>I pulled a small iron box out of Stigma. The box was made using ‘Setting Intervention’ and contained approximately 10,000 bullets in it.</p>
 <p>“You retreat. We’ll stop them.”</p>
 <p>“No. You said you were from the Temple. Please take the King somewhere safe. We cannot stop those monsters.”</p>
 <p>“If the Temple has not perished, we believe you can find a way. Think of it as a retreat for the sake of future advancement. Take the King and run!”</p>
 <p>The knights each said a thing or two to us, but the King remained silent. Completely absorbed in grief and anger, she quietly sobbed. She couldn’t suppress the feeling of indignation welling up in her.<br>Jin Sahyuk only stared at the King.</p>
 <p>“No, we can stop them.”</p>
 <p>I stretched out Aether and wrapped it around Jin Seyeon and Aileen, pulling them up over the wall. Hiyak— Kyaak— With strange screams, the two of them fell on the floor.</p>
 <p>“The only way we can survive is by defeating them.”</p>
 <p>I took out the Desert Eagle. A sharp flash of light shot out from the gun.<br>The knights looked at me in bewilderment, but I didn’t care. I aimed my gun at the monsters below.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>Meanwhile, at Yoo Yeonha’s mansion in Seoul.</p>
 <p>“Haa….”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha processed all the papers she had piled up on her desk and buried herself in her chair. Her workload had increased recently because of the Orden Incident. But now that she was finally done, she planned to take tomorrow off.</p>
 <p>“Huaaammm….”</p>
 <p>She yawned and turned on the TV. An interesting show just happened to be on air. It was about the forbidden romance between a low-grade Hero and a Master-rank Hero.</p>
 <p>—It doesn’t matter that you’re a low-rank Hero. What matters is that I love you…… <em>Tzzt</em> We have breaking news.</p>
 <p>The screen switched and the news came on.</p>
 <p>—This is a breaking news report. Orden claims that he has taken multiple Heroes who broke into his territory as hostage.</p>
 <p>"…What?"</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha jumped up and stared the TV screen.</p>
 <p>—Although nothing has been confirmed yet, ‘Aileen’, ‘Yi Yongha’, ‘Park Hanho’ from the Temple of Justice, in addition to Master-rank Hero ‘Jin Seyeon’, high-rank Hero ‘Seo Youngji’, high-intermediate-rank Hero ‘Shin Jonghak’, and the S-rank mercenary ‘Fenrir’, are currently held captive according to Orden. Orden demands the Association and the Korean government to….</p>
 <p>At that moment, Yoo Yeonha’s expression froze.<br>Not only Shin Jonghak, but Kim Hajin as well?<br>She tilted her head, wondering if she had misheard.</p>
 <p><em>Tiriring—</em></p>
 <p>But at this time, her smartwatch rang. It was solid information from the Association and the government.</p>
 <p>[Calling for an emergency meeting. Orden is holding Heroes and a mercenary hostage.]</p>
 <p>And the message clearly contained the names Shin Jonghak and Kim Hajin.</p>
