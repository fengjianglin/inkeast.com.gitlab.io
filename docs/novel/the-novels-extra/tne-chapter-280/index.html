 <p><em>Beep— Beep—</em></p>
 <p>Orden Spy Retrieval Mission. The Association needed the strongest and the stealthiest member of the Chameleon Troupe for this mission they named ‘Sunrise’. Boss was the most suitable member, of course, but the reason I volunteered in her place was simple.<br>It wasn’t just because I could turn back time and Boss couldn’t.<br>I was worried about her.<br>It was a strange feeling.<br>I didn’t want to see her get hurt.</p>
 <p><em>Beep— Beep—</em></p>
 <p>Boss must have thought the same thing. Before I came here, we had a little argument over who would participate in this mission.<br>I won in the end, but… Boss was probably watching me from somewhere right now.</p>
 <p><em>Beep— Beep—</em></p>
 <p>I took out the [Mysterious Magnifying Glass] again, which allowed me to identify other people’s emotions and weaknesses. Boss’ emotions that I witnessed the other day continued to linger in my mind.</p>
 <p>“Haa….”</p>
 <p>I heaved a sigh.<br>I suddenly remembered that it had been 8 years since I first woke up in this world.<br>That’s enough time to graduate from both middle and high school.<br>More than half of those years, I spent with Boss.</p>
 <p><em>Beep— Beep—</em></p>
 <p>Over the years, through all the laughter we shared, she changed me and I changed her. She had become close to me before I knew it.</p>
 <p>“…Yi Byul.”</p>
 <p>I muttered her name.<br>It was then that I realized this could be an interesting pun.<br>‘Yi Byul (Separation) had become close to me before I knew it.’</p>
 <p><em>Beep— Beep.</em></p>
 <p>My thoughts were starting to get off topic when the Morse code finally stopped.<br>I ceased thinking and turned my attention to the screen which displayed a pair of numbers.</p>
 <p>[7.273853, 20.141379]</p>
 <p>Converted to latitude and longitude, the result was: [7º16’25.9”N 20º08’29.0”E].</p>
 <p>These coordinates, according to the map… was in the middle of Orden’s palace.</p>
 <p>“…What the.”</p>
 <p>The coordinates were pointing to the center of Orden’s palace.<br>Well, to be fair, this mission wouldn’t have come with such great rewards if it was easy.<br>I picked up the radio and whispered, “I received the coordinates.”</p>
 <p>—Roger that. Contact us after rescuing our agent. Also, please wear the camera we gave you. After we confirm that our agent is safe, we’ll let you know the location of the underground fortress.</p>
 <p>The radio stopped there, and I took out the [Book of Truth] to make sure all of this wasn’t a trap.<br>My question: ‘Is this mission a facade for capturing the Chameleon Troupe?’<br>The answer: ‘No.’</p>
 <p>“That was a waste.”</p>
 <p>Though it sounded simple, the question actually took up two streaks of Stigma, because it required an understanding of human psychology and its structure. Fortunately, thanks to the Orb of Regeneration, it would take only three hours to fully recharge Stigma.</p>
 <p>“Mmm~”</p>
 <p>I stretched before I began the mission.<br>I put on some armor and other equipment I brought with me.<br>First was the carbon fiber armor reinforced with magic, rare ores, and enchantment — the [Black Lotus Uniform].</p>
 <p>===<br>[Black Lotus Uniform] [Masterpiece] [Composite Attribute]<br>A masterpiece born of great dexterity. When you look at this armor, you can’t help but admire the craftsmanship of the Dwarves, the ‘creation race’.</p>
 <p>「Defensive power — 7/10」<br>「High-rank Shock Absorption」<br>「High-rank Magic Power Circulation」<br>「High-rank Physical Strength Enhancement」<br>「High-rank Magic Power Reinforcement」<br>「Pinnacle-rank Instant Acceleration」<br>===</p>
 <p>Even though this uniform weighed as light as a t-shirt, it had the sturdiness of a military tank. In addition, I granted it four ‘high-rank’ and one ‘pinnacle-grade’ enchants through Four-colored Enchant.<br>I put extra effort into the last option, 「Pinnacle-grade Instant Acceleration」.</p>
 <p>“I’ll try it out today.”</p>
 <p>A while ago, Boss severed one of Kurukuru’s wings. I ground it into powder and used it as material for Four-colored Enchant. As a result, I was able to reproduce Kurukuru’s speed, though only for a moment.</p>
 <p>After the great [Black Lotus Uniform] was the [Black Lotus Robe], which was meant to be worn over the uniform.<br>My creativity was at its limit, so I ended up naming all my equipment after ‘Black Lotus’.<br>Somehow their names made them feel more luxurious.</p>
 <p>===<br>[Black Lotus Robe] [Luxury] [Multiple Attributes]<br>A masterpiece born of great dexterity. When you look at this robe, you can’t help but admire the craftsmanship of the Dwarves, the ‘creation race’.</p>
 <p>「Defensive power — 5/10」<br>「High-rank Shock Absorption」<br>「High-rank Concealment ∙ Stealth」<br>「High-rank Anti-Magic Force」<br>===</p>
 <p>Not only did the robe come with a stealth function, but it was also equipped with an ‘anti-magic power’ function, making me immune to almost all petty spells.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, I also brought the [Black Lotus Walker], which increased my speed, and the [Black Lotus Wrist Protector], which increased the power of my arrows.</p>
 <p>Click— Click—</p>
 <p>I was now dressed from head to toe in the complete set of ‘Black Lotus attire’.<br>Lastly, I put the invisibility cloak over Spartan who was sitting on my shoulder.</p>
 <p>“Are you ready?”</p>
 <p>—Pururu.</p>
 <p>Now fully grown, Spartan was as big as the length of my forearm.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go rescue that agent.”</p>
 <p>—Pururu.</p>
 <p>Spartan was already aware of the coordinates. He closed his eyes and started shaking.<br>Soon, Spartan’s Authority ‘Long-ranged Teleportation’, which allowed for instant travel over a long distance, activated.</p>
 <p>When I opened my eyes again, I was in front of Orden’s palace.</p>
 <p>“Okay, Spartan, you should head back now.”</p>
 <p>—Pururu?</p>
 <p>Spartan shook his head, but this place was too dangerous for him. One hit in the wrong spot and he could die.<br>I didn’t want to risk losing Spartan, so I forcefully sent him away.</p>
 <p>After I made sure Spartan left— I turned on the camera I received from the Association, which was hanging at the end of a necklace around my neck.</p>
 <p>“This is Black Lotus. I turned the camera on. Can you see?”</p>
 <p>—Yes. Thank you for your cooperation. Please capture the palace as much as possible….<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>Meanwhile, Aileen created an island of her own inside the commander’s tent of the underground fortress. She built walls with boxes of snacks from all around the world and placed cute stuffed animals here and there for decoration.</p>
 <p>“Mm~ Mmm~”</p>
 <p>The combination of snacks, a penguin plush, and a shark plush was indeed beautiful.</p>
 <p>“Aren’t you guys the cutest~?”</p>
 <p>Some people might criticize Aileen for being so laid-back during a serious mission, but this was how she always was.</p>
 <p>Aileen never had the chance to experience real fear because she had been incredibly powerful since she was a child. She was always first place, revered by all. Many people expected her to become the strongest Hero in history.</p>
 <p>However, as Aileen grew stronger, she became lonelier.<br>To Aileen, who became a High-rank Hero at the tender age of thirteen, ‘friends’ were nothing more than a fantasy. Aileen turned to these stuffed animals to soothe her loneliness.</p>
 <p>A penguin with glasses and a baby shark that sang songs.</p>
 <p>“Huhu….”</p>
 <p>She took a step back to examine the room she decorated. The longer she saw it, the more satisfied she became.<br>‘Now this is worth willing to save the world for,’ Aileen nodded her head in satisfaction when suddenly…</p>
 <p><em>Tok, tok—</em></p>
 <p>Someone knocked on her door. Aileen flinched.</p>
 <p>“Guys, go hide for a minute.”</p>
 <p>Aileen whispered, and her Spirit Speech activated right away.<br><em>Sssss….</em><br>Spirit Speech descended from the ceiling like a powder and concealed the animals from view.</p>
 <p>“Okay, come in.”</p>
 <p>As the door opened, Aileen returned to her chair and took out her laptop. She even started typing to pretend she was working.</p>
 <p>“Oh, what are these? There’s a ton of snacks here.”</p>
 <p>Aileen recognized the guest’s voice right away.<br>It was Jin Seyeon.</p>
 <p>“I’m not going to give you any, so go awa…?”</p>
 <p>Aileen turned around, declining Jin Seyeon’s request in advance.<br>But Jin Seyeon wasn’t alone. She was with Chae Nayun.</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun scratched the back of her neck nervously and bowed.</p>
 <p>“Haha…. How are you, Captain Aileen? It’s me, Chae Nayun.”</p>
 <p>“…Who are you? Where’s your team leader? What’s Yun Seung-Ah doing right now?”</p>
 <p>“She’s training with Kim Suho.”</p>
 <p>“…She’s flirting during a serious mission?”</p>
 <p><em>Tzzt— Tzzt—</em><br>The moment Aileen frowned, the radio began crackling again. This time, a window popped up on her laptop screen. It was a video call.</p>
 <p>—I have been informed that you finished setting up the fortress.</p>
 <p>Yi Gongmyung’s face appeared on the screen.</p>
 <p>“Yup, we did. What’s next?”</p>
 <p>—We’ve got a plan going on our side currently. Soon, the person we hired will be rescuing our spy from Orden.</p>
 <p>The Association had dispatched a spy into Orden’s territory about three months ago. They were able to win over a few people whom Orden had been trying to recruit.</p>
 <p>“…Hired?”</p>
 <p>—Yes. He’s skilled enough to break in unnoticed.</p>
 <p>Aileen wasn’t convinced. The Association had deployed spies many times, but Orden had uncovered them all.</p>
 <p>“Wait, are you sure that the spy’s trustworthy? What if he betrays us?”</p>
 <p>—You can trust him.</p>
 <p>The problem was the ‘vow’ that all spies had to take. This vow served as a safety net to prevent spies from turning on the Association. However, Orden possessed the ability to discern the difference in magic power caused by said vow. So, the spy this time was sent in without a vow, oath, or even a seal.</p>
 <p>“…Well, I guess I have no choice but to trust him. How’s the mission going?”</p>
 <p>—The rescue agent departed a few moments ago.</p>
 <p>“And who is this rescue agent?”</p>
 <p>—It’s someone you all know well.</p>
 <p>Though Yi Gongmyung’s voice was full of confidence, his answer wasn’t enough to satisfy Aileen.<br>Aileen folded her arms with a frown.</p>
 <p>“What’s his name?”</p>
 <p>She asked again, and this time, Yi Gongmyung was straightforward.</p>
 <p>—’Black Lotus’.</p>
 <p>“…What?! Black Lotus?”</p>
 <p>“What? For real?”</p>
 <p>Not only Aileen but also Jin Seyeon and Chae Nayun were surprised.</p>
 <p>—Yes, we entrusted Black Lotus with the mission to rescue the spy.</p>
 <p>“What, are you serious?”</p>
 <p>—Why would I lie about it?</p>
 <p>“Uh…. Kuhum. No wonder that old geezer from the Association was brimming with confidence.”</p>
 <p>Yi Yukho, the current chairman of the Association. When Aileen met him a week ago to discuss the current mission, that old, bald codger had told her not to worry.</p>
 <p>“Black Lotus seems like a safe bet, as long as he doesn’t betray us.”</p>
 <p>Though she sounded calm on the outside, Aileen was quite surprised. She never imagined the Association would hire Black Lotus. The present circumstance reminded her once again of the grave importance of their mission.</p>
 <p>—Right. Black Lotus is currently heading towards…. Ah, he turned the camera on.</p>
 <p>“Camera? Please show us!”</p>
 <p>Jin Seyeon shouted out of surprise. Chae Nayun also pushed her head towards the laptop screen.</p>
 <p>“Ugh, get out of my way, all of you! Hey, do you even know who Black Lotus is?”</p>
 <p>Aileen placed her hand on Chae Nayun’s cheek and pushed her away.</p>
 <p>“Of course I do, though I’ve never met him in person.”</p>
 <p>“Then you don’t really know him. Move!”</p>
 <p>—I’ll share the view of Black Lotus’s camera with you.</p>
 <p>Yi Gongmyung turned on the view that was connected to Black Lotus’ camera.<br><em>Pat!</em> With a tiny flash of light, the screen switched to a view of Orden’s palace.</p>
 <p>—This is Black Lotus’ point of view. Coordinates are being updated in real time, so please assist him if the situation gets out of hand.</p>
 <p>“Okay, okay.”</p>
 <p>Aileen, Chae Nayun, and Jin Seyeon all gathered around the screen.<br>At first, Black Lotus seemed to be wandering around the palace aimlessly.<br>Then, suddenly, he rushed to the gate at the speed of light.</p>
 <p>“Wow! Oh wow, he’s so freaking fast. Er, I mean… he’s really fast.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun was thoroughly impressed with Black Lotus’ speed. But realizing that her language wasn’t appropriate given the situation, Chae Nayun slapped her mouth with her hand in embarrassment.</p>
 <p>“You’re right, he’s very fast. He… seems to have gotten stronger.”</p>
 <p>Jin Seyeon muttered. She wasn’t at all aware that the increase in Black Lotus’ speed was due to the equipment he had on.<br>Aileen also nodded in agreement.</p>
 <p>“He moves like lightning.”</p>
 <p>“…It’s almost too pretentious for an archer.”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, they heard an unfamiliar voice.</p>
 <p>—I’ve entered Orden’s palace.</p>
 <p>It came from the laptop. It was Black Lotus’ voice.</p>
 <p>At that moment, as he turned a corner, Black Lotus spotted a humanoid monster.<br>The monster seemed to be a guard on patrol. Black Lotus quickly hid behind a wall.</p>
 <p>“…!”</p>
 <p>“Look!”</p>
 <p>The trio flinched in surprise.</p>
 <p>—A monster is coming this way. I’ll dispose of him.</p>
 <p>But Black Lotus was calm. He took out his bow and positioned an arrow against it. In the next moment, something mysterious happened.</p>
 <p><em>Chwaaa—</em></p>
 <p>The monster was definitely standing on the right side of the corner. However, Black Lotus aimed his arrow straight ahead. The arrow flew in a straight line, before suddenly warping to the right.</p>
 <p><em>Crack—!</em></p>
 <p>An impossible attack from a blind spot.<br>Naturally, it was unavoidable, and the humanoid monster fell to the ground after the arrow pierced his neck.</p>
 <p>“That arrow just bent on its own. I’ve seen him do that before too,” Aileen muttered, pointing at the screen.</p>
 <p>“Oh, you’re right. It wasn’t even a magic arrow. Interesting…” Chae Nayun also chimed in but stopped when she suddenly felt a sense of déjà vu.</p>
 <p>‘A self-bending arrow. Where have I seen that before…?’</p>
 <p>“His skill is almost god-like.”</p>
 <p>Jin Seyeon was also intrigued by Black Lotus’ skill.<br>It was then.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on here?”</p>
 <p>The door swung open and Yun Seung-Ah entered the tent.<br>And she wasn’t alone. Kim Suho, her training partner, was also with her.</p>
 <p>“Shhh. Be quiet. We’re watching Black Lotus right now.”</p>
 <p>Yun Seung-Ah widened her eyes at Aileen’s remark.<br>Kim Suho couldn’t help but shout out in surprise.</p>
 <p>“Black Lotus?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, we recruited him for the mission. He’s on our side for now. How’s that? Our connections are pretty amazing, huh?”</p>
 <p>Aileen smirked.<br>As a foe, Black Lotus was fearsome; but as a friend, he was more dependable than anyone else.<br>Aileen knew how annoying Black Lotus could be from the time he blocked the bridge on the 8th floor of the Tower of Wish. But this time he was on her side and there was nothing to be afraid of.</p>
 <p>“Oh… let me see. I want to see too.”</p>
 <p>Yun Seung-Ah and Kim Suho joined the trio.<br>Though the tent became a little cramped for space, there was still enough room for everyone.</p>
 <p>“What? Black Lotus?”</p>
 <p>However, this wasn’t the end.<br>Suddenly the entire fortress started to buzz with voices, probably because of Kim Suho’s shout out from earlier.</p>
 <p>“Where~?”</p>
 <p>“Did you just say Black Lotus?”</p>
 <p>More and more people started to pour in, and soon enough, Aileen’s tent was filled well beyond its maximum capacity.</p>
 <p>“Dammit, I can’t see! Get lost, all of you!”</p>
 <p>The tiny commander— Aileen yelled in annoyance.<br>But no one seemed to pay attention to her. Rather, they pushed Aileen away and nestled in front of the screen.</p>
 <p>“Heh~ So this is from Black Lotus’ point of view? I was actually really curious about him. I’m going to watch how he plays~”</p>
 <p>Nicholas from the Temple of Justice seemed especially excited.<br>This was due to the recently formed rivalry between the Temple of Justice and the Chameleon Troupe as the latter began to gain recognition among the public.</p>
 <p>—I believe the spy is in a different building.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Black Lotus spoke again.<br>He had just entered the palace. The inside was very spacious and filled with several different buildings.</p>
 <p>—I’ll head there right away.</p>
 <p>Black Lotus rushed towards one of the buildings.<br>But the scene that appeared on the screen next was simply absurd.</p>
 <p>“Huh… that’s… a lot of monsters.” Jin Seyeon muttered.</p>
 <p>Just as she said, the building was fiercely guarded. It was apparent even from afar.<br>There were at least a hundred monsters on land and a dozen in the sky.</p>
 <p>—Can you make it?</p>
 <p>Yi Gongmyung asked Black Lotus. He was worried because he hadn’t expected there to be this many guards.</p>
 <p>—….</p>
 <p>There was a short silence, followed by a burst of small laughter.</p>
 <p>—Piece of cake.</p>
 <p>The screen changed swiftly.<br>Black Lotus was as fast as lightning but as silent as wind.<br>In only a second or so, Black Lotus had moved to a completely different location.</p>
 <p>“Ooh~ Look at him go….”</p>
 <p>Nicholas licked his lips with a grin.</p>
 <p>“He’s really, really fast.”</p>
 <p>“And he doesn’t make any sound when he moves.”</p>
 <p>Yun Seung-Ah and Kim Suho also voiced their opinions.<br>The audience(?) gathered in the commander’s tent admired every move Black Lotus made.</p>
 <p>The first mission finally began.</p>
