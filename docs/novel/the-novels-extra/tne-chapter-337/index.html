<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Reality Manipulation, an Authority that allowed its user to interfere with the material world and manipulate reality itself.</p> 
 <p>Jin Sahyuk realized that she could kill Bell with her Authority. All she had to do was manipulate the ‘material’ that was Bell. Bell was no longer a human but ‘a container that held Baal’, so it wouldn’t be too difficult for Jin Sahyuk to transform his body.</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>But Jin Sahyuk hesitated. Old memories kept coming back.<br> After meeting her end in Akatrina, she had reincarnated in a boring world called Earth. Her biological parents abandoned her before she could even memorize their faces. She went through the painful process of learning to walk and speak again in an orphanage.</p> 
 <p>When she turned three and was finally getting used to Earth’s language, Bell came to see her for the first time.</p> 
 <p>“…Oi.”</p> 
 <p>Jin Sahyuk called Bell. Even as he experienced a tremendous amount of pain, Bell gave a sly smile that was so characteristic of himself.</p> 
 <p>“What? Got something to say to me?”</p> 
 <p>She stared at Bell in silence.<br> She had spent 25 years with Bell. Perhaps 25 years meant nothing to someone like Bell, but for an ordinary human like herself, 25 years was half her entire lifetime.</p> 
 <p>“…I do.”</p> 
 <p>Bell established himself as her teacher and helped awaken her Authority. In a sense, he was like a male nanny, watching over her as she grew. He endured her quick-tempered and selfish personality without much complaint.<br> Even if all that was just a buildup for this moment, right now, Jin Sahyuk felt the need to say something she had never said before.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you.”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>Bell’s expression stiffened.<br> But soon, a playful smile once again spread across his face, and he looked at Jin Sahyuk proudly.</p> 
 <p>“No, I’m the one who should be thanking you.”</p> 
 <p>Bell’s words served as a signal. Jin Sahyuk nodded and gathered her magic power. Now, it was time to grant Bell’s wish.</p> 
 <p><em>Guoooo….</em></p> 
 <p>A whirlwind of black magic power shook like a storm as it formed around her hand.<br> This was Jin Sahyuk’s Authority that could melt and dismantle reality. She swung her hand that was tinged black like a spear.</p> 
 <p><em>Chwaak—!</em></p> 
 <p>Her hand penetrated Bell’s chest. It cut open his skin, broke his ribs, and reached his heart. Bell’s heart was beating vividly.</p> 
 <p>Jin Sahyuk looked into Bell’s eyes.</p> 
 <p>“….”</p> 
 <p>Bell met her gaze and waited for his end.<br> Jin Sahyuk closed her eyes and inhaled.<br> <em>One, two, three.</em><br> She counted inside her head and opened her eyes again. Her entire body was overrun with magic power. She planned to invest her all in this final move.<br> Bell gave her his last smile.</p> 
 <p>“Please.”</p> 
 <p>Jin Sahyuk nodded. She had already made her decision. Without hesitation, she released her magic power into Bell’s body.</p> 
 <p><em>Guooooo….</em></p> 
 <p>Her Authority engulfed Bell. Her magic power tore apart his veins and dove deeper into his body. The tornado of magic power soon reached the Authority ‘Magic Power Body’ etched in the center of Bell’s heart.</p> 
 <p>Jin Sahyuk poured all her magic power into the heart.<br> The goal of Reality Manipulation was to eliminate Magic Power Body.</p> 
 <p>“….”</p> 
 <p>At that moment— an unimaginable amount of pain struck Bell. However, he neither screamed nor squirmed. With a faint smile, he placed his hand on Jin Sahyuk’s shoulder. </p> 
 <p>Bell remained calm throughout the whole process. He simply looked at Jin Sahyuk with the eyes of a proud father looking at his daughter.</p> 
 <p><em>Chwaaaaa…!</em></p> 
 <p>The movement of magic power quickened, and the ‘human shell’ containing Bell began to fall apart. Patches of his skin turned into dust and disappeared into thin air, and the bones, muscles, nerves, and organs underneath them began to fade away as well.</p> 
 <p>“…Goodbye.”</p> 
 <p>At the moment of Bell’s death, Jin Sahyuk offered him her last words. Bell did not return an answer but only a smile, one that seemed to belong to the happiest man on earth.</p> 
 <p>Jin Sahyuk wished for him to rest in peace, surrounded by only the happiest memories.</p> 
 <p>…However.</p> 
 <p>Suddenly, a tremendous amount of magic power appeared at the spot where Bell had just disappeared.<br> <em>Kwaaaaaa—!</em><br> The magic power immediately spread outside the mansion and formed a dome-shaped barrier.</p> 
 <p>The barrier caged not only Jin Sahyuk and Shin Jonghak but also the entire [Leores Plaza]. Even so, Jin Sahyuk remained calm. She knew who the magic power belonged to.</p> 
 <p>Baal.</p> 
 <p>—Haaa….</p> 
 <p>The strongest of the evil gods, the rank 1 devil. <br> He had broken out of his container and descended as a devil.</p> 
 <p>—…I’ve waited for far too long.</p> 
 <p>Baal and Bell looked alike. Their appearances were almost identical, except for the horn on Baal’s forehead and his crimson eyes.</p> 
 <p>—So you are the one who granted my friend’s wish.</p> 
 <p>His voice vibrated in a way that no human’s voice could vibrate. Baal looked at Jin Sahyuk and smiled. Though the presence of the evil god was certainly overwhelming, Jin Sahyuk stepped forward without getting intimidated.</p> 
 <p>“It’s your turn to keep your promise.”</p> 
 <p>—…Promise.</p> 
 <p>“That’s right. Or, did you not hear about the promise?”</p> 
 <p>—Of course, I did.</p> 
 <p>Baal shook his head. He then formed a rock and handed it to Jin Sahyuk.</p> 
 <p>—Take it. It’s what you wanted, a stone that will transfer you to another dimension. Once you pour your magic power into this stone, a dimensional portal will appear. Your power is special, after all.”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>Jin Sahyuk looked at the rock with suspicion. But the magical rock appeared authentic. According to Bell, Baal was a devil who kept his promises.</p> 
 <p>“By the way, what did you mean by ‘my friend’? You considered Bell your friend?” Jin Sahyuk asked as she slid the rock into her pocket.</p> 
 <p>—693 years is a long time, even for me. He’s been with me all those years, and I reckon that qualifies him as my friend.</p> 
 <p>“…Then, I assume you’re sad?”</p> 
 <p>Jin Sahyuk asked sarcastically. The word ‘friend’ bothered her. What kind of person would enslave his friend for 693 years?</p> 
 <p>—He was a useful friend, but it’s okay. 693 years was long enough. He can go. The one who truly wants to be with me is here right now.</p> 
 <p>Baal smiled, looking into the distance. His gaze traveled to the wall that Chae Nayun and Jin Sahyuk had destroyed upon entering.<br> Jin Sahyuk widened her eyes and followed Baal’s gaze.</p> 
 <p>“….”</p> 
 <p>In the darkness, she saw Yi Yeonjun. She noticed that one of his arms had been torn off from an apparent battle.</p> 
 <p>“What are you doing here? And where’d you lose your arm?”</p> 
 <p>Jin Sahyuk asked mockingly, causing Yi Yeonjun to glare at Jin Sahyuk.</p> 
 <p>He answered, “I’ve been betrayed.”</p> 
 <p>“…Huh?”</p> 
 <p>His answer was so random that Jin Sahyuk couldn’t help but frown.</p> 
 <p>**</p> 
 <p>[England — Evandel’s domain]</p> 
 <p>—Valac’s army is causing an uproar across Europe. Germany has decided to retaliate, while Italy has chosen to respond more realistically….<br> —Next up is Spain. ‘Astaroth’s army’ has appeared from inside Astaroth’s barrier-<br> —We have breaking news. Djinns are currently invading by sea. All citizens near the coast must evacuate.</p> 
 <p>Valac and the other hostile devils were rampaging all across the world.<br> Ah Hae-In was watching the news on her smartwatch when she heard the sound of a belt tightening around the waist and turned her head to the side.</p> 
 <p>“All done. I’m finished,” Evandel announced and clenched her fists.</p> 
 <p>Ah Hae-In scanned the girl carefully.<br> The hat Kim Hajin got her, the robe that improves its wearer’s resistance and adaptability, and the belt that exudes defense magic in response to enemy attacks. Everything was perfect.</p> 
 <p>“I see that you’re dressed up… but are you sure you can do it?” Ah Hae-In asked carefully.</p> 
 <p>Evandel’s talent was now in full bloom, but to her teacher’s eyes, she was still just a child who needed protection.</p> 
 <p>“Yeah! I can do it!”</p> 
 <p>Despite her teacher’s worries, Evandel nodded confidently.<br> There was only one reason that Evandel endured a period of loneliness to build her domain - to protect.<br> Evandel wanted to protect Rachel, Hajin, her friends, as well as the good people and animals around the world.</p> 
 <p>“I see.”</p> 
 <p>Ah Hae-In nodded proudly.</p> 
 <p>“Then, get ready.”</p> 
 <p>“Okay-!” Evandel shouted. At the same time, Ah Hae-In and Evandel each summoned their spirit beasts. The pair stared at the demonic monsters that were beginning to appear from beneath the horizon.</p> 
 <p>Kim Hajin and other Heroes had not returned from the Demon Realm Gate yet, but such fact could not hold them back. They would have to win without the Heroes’ help.</p> 
 <p>“Go,” Ah Hae-In muttered, and the Cardinal Beast, Azure Dragon, appeared.</p> 
 <p><em>Grrrrr….</em></p> 
 <p>The Azure Dragon revealed his gigantic figure and placed Ah Hae-In on his head. Meanwhile, Evandel got on a unicorn that was much smaller than the Azure Dragon.</p> 
 <p>—Look, over there! It’s the Azure Dragon!<br> —There’s also a unicorn!<br> —W-Wow!</p> 
 <p>Reporters, drones, camera crews, Heroes and citizens who had been waiting near Evandel's domain all turned their gaze to the pair.<br> At the center of the attention of the eager and hopeful audience— Evandel cried.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s gooooo—!”</p> 
 <p>Her cute voice was full of determination.</p> 
 <p><em>Rumble—!</em></p> 
 <p>Evandel’s spirit beasts began to dash at their master’s command towards the ‘villains’ on the other side of the ocean.<br> The footsteps of individual spirit beasts soon merged into one and became a giant roar that shook the earth.</p> 
 <p>**</p> 
 <p>[Demon Realm Gate — The Republic of Leores after Baal’s descent]</p> 
 <p>“…!”</p> 
 <p>I opened my eyes. My back was in touch with something soft and the ceiling looked unfamiliar.</p> 
 <p><em>Gulp—</em></p> 
 <p>I swallowed hard and began thinking.<br> I knew for sure that I hadn’t revived. I would know if I did.<br> The most likely explanation was that Boss, who had been listening in on our conversation, saved me. The fact that I was alive meant that Boss defeated Yi Yeonjun, and….</p> 
 <p>“You up?”</p> 
 <p>“Uaak!”</p> 
 <p>I turned to the voice in surprise. I thought my heart might burst, but soon heaved a sigh of relief.<br> It was Jain. She was sitting at the bedside in her original appearance which I hadn’t seen in a while.</p> 
 <p>“Yes, I’m awake. Long time no see, Jain.”</p> 
 <p>“Yeah, it’s been a while~ I missed you. How are you feeling?”</p> 
 <p>“Fine. More importantly, where’s Boss?”</p> 
 <p>When I asked Jain about Boss, she smiled bitterly and drew the curtain, then pointed outside the window.<br> I was speechless.<br> The scenery just outside the window was hell-like.</p> 
 <p>“…What is that?”</p> 
 <p>The Leores Plaza, where the Transnational Peace Conference should have been held, was surrounded by a huge barrier, as a dark storm raged everywhere and gargoyles and other creatures roamed the sky.</p> 
 <p>“As you can see, it’s a mess. I managed to escape with you, but Kim Suho, Chae Nayun, Yun Seung-Ah and Boss… they’re all stuck in there.”</p> 
 <p>“…Has Baal descended?”</p> 
 <p>“Yeah.”</p> 
 <p>Jain nodded casually.</p> 
 <p>“It happened much quicker than we all had expected. Bell’s dead and Baal descended.”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>“Oh, and I heard about Yeonjun-ssi. I didn’t know. Thanks for bringing me to my senses. I almost got persuaded by Yeonjun-ssi, too~”</p> 
 <p>Jain beamed.<br> Dazed, I stared at Jain before turning my gaze to the barrier that was likely formed by Baal.</p> 
 <p>“Is Boss in there?”</p> 
 <p>“Yeah. She’s waiting for you, probably~?”</p> 
 <p>I then turned my gaze to the corner of the room. My weapons were there. Aether, the Black Lotus Uniform, Temujin’s Bow, and the Pinnacle-grade Artifact [Ancient Hero Leoricus’s Exorcism Bow].</p> 
 <p>“I fixed them all. I used the Regeneration Orb or whatever it’s called to fix them~”</p> 
 <p>“…Thank you.”</p> 
 <p>I got up from the bed and tried to approach my weapons.</p> 
 <p>“Sure~ By the way, you have a nice body, Hajin~”</p> 
 <p>But then Jain said something weird. It was then that I finally realized the cause of my sense of disharmony.<br> I was completely naked.</p> 
 <p>“…Ah.”</p> 
 <p>Thankfully, Aether, having noticed my perplexity, flew at me and stuck to my body. Aether transformed into a piece of cloth and covered my vital(?) area.</p> 
 <p>“Kuhum. Kmmmm.”</p> 
 <p>I let out a dry cough and armed myself.<br> First, I put on the Black Lotus Uniform, then I put Desert Eagle into its holster. Finally, I turned to the two bows.</p> 
 <p>[Temujin’s Bow Blessed by Horus]<br> [Ancient Hero Leoricus’s Exorcism Bow]</p> 
 <p>I had yet to synthesize the two weapons.</p> 
 <p>“Synthesis.”</p> 
 <p>Now seemed like a good time.</p> 
 <p>[You have activated Lv.10 Synthesis.]<br> [Fusing a pinnacle-grade item with a pinnacle-grade item….]<br> [The success rate is extremely low….]</p> 
 <p>If this was a game, what I was doing right now would equal the act of combining two of the rarest types of items. Therefore, it wasn’t surprising that the success rate was extremely low. My luck had always hurdled tasks that seemed impossible, however.</p> 
 <p>[Your luck has been activated!]<br> [A tremendous amount of luck has increased the rate of success!]<br> [‘Young Dwarf’s Dexterity’ has also responded!]</p> 
 <p>Golden confetti covered the System, and as a result….</p> 
 <p>[Your skill has successfully synthesized ‘Black Lotus Bow’ from ‘Temujin’s Bow Blessed By Horus’ and ‘Ancient Hero Leoricus’s Exorcism Bow’!]<br> [With ‘Young Dwarf’s Dexterity’, you have created a world-class weapon. You earned SP!]</p> 
 <p>The pair of bows clung to each other and transformed into an even more powerful artifact. Its name was simple: ‘Black Lotus Bow’. As an artifact born of my skill and Gifts, this bow was truly one of a kind.</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>I scrutinized the bow’s information.</p> 
 <p>“Wow~ What’s that~? It looks really good~”</p> 
 <p>Jain exclaimed in admiration before I even finished reading the item information.<br> I nodded with a small smile.</p> 
 <p>“You’re right. It is good.”</p> 
 <p>“…Then, are you ready to go?”</p> 
 <p>I took a deep breath.<br> Then I nodded.</p> 
 <p>“Yes.”</p> 
 <p>This could be <em>the</em> last battle.<br> I no longer had any reason to conserve SP, Stigma’s magic power, God-slaying Bullet or anything else.<br> I vowed to stake my all.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go end everything.”</p>
