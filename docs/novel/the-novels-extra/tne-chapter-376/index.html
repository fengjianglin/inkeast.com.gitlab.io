 <p>“Get up~ Get up~ Get up~”</p>
 <p>A cute voice tickled my ears. Perhaps because I was still drowsy, it sounded like the chirping of a bird.</p>
 <p>“Get up~ Get uuuuup~”</p>
 <p>My shoulders shook. It seemed even hands this small had decent pushing power.<br>Although the drowsiness quickly went away, I stayed still on purpose, being careful to stop my mouth from wriggling from joy.</p>
 <p>“I said get up….”</p>
 <p>After shaking me for a long time, Evandel crossed her arms and glared at me with perked up eyes. Only then did I open my eyes. Seeing Evandel’s pouting face, I smiled.</p>
 <p>“Ah, you’re up~”</p>
 <p>“…Yep, I’m up.”</p>
 <p>Drunk on sleep, I hugged Evandel, and she dug into my chest like a puppy. She even giggled adorably.<br>Stroking Evandel’s hair, I faced the window. A green hill entered my eyes. Illuminated by the cozy sun, a residential district was laid out before it.</p>
 <p>This place was the Healing City constructed by the Colored-Paper Charity Foundation.<br>Three months ago, I came down from the Alps to this city and became an official ‘pharmacist’.</p>
 <p>“Hajin, I’m hungry. I have to eat breakfast.”</p>
 <p>Evandel’s squishy voice rose from my chest.</p>
 <p>“Oh, you do?”</p>
 <p>“Un~ Let’s go~”</p>
 <p>Evandel was now old enough to be used to using casual speech. With a smile, I got up from my bed.</p>
 <p>When I arrived at the cafeteria with Evandel, Rachel and Yi Byul were sitting side by side, staring at each other. Their expressions were stiff as though they had finished a serious conversation, but they changed instantly when they saw me and Evandel.<br>Rachel offered a greeting first.</p>
 <p>“You’re awake? Good job, Evandel.”</p>
 <p>“Un~”</p>
 <p>Evandel scurried up and sat between Rachel and Yi Byul. I sat down on the opposite side, facing Evandel. Then, I asked Yi Byul and Rachel.</p>
 <p>“What were you talking about?”</p>
 <p>The two of them exchanged glances before shrugging and saying a sentence each.</p>
 <p>“We were talking about Evandel.”</p>
 <p>“…It’s been three months since I started staying here with Evandel and Rachel, after all.”</p>
 <p>“Ah~”</p>
 <p>Rachel and Yi Byul exchanged glances before letting out tiny coughs. A strange air flowed between them. I didn’t dig into it too deeply and reached to grab a loaf of bread from the table.</p>
 <p>Nibbling on the bread, I looked around at the people who made me feel like I was dreaming every day.<br>They had stayed by my side for the past three months without losing their memories of me. Right. Three months had already gone by since I started living with them.</p>
 <p>Many things happened during this time. Unsurprisingly, Yoo Yeonha was the culprit behind most happenings. After hearing that I had been ‘deleted’ from this world, she misunderstood as she always did.</p>
 <p>What was it again? ‘So that is your sacrifice’? In any case, she blurted out something incomprehensible and researched how to bring back my existence.</p>
 <p>It was cute at first as she started by gathering everyone who remembered me. Including Yoo Yeonha herself, there were nine people: Chae Nayun, Rachel, Evandel, Cheok Jungyeong, Jain, Droon, Jin Seyeon, and Yi Byul.<br>Unfortunately, Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak, who didn’t know about the Kwang-Oh Incident and lacked a key link like Evandel, couldn’t remember me.</p>
 <p>After that, Yoo Yeonha began to experiment. Before I could even think to stop her, she used tens of billions of won.<br>But there was no gain as expected, and Yoo Yeonha ended up offering me Essential Pharmacy’s CEO position.<br>But since I didn’t think of myself as someone worthy of that position, I settled with becoming a researcher. After all, my goal was to help as many people as possible.</p>
 <p>“How is it? Good?”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Yi Byul asked. Judging by her eyes full of expectation, it seemed she was the one who baked this bread.<br>I nodded my head with a smile.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, it’s good.”</p>
 <p>“I’m glad….”</p>
 <p>Yi Byul sighed a breath of relief. That was kind of cute. I stared at Yi Byul for a moment before grabbing her hand from under the table.</p>
 <p>“Ah.”</p>
 <p>An embarrassed sound escaped her lips.</p>
 <p>“Kuhum.”</p>
 <p>At that exact moment, Rachel let out a dry cough.<br>Yi Byul flinched and quickly let go of me, while I awkwardly scratched my head.</p>
 <p>“Oh, how have things been, Rachel-ssi?”</p>
 <p>“…I’m still seeking what I’ve always been seeking. The revival of England and the English Royal Court Guild. That is the reason I went to Cube all those years ago.”</p>
 <p>Rachel smiled sweetly. Just as she said, Rachel had lived her life for the revival of England and the English Royal Court Guild. And as she had made great contributions during the Great Devil War, now should be the perfect time. After all, talks of a Restoration were gaining traction in England.</p>
 <p>“Of course, there are still several hurdles to get through. Lancaster is still alive too.”</p>
 <p>“…He is?”</p>
 <p>For a moment, I was dumbstruck. That guy was still alive?</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>Rachel continued with a light smile.</p>
 <p>“There are still many problems that have to be resolved. In the past, I was afraid… but now, I’m okay. I’ve gotten stronger. Thanks to Hajin-ssi and Evandel.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>That caught me off guard. I flinched slightly, while Yi Byul’s eyes turned sharper. She glanced at Rachel before looking back at me with puffed cheeks.</p>
 <p>Rachel added, “…Thank you.”</p>
 <p>She only said two words, but I could clearly see through the meaning behind them. They were just as transparent as Rachel’s clear, ocean-colored eyes.<br>Rachel then shrugged leisurely.</p>
 <p>“Thinking about it now, I don’t think I’ve said thank you to Hajin-ssi that often.”</p>
 <p>“Uh… no, you don’t really need to. I should be the one who’s thanking you.”</p>
 <p>I nodded my head in embarrassment and went back to eating my loaf of bread. Meanwhile, Yi Byul spoke to Rachel.</p>
 <p>“…There will be a small meeting tonight.”</p>
 <p>I looked up again. Yi Byul seemed to be nervous as she was glaring at Rachel with a laser-like gaze. A faint chuckle escaped my mouth.</p>
 <p>“Rachel, you’re coming too, right?”</p>
 <p>She sounded like she was issuing a challenge, but the intent behind her words was pure and nonmalicious. As Rachel knew this too, she smiled brightly and accepted Yi Byul’s invitation.</p>
 <p>I stared at them for a moment before opening my mouth.</p>
 <p>“I’ll buy the groceries.”</p>
 <p>“Un?! Then me too~ I wanna go too~”</p>
 <p>Evandel smiled brightly and raised both of her hands. Rachel’s eyes widened slightly.</p>
 <p>“Hm? I don’t mind, but Evandel, weren’t you going to Disneyland today with your friends?”</p>
 <p>“Aaah! You’re right!”</p>
 <p>Rachel reminded Evandel of a promise she made with her friends, and like a true adult, Evandel said, “I guess we can buy groceries together next time~”</p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p>5:30 p.m. As the sun was beginning to set, I went outside to buy groceries from a supermarket at the center of the city.<br>The city’s streets were filled with young boys and girls. I walked while listening to the children’s cheerful laughter.</p>
 <p>Then, I suddenly felt a gaze fall on me. It was fixated on me only, coming from the zelkova tree forest on the right side of the city.</p>
 <p>I became nervous. At my current state, I couldn’t even defeat ordinary Djinns.</p>
 <p>But soon, the mysterious person revealed herself and eliminated my tenseness and worry.</p>
 <p>It was Chae Nayun.</p>
 <p>She stood at the border between the city road and the sky and looked down at me. After doing so for a long time, she grinned confidently.</p>
 <p>“Have you been well?”</p>
 <p>She greeted me in a Chae Nayun-like fashion.<br>I smiled back and nodded my head.</p>
 <p>“Yeah. It’s been a while.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun didn’t show herself after we last met at the cabin. She had vanished after leaving behind the words ‘I’m leaving’.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, it really has been a while.”</p>
 <p>She crossed her arms.</p>
 <p>“Wait, didn’t you say you were going to conquer the Tower of Miracle?”</p>
 <p>The Tower of Miracle.<br>This Tower had left many wounds to both me and Chae Nayun.<br>After Creator’s Sacred Grace’s failure to conquer this Tower, it was treated as a forbidden topic by the public. But when Essence of the Strait recently announced their plans to officially conquer the Tower, it was brought into the spotlight once again.</p>
 <p>“Yep, I plan on obliterating that Tower.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun raised her arm and flexed. I could practically see the confidence oozing out of her.</p>
 <p>“Pft. Yeah, If it’s you, I’m sure it’s possible…. Oh right, I’m about to go buy some groceries. Do you want to come too?”</p>
 <p>I pointed at the supermarket in the distance.<br>However, Chae Nayun shook her head.</p>
 <p>“No, that’s not what I came here to do.”</p>
 <p>“…Then why are you here?”</p>
 <p>“Well… the campaign is two days away. I might die there, so I thought I’d tell you before I go.”</p>
 <p>She brought up a frightening topic.<br>When I furrowed my brows, Chae Nayun lowered her head. The glow of the setting sun burst out from behind her. Chae Nayun remained silent for a long time before muttering in a quiet voice.</p>
 <p>“…Thank you for everything.”</p>
 <p>“Huh?”</p>
 <p>“Thanks to you, I didn’t have to see Oppa becoming a devil. I picked up the sword because of you, and you’re also the reason I became this strong.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun spoke as if she were reciting a line she had practiced countless times. I could tell she was embarrassed since her face was flushed red.</p>
 <p>“And thanks to you, I regained my real grandfather.”</p>
 <p>“…It’ll take him 20 years to fully recover with that medicine.”</p>
 <p>A pill that reduced the side-effects of Gifts. As I created it using Setting Intervention, reproducing it was extremely difficult. But Essential Pharmacy succeeded in creating a tiny amount, and they had been given to Heynckes and Chae Jooochul.<br>It was true that Chae Joochul regained a little bit of his true emotions, but I didn’t think Chae Nayun was talking about that.</p>
 <p>“Just accept my gratitude, bastard. In a way, you’re the reason I’m alive and standing here right now.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>A bitter smile emerged on my face.<br>Looking back… it was thanks to Chae Nayun that I came to love this world. The one who showed me that this world wasn’t a novel was none other than Chae Nayun.</p>
 <p>I replied, “…It’s the same with me. The reason I’m here… it might be because of you.”</p>
 <p>“Is it? That’s good to hear.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun walked up to me and stopped a nose-distance away. Looking straight into my eyes, she scratched her cheeks before dropping her head.<br>And once her gaze fell, it didn’t come back up for a while.</p>
 <p>“Then….”</p>
 <p>After taking a few steps back while looking down at my feet, she raised her head as though she finally came to a decision. Then, she reached her hand out. I reflexively flinched, feeling that her action was intimidating.</p>
 <p>“W-What?”</p>
 <p>“Here.”</p>
 <p>When Chae Nayun opened her fist, a shining object dangled down.</p>
 <p>“Ah.”</p>
 <p>An exclamation escaped my mouth.<br>This was the necklace I gifted Chae Nayun a long time ago.<br>Chae Nayun stared at it with a bittersweet face.</p>
 <p>“You lent it to me, remember? Since the war is over, I should return it.”</p>
 <p>“…It’s fine.”</p>
 <p>I pushed her hand back. That was obvious. After all, I made this necklace for her.</p>
 <p>“What? No, take it.”</p>
 <p>“I said it’s fine. Just think of it as a gift from a friend.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun paused. Standing still, she clenched her fists. Her face froze, and her shoulders stiffened.<br>Chae Nayun slicked her hair back roughly.</p>
 <p>“You… you still think we can be friends?”</p>
 <p>Her trembling voice trailed off. As though she was angry… no, sad, she glared at me hatefully.</p>
 <p>“You should know. We can’t be friends.”</p>
 <p>I didn’t say anything. There wasn’t anything I could tell Chae Nayun as of now. I could only wait for Chae Nayun’s ‘choice’ that would come one day in the future.</p>
 <p>“Do you know what kind of a person you are to me?”</p>
 <p>I shook my head.<br>Chae Nayun stared at me fixedly and made a dispirited smile.</p>
 <p>“Most likely… I’m going to continue hating you and loving you. Until the day I die.”</p>
 <p>Her voice was as cold as ice and as deep as the ocean. It seemed to carry an incomprehensible darkness.</p>
 <p>“So, here!”</p>
 <p>Without giving me a chance to think, she reached out with her hand.</p>
 <p>“Take this, you bastard!”</p>
 <p>“…If you say so.”</p>
 <p>“Huh?”</p>
 <p>When I agreed, a shadow was suddenly cast over Chae Nayun’s face. But putting on a bright smile in the next instance, she playfully tapped my chest with her hand holding the necklace.</p>
 <p>“Okay, take it.”</p>
 <p>“I will, but not now. I’ll take it back after you come back from the campaign.”</p>
 <p>“…What?”</p>
 <p>“You heard me. I’m talking about the Tower of Miracle. If you want to succeed, or at least increase the chances of succeeding by even a little, you’ll need that necklace.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun became dumbfounded, and I laughed.</p>
 <p>In truth, the Tower of Miracle in my story was a McGuffin.<br>I did not write even a rough outline about the Tower of Miracle. I only thought, ‘What would happen if this was the reward?’ in my head.<br>So, it was extremely unlikely that the Tower’s reward was the same as what I thought of.</p>
 <p>However.</p>
 <p>If the Tower’s reward really <em>was</em> something similar to what ‘I thought’, and if Chae Nayun came to possess that ‘miracle’, would she be able to become happy again?</p>
 <p>“…Got it? Give it back to me after you conquer the Tower of Miracle. Don’t refuse just for the sake of it.”</p>
 <p>I pushed Chae Nayun’s fist back. She furrowed her brows, then reluctantly put the necklace back into her pocket.</p>
 <p>“So fussy… Fine. It’s true that this necklace will help a lot….”</p>
 <p>Grumbling brusquely, Chae Nayun turned around.<br>The sun had finished setting before I noticed, and Chae Nayun became dyed by the darkness of the navy world.<br><em>Tap, tap.</em><br>Having failed to achieve her initial objective, Chae Nayun spoke with her back facing me.</p>
 <p>“I’m going. See you again.”</p>
 <p>I replied as I placed her leaving figure in my memories.</p>
 <p>“…Yeah, have a happy life.”</p>
 <p>I didn’t say ‘see you again’ on purpose.</p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p>—How was Disneyland? Fun?</p>
 <p>—Un! Super fun~!</p>
 <p>A rowdy noise woke me up while I was having a catnap on the balcony.</p>
 <p>—I saw a flying pumpkin carriage!</p>
 <p>Massaging my stiff neck, I looked at the living room through the window. I saw Evandel in a fairy uniform and a fairy headband.</p>
 <p>—But the haunted house was too scary….</p>
 <p>Her cute appearance made me grin, and I was late to notice the person sitting next to me. I turned my head and faced Yi Byul, who was leaning on the balcony’s rail and staring at me.</p>
 <p>“Oh, you were watching me? You could have woken me up.”</p>
 <p>I spoke as I rubbed my heavy eyelids.</p>
 <p>“…Sorry.”</p>
 <p>But Yi Byul suddenly apologized. Her expression was dark too.<br>I was confused, but then I realized the reason my eyelids felt so heavy.<br>I was crying.<br>I quickly wiped off the tears and spoke.</p>
 <p>“Oh, this? It’s nothing. I must have had a bad dream.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>“Really. You don’t have to be sorry about anything.”</p>
 <p>Yi Byul grabbed my hand tightly. Her cold hand was shaking.<br>I felt like I knew what she was thinking about.<br>After all… she was the only one who knew the truth about me.</p>
 <p>Yi Byul spoke, “…You can leave whenever you want. I understand.”</p>
 <p>“No, I’m not going anywhere.”</p>
 <p>I refused flatly and looked into her eyes. She was tearing up from guilt.<br>This was the reason I couldn’t say ‘I can’t go.’ For us, there was a big difference between not going and being unable to go.</p>
 <p>“I’m staying here. Because you said you won’t forget me and because you came to find me first.”</p>
 <p>“I—”</p>
 <p>Just as Yi Byul was about to say something, the balcony door suddenly shot open, and Evandel came running in.</p>
 <p>“Hajin~ Hajin~ I’m back~!”</p>
 <p>After proudly boasting to Rachel, it seemed I was next. I exchanged glances with Yi Byul before coming out to the living room.<br>There were many people gathered there. Rachel and Yoo Yeonha, Droon and Yi Yuri, and even eight of Evandel’s friends.</p>
 <p>“Hello~”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha waved her hand.</p>
 <p>“Yo.”</p>
 <p>I waved my hand half-heartedly.<br>Although Yoo Yeonha was currently the most influential person on the planet, she wasn’t a particularly rare guest here. Even if she was busy, she came at least once a week.</p>
 <p>“Wait, Evandel?”</p>
 <p>“Un~?”</p>
 <p>“Go play with your friends on the 2nd floor. The adults have something to talk about.”</p>
 <p>“Okay! Can we all play games?!”</p>
 <p>“Only for two hours.”</p>
 <p>“Yay~!”</p>
 <p>Evandel and here friends rushed up to the 2nd floor. I breathed out a sigh, then sat down on the long table in the living room. A plate of thick steak was steaming in front of me.<br>Yoo Yeonha asked as soon as Yi Byul and I sat down.</p>
 <p>“Nayun came and left immediately?”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>I nodded silently.</p>
 <p>“Nayun-nim came?”</p>
 <p>Rachel, who was sitting next to Yoo Yeonha, opened her eyes wide.</p>
 <p>“You should ask him. He should know better than me.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha pointed at me.</p>
 <p>“Yes, Chae Nayun came and left. She talked about the Tower campaign that’s coming up and didn’t say much else.”</p>
 <p>“Ah, right, the Tower of Miracle campaign is coming up…. Nayun-nim must be really busy then.”</p>
 <p>Rachel seemed a bit regretful.</p>
 <p>For the record, Aileen was elected as the new chairman of the Hero Association, and Chae Nayun became the youngest Master-rank Hero. As many high-rank Heroes were promoted to Master-rank simultaneously, the honorable title went to Chae Nayun who was four days younger than Kim Suho.</p>
 <p>The reason Rachel started addressing her so respectfully was because of her position as the ‘youngest Master-rank Hero’. Rachel, who was still a high-rank grade-1 Hero (world rank 79), was rather serious about formalities.</p>
 <p>“There you go again with Nayun-nim…. Just address her casually.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha shook her head before quickly turning her head to face me.</p>
 <p>“Here, take this.”</p>
 <p>She suddenly took out a piece of paper.</p>
 <p>“What’s this?”</p>
 <p>“You rested a lot already. It’s time to start working.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha smiled mischievously. This smile of hers always made me anxious. Just what the heck did she do this time?<br>I swallowed hard and checked the contents of the paper.</p>
 <p>[Press Conference Request Form]</p>
 <p>“…What? A press conference?”</p>
 <p>“Yep. The patent for the baldness cure you created passed. There’s a reason you’re called the ‘Miracle Pharmacist’ right now. Everyone is talking about you, and you’re practically the savior of all men between the ages of 20 and 90.”</p>
 <p>“But what’s the press conference for?”</p>
 <p>“Well, who knows? Maybe your existence might revive in this world with this press conference.”</p>
 <p>A chuckle immediately escaped my mouth. For a mere baldness cure?</p>
 <p>However, Yoo Yeonha raised her eyebrows sharply.</p>
 <p>“No, I’m being serious. The baldness cure is a huge deal. It’s something that even magic has failed to solve. If you hold a press conference, tens of thousands of people will swarm to it. Do you know how many people in the world are suffering from complete or partial baldness? In the West, over half—”</p>
 <p>“Ah, geez, stop. A mere baldness cure won’t—”</p>
 <p>“Mere?”</p>
 <p>“…Oh right. Didn’t you say you got partial balding from stress?”</p>
 <p>“What? No, I didn’t! When did I say that!?”</p>
 <p>“Then take this back.”</p>
 <p>I gave the document back to Yoo Yeonha. She pouted and put the request form away.<br>At that moment, Yi Byul asked.</p>
 <p>“Anyways, you didn’t come with Cheok Jungyeong?”</p>
 <p>It seemed Yi Byul was wistful for some familiar faces.</p>
 <p>“Mm, no. They will become wanted targets again.”</p>
 <p>“…Wanted targets?”</p>
 <p>Yi Byul furrowed her brows.</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha looked out the window and stared at the distant sky, then murmured.</p>
 <p>“Right about now… they should be in the underground prison, preparing to win Yoo Jinwoong over.”</p>
 <p>“…What?”</p>
 <p>“Huh?”</p>
 <p>My eyes widened. I wasn’t the only one. Yi Byul and Rachel also made similar faces.<br>Yoo Yeonha waved her hand as though it wasn’t a big deal.</p>
 <p>“It’s fine. This matter will be taken care of with utmost secrecy. We finished discussing it with the Association Chairman. Yoo Jinwoong received 15 years behind bars, but Chae Joochul got away scot-free. Maybe feeling bad about that, she agreed as soon as we made the offer.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha shrugged before continuing.</p>
 <p>“In truth, Jin Seyeon was the one who made the offer first. She’s completely become a member of the Chameleon Troupe now. Something about protecting justice from the shadows…. Well, she’ll become a thief and a destroyer along with the rest of them, but she’ll be doing it to the ‘evil’ ones. Anyways, I’m happy. I don’t want my father rotting away behind bars for 15 years.”</p>
 <p><em>Sk, sk.</em> Yoo Yeonha sliced her steak with her knife and fork.</p>
 <p>“I’m sure he’ll agree. Traveling the world was his second dream.”</p>
 <p>Yi Byul and I stared at Yoo Yeonha. She placed a small chunk of the steak into her mouth.<br><em>Nom, nom.</em><br>After gracefully chewing and swallowing the piece, she wiped her mouth with a napkin and put the knife and fork down.</p>
 <p>“Now, then.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha interlocked her fingers and rested her chin on them. Then, she made an evil, mischievous smile.</p>
 <p>“That’s what’s going on with me. Rachel is probably going to say something about her guild or whatever, so….”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha looked back and forth between me and Yi Byul.</p>
 <p>“Why don’t I hear you two’s story?”</p>
 <p>The room turned silent for a moment. Rachel and even Droon and Yi Yuri looked curious.<br>I grabbed Yi Byul’s hand. She seemed to be nervous as it was cold and stiff.</p>
 <p>“Well….”</p>
 <p>I thought about the people I abandoned. My friends and family, who were my all before I came to this world.</p>
 <p>Although I might not be able to see them ever again, I didn’t regret my decision.<br>I miss them every day and felt saddened when I thought about my parents losing me forever, but I wouldn’t have made this decision if I wasn’t sure.</p>
 <p>“…Our story.”</p>
 <p>I thought about Chae Nayun who wasn’t here. I thought about Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak who could not remember me. I thought about the things I could do in this world.<br>Then, I looked at the person who was very, very precious to me.</p>
 <p>“We’ll have to write it from now. Until it becomes a happy ending.”</p>
 <p>I spoke as I always did and smiled. Yi Byul smiled back. Everyone in the room smiled.<br>That was enough.</p>
 <p>Although I became a completely different person in a completely different world.<br>Although I lost everything from the previous world.<br>The current me… no, we, could confidently say that we are happy.<br>Since we can forever be with people who are precious to us….</p>
