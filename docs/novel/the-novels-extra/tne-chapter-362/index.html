 <p>[Morax and Jin Sahyuk's Story] </p> 
 <p><em>Jiing—</em> Hearing this vibration, Jin Sahyuk shook her head. Demonic energy exploded from an unknown place and burned the surface of her skin. Jin Sahyuk purified the demonic energy with a simple use of Reality Manipulation. The demonic energy turned blue before dissipating into the air. </p> 
 <p>"Are you okay?" A somewhat arrogant voice rang out. Jin Sahyuk turned to that direction. Shin Jonghak was looking at her with his spear in his hand. He seemed to have been unaffected by the demonic energy explosion. </p> 
 <p>"…." Jin Sahyuk got up silently. She then checked on Morax. The devil was full of slash marks. He was missing most of his fingers, and black blood was covering his giant body. A human would have died by now, but Morax was without a doubt alive.</p> 
 <p>It was then.</p> 
 <p>"Interesting." </p> 
 <p>A voice that was neither Shin Jonghak's nor Jin Sahyuk's resounded in the barrier. Shin Jonghak grabbed his spear, while Jin Sahyuk tied her disheveled, lightly-burnt hair into a ponytail.</p> 
 <p>"These beings called devils are truly interesting. Not as much as humans, of course, but interesting indeed." </p> 
 <p>The Monster King Orden murmured as he looked up at Morax. His eyes flickered with curiosity, and Jin Sahyuk couldn't help but find this sight shocking. </p> 
 <p>"Did he go crazy after reviving?" </p> 
 <p>The bastard had appeared out of nowhere and was simply staring at Morax. Without doing anything, it stood fixed on the ground. He was 'observing' Morax, just as the word suggested. <br> Orden turned his head and faced Jin Sahyuk.</p> 
 <p>"Do you need help, human?" </p> 
 <p>"…."</p> 
 <p>Jin Sahyuk shrugged off Orden's gaze with a grin. </p> 
 <p>"You can help by screwing off." </p> 
 <p>Kurukuru, who was standing next to Orden, flapped its wings in response. It seemed to be threatening Jin Sahyuk, saying, 'How dare you—' <br> Orden suppressed Kurukuru and replied dryly. </p> 
 <p>"It's too interesting a sight to just pass by, no?"</p> 
 <p>"…I didn't know you talked so much." </p> 
 <p>Just like how Orden found the situation interesting, Jin Sahyuk was interested in Orden's change. His body was a lot smaller than it was in the past, and humor seemed to take place of the weight that was lost. </p> 
 <p><em>Whoosh—</em></p> 
 <p>At that moment, Shin Jonghak's spear flew through the sky. He muttered as he glared at Jin Sahyuk with a displeased look.</p> 
 <p>"Orden doesn't seem to be an ally or a foe. Just focus on the devil, Jin Sahyuk."</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Morax began to move once again. He let out an odd screech and swung his arm, and Shin Jonghak swung his spear and pushed him away. <br> Black light flickered from the tip of his spear. This light of darkness was hard to explain in theory, but in any case, it was the power that belonged to Shin Myungchul, which Shin Jonghak had now succeeded.</p> 
 <p>"…Hmm."</p> 
 <p>With this, Jin Sahyuk saw their chance of winning was high. However, Jin Sahyuk didn't want to kill Morax yet. </p> 
 <p><em>Whooosh—</em></p> 
 <p>Morax punched out, but Shin Jonghak struck back with his spear. That wasn't all. The black light imbued in the spear traveled through Morax's fist and bound his entire body. <br> Light of darkness that burned and purified everything.<br> This black light, which Shin Myungchul acquired by atoning for his sins, was not perfect by any means. However, it boasted an undeniable advantage against one type of opponent.<br> With this power, Shin Jonghak became the perfect natural enemy of demons. After all, the black light had the power to 'purify demonic energy'. </p> 
 <p>"Oi, hold down that guy's body. Don't burn everything." </p> 
 <p>However, Jin Sahyuk didn't want to kill Morax yet. She jumped up lightly.</p> 
 <p>"What? Wait, where are you going, dumbass?"</p> 
 <p>Shin Jonghak shouted, but Jin Sahyuk didn't answer. She slowly flew up and landed on Morax's shoulder. The skin on Morax's shoulder was quite a disgusting mess. Morax knew his large body was both its advantage and disadvantage. To overcome this flaw, he had transformed the surface of his skin into a scorching swamp of demonic energy. </p> 
 <p>Thus, when Jin Sahyuk's shoes touched Morax's shoulder, they melted in an instant. However, Jin Sahyuk's feet were fine. She had already used Reality Manipulation to change the properties of her feet. Although she wouldn't be able to last long, she should be fine for a few minutes.</p> 
 <p>"…Wait for me, Puharen." </p> 
 <p>Jin Sahyuk muttered as she glared at Morax's giant eyes. Then, she drew a deep breath. She looked like a diver preparing to jump, and what she did afterward was exactly that. </p> 
 <p>Jin Sahyuk swam through the demonic energy swamp trying to cuff her in… and jumped into Morax's pupils. <br> Just like what she did to Shin Jonghak, she was entering Morax's deep consciousness. </p> 
 <p>*</p> 
 <p>[Evandel's Cabin]</p> 
 <p>—Crevon's army is supposedly sweeping through all regions of Earth. After setting off from the Steppes of Manchu two days ago, the Crevon Army stretched out to the west and east, defeating the demons' armies. That's not all. In Paris, Grand Magician Oh Jaejin, 9-star Magician Ah Hae-In, and her disciple 'Evandel'….</p> 
 <p>On the other hand, Evandel was watching TV in her cabin. Public broadcast had been cut off with Baal's descent and was only restored today. Many broadcasters were reporting hopeful news all over the world.<br> Evandel calmed herself as she listened to these reports. </p> 
 <p>—Astaroth, the demon of the west, has been defeated by the combined efforts of Grand Magician Oh Jaejin and Grand Magician Ah Hae-In. The east side's Valac has been pushed back by the German government and Crevon's Hwarangs. </p> 
 <p>At first, Evandel was scared of this war. But after watching numerous Heroes fight while risking their lives, she learned something new. Their sacrifice and commitment taught her an important lesson. </p> 
 <p>In this world, many people fought to protect the world. To protect the animals, to protect the land, and to protect people, they stood back up no matter how many times they fell and didn't give up no matter how frightened they were. <br> Even though they should be afraid as well, they were overcoming their fears.</p> 
 <p>So, starting from today, Evandel decided to admire them. Not only that, she swore to follow in their footsteps. The weight behind the word 'Hero' increased in Evandel's heart, and she set a new goal for her future self. </p> 
 <p>—On the other hand, the less belligerent Leraje and Vassago have shown strange signs of protecting the citizens of their land. The World Government and the Hero Association have chosen not to antagonize them. </p> 
 <p><em>Ssk- ssk-</em> At that moment, a strange noise rang out. Evandel tilted her head at the faint sound and looked around the cabin room. </p> 
 <p>—Ah, we just received additional reports. The demon army that invaded Gaeseong has reportedly been annihilated by an unknown creature. Eye-witnesses described the mysterious creature as a black rabbit….</p> 
 <p><em>Ssk- ssk-</em> Evandel strained her ears and listened carefully. It was the sound of words being written. But where was it coming from? Curious, Evandel thought for a moment before suddenly realizing something and turning her head.</p> 
 <p>—Humanity's war against demons seems to be racing toward the victory line, but there is danger remaining. The Nine Evils who serve the devils are still alive and well, and the rank 1 devil, Baal, is currently at the border of the Korean Peninsula….</p> 
 <p><em>Ssk- ssk-</em> Characters were being written on the 'Communication Letter' she treasured. Evandel quickly sprinted to it and picked it up.</p> 
 <p>[Evandel, are you there?]</p> 
 <p>"Aaah!" </p> 
 <p>When she saw these four words, her eyes widened. Evandel swallowed hard and held the letter tightly.</p> 
 <p>[It's me, Hajin. Kim Hajin.] </p> 
 <p>She almost burst into tears the moment she saw the words. No, she teared up. <em>Huaaaang—</em> Evandel held the letter in her embrace while crying. Then, she looked down at the letter once again. </p> 
 <p>[Are you doing well?]</p> 
 <p>"Un! Un! Un!" </p> 
 <p>Evandel shouted before realizing her voice couldn't reach him. She only knew one way to reply to him. </p> 
 <p>She quickly began to jot down a reply. The pencil in her cute hands began to draw adorable characters….</p> 
 <p>*</p> 
 <p>[Un! I'm doing well! What about you, Hajin? Are you okay? I want to see you!] </p> 
 <p>Inside the stronghold Hirano Arashi constructed, I smiled as I read the words being transmitted to me by the Communication Letter. I felt like I could hear Evandel's voice through the text.</p> 
 <p>[I'm doing fine. Soon….]</p> 
 <p>I fell in thought in the middle of writing. <br> Would I be able to safely go back to Evandel's side?</p> 
 <p>"Haa…."</p> 
 <p>I planned to do everything in my power to tie the final knot. Even if I died in the process, I still had one chance to revive. <br> But even if revived….</p> 
 <p>[Everything's almost over, so be a good girl and listen to Master Ah Hae-In, okay?] </p> 
 <p>After hesitating for a while, I changed what I was going to say. Evandel replied immediately in the same cute, child-like tone she always had. </p> 
 <p>"What are you doing, laughing like that?" At that moment, Boss peeked her head up from the bottom of the ladder. I was on the second floor of the stronghold, while she was on the first. <br> After walking up to the second floor, Boss narrowed her eyes and glanced at the letter in my hand. I covered the letter with my hand and replied to Boss. </p> 
 <p>"Getting mentally ready for the war that's about to begin." </p> 
 <p>From the outside, I might look like I was fooling around. But in reality, I was keeping a close eye on Baal through the Thousand-Mile Eyes. Although it would probably be difficult to kill him in one attack, all I could do was sit here and wait for an opportunity. </p> 
 <p>"What about you, Boss? Are you done?" </p> 
 <p>"…Yeah." </p> 
 <p>Boss sat down next to me. Then, she muttered somewhat bitterly.</p> 
 <p>"I retrieved Yi Yeonjun's corpse. I plan on burying him in Pandemonium later."</p> 
 <p>"…Got it." </p> 
 <p>I bitterly smiled back and nodded my head. <br> Yi Yeonjun had done something horrible to Boss. He had destroyed the happy life she could have led. But I couldn't fault him for that in good conscience. <br> After all, I was the one who created Boss, and her past was only materialized around my writing. </p> 
 <p>"…If it weren't for him, I might have led a normal life." </p> 
 <p>Boss muttered as she looked out into the far distance. I wasn't sure if she knew what I was thinking about.<br> I didn't say anything. What she said wasn't true. Boss couldn't have led a normal life.<br> Because I created her. </p> 
 <p>"But…." </p> 
 <p>Boss glanced at my hand. Then, like a crawling caterpillar, her hand slowly moved toward it.</p> 
 <p>"…But… you know…."</p> 
 <p>But because her hand was moving at a speed of 1mm per second, I decided to act first and grabbed her hand. Boss flinched at first but soon smiled gently and said, "I was able to meet you because of it." </p> 
 <p>My heart jumped. I wondered if Boss could also hear the <em>Ba-Thump-</em> sound-effect. I raised my head in a daze and stared at Boss. She was doing the same. </p> 
 <p>"…."</p> 
 <p>"…."</p> 
 <p>I felt a strange sensation welling up inside me. I couldn't tell whether it was sadness, gratitude, or love. <br> I also thought this.<br> Even if her past was created by my settings, the current reality was no longer a part of my novel. So maybe, it didn't matter. <br> Since I couldn't write about what would unfold in the future, and since I couldn't know about it and decide anything, perhaps I had finally been freed from the restraints of this world being a novel. </p> 
 <p>"Boss."</p> 
 <p>I squeezed her hand. <br> Setting all these thoughts aside, what I wanted to do now was clear. <br> I slowly leaned towards her. Boss didn't avoid me. In fact, she seemed to be waiting, as she slowly closed her eyes….</p> 
 <p>"We're all down here~" </p> 
 <p>Jain's voice suddenly cut in. Boss jumped in a fluster and pushed me away. Then, she shot a glance down. </p> 
 <p>"Hm~? What are you two doing up the… Aak!" </p> 
 <p>Boss threw a shadow rock at Jain before approaching me again. She then set the previous mood in a hurry.</p> 
 <p>"…Then, Hajin, what should I do from now on?"</p> 
 <p>Boss asked as she played with my hand. I knew what she was asking for, but I asked anyway. </p> 
 <p>"What do you mean?"</p> 
 <p>Somewhat frustratedly, Boss returned to her usual self and spoke in a dry voice. </p> 
 <p>"I lived to fulfill Yi Yeonjun's wish in his place. Reforming the Chameleon Troupe, killing people and stealing items… they were all for him. But now…." </p> 
 <p>Boss stopped and suddenly closed her eyes. She didn't finish no matter how long I waited. <br> I smiled bitterly and pulled her towards me. Although we didn't kiss, the embrace was even softer. </p> 
 <p>"…It's fine."</p> 
 <p>I pointed at the members of the Chameleon Troupe who were waiting on the first floor. They were 'preparing' what I asked for along with Yoo Yeonha. </p> 
 <p>"You have <em>them</em>. If you don't have a goal, or if you don't have a purpose, you can look for it with your comrades. You <em>must</em>. This time, without killing people. So that you can be happy together…." </p> 
 <p>Although it might not be the best answer, it was the most ideal solution. A text-book answer or a cliche, if you will.</p> 
 <p>But Boss smiled even at my corny line. Looking into my eyes, with a delicate smile.</p> 
 <p>"…."</p> 
 <p>Seeing this smile and feeling my beating heart, I was convinced once again. <br> I wanted this woman to be happy. I wanted her to laugh. I… I loved everything about her….</p> 
 <p>And that's what saddened me more.</p> 
 <p>*</p> 
 <p>With the battle against Baal about to break out in full, the atmosphere was tense. In this frozen-cold silence, a rather light word popped out.</p> 
 <p>"Grandfather." </p> 
 <p>It was Chae Nayun. Everyone, including Baal, turned to face her. Chae Nayun's expression was somewhat sinister. Chae Joochul stood apathetically for a moment as if he didn't know how to react. Then, he made a gentle smile as he had always done.</p> 
 <p>"…Grandfather." </p> 
 <p>But Chae Nayun wasn't smiling. She was glaring at Chae Joochul a bit resentfully.</p> 
 <p>"When this ends, we need to talk." </p> 
 <p>Her tone was laced with thorns. Chae Joochul didn't know why Chae Nayun was angry, but he nodded his head anyway.</p> 
 <p>"Baal."</p> 
 <p>Then, Kim Suho stepped forward.</p> 
 <p>—….</p> 
 <p>Baal looked down at Kim Suho from above and thought about the youth's sudden transcendence and the barrier's effect on him.<br> However, Kim Suho didn't wait for him to finish his thoughts. </p> 
 <p>—!</p> 
 <p>Many Heroes roared out from their hearts. They ran toward Baal without a moment of hesitation. </p> 
 <p>Baal observed their moves with his narrowed, devilish eyes. <br> Heynckes's Steel Spirit cut his skin. Chae Joochul's storm dug into his eyes. Rachel's elementals and Aileen's Spirit Speech combined to form a dragon-like creature that bit down on his neck. Chae Nayun's sword shot to a gigantic size and slashed at his chest. </p> 
 <p>However, Baal didn't react. He knew any attempts to counter-attack would be nullified by Kim Suho's sword. He simply focused on calming his heart to avoid wasting any energy. </p> 
 <p>Even as he bled, Baal continued to think. Perhaps, he was desperate. Baal toiled like a human to find an answer. That in itself was humiliating enough, but thanks to it, he was able to arrive at a reasonable answer soon. </p> 
 <p>The root cause was him cutting off the world's deterrent force. So that he could descend, he had isolated the space inside the barrier from the world's deterrent force. That had also affected Kim Suho, allowing him to transcend. <br> This was only possible because Kim Suho was a Hero with an Authority and because he was the 'main character'. </p> 
 <p>—…. </p> 
 <p>Remaining silent amidst the barrage of attacks, Baal searched for only one person - Kim Hajin. <br> The foolish humans had refused the offer he made, but he was convinced that the world would end if Kim Hajin didn't die. And when that happened, he, Baal, would die as well. </p> 
 <p>—Where are you….</p> 
 <p>Baal couldn't find him. <br> Most likely, he wouldn't be able to find him for all eternity. This was because Kim Hajin was hiding in the barrier's crack. </p> 
 <p>—….Hah? </p> 
 <p>At that moment, Baal let out a short cry. <em>Chwaaaack—</em> He could hear something cutting his heart. A giant sword had invaded Baal's true body. <br> Baal stared at the sword piercing his skin, and the woman holding this sword. </p> 
 <p>"Uhahaha, how is it? Painful, right?" </p> 
 <p>A lowly human, a swordswoman named Chae Nayun, was looking at him with a smile. Baal's mind reeled from rage. </p> 
 <p>—…I admit. I cannot defeat you all. </p> 
 <p>Baal muttered with cold fury. Although this declaration was humiliating, he still had a method left.</p> 
 <p>—But did you forget?</p> 
 <p>If his barrier was setting the stage for Kim Suho, all he had to do was destroy it. Although he wouldn't be able to maintain his true body, Earth still had devils and demons under his rule. <br> Accepting their help wasn't a pleasant thing to do, but Baal knew he wasn't in a position to care about his pride. His subordinates would destroy Earth for him.</p> 
 <p>—I might die, but I am the god of evil who can never be annihilated.</p> 
 <p>Baal glared at Kim Suho's unshaking eyes and declared his intention to destroy the barrier. <br> An author of a novel might describe this move as 'self-destructing'. <br> Even Kim Suho's Authority shouldn't be able to interfere with him trying to detonate the barrier alongside everything within it.<br> Believing this, Baal destroyed his body. </p> 
 <p>…No.<br> He <em>tried</em> to destroy it.</p>
