 <p>I went to a restaurant with Kim Suho.<br>It was time for me to deal with all my personal affairs. There was something I needed to give Kim Suho.</p>
 <p>“By the way, why haven’t you been eating with Chae Nayun lately?”</p>
 <p>Kim Suho sat down as he looked around the restaurant.</p>
 <p><span id="footnote-ref-9ec7"><span>“No reason. I have something to talk about with you.”</span><a href="#footnote-9ec7">[1]</a></span></p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Kim Suho suddenly made a mischievous face.</p>
 <p>“What’s up with that face?”</p>
 <p>“Nothing, I thought you sounded like Chae Nayun. I must be mistaken.”</p>
 <p>“…Screw off.”</p>
 <p>Ignoring his stupid comment, I ordered my food and placed a jar on the table.</p>
 <p>“What’s this?”</p>
 <p>“You forgot already? It’s the jar we got from fighting that snake.”</p>
 <p>This Jar of Greed came with two uses. Although I thought about using both, that would be too greedy. Since I used one to strengthen Aether, it was only proper that Kim Suho uses the second. After all, an amazing greed would inevitably adhere to Misteltein.</p>
 <p>“I remember, but I said you could have it…”</p>
 <p>“I already used it once.”</p>
 <p>I cut off Kim Suho before he could reject my offer.</p>
 <p>“Plus, I’m not saying I’ll give it to you for free. I found another Dungeon, you see.”</p>
 <p>“Another Dungeon? Do you work part-time at an information guild or something?”</p>
 <p>Kim Suho’s eyes widened.<br>I grinned.<br>This Dungeon was impossible for me to clear alone, but if I didn’t clear it, the artifact lying within would eventually fall into the Djinns’ hands.</p>
 <p>“In exchange for you using this jar, let’s clear this Dungeon. We’ll split the loot 7:3.”</p>
 <p>“…You’re 7?”</p>
 <p>“Yep.”</p>
 <p>Kim Suho looked at me silently, then grinned and pulled the jar closer.<br>It was a silent agreement.</p>
 <p>“So how do you use this? Did you get it appraised?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, it’s called the Jar of Greed. You have Misteltein with you, right?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah.”</p>
 <p>“Then you just have to put it inside for 10 days.”</p>
 <p>“…That’s it?”</p>
 <p>“This artifact consolidates whatever’s put inside. I’m sure Misteltein will receive a huge boost in power.”</p>
 <p>Misteltein would undoubtedly show great synergy with any type of greed. Well, as long as it didn’t receive charm-related greed like Aether.<br>Kim Suho looked satisfied. If I remembered correctly, Kim Suho’s affection towards Misteltein should be at an all-time high. He should even be sleeping with it.</p>
 <p>“…Thanks.”</p>
 <p>Kim Suho suddenly put on an apologetic look and spoke softly.</p>
 <p>“You’ve only been helping me recently.”</p>
 <p>“It’s a give and take.”</p>
 <p>“No, even in Busan, it was because of you that…”</p>
 <p>Busan. He must be talking about Jin Sahyuk.<br>I shook my head.</p>
 <p>“No, you would have been fine without me.”</p>
 <p>“…You’re pretty stubborn, you know that?”</p>
 <p>“Like you’re one to speak.”</p>
 <p>“Nu-uh, you’re more stubborn.”</p>
 <p>“No, you are.”</p>
 <p>“No, you are!”</p>
 <p>Kim Suho and I both frowned. Our sudden exchange of praises turned into a staring contest. Soon, we laughed and smiled at each other.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>That night, I went to Seoul through Cube’s Portal.<br>The weather was dull and unpleasant.<br>My chest felt especially heavy today.</p>
 <p>“Hey~”</p>
 <p>When I was about to leave the Portal Station like usual, a familiar face popped out.</p>
 <p>“Kim Hajin~”</p>
 <p>It was Chae Nayun.<br>She linked her arm with mine the moment she appeared.</p>
 <p>“Why are you always late?”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Tonight, I had dinner plans with Chae Nayun.<br>It was the night I would tell her farewell.</p>
 <p>“…Hey.”</p>
 <p>I replied without an ounce of emotion in my voice.<br>Chae Nayun shrunk back slightly but soon smiled brightly.</p>
 <p>“Geez, what’s up with that reaction? Anyways, where are we going today?”</p>
 <p>“I reserved a restaurant near Seocho District.”</p>
 <p>Near my apartment, there was a restaurant Evandel and I frequented.</p>
 <p>“Oh~ really?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, follow me.”</p>
 <p>“…Ah, wait for me.”</p>
 <p>I walked over to a parking lot near the Portal Station.<br>With my one-year VIP membership, my bike was parked in the best spot.<br>Chae Nayun was overjoyed when she saw my bike. I drove much more skillfully than before (thanks to Dexterity) and arrived at the restaurant.</p>
 <p>I was somewhat nervous that the waiter would notice me, but likely because I always wore sunglasses when I came with Evandel, I didn’t receive any strange looks.</p>
 <p>Looking at each other across the table, Chae Nayun asked several questions while we waited for the food to arrive. However, I replied to all of her questions half-heartedly.</p>
 <p>“…Hmph.”</p>
 <p>In the end, Chae Nayun seemed to have gotten tired of it, as she pouted.<br>Even when the food arrived, I didn’t say anything. Chae Nayun snuck glances at me as she quietly ate her food.<br>In complete silence, we finished our dinner.</p>
 <p>“That will be 230,000 won.”</p>
 <p>“Hey, I’ll pay—”</p>
 <p>“No, I’ll do it.”</p>
 <p>I paid for the food before Chae Nayun could and left the restaurant.<br>The sky was fairly dark.<br>I walked underneath this dreary sky, and Chae Nayun followed behind me.</p>
 <p>“Hey.”</p>
 <p>After a few minutes of silent strolling, we arrived at an empty park. Chae Nayun finally opened her mouth. I stopped and turned around. A faint tinge of tears could be seen on the corner of Chae Nayun’s eyes.</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun glared at me and clenched her fists.</p>
 <p>“Are you tormenting me on purpose?”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>I didn’t reply to her.<br>Chae Nayun’s angry voice continued.</p>
 <p>“Or are you just ignoring me, fully aware of my feelings?”</p>
 <p>Hearing her teary voice, I closed my eyes. In my head, I once again repeated my resolve.</p>
 <p>“Or are you really unaware?”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>The only way I could remain in her mind as a good memory. That was to be a ‘bad’ person rather than ‘someone to kill’.</p>
 <p>“Sorry.”</p>
 <p>I had to end our relationship before it progressed any further.</p>
 <p>“…About what?”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun asked with a trembling voice.</p>
 <p>“What are you sorry about?”</p>
 <p>Looking into her eyes, I spoke resolutely.</p>
 <p>“I’m dropping out.”</p>
 <p>“…!”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun’s shocked breath flowed through the wind.</p>
 <p>“W-Why?”</p>
 <p>“I’m going to become a mercenary. I already got a good offer.”</p>
 <p>“…Yeah, but why?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t want to tell you that.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun’s eyebrows twitched.</p>
 <p>“…Then when are you dropping out?”</p>
 <p>“Next week at the earliest.”</p>
 <p>Next week.<br>Hearing these two words, Chae Nayun laughed despondently.</p>
 <p>“And when did you decide?”</p>
 <p>“Before I became a second-year.”</p>
 <p>Hearing that, Chae Nayun clenched her teeth and forcefully curled up the corner of her lips.</p>
 <p>“So you decided that long ago? Without telling me anything?”</p>
 <p>“Why would I?”</p>
 <p>“Ah… r-right, right, right…”</p>
 <p>Unable to speak properly, Chae Nayun dropped her head down and smacked herself with her hand. Her hair, which had grown fairly long, shook and covered her face.<br>After a brief moment of silence…</p>
 <p>“Fine, I get it.”</p>
 <p>She raised her hand and wiped away the tears flowing down from her face.</p>
 <p>“You do whatever you want. It’s your business anyways. It has nothing to do with… dammit.”</p>
 <p>After cursing silently, she turned around.<br><em>Tak, tak.</em><br>Only the sound of her lonely footsteps rang out in the empty park.</p>
 <p>“…Yeah.”</p>
 <p>I also turned around.<br>Breathing out in bitterness, I began to walk away from her.<br>However.<br><em>Beeeep— Beeep—</em><br>My smartwatch suddenly began to buzz crazily.<br>It wasn’t just mine.<br>Chae Nayun’s watch and even the watches of people far away from us began to ring loudly.<br>It was an emergency evacuation alarm.</p>
 <p>“Eh?”</p>
 <p>Puzzled, I turned on my smartwatch.<br>There was a breaking news that Creator’s Sacred Grace had failed their Tower campaign.<br>Since I knew it would happen, I didn’t think much of it.</p>
 <p>“…Hey! Kim Hajin!”</p>
 <p>However, Chae Nayun suddenly ran into me. Before I could even react, she embraced me and covered me with her body. It was as though she was trying to protect me from something.<br>In the next moment…</p>
 <p><em>KOONG—!</em></p>
 <p>A giant explosion swept over us.<br>I didn’t even have time to be confused.<br>After a quick flash of light, a huge shockwave pressed down on my body.<br>Then, my consciousness faded away.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>Yoo Yeonha was currently in her dorm room, which was smaller than last year’s thanks to her rank dropping.</p>
 <p>“Hmm….”</p>
 <p>Seeing the report that arrived, Yoo Yeonha sighed.</p>
 <p>[We looked into every known criminal in the world, but no one had such a tattoo.]<br>[Our newest member, Kim Hosup, helped a lot in this investigation.]</p>
 <p>The complete investigation only took 3 weeks to finish. As Yoo Yeonha expected it to take at least three months, she was genuinely surprised.</p>
 <p>“The new recruit we hired last time must be quite useful.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha wrote back a positive reply talking about a bonus for the new recruit’s hard work. Then, she went back to looking at the tattoo.<br>A common-looking tattoo that wasn’t so common. Although the deep color of the tattoo made it look odd, it also made it look all the more natural.</p>
 <p>“Where did a tattoo like this come from…?”</p>
 <p>While Yoo Yeonha was murmuring with curiosity, another message arrived.<br>This time, it was much more shocking than the previous news.</p>
 <p>[Master, Creator’s Sacred Grace has failed its Tower of Miracle campaign.]</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p><em>Beeep— Beeep—</em><br>At the same time, her smartwatch spat out a loud alarm.</p>
 <p>“Kyak!”</p>
 <p>Startled by the emergency evacuation alarm, Yoo Yeonha jumped out of her seat.</p>
 <p>“W-What is it!?”</p>
 <p>However, she soon calmed down and replied to the message she received.</p>
 <p>[Are you positive?]</p>
 <p>[Yes. The failure of Creator’s Sacred Grace caused the Tower of Miracle’s magic power to leave the Tower, creating magic power explosions around the area.]</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha made a strange face at this revelation.<br>The failure to conquer a Tower often caused its magic power to clash with the outside world’s magic power, causing huge explosions.<br>This meant one of two possibilities.<br>Either the nature of the Tower was like that, or the guild that failed to conquer it had been careless.</p>
 <p>The Tower of Miracle was located in Umyeon Mountain in Gangnam. If explosions were caused by the conquering guild’s carelessness…</p>
 <p>“Hm.”</p>
 <p>That would be the end of Creator’s Sacred Grace.<br>The corners of Yoo Yeonha’s mouth curled up subconsciously. However, now wasn’t the time to celebrate.<br>Yoo Yeonha quickly put on a serious face and contacted Essence of the Strait.</p>
 <p>“Immediately deploy guild members to regions around the Tower of Miracle. Yes, as many as possible! Our foremost goal is the protection and rescue of civilians.”</p>
 <p>The downfall of a competitor was an opportunity for growth.<br>Yoo Yeonha planned to make use of this situation to its fullest.</p>
 <p>“Whew….”</p>
 <p>After spending about 10 minutes buried in her comfortable chair…<br>Tiriri—<br>Her smartwatch rang once again.<br>She picked up the call without much thought.</p>
 <p>“…Yes, hello?”</p>
 <p>However, the content of the call was something she couldn’t take lightly.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>Yoo Yeonha quickly ran to the Gangnam Severance Hospital, where Chae Nayun and Kim Hajin were hospitalized.<br>Perhaps because of the slow flow of information, Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak were yet to be seen. However, the hospital was still in a state of chaos. Patients were brought in by the minute, and most were severely injured.</p>
 <p>“Yoo Yeonha-ssi, over here.”</p>
 <p>The hospital’s chief resident quickly came to greet her.</p>
 <p>“Um, where are the two patients you talked about?”</p>
 <p>“Ah, neither are seriously injured, so you don’t have to worry too much. They’re currently staying in VIP rooms.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha breathed a sigh of relief. At the same time, she couldn’t help but wonder, why did these things always happen to them?</p>
 <p>“What about other civilians?”</p>
 <p>“We’ve yet to grasp the complete damage, but with Gangnam being such a rich district, several mana barriers helped reduce the impact of the explosions. The damages should be within acceptable levels.”</p>
 <p>“Ah… then can you take me to my friends’ room?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, follow me.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha followed her contact. She first visited Chae Nayun.</p>
 <p>“It’s here.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you.”</p>
 <p>[VIP – Chae Nayun]<br>The nameplate showed that only one person was inside the room.<br>Yoo Yeonha opened the door and walked in.</p>
 <p>“Eh?”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun was still unconscious. What surprised Yoo Yeonha was that her hair was much shorter than it was earlier in the day.</p>
 <p>“Her hair is… practically a short-cut.”</p>
 <p>“Her hair was burnt protecting the other person, so we had no choice but to cut it.”</p>
 <p>“Ah…”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha immediately knew that Chae Nayun protected Kim Hajin.</p>
 <p>“You know, he would have been fine if you didn’t protect him.”</p>
 <p>“Hm?”</p>
 <p>When Yoo Yeonha murmured, Chae Nayun slowly opened her eyes.<br>Startled, Yoo Yeonha quickly walked up to her.</p>
 <p>“Nayun!”</p>
 <p>“…Eh?”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun muttered blankly after seeing the hospital ceiling. Then, she suddenly shot up. Her hands were trembling uncontrollably, and her eyes were filled with terror.</p>
 <p>“Nayun, everything’s okay.”</p>
 <p>“W-What, what just, uu, uaaah….”</p>
 <p>Despite Yoo Yeonha’s warm words, Chae Nayun’s eyes were already tearing up. Seeing her struggling to get up with unspeakable terror, Yoo Yeonha couldn’t help but feel pity.</p>
 <p>“Nayun, calm down for now.”</p>
 <p>“Ah, uu, Hajin, what happened to, Hajin….”</p>
 <p>“Patient Kim Hajin is fine. He’s sleeping next door. He’s in a much better condition than you.”</p>
 <p>“…Really?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, really.”</p>
 <p>Only then did Chae Nayun’s trembling stop. But immediately afterwards, she began to hyperventilate. Then, she fainted.<br>Yoo Yeonha shouted in shock.</p>
 <p>“Ah! Is she okay!?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, like I said, she has no physical injury. But she keeps showing signs of a panic attack. This is already the third time.”</p>
 <p>“…Third time?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, I believe she’s suffering from a form of PTSD.”</p>
 <p>“T-That’s….”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha quietly placed her hand on Chae Nayun’s forehead. It was burning hot.</p>
 <p>“Oh right, what about the other patient?”</p>
 <p>“Patient Kim Hajin is next door.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha left Chae Nayun’s room and went next door.<br>Kim Hajin was sleeping on the hospital bed.<br>Just like what the doctor said, he didn’t seem to have any noticeable injury.</p>
 <p>“…He suffered light burns to his legs and arms, but he’s completely fine otherwise.”</p>
 <p>“That’s great to hear.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha stared at Kim Hajin, who was sleeping in a patient gown.<br>He looked relaxed and at peace.<br>It was almost as though he had fallen asleep, rather than fainting.<br>Looking at him sleeping like a child, Yoo Yeonha smiled. She also got the urge to poke his puffed cheeks.<br>…But at that moment, through pure coincidence, something caught her attention.</p>
 <p>“Hm?”</p>
 <p>Below his right sleeve, a black line was peeking out of his upper arm.<br>It was a strangely familiar and ominous figure.<br>Suddenly, an image in Yoo Yeonha’s head overlapped with the line in front of her.</p>
 <p>“…What’s… this…?”</p>
 <p>Murmuring softly, Yoo Yeonha reached out.<br>But when her fingers were about to touch his sleeve, her instincts roared.<br>To stop, to step back, to not go forward any further.</p>
 <p>“This….”</p>
 <p>However, her hand still moved and pulled up Kim Hajin’s sleeve. Regret only came later.<br>Half of the tattoo was still covered by his sleeve.<br>However, Yoo Yeonha didn’t need to see the full thing.<br>Half of a cross and half of a crescent moon.<br>It was exactly like the picture of the tattoo she saw.</p>
 <p>“E…Eh?”</p>
 <p>Murmuring quietly, she let go, and the sleeve fell back down, covering his arm.</p>
 <p>“T-This….”</p>
 <p>Almost as though she lost her speech, she couldn’t find the words to speak.<br>She couldn’t think.<br>She only knew that her head hurt.<br>Her train of thought seemed to be cutting off, like it was attempting to protect her from stress she couldn’t handle.<br>Her brain seemed to have stopped functioning.<br>As a result, the only thing she could do was breathe.</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha raised her hands in a daze and clenched her head, which seemed to be burning up. Her hair tangled up from cold sweat. But rather than these trivial things…</p>
 <p>“Ah…”</p>
 <p>It hurt.</p>
 <p>“Auuk….”</p>
 <p>Her head hurt, like it was about to explode.<br>That was all she felt.<br><br></p>
