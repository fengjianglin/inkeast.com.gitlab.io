 <p>[Baal’s Castle]</p>
 <p>Kim Suho continued to climb a seemingly endless spiral staircase. As he grew closer to the sky, he continuously mulled over what Jin Sahyuk said two hours ago.</p>
 <p>‘Kim Hajin has complicated feelings for me, so much so that it’s troubling even for me.’<br>‘If you knew how Kim Hajin feels, you would all be shocked speechless….’</p>
 <p>Unable to understand what she meant, Kim Suho called Shin Jonghak.</p>
 <p>“Shin Jonghak, do you know anything about it?”</p>
 <p>“About what?”</p>
 <p>“About what Jin Sahyuk said.”</p>
 <p>Shin Jonghak shook his head.</p>
 <p>“No clue. I only followed her here…. But I’ve seen that woman stare at Kim Hajin with a warm look.”</p>
 <p>“What? Really?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry about it, Suho. I’m sure she’s lying. Why would Fenrir like that crazy woman anyways?”</p>
 <p>Aileen cut in.<br>To be honest, Kim Suho thought the same way. But he knew Jin Sahyuk wasn’t the type to make such jokes. She considered herself as royalty, and joking was something that didn’t suit their dignity.</p>
 <p>“Rather than that, I’m curious when we’ll reach the end of this staircase.”</p>
 <p>Aileen crossed her arms unhappily. Just as she said, the group had been climbing the staircase for almost three hours, but they had yet to catch a glimpse of anything resembling a pathway.</p>
 <p>“…Oi! Black haired girl!”</p>
 <p>Aileen called Jin Sahyuk, who was climbing ahead of them. Jin Sahyuk stopped and looked back at Aileen.</p>
 <p>“Are you sure we’re going the right way?”</p>
 <p>“…Who knows?”</p>
 <p>Jin Sahyuk shrugged irresponsibly.</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>Aileen scowled, to which Jin Sahyuk smirked.</p>
 <p>“What other choice do we have? It’s not like we can shout for Baal to come out. Let’s just keep going, and in the meanwhile, I’ll send a Mental Transmission to Black Lotus.”</p>
 <p>“…Mental Transmission? To Black Lotus?”</p>
 <p>“Yep.”</p>
 <p>Jin Sahyuk nodded and sent a Mental Transmission to Kim Hajin. Her way of sending Mental Transmissions was rather unique, as she used ‘Reality Manipulation’ to do so.</p>
 <p>—I’m in Baal’s castle with Kim Suho. You stay outside. Don’t enter the castle. If you want to save the world, then do as I say.</p>
 <p>Kim Hajin replied about three minutes afterward.</p>
 <p>—…Why?</p>
 <p>It was a short, blunt question. Jin Sahyuk laughed inwardly at this cute reaction. Behind her, Aileen’s loud voice rang out.</p>
 <p>“Cmon-! How long do we have to keep—”</p>
 <p>“Oh, there it is.”</p>
 <p>Jin Sahyuk interrupted Aileen and pointed to a spot on the spiral staircase. Shin Jonghak, Kim Suho, and Aileen all turned their gazes to the spot Jin Sahyuk was pointing to.</p>
 <p>“…Huh? You’re right. It really is there. But there wasn’t anything just a moment ago.”</p>
 <p>Aileen’s eyes widened. Just like she said, a huge gate had suddenly appeared at a previously empty spot.</p>
 <p>“…I’ll go in first.”</p>
 <p>Shin Jonghak stepped forward as soon as he saw the gate. He hopped up the staircase, three steps at a time until he reached the gate. Seeing how Shin Jonghak was practically running, Jin Sahyuk smiled.</p>
 <p>Soon, all four members of the group reached the gate. Standing in front of the ogre-sized gate, Shin Jonghak stared at Jin Sahyuk, and Jin Sahyuk nodded her head. Shin Jonghak then grabbed the knob on the right side while Kim Suho grabbed the knob on the left. Together, they pushed it forward.</p>
 <p><em>Kiik—</em></p>
 <p>The giant gate opened with a course sound. Immediately, a brilliant light shone from the other side, and classical music began to play. The four of them blinked their eyes at the dazzling light, and in the next instant, their thought processes stopped.<br>A scene they hadn’t expected to see was spread out before them.</p>
 <p>“…Where is this?”</p>
 <p>Aileen muttered quietly and rolled her eyes to study the area. To describe it simply, they were at the scene of a ‘banquet’. A fancy chandelier cast light in all directions, and a sumptuous feast was prepared inside. They could also see well-dressed men and women dancing to the tune of classical music.<br>No matter how they looked at it, they were in a banquet hall.</p>
 <p>“…There he is.”</p>
 <p>While the others stood confused, Jin Sahyuk spotted a certain person from the crowd and smiled.<br>Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak also followed Jin Sahyuk’s gaze, while Aileen’s attention was caught by a waiter holding a plate of fancy chocolates.</p>
 <p>“That’s Yi Yeonjun, the previous boss of the Chameleon Troupe.”</p>
 <p>The moment Jin Sahyuk mentioned this…</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>Aileen’s eyes shot open, and her attention turned to Yi Yeonjun.</p>
 <p>“That bastard… he’s really alive?”</p>
 <p>Aileen also had an ill-fated relationship with Yi Yeonjun. Currently, he was sitting on a chair at a balcony on the upper floor of the banquet hall, looking down at the crowd below.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>[Demon Realm Gate – Baal’s Barrier]</p>
 <p>I stood in front of Baal’s castle. Jain and Shimurin were standing next to me. Although I used up most of my bullets, I eliminated all the demonic beasts running amok inside the barrier. Soon, Rachel, Yun Seung-Ah, and the other Heroes should arrive here as well.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go in.”</p>
 <p>Just as I was about to enter Baal’s castle…</p>
 <p>—I’m in Baal’s castle with Kim Suho. You stay outside. Don’t enter the castle. If you want to save the world, then do as I say.</p>
 <p>Jin Sahyuk’s Mental Transmission flowed into my ears. I paused immediately.</p>
 <p>“…Hm? What’s up~?”</p>
 <p>Jain tilted her head curiously.</p>
 <p>“Uh… hold on, I just got a strange message.”</p>
 <p>I messaged back.</p>
 <p>—Why?</p>
 <p>But she didn’t return an answer. After waiting for a few minutes, I contemplated ignoring her warning and going inside. I gave it more thought and concluded that the changed Jin Sahyuk wouldn’t lie to me.</p>
 <p>“Let’s wait a bit more.”</p>
 <p>I spread Aether out like a mat and took a seat on the ground. Jain and Shimurin also sat down next to me. Jain yawned, and Shimurin took out a scroll as soon as she sat down.</p>
 <p>“Is that the dimension scroll?”</p>
 <p>I looked at her scroll with keen interest. Shimurin nodded her head with a grin.</p>
 <p>“This scroll will summon a portal connecting two dimensions together. It’s still incomplete and unsafe. The portal isn’t big enough either. There’s still a lot I have to fix… Why? Do you want to give it a go?”</p>
 <p>“…”</p>
 <p>I stared at the scroll fixedly. Then, a brilliant idea flashed across my mind.</p>
 <p>“Let me test something.”</p>
 <p>I took out two A4-sized pieces of paper. Shimurin tilted her head and asked.</p>
 <p>“What’s that?”</p>
 <p>“They’re just pieces of paper for now….”</p>
 <p>I activated Setting Intervention, adding [Linkage], [Recording], and [Durability] to their setting. I also changed the name of the papers to ‘Messenger’.</p>
 <p>[You used 103SP to change the setting of a set of objects.]<br>[Luck activates.]<br>[Item, ‘Messenger’, increases in rank.]<br>[Item, ‘Messenger’, has been strengthened in functionality.]</p>
 <p>“Now it’s a messenger.”</p>
 <p>“A what?”</p>
 <p>Shimurin’s eyebrows went up, and Jain turned her gaze to us with interest.</p>
 <p>“A messenger. If you write something on one paper, the same thing will be written on the other.”</p>
 <p>I demonstrated the Messenger’s function. Shimurin nodded her head.</p>
 <p>“So that’s what it is. You want to send this to your world?”</p>
 <p>“Exactly.”</p>
 <p>“…Hm.”</p>
 <p>Shimurin rubbed her chin and fell in thought. After about 30 seconds, she continued.</p>
 <p>“It’s likely that the paper will burn while crossing over to your world.”</p>
 <p>“It’s fine. This paper has good durability.”</p>
 <p>At the very least, it should withstand being burnt. I added [Durability] to its setting, not to mention the added bonus from luck.</p>
 <p>“You’re that confident? This scroll might look tiny, but it’s expensive enough to be a national treasure you know?”</p>
 <p>“Just do it. Who cares about money when the world is at risk?”</p>
 <p>“…Well, that’s true.”</p>
 <p>Shimurin let out a dry cough and tore the scroll in half. The grand magician’s magic power flowed into the scroll, and a small, fist-sized portal appeared in the air.</p>
 <p>“Alright, Kim Hajin, it’s your turn now.”</p>
 <p>“Got it.”</p>
 <p>I sent Stigma’s magic power into the portal and set the coordinate to Evandel’s cabin.</p>
 <p>“Done. I’m going to give it a go then.”</p>
 <p>I wrote a message on the paper, folded it into a paper airplane, and sent it flying inside the portal. With my Master Sharpshooter Gift, the paper airplane practically flew like a real one.</p>
 <p>“Wow~ how cool~ so we just have to wait now~?”</p>
 <p>Jain muttered, but Shimurin and I only stared at the remaining paper.</p>
 <p>…It was then.</p>
 <p>—We just found Yi Yeonjun in what seems to be the first stage, a ‘banquet hall’. You wait outside and destroy Baal’s castle with an arrow when I give the signal. I know you can do it.</p>
 <p>Jin Sahyuk returned a belated reply.</p>
 <p>“What is she talking about?”</p>
 <p>I spat out a complaint out loud. When Shimurin and Jain gave me a curious look, I returned a reply.</p>
 <p>—Are you crazy? How am I supposed to destroy Baal’s castle?</p>
 <p>—You can do it.</p>
 <p>—No way.</p>
 <p>It was impossible, especially when even Baal’s barrier could only be partially destroyed with the help of the ‘Mystic Key’.</p>
 <p>…Wait. Mystic Key?</p>
 <p>—You should be able to do it. So when I give the signal, shoot immediately and destroy the castle.</p>
 <p>Ignoring my worries, Jin Sahyuk gave a firm command.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>[Earth – ♡Evandel and Hayang’s Cabin♡]</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Ah Hae-In and Evandel returned to Evandel’s ‘domain’.</p>
 <p>“TV, TV~”</p>
 <p>Evandel hummed happily as she turned on the TV inside the cabin.</p>
 <p>—Valac’s army retreated from Europe.</p>
 <p>A timely report of the day’s news came out.</p>
 <p>—Duchess Ah Hae-In and her disciple led humanity to their first victory.</p>
 <p>Ah Hae-In and Evandel had successfully stopped Valac’s army from advancing into Europe. Evandel and her unicorn commanded 5000 spirit beasts as though they shared one mind, while Ah Hae-In fully utilized the power of the Cardinal Guardians to force Valac to retreat.</p>
 <p>—The streets of Europe are filled with people cheering the two magicians’ achievements….</p>
 <p>“Oooh, look Hayang, we did good~”</p>
 <p>Evandel watched the news with sparkling eyes. Seeing her achievements broadcasted across the world, she was both excited and proud.</p>
 <p>—We captured footage of a black wolf defeating Valac’s adjutant. Let’s take a look.</p>
 <p>“…Fenrir, Fenrir, come over here! They’re praising you on TV!”</p>
 <p>Evandel hugged Fenrir excitedly. Fenrir maintained his indifferent act while stealthily gazing at himself appearing on TV.<br><em>Kwaaaaaa—!</em><br>A house-sized wolf was storming forward and crushing several demons.</p>
 <p>“So cool!”</p>
 <p>—Krrr.</p>
 <p>Fenrir shrugged hearing Evandel’s cheer.</p>
 <p>“…Haha.”</p>
 <p>Ah Hae-In chuckled and left Evandel to enjoy her time with her spirit beasts. Then, she turned on her smartwatch, which she kept off during the war.<br>She was immediately stormed with messages from the Association.</p>
 <p>[Demon Realm Gate – Kim Suho, Aileen, Yun Seung-Ah, Shin Jonghak, Rachel, Yoo Yeonha, and others]<br>[Valac – Ah Hae-In]<br>[Leraje – Game to be released next Monday]<br>[Astaroth – Leore, Kim Hwaoong, Yi Heejoon, and 13 other 8-star magicians]<br>[Vassago’s Colosseum – Jin Seyeon, Vast Expanse, and others]</p>
 <p>She received a report containing the activities of various Heroes. Ah Hae-In found the name ‘Rachel’ on the list and looked back at Evandel.<br>Evandel was clapping her hands like a seal and watching the news with widened eyes.</p>
 <p>“…Cute.”</p>
 <p>A faint smile emerged on Ah Hae-In’s face. She became worried when both Kim Hajin and Rachel left, but it seemed that her worry was unnecessary.<br><em>Tiriring—!</em><br>As she was watching Evandel play with her friends, she received another message.</p>
 <p>[Duchess Ah Hae-In, when will you introduce your disciple to the world? Everyone is curious. Earth needs an icon of hope.]</p>
 <p>It was from the Association yet again. In truth, the Hero Association already knew who Ah Hae-In’s disciple was, that it was a young girl of the name ‘Evandel’.<br>That was why they kept pestering her. A ten-year-old genius magician who could wield an army of spirit beasts. Evandel was truly the perfect candidate for an ‘icon of hope’.</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Ah Hae-In ignored the message and turned her smartwatch off. At that moment, a paper airplane flew inside the cabin from the window.</p>
 <p>“What’s this…?”</p>
 <p>Ah Hae-In frowned and grabbed the airplane. When she touched it, her face immediately stiffened. She could feel a trace of magic power from the paper material.<br>She quickly opened the airplane and checked the contents.</p>
 <p>[Evandel, are you doing well? It’s me, Hajin. If you have something you want to say to me, all you have to do is write something on this piece of paper. I can reply to you on the same paper. I want to see you.]</p>
 <p>“…!”</p>
 <p>It was, without doubt, a message from Kim Hajin.</p>
