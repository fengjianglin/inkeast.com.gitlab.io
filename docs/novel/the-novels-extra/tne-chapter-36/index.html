 <p>Yoo Yeonha opened her eyes. A patternless white ceiling filled her sight, and the sound of something being cut tickled her ears. She turned towards the direction of the sound.<br>Kim Suho was cutting an apple with a fruit knife.</p>
 <p>“…What are you doing here?”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha asked dumbfoundedly. Kim Suho glanced at Yoo Yeonha before smiling bashfully.</p>
 <p>“You’re awake? It doesn’t hurt anywhere, right?”</p>
 <p>“…I’m fine.”</p>
 <p>“The doctor said there’s nothing wrong with your body.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha raised her upper body. She felt slightly stiff and sore, but it wasn’t to the point she couldn’t move.</p>
 <p>“What I want to know is why you’re here.”</p>
 <p>“We’re taking turns nursing you. Me, Nayun, Shin Jonghak, and Kim Horak.”</p>
 <p>“Why?”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha asked genuinely curious.</p>
 <p>“Well, it’s kind of our fault…”</p>
 <p>“…Huh?”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha fell in thought because of Kim Suho’s incomprehensible words. How was it their fault?<br>But even after contemplating about what happened, she couldn’t come up with an answer.<br>‘Did they do something I didn't know?’ Yoo Yeonha glared at Kim Suho, demanding an explanation.</p>
 <p>“As members of the same team, we should have been more careful. We were too absorbed in caring for Nayun that we were too negligent…”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha became lost for words. Her brain seemed to freeze at the sheer stupidity of Kim Suho’s statement.<br>It wasn’t like they could have known she would get attacked. Not to mention, the investigation team had only met twice, and there was even a huge argument in the second meeting.</p>
 <p>“…Sorry.”</p>
 <p>“Pfft.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha chuckled at Kim Suho’s bashful apology. If anything, she realized just how stupidly kind this man was.</p>
 <p>“You don’t need to be sorry. I got what I deserved.”</p>
 <p>Kim Suho scratched his neck and gave Yoo Yeonha a plate of sliced apples, which were shaped like rabbits. Yoo Yeonha smiled subconsciously. Being a girl, Yoo Yeonha liked cute things.</p>
 <p>“They look nice.”</p>
 <p>“Thanks.”</p>
 <p>Kim Suho laughed innocently. His handsome face seemed to shine. Yoo Yeonha stared at his face in a daze before suddenly remembering something and asking.</p>
 <p>“…Oh right, um, did that person come?”</p>
 <p>“That person?”</p>
 <p>Kim Hajin.<br>Yoo Yeonha couldn’t say his name out loud. She had a conscience. She didn't expect him to visit her after what she had done.</p>
 <p>“No, nevermind.”</p>
 <p>She looked outside the window. There wasn’t a single cluster of clouds on the East Sea’s clear and blue sky. The world seemed particularly bright under the beaming sunlight.</p>
 <p>Seeing this dazzling scenery, Yoo Yeonha fell in thought.<br>She learned many things today.<br>Of course, her 17-year-old personality wouldn’t entirely change with just this one incident. Tomorrow’s Yoo Yeonha might not be too different than today’s.<br>But there were certainly many things she felt from the bottom of her heart. She wasn’t sure whether it was self-reflection, introspection, or plain gratefulness.<br>Before she wrote everything down on her diary and pondered over it, she first picked up her smartwatch.<br>There was still something she needed to do.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>I received a message.</p>
 <p>[Thank you. I’ll repay today’s debts for sure.]</p>
 <p>The sender was Yoo Yeonha. Seeing her name, the corners of my mouth curled up to a smile.<br>I wanted to say something cool, but the person sitting in front of me asked for another affirmation.</p>
 <p>“Um… So I can just take this money? Really?”</p>
 <p>I stared back at the man. Park Soohyuk has been like this for a while. I lost count how many times he asked if this was real.<br>Haa. I couldn’t help but sigh.<br>It was my money I was investing, so why was he so hesitant? Just buy an HUV (hunter utility vehicle) and a proper magic pouch already!</p>
 <p>“Yes, yes, yes. Please take it! Please!”</p>
 <p>I stood up and bowed down at a 90-degree angle.</p>
 <p>“Please take it!”</p>
 <p>“Ah, um, I—”</p>
 <p>“What, do I need to kowtow? I’ll do it!”</p>
 <p>“No, no! I’ll take it! Thank you so much for investing in SH Agency!”</p>
 <p>He finally put the signed documents in his suitcase.<br>How did such an easygoing person end up becoming the agent world’s greatest giant? I was the owner who created this setting, but I just couldn’t understand it.<br>After staring at him for a moment, I asked casually.</p>
 <p>“By the way, how old are you?”</p>
 <p>“I’m 29.”</p>
 <p>“Ah, you’re more than a decade older than me. You don’t have to talk so formally.”</p>
 <p>Talking casually would be better for our relationship.</p>
 <p>“How can I do such a thing to an investor…”</p>
 <p>“Don’t think of me as an investor, think of me as a business partner. You know, like we’re building SH Agency together.”</p>
 <p>“But still…”</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, I’m fine with it.”</p>
 <p>“But…”</p>
 <p>A back and forth argument went around on the topic of talking formally or casually. Eventually, I defeated Park Soohyuk and he submitted.</p>
 <p>“Okay… I won’t talk so formally then.”</p>
 <p>“Good.”</p>
 <p>I got up.</p>
 <p>“Then let’s go hunt. We’ll stop at just two for today.”</p>
 <p><span id="footnote-ref-c856"><span>“Alright, then this hyung</span><a href="#footnote-c856">[1]</a><span>&nbsp;will support you from the back.”</span></span></p>
 <p>Park Soohyuk laughed bashfully.<br>We left the coffee shop. Right when we were about to head to the Field, I saw a convenience store.</p>
 <p>“Um, Soohyuk hyung?”</p>
 <p>I was the one who suggested talking casually, but I felt shy now that I needed to do it.</p>
 <p>“Hm? What’s up?”</p>
 <p>“We should buy a lottery ticket.”</p>
 <p>I pointed at the poster that said [lottery ticket on sale]. In truth, this was the first method I thought up to make money since I had an absurd level of luck. But because of my status as a ‘minor without a guardian’, I haven’t been able to do it until now.</p>
 <p>“Come on, lottery tickets are a waste of money. You might be too young to understand these things, but the lottery is a scam.”</p>
 <p>“It’s not a scam. I have good luck, so I’ll probably win something. I’ll invest what I get on SH Agency, so give it a try.”</p>
 <p>“No, I’m telling you it’s a scam…”</p>
 <p>“Just follow me.”</p>
 <p>I dragged Park Soohyuk to the convenience store. I grabbed ten instant lottery tickets on the counter, and with Park Soohyuk’s clearly aged face, the clerk didn’t even ask for his identification. After buying the ten tickets, I brought them over to a nearby table.</p>
 <p>“I need something to scratch them with.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, here’s a coin.”</p>
 <p>Even though he just said lottery tickets were a scam, he gave me a coin with anticipating eyes.</p>
 <p>“I’ll start then.”</p>
 <p>Shashak. I started scratching on the silver foils on the ticket. The first one was a fail. I immediately moved on to the second. Another fail. I scratched the third ticket. Another fail.</p>
 <p>“Haam.”</p>
 <p>Park Soohyuk had already lost interest and yawned. Unperturbed, I continued scratching. Fourth, fifth, sixth…<br>While Park Soohyuk walked around the cup ramen aisle, I scratched the tenth lottery ticket.</p>
 <p>“Oh, finally.”</p>
 <p>“You won? How much?”</p>
 <p>Park Soohyuk asked casually after picking up a cup ramen.</p>
 <p>“20 million won.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, nice.”</p>
 <p>Park Soohyuk then started walking towards the counter before suddenly stopping and tilting his head. ‘Did I hear that wrong…?’ murmuring so, he turned towards me.</p>
 <p>“…Can you repeat that?”</p>
 <p>“20 million won. Looks like getting the first place jackpot is asking for too much.”</p>
 <p>First place was 100 million won.<br>I showed Park Soohyuk the lottery ticket. His jaws instantly dropped.</p>
 <p>“W-What, is, is this real?”</p>
 <p>“It’s real, so take it.”</p>
 <p>I handed him the ticket.</p>
 <p>“W-Why are you giving this to me?”</p>
 <p>“Oh, didn’t I tell you? I’m still a minor, so I can’t claim the money. You can take it. It’s an additional investment, so send me a modified contract.”</p>
 <p>Park Soohyuk stared at me in a daze. His gaping mouth didn’t think to close. The cup ramen he was holding could probably fit in his mouth. It sure was big.</p>
 <p>“Take it.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, yeah.”</p>
 <p>Park Soohyuk quickly put the lottery ticket in his pocket. Next, he quickly looked around himself and began to sweat as though he had just committed a crime.</p>
 <p>“You can put down your guard. No one is going to steal it. “</p>
 <p>“No, you don’t understand how scary the world can be…”<br><br></p>
 <p>**<br><br></p>
 <p>Moonlight shone through a broken window, but it only lit up dusty ruins and absolute silence. Vines and moss were the only living things in this desolate place abandoned by humans.</p>
 <p>A factory in Suwon abandoned after Outcall, this was Chameleon Troupe’s temporary hiding place.</p>
 <p>—Boss.</p>
 <p>A voice rang out in the empty space. The call awoke an existence sleeping in the darkness.</p>
 <p>—You’re awake?</p>
 <p>The existence slowly opened its eyes. The revealed pupils glistened like jewels yet carried a threatening aura.</p>
 <p>—Those bastards started moving. The Packhorse Master. They just listed themselves on the stock market.</p>
 <p>The ownerless voice notified the existence of this information.<br>The existence replied briefly. Not even a hint of emotion could be felt in the dull voice.</p>
 <p>“Understood.”</p>
 <p>—What should we do next?</p>
 <p>The existence put off answering the question and slowly raised its body. Meanwhile, a full moon revealed itself from behind the clouds. A brighter moonlight infiltrated the window and lit up the existence’s body. The enshrouding darkness instantly melted down.</p>
 <p>—That aside, Boss is beautiful as always.</p>
 <p>Long black hair seemingly weaved out of shadows, full pink lips, and a smooth white skin adorning a graceful figure… A woman, who seemed to be the manifestation of modern beauty, spoke without the slightest change in her expression.</p>
 <p>“Do you have a death wish?”</p>
 <p>A dark blue magic power crackled from her hands.</p>
 <p>—I’m kidding, but it’s not like I can say Boss is ugly. Forgive me.</p>
 <p>The threatening magic power akin to an erupting lava calmed down.</p>
 <p>—Anyways, what are we going to do? The Packhorse Master is making its move.</p>
 <p>“We will only steal. We won’t care about anything else.”</p>
 <p>It was an apathetic answer, but her command was clear.</p>
 <p>—Oh, by the way, there’s someone buying Packhorse Master’s stocks en masse.</p>
 <p>“Stocks?”</p>
 <p>—Yep. At first, I thought it was just a small investor, investing 3 million won first and 10 million won second. But suddenly, he threw in 250 million won on top of that. A small investor randomly investing wouldn’t do something like that.</p>
 <p>“Coincidence?”</p>
 <p>—Mm… 95%, I’d say. But Boss, the other 5% is what I’m concerned with. There’s no reason to buy this stock. Packhorse Master doesn’t even have a guild page yet.</p>
 <p>The guild stock market was riskier than the normal stock market. Thus, without a proper source of information, few small investors invested in new guilds. And there was no way that there was a source of information on Packhorse Master.</p>
 <p>“Don’t mind it. We only have one job.”</p>
 <p>—Mmm… If you say so. I’ll tell the troupe members that.</p>
 <p>“Un.”</p>
 <p>With that, the voice disappeared. Then, it quickly came back.</p>
 <p>—Oh right, a few interesting pages appeared on Violet Banquet.</p>
 <p>The woman tilted her head.</p>
 <p>—Artifact Search Corp, Jonggak's Dog Meat Soup, and Truth Agency.</p>
 <p>“Are they of any use?”</p>
 <p>—The first two are slowly building their reputation, but I don’t know about Truth Agency. I just included it because of how confident it introduced itself. Since it’s boasting in Violet Banquet, I’m sure it has some skill.</p>
 <p>“Take it out.”</p>
 <p>—Come on~ You know how things are. It wasn’t just once or twice that seemingly ordinary pages were the jackpot. I’ll give you the page number later, so take a look. It says it’ll answer any question. Who knows? Maybe it can help us find that son of a bitch.</p>
 <p>However, the woman remained uninterested.</p>
 <p>“That doesn’t happen often.”</p>
 <p>—Still. Alright, I’m going. See you later, Boss~</p>
 <p>That seemed to be the end of the conversation.<br>But the voice came back once again.</p>
 <p>—Oh, one more thing, Boss.</p>
 <p>“…”</p>
 <p>Veins popped up on the woman's white forehead.</p>
 <p>“What now?”</p>
 <p>—Cube’s exams start next week. You’ll go watch, right?</p>
 <p>Huu.<br>The woman sighed before replying.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, I will.”</p>
