 <p><br></p>
 <p>Last Friday night, I sent Boss a message.<br>I said that I wanted to<em>&nbsp;</em>negotiate.<br>Boss was silent for a week until she messaged me today.<br>The content of the message was a coordinate pointing to an intermediate-rank danger zone on the outskirts of Gyeonggido.<br>She was clearly telling me to come.</p>
 <p>“…Huh?”</p>
 <p>When I arrived, I saw an abandoned house standing alone in the middle of a dense forest.<br>It was a stone house that often appeared in scary movies, with stone bricks with fading color covered in moss and vines, and darkness shining through the broken window.<br>I went inside.<br>The sound of footsteps echoed out from darkness. I got goosebumps on my skin every time a chilly wind blew.</p>
 <p>“Hello?”</p>
 <p>The moment I voiced out, something large dropped down from the ceiling. Evandel’s Ghost Wolf shot out of my chest in response, and I opened my eyes to grasp the situation.</p>
 <p>“…A bat?”</p>
 <p>Flying Nightmare.<br>A giant bat was being crushed by Fenrir. Er, wait, I was Fenrir.</p>
 <p>—Krrrr! Krrrr!</p>
 <p>—Guaaaa!</p>
 <p>The giant bat struggled as hard as it could under the Ghost Wolf, but its neck was quickly bitten and twisted like a stringless puppet.<br>The Flying Nightmare should be an intermediate rank grade 6 monster, but it was helpless against the Ghost Wolf.</p>
 <p>“I guess I’ll leave close ranged combat to him.”</p>
 <p>I could just shoot from long range and the wolf could take care of anything that neared me. It was the perfect combination.</p>
 <p><em>Kiiiik—</em></p>
 <p>Soon, the door behind me opened and small footsteps rang out.<br>I turned around.<br>As expected, it was Boss.<br>She looked back and forth between the dead bat and the wolf, and asked.</p>
 <p>“Is it your pet?”</p>
 <p>“Yes? Ah, yes, something like that.”</p>
 <p>“It’s cute. First, take a seat.”</p>
 <p>Boss pointed at a table, which was the only furniture in the house.<br>I sat down in front of it, with the wolf lying next to me.<br>I asked Boss.</p>
 <p>“Did you leave the bat here on purpose?”</p>
 <p>“No, many monsters live around here. It must have come in on its own. Anyways, I heard you wanted to negotiate?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>“Let’s hear it. What condition didn’t you like?”</p>
 <p>Boss took out the contract once again.<br>An official mercenary contract. It was a good offer with a salary, which mercenaries rarely received.<br>However, what I wanted couldn’t be written down on a contract, nor was it allowed to.</p>
 <p>“I liked the conditions.”</p>
 <p>“Then what?”</p>
 <p>“There’s one request I’d like to make.”</p>
 <p>Boss tilted her head with a puzzled look.<br>With a thing smile, I told her what must be done.</p>
 <p>“I need you to help me kill someone.”</p>
 <p>Silence descended. I couldn’t even hear Boss’ breathing.<br>I did my research and the result was conclusive.<br>It was impossible for me to kill Chae Jinyoon alone.<br>Daehyun Hospital’s VIP ward couldn’t be underestimated. Each room was a fortress that could withstand a full-powered attack from high-intermediate rank Heroes, and Chae Jinyoon’s room even had 3 powerful mercenaries protecting it in shifts.<br>The situation was still better than when he was first hospitalized, when even a high-intermediate rank Hero was guarding him. Regardless, I had no way of penetrating their defense.<br>And even if I somehow managed to do so… my identity would certainly be discovered.<br>The Chae clan could easily make use of Yoo Jinhyuk. There was simply no way I could avoid his Gift.</p>
 <p>As selfish as it may be, I still wanted to stay together with the few comrades I’ve come to rely on.</p>
 <p>“You want to… kill someone?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>With a stiff expression, I gave Boss an envelope.<br>Boss stared at the envelope for a moment, then grabbed it with a light sigh. Her small hand entered my sight.<br>She opened the envelope.<br>Pictures of Chae Jinyoon and information about him fell down.<br>Immediately, Boss’ expressionless face changed. With widened eyes, Boss looked at me and asked.</p>
 <p>“…Is there a specific reason?”</p>
 <p>I nodded.</p>
 <p>“What is it?”</p>
 <p>“Mm… for the sake of world peace.”</p>
 <p>Although what I said was the truth, Boss made a sullen face.<br>I couldn’t do anything about it, since it wasn’t that I had personal grudge against him.</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Boss was silent for a while.<br>It was undoubtedly because Chae Jinyoon was a difficult target, even for her. Chae Jinyoon’s clan, to be exact.</p>
 <p>“I’ll be the one to kill him. You just have to create the opportunity….”</p>
 <p>I didn’t plan on asking her to kill him. She probably wouldn’t agree in the first place.<br>Seeing her completely silent, I added a secret word.</p>
 <p>“…Boss.”</p>
 <p>For this day, I purposely avoided calling her Boss.<br>Immediately, Boss’ eyebrows twitched.<br>She was trying to keep her imposing manner, but I could see the corner of her lips curling up faintly.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>On the other hand, the ‘Past Family’, excluding Kim Hajin, was meeting in a coffee shop. Although the purpose was to study for the final exams that would start in a week, Yoo Yeonha was the only one actually studying. Even Kim Suho was busy texting on his smartwatch.<br>Chae Nayun stared at Kim Suho suspiciously.</p>
 <p>“Kim Suho, you’re texting Seung-Ah Unni, aren’t you?”</p>
 <p>“Huh?”</p>
 <p>“I knew it. So that’s why she kept asking me about you.”</p>
 <p>Kim Suho flinched.</p>
 <p>“Uh… we’re just talking normally.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha cut in.</p>
 <p>“Isn’t that stranger? A cadet having personal conversations with a guild’s vice-leader? And she’s currently the most popular Hero too…”</p>
 <p>“Eh? Ah, no, it’s not like that….”</p>
 <p>Taken aback, Kim Suho began to ramble. Luckily for him, the subject of the conversation quickly changed. Yi Yeonghan mischievously teased Chae Nayun, who was sitting in a daze.</p>
 <p>“Why are you so quiet? Are you thinking about Kim Hajin?”</p>
 <p>“Why would Chae Nayun be thinking about that idiot?”</p>
 <p>But it was Shin Jonghak who reacted first, and Yoo Yeonha also frowned at his language.</p>
 <p>“…Jonghak, don’t call him an idiot. He’s rank 1 in theory.”</p>
 <p>“Right, Jonghak, didn’t you ask him for help yesterday?”</p>
 <p>“What? Don’t make things up, Kim Suho. Have you finally gone mad?”</p>
 <p>“I saw you ordering Kim Horak to ask for you.”</p>
 <p>Kim Suho remembered seeing Shin Jonghak awkwardly handing Kim Horak his notebook and Kim Horak going to Kim Hajin with it.</p>
 <p>“…That was just him asking what he didn’t understand.”</p>
 <p>“What nonsense is that…”</p>
 <p>“Shut up—!”</p>
 <p>“Stop being so loud. I’m tired and annoyed by my recent hellish training.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun quickly suppressed Shin Jonghak’s delirium.<br>On the other hand, Yoo Yeonha smiled bitterly and closed her textbook. No one seemed to be interested in studying.</p>
 <p>“So, all three of you are going to Yoo Sihyuk Camp? Then you’ll be a league above the other cadets once you come out.”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, we’ll come back early March.”</p>
 <p>“Hm… then when should we go on our trip?”</p>
 <p>The best part of being students was being able to go on trips with friends. Hearing Yoo Yeonha’s words, Chae Nayun replied in a better mood.</p>
 <p>“December 17th, a week after finals.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, that day doesn’t work for me. I have a promise with Hajin.”</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun’s eyes widened at Kim Suho’s unexpected words.</p>
 <p>“W-W-What promise?”</p>
 <p>“Uh, we’re going…”</p>
 <p>Kim Suho paused.<br>Last week, Kim Hajin said that he found a Dungeon and invited him to come.<br>Kim Suho felt that it was something he shouldn’t reveal to others.</p>
 <p>“…we’re going on a drive together.”</p>
 <p>“A drive?”</p>
 <p>“Uh, yeah. I’ve been wanting to try riding his bike.”</p>
 <p>“Pft, what a fitting duo.”</p>
 <p>Shin Jonghak sneered, while Chae Nayun suddenly began to bang her head against the backseat of the couch in a fit of rage.</p>
 <p>“Ha, haha, I can’t believe this. Ha, haha.”</p>
 <p>After repeating this woodpecker-like motion for a bit, Chae Nayun suddenly shot up.</p>
 <p>“Hey, I’m going first.”</p>
 <p>Kim Suho asked.</p>
 <p>“Where are you going?”</p>
 <p>“Training. I’m going training. Don’t follow me, Shin Jonghak.”</p>
 <p>“…Kuhum.”</p>
 <p>Shin Jonghak, who was stealthily trying to get up, sat back down.</p>
 <p><em>Koong, koong.</em><br>Chae Nayun then stomped out angrily for no determinable reason.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>9 P.M.<br>After talking with Boss, I met with Rachel as soon as I returned to Cube. This was our standard one-on-one training time.</p>
 <p>“By the way, why did you ask me to help you with Barrier? I’m only rank 334.”</p>
 <p>Before the start of training, I suddenly got curious and asked.<br>Rachel looked at me for a minute, then spoke with a sheepish smile.</p>
 <p>“I’m not that stupid. I already know that Hajin-ssi is staying at that rank on purpose.”</p>
 <p>“…Yes? Ah, well….”</p>
 <p>I shrugged at Rachel’s surprisingly high evaluation of me. Thinking about it carefully, she wasn’t wrong. If I utilized Stigma’s magic power well, I felt like I could easily climb to rank 30.<br>Any higher made me doubtful because of my stats.<br>0.7 from Aether, 0.3 from Under Armor, and 0.1 from Ghost Wolf. Even with a total of 1.1 points from items, my stats still weren’t great.</p>
 <p>“Let’s start. Try activating Barrier.”</p>
 <p>Rachel nodded with a look of determination. She stood up straight and invoked Barrier.<br>Although it looked a bit jagged, it was still covering her upper body, and its defensive capability looked high even at a glance.</p>
 <p>“Now, I’ll try attacking.”</p>
 <p>I held up my cadet handgun and aimed at her Barrier.<br>Although I could easily kill a low-intermediate rank monster with a cadet handgun, I shouldn’t be able to penetrate Rachel’s Barrier.</p>
 <p>“Before that, cover yourself with qi reinforcement. Just in case you get hurt.”</p>
 <p>“Yes!”</p>
 <p>Along with an enthusiastic reply, Rachel covered herself with qi reinforcement.<br>She really was passionate about learning.</p>
 <p>“Now, try to stop my bullets using that Barrier.”</p>
 <p>“…?”</p>
 <p>This time, she seemed a bit confused.<br>She probably thought the Barrier would defend on its own.</p>
 <p>“Using this Barrier?”</p>
 <p>“Yep, you’ll know what I mean once you try. It’ll be quite difficult.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Rachel quietly curled her body behind her Barrier.<br>I grinned and aimed my gun at her.</p>
 <p>“I’m shooting.”</p>
 <p>I fired immediately. The bullet I shot curved in an odd way, digging underneath Rachel’s Barrier, then suddenly shooting up and hitting her arm.</p>
 <p>“…Uuu!”</p>
 <p>Rachel trembled at the sudden impact. Then, she rubbed her arm with her hand.<br>Since she had her qi reinforcement up, it should have only felt like a sting.<br>I provoked her slightly.</p>
 <p>“If you want to block my bullet with that Barrier, you’ll need to practice for at least three years.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Rachel opened her eyes flaringly like her pride was hurt.</p>
 <p>“I, I want to try again.”</p>
 <p>“Of course.”</p>
 <p>The decision Rachel made to deal with my bullet was enlarging the size of her Barrier.<br>With a small smile, I aimed where her Barrier couldn’t cover, her toe.<br>Tang.</p>
 <p>“Auu! Ow!”</p>
 <p>Her qi reinforcement must have been weaker around her feet as she fell to the ground holding her foot. Then, with teary eyes, she glared at me with a wronged face.</p>
 <p>“T-That was mean!”</p>
 <p>“What do you mean? That was Rachel-ssi’s fault. Why try to block a bullet with just a Barrier?”</p>
 <p>“…Eh?”</p>
 <p>“Try asking the grass, or the wind.”</p>
 <p>I remembered a scene I described.<br>A breathtaking scene from the future, where Rachel would ask her elementals to cast hundreds of Barriers. Using this fairytale-like power, she would save thousands of people and overcome her trauma at the same time.</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Of course, that was in the future. The present time’s 17-year-old Rachel was only glaring at the grass, unable to understand what I meant.</p>
 <p><em>Buzz—</em></p>
 <p>Suddenly, my smartwatch rang.<br>This buzz was an alarm function I added to notify me whenever a change happened to me.</p>
 <p>===<br>[24 hours passed since consuming a ginseng pill. All stats increase by 0.0012 point.]<br>[Medicinal effect, ‘Physical Body Reinforcement’, has been 100% memorized.]</p>
 <p>4. Physical Body Reinforcement<br>▷Increases all stats by 0.001~0.02 point. (The increase is only dependent on luck. Your physical stats will not affect it in any way.)<br>▷Reproduction cooldown time: 24 hours.<br>===</p>
 <p>After eating Yoo Yeonha’s ginseng pill every day, I finally obtained its medicinal effect.<br>Although the ginseng pill’s effect permanently increased its user’s stats by 0.001~0.02 point, the upper limit was only achievable by children or the elderly. I’ve only been able to get 0.0015 point at max with each max.<br>But now that I had this Physical Body Reinforcement effect, my stat increase would take a new turn. Assuming I only gained 0.0018 point per day, a year would give me 0.657 point, and ten years would give me 6.57 points…</p>
 <p>“Mm.”</p>
 <p>After nodding in satisfaction, I held up my gun once more.</p>
 <p>“Alright, let’s go aga…”</p>
 <p>It was then.<br><em>Psssh, psssh.</em><br>I could hear the rustling of leaves behind me.<br>Who was it?<br>I quickly turned around, but the person who was watching us seemed to have run away.<br>However, my Thousand-Mile Eyes could easily see through the forest and find the person running away.</p>
 <p>“…Huh?”</p>
 <p>A familiar silhouette with brown hair.<br>It was Chae Nayun.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>Time flew by like a river, and the hellish finals began for Cube’s cadets.<br>But just like always, I breezed through the written exams.<br>What most cadets were concerned about were the combat exams.</p>
 <p>“Listen up. For the final exam, everyone will start from an equal position.”</p>
 <p>Today was December 8th.<br>All first-year cadets were gathered in Gyeonggido for the final exam.</p>
 <p>“The final exam will be Tower Climbing!”</p>
 <p>Today’s exam was Tower Climbing, but I didn’t know much about it, since I skipped writing about most of Cube’s exams after the first semester.<br>I suddenly regretted it.</p>
 <p>“This is a common training program used by guilds before attempting to conquer Towers. Up to 1500 people can enter at a atime.”</p>
 <p>The building in front of us was too square to be called a Tower.<br>I looked up at this building in a daze.<br>Although it only looked like a 10-story building, it should be much bigger on the inside.</p>
 <p>“This Tower’s entrance is a magic engineered device that’s similar to a Portal. Once you go inside, you’ll be sent to a random predetermined location, so don’t be alarmed!”</p>
 <p>After the instructor’s explanation, cadets began to enter the Tower one by one.<br>When it was my turn, I went in with my eyes closed.<br>Sensations similar to a Portal enveloped me, and in the next moment, I could clearly feel that I was transported to another space.<br>Even when I opened my eyes, all I saw was darkness.<br>I looked around using my Thousand-Mile Eyes.<br>Although there was darkness all around me, my extraordinary eyes could see everything as though it was day.</p>
 <p>“Hmm.”</p>
 <p>I was in a small white room with only a small pathway to my right.<br>Finding my way out of this room seemed to be my first goal.<br>I focused my vision and tried to see through the walls.<br>But as expected of a Tower, something seemed to be hindering my Gift as I couldn’t see that far away.</p>
 <p>“Argh, my eyes hurt.”</p>
 <p>I felt like I could peer through the walls if I added Stigma’s magic power, but I decided to save it since I didn’t know what would happen later on.<br>Soon, the lights came on, signaling that the exam had begun. At the same time, glowing sentences appeared on the white walls.</p>
 <p>[3 Commandments]<br>[Cooperate with White to climb.]<br>[Be wary of traps.]<br>[Have faith.]</p>
 <p>“…I’ll be damned if Lancaster or other Djinns don’t come out.”</p>
 <p>I was all too familiar with how things were panning out.<br>Although Djinns wouldn’t dare to act too openly with so many watchful eyes on Cube, about 30% of Cube was already taken over by Djinns.<br>First, I took a careful look around. But just as I concluded before, there wasn’t anything special about the room.</p>
 <p>“So I’ll have to cross that bridge…”</p>
 <p>There was a pathway on the right leading to a bridge. It looked too much like a trap, with the left and right sides of the bridge being completely empty.<br>But I had no choice.<br>I walked down the sole pathway and arrived at the bridge.<br>While I was going over the bridge, one careful step at a time…<br><em>Shweeek—</em><br>An arrow came flying in with a fierce shockwave.<br>No, there wasn’t just one arrow.<br>One from the front, and one from the left and right.<br>However, all three arrows lost their speed three steps in front of my head.<br>Compared to Rachel’s rapier, these arrows were like turtles.<br>Under Bullet Time, which I was now all too familiar with, I grabbed the two arrows flying in from the sides, then dodged the one from the front by lightly tilting my head.<br>Then, I chucked the arrows forward, destroying the crossbow that fired the arrow.</p>
 <p>“Ahahaha!”</p>
 <p>After clearing the first trap with ease, I laughed imposingly.<br>However.<br><em>Doosh—</em><br>The sound of a door opening rang out.</p>
 <p>“…W-What!?”</p>
 <p>And the bridge I was standing on dropped down.</p>
