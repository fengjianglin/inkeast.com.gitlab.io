 <p>Wuxiaworld is hiring once again! &nbsp;We are now looking for up to TWO part-time front-end technomancers/programmers/UI designers to assist our current Technomancers in beautifying and improving our front-end functionality. &nbsp;Specifically, we need people with <strong>all</strong> of the following skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (experience with React, Angular 2+).</p>
 <p>Since we do have a lot of applicants, priority will be given to applicants with UI overhaul experience, and even better would be expertise in ASPNET Core (<strong>NOT</strong> regular ASPNET)...</p>

 <p><br></p>
 <p>Once separated from my body, Stigma’s magic power didn’t last long.<br>The same applied to any other form of magic power. Although people could materialize magic power for an instant, it usually disappeared within 10 minutes unless the user provided a constant supply of magic power to maintain its form.</p>
 <p>[You obtained a new skill, 「Normal Skill Acquisition Scroll – Lv.0 Extraction and Permanent Materialization」].</p>
 <p>However, this skill made condensing magic power and materializing it possible.<br>In other words, ‘mana crystals’, which usually took a long time to create, could be done in an instant.<br>Although the skill was still low-level, it should be possible.</p>
 <p>[You activated 「Extraction and Permanent Materialization」].</p>
 <p>I used the skill on the Stigma on my upper arm.<br>First was the extraction process.<br>It felt like my arm was being ripped off, but I clenched my teeth and endured it. From my arm, Stigma’s magic power faintly glimmered. The skill’s power forced its magic power to form a certain shape.<br>Meanwhile, the pain grew more intense. From my arm to my shoulder, from my shoulder to my head. It felt like I was being trampled by dozens of horses.</p>
 <p>“Kuuak…”</p>
 <p>Then suddenly, the pain stopped.<br>When I opened my eyes, a crystal was resting on my palm.<br>The unrefined crystal was rocky like an uncut gem. Additionally, it gave off a white glow rather than a blue glow.<br>I checked the item’s description.</p>
 <p>===<br>[Lv.2 Pure ‘Origin’ Mana Crystal]<br>○Lv.2 ????<br>○Lv.2 ????<br>===</p>
 <p>Origin Mana Crystal. Despite its grand name, its effects were a complete mystery.<br>However, I felt like I knew how to use it.</p>
 <p>[The chief administrator is observing you with interest.]</p>
 <p>Suddenly, I received a rather interesting alert.<br>Chief Administrator, the existence overseeing all floors.<br>I smiled at its interest and turned on my smartwatch.<br>Then, I typed in the effects I desired in the mana crystal’s question marks.</p>
 <p>===<br>[Lv.2 Pure ‘Origin’ Mana Crystal]<br>○Lv.2 Permanent Strength Increase Upon Consumption<br>○Lv.2 Permanent Speed Increase Upon Consumption<br>===</p>
 <p>The SP required was zero, as expected.<br>I had created something of a blank check with my Stigma.<br>Since I made one, I put it in my mouth without hesitation.</p>
 <p>[Consuming an Origin Mana Crystal increases your strength by 0.05 points.]<br>[Consuming an Origin Mana Crystal increases your speed by 0.05 points.]</p>
 <p>Perhaps because my stats were still in the 2-point range, it went up by quite a lot. If I gained 0.05 points in the Tower, I should gain about 0.01 in the outside world.</p>
 <p>“…Great.”</p>
 <p>Great, simply great. It was completely worthy of being called a cheat skill.<br>However…<br>My body hurt, and I felt drowsy.<br>Although it didn’t specifically limit me in any way, once a day was unquestionably my limit.<br>I thought about jumping on the bed then stopped when I remembered the egg sleeping on it.</p>
 <p>“…When are you going to hatch?”</p>
 <p>Muninn’s egg still showed no signs of hatching.<br><em>Rub, rub—</em><br>A rubbed the reflective surface of the egg to scare it.</p>
 <p>“If you won’t hatch, I’ll extract your power and absorb it all. In fact, I’ll fry you!”</p>
 <p>However, the egg showed no signs of change. Instead of making a fried egg, I put the egg down and put the bed in my inventory. To hatch, it only needed the blanket.</p>
 <p>“Hyung’s leaving now.”</p>
 <p>After saying goodbye, I left the waiting room.<br>Although I put a lot of effort into making my waiting room hospitable, sleeping in Prestige’s hideout provided more of an advantage. Plus, being alone was lonely.</p>
 <p>“Auu, I’m so tired.”</p>
 <p>I trudged back to the Chameleon Troupe’s hideout.</p>
 <p>“Oh~ Hajin, you’re back~”</p>
 <p>It was now 11 p.m.<br>The three members of the Chameleon Troupe were grilling meat.</p>
 <p>“Come eat.”</p>
 <p>Cheok Jungyeong gestured with his index finger, and Boss stared at me silently.</p>
 <p>“Ah, it’s okay, I’m too tired.”</p>
 <p>I took out my bed from my inventory.<br>Jain and Boss’ eyes widened.</p>
 <p>“Oh~ where’d you get that bed~?”</p>
 <p>“I brought it from my waiting room.”</p>
 <p>===<br>[Lv.3 Comfy Bed]<br>○Lv.3 Recovery<br>*Fully restores your vitality in 6 hours.<br>○Lv.3 comfiness<br>*Clears your mind<br>===</p>
 <p>I lay down on the Lv.3 bed I made.<br>I couldn’t hold back my drowsiness any longer. Boss and Jain looked at me with envy, but I had no intention of giving up the bed for today.<br>I closed my eyes, hoping for the fatigue from using Extraction and Permanent Materialization to go away.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>…A perilous land.<br>Reddish-black fragments scattered down from the shattered sky.<br>The world was dark.<br>There was no hope, no light, and only death.<br>I was there, resenting my birth, rejecting my existence.</p>
 <p>I had parents, parents who regretted giving birth to me.<br>They called me a fabrication of a curse, an origin of evil. They condemned and cursed me several times a day until eventually, they decided to kill me.<br>I killed them in order to survive. I cut the flesh of the very person who gave birth to me. I slashed the neck of the person who held me when I was a baby. I died above the corpses of my parents and was reborn.</p>
 <p>…That was the story of my childhood.<br>At the same time, it was a world I could live in.<br>I was happy to have parents, even though they hated me. I was happy to have a place to call home. I was happy to have parents who I had no choice but to love and hate.</p>
 <p>But when I killed them, everything disappeared.</p>
 <p>I wandered in the void. Occasionally, there were people who made me smile. However, they were all schemers who wanted to use me for their purposes. Tricked by the snakes’ smiles, I killed more and more people. Soon, the snakes began to fear me, and I killed the snakes that tried to kill me.<br>While living in this perpetual cycle, I met a certain man.<br>There was nothing special about the way we met.<br>There was no reason for us to be together.<br>However, he treated me honestly. He told me to do what I wanted, that he would become my new fence if I wanted.<br>I agreed.<br>That was when the real killing began.<br>I never resented anyone. I was simply an existence born to kill…</p>
 <p>“….!”</p>
 <p>My eyes shot open with a resounding vibration in my chest.<br>The scenes of the past crumbled down, and reality appeared before my eyes.<br>I was drenched in sweat, and my face was heated.<br>An unprecedented unrest shook my body.</p>
 <p>“Haa….”</p>
 <p>Was it because I wasn’t sleeping on my special bed? I ended up having a nightmare I haven’t had for a long time.<br>This was the reason I hated going to sleep. My past always crept up in my sleep, but my dream-self was always too young to resist it.</p>
 <p>“Huu….”</p>
 <p>I calmly swallowed my saliva. Using magic power, I smoothened my flow of blood and cooled my heated body.<br>However, what I couldn’t understand only became harder to understand.<br>I opened my system log.<br>Kim Hajin’s inner thoughts towards me were recorded here.<br>He was full of emotions I couldn’t comprehend.</p>
 <p>[Longing] [Responsibility] [Affection]<br>[Sadness Towards Your Past] [Trust] [Desire to Look After You]</p>
 <p>Longing, responsibility, affection.<br>Such embarrassing emotions weren’t the sources of my trouble.<br>It was the ‘sadness towards my past’.</p>
 <p>I gritted my teeth and clenched my fists. My fingernails dug into my skin.<br>Rage rose up from the bottom of my heart.</p>
 <p>“…How laughable.”</p>
 <p>What do you know about me to have such a feeling towards me?<br>Just what do you know to dare to have such a thought?<br>Did you investigate my past secretly?<br>…My stomach churned.<br>Something inside my deepest subconscious squirmed. An uncontrollable hostility was rising up.<br>I got up from my bed and walked. I moved as my emotion told me. I stopped in front of his bed and looked down at him.</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>I wanted to ask him.<br>What have you found out about me during the past three years?<br>What is your purpose for being with me?<br>In the end, are you also one of ‘them’?<br>Magic power ignited on my hands. The black magic power of Shadow spread out towards him.<br>I had to kill him.<br>I had to kill anyone suspicious.<br>I had to kill him before he betrayed me.</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>However, my hands refused to move.<br>The past three years flashed before my eyes.<br>Among his inner emotions were ‘affection’ and ‘longing’.<br>How was I supposed to interpret them?<br>While I was contemplating…</p>
 <p>“…Huaam.”</p>
 <p>He tossed and turned his body.<br>Immediately, my magic power flickered off, and I took a few steps back.</p>
 <p>“…Hm?”</p>
 <p>Soon, he woke up. After blankly staring at the ceiling, he raised his upper body.</p>
 <p>“Boss?”</p>
 <p>He called my name.<br>His drowsy eyes looked straight at me.</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Facing his stare, my body froze.<br>Gulp— I swallowed.<br>There were many questions I wanted to ask.<br>Where the emotions you had for me were coming from.<br>Whether I can trust you.<br>Why you were staying with me.<br>However, what came out of my mouth was…</p>
 <p>“I’m… hungry.”</p>
 <p>A stupid word.<br>For a moment, he looked at me in a daze. Then, he burst into laughter.</p>
 <p>“Pft, at this hour? Ah… well, I guess you were tired today.”</p>
 <p>He jumped out of his bed and headed to the kitchen.</p>
 <p>“I’ll make you something special to revitalize you.”</p>
 <p>He turned on the lights.<br><em>Tak, tak, tak, tak.</em><br>The sound of him cutting vegetables and meat rang out.<br><em>Tzzzzz.</em><br>He ignited the burner and poured the ingredients onto the frying pan.<br>Standing behind him, I watched him cook for a long time.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>Next day, [Lv.0 Essence of the Strait Hideout]<br>Chae Nayun raised her sore tired body. Although it was still early in the morning, all the guild members were already awake and making their beds.</p>
 <p>“Mmm~”</p>
 <p>After her morning stretch, Chae Nayun sat down on the ground. Then, she took out her frying pan, burner, salt, and boar meat.</p>
 <p>“Nayun~ Nayun~ my favorite Nayun~”</p>
 <p>Yi Jiyoon snuggled up to her, giggling happily. On the other hand, the other guild members were walking on eggshells around her.</p>
 <p>“What’s everyone doing?”</p>
 <p>As she grilled the meat, she called them over like she always did.</p>
 <p>“…Huh?”</p>
 <p>“Aren’t you going to eat?”</p>
 <p>“Y-Yeah, we, we will…”</p>
 <p>Only then did they approach her one by one.</p>
 <p>“Kuhum, we’re really lucky to have you, Nayun-ssi.”</p>
 <p>“I agree. What a godsend~”</p>
 <p>Almost 2 weeks had passed since they came up to the 3rd floor. Essence of the Strait’s guild members were relying on Chae Nayun’s food.</p>
 <p>“Kuhum, everyone, before eating…”</p>
 <p>Kim Youngjin, the Chief Officer of the Tower Subjugation Team, gathered the attention of the guild members.</p>
 <p>“Essence of Strait is able to advance faster thanks to Chae Nayun, so let us each give her a word of grati—”</p>
 <p>“Don’t need it~”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun herself didn’t have any opinion on the matter.<br>She no longer expected anything of anyone. She didn’t wish for anything, and thus there was no disappointment.<br>That was it.<br>Kim Youngjin had acknowledged his mistake and apologized to her already. She knew how difficult that was for a high-intermediate rank Hero to do.</p>
 <p>“O-Oh, okay. Ah, you can give me the tongs, I will grill the meat for you.”</p>
 <p>“…Okay.’</p>
 <p>She didn’t reject his offer.<br>Leaving the cooking to Kim Youngjin, Chae Nayun opened her messenger.</p>
 <p>「Thanks again, Hyung-nim. Your advice really saved us.」<br>「Oh right, do you want to meet up sometime?」</p>
 <p>“Is he busy…?”</p>
 <p>Two days had gone by since she messaged Extra7, but he hasn’t answered. The only replies she had were from Shin Jonghak.</p>
 <p>YoungFly: 「Where are you? Let’s go hunting together if you have time.」</p>
 <p>「Do it with your guildmates.」</p>
 <p>YoungFly: 「I’m too strong for their standards.」</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun simply ignored him.</p>
 <p>“Right, Nayun, are you going to buy that longsword?”</p>
 <p>“Longsword?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, the Lv.3 longsword that’s being sold in the shop outside the inner wall.”</p>
 <p>“Oh….”</p>
 <p>The named shop outside the inner wall. Players called it the [Brother and Sister Shop].<br>A longsword was perfect for Chae Nayun.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know… I already have the Red Crystal Spear.”</p>
 <p>Without saying much, Chae Nayun secretly touched her left shoulder. Immediately, a burning pain pulsed out. She had received this injury when fighting a [Lv.3 Banshee] four days ago. She initially believed the injury would heal over time, but because the pain was only getting more intense, she couldn’t even use two-handed weapons properly.</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun examined her injury through the system window.</p>
 <p>[Lv.2 Curse of the Vengeful Spirit]</p>
 <p>The curse was Lv.1 yesterday. As expected, it was getting stronger over time.<br>Still, Chae Nayun feigned healthiness and asked Yi Jiyoon.</p>
 <p>“Jiyoon, you still can’t use Healing Factor?”</p>
 <p>“Eh? Oh, yeah, I still don’t have enough magic power. Why? Are you hurt somewhere?”</p>
 <p>“…No, that’s not it.”</p>
 <p>It was then.<br>Pshhhu! A strange alarm rang, and a holographic window popped up in the air.<br>Medea was on the screen.</p>
 <p>“Oh, it’s Medea-ssi.”</p>
 <p>The 3rd floor’s administrator.<br>The male members even put down their chopsticks to focus.</p>
 <p>[Hello, Players. I’m Medea, it’s been a while~ I’m here to give you all a new goal.]</p>
 <p>Tada—<br>Medea snapped her fingers, and a thick spire appeared on the screen.</p>
 <p>[This is a Demon Spire. There’s one located in each of the four cardinal directions. You can think of them as control towers.]<br>[I will reward the Player or group that destroys one of these with 5000TP.]<br>[Each Player’s ‘damage contribution’ will also be estimated. Players with the highest contribution points will receive special rewards.]<br>[It’s not fun telling you what they are in advance, but…]</p>
 <p>Tada—<br>Medea snapped her fingers again.<br>This time, three windows with different item information popped up.</p>
 <p>[Special Skill Acquisition Book – Lv.1 Lightning of Thor] [Artifact – High-intermediate]<br>[Special Skill Acquisition Book – Lv.2 Wind of Odyssey] [Artifact – Low-intermediate]<br>[Trait Recovery Coupon]</p>
 <p>“Oh?!”</p>
 <p>Everyone’s eyes lit up. The rewards were the so-called skillbooks they had only heard about in the Community. Not to mention, they were ‘special’ skillbooks rather than basic skillbooks.</p>
 <p>“H-Hey, aren’t those like… really good?”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun was especially agitated. Her injury made her more impatient.</p>
 <p>“Calm down, everyone. We should formulate our plans carefully.”</p>
 <p>Kim Youngjin calmed the excited guild members down and initiated a meeting.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>I left the city and entered the field as soon as I saw Medea’s announcement, bringing a handmade bow along with 20 arrows.<br>After walking through the dark monster field for a bit, I discovered three skeletons.<br>I nocked three arrows on my bow.<br><em>Chweeek—</em><br>I aimed at them and lightly fired. The three arrows pierced their head directly.</p>
 <p>—Wow, who’s that?<br>—That was a good shot.<br>—Where did he get that bow? It looks like it’s high level.<br>—Should we ask him?</p>
 <p>My performance caught the attention of a few other Players in the area.<br>I ignored their murmuring and approached the skeletons. I placed my hand above them and used my skill.</p>
 <p>[You activated 「Extraction and Permanent Materialization」].</p>
 <p>The lifeless skeletons transformed into dust. However, the dust didn’t scatter away and instead coalesced into a crystal.</p>
 <p>[Lv.0 Skeleton Soul]<br>○Lv.0 Vengeful Spirit</p>
 <p>At first glance, the crystal was useless, filled with only a vengeful spirit. However, by collecting these and using [Synthesis], I could use them as grenades that would blow up the Demon Spires.<br>Once all three skeletons turned into crystals, I turned around to return the way I came from.<br>Tap, tap<br>Then suddenly, someone tapped on my shoulder.</p>
 <p>“Um… you’re a Player, right?”</p>
 <p>Hearing a voice, I turned around. Startled, I jumped inwardly.<br>Standing in front of me was the white-haired Aileen. She was a lot skinnier than the last time I saw her, but her unique confidence was still present. As expected of Temple of Justice’s Hero, Aileen had survived just fine.<br>But why was she here? Did she recognize me? No, that was unlikely. Although I was still wearing a hood, my equipment was completely different from what I was wearing in the tutorial.</p>
 <p>“I saw you doing something just now… is that the Dismantling technique?”</p>
 <p>Thankfully, it seemed that she just misunderstood my Extraction skill for the Dismantling technique.</p>
 <p>“Dismantling technique?”</p>
 <p>I changed my voice and spoke.</p>
 <p>“Yep.”</p>
 <p>“…Why do you ask?”</p>
 <p>“Ah, well, I have food, but I don’t know how to dismantle it.”</p>
 <p>“Oh?”</p>
 <p>So she was asking someone she just met to do it for her?<br>Should I say she was amicable or naïve…? Ah, no, it was because she kills anyone who tried to scam her.</p>
 <p>“If you help me, you can have some of it!”</p>
 <p>Aileen suggested.<br>At that moment, I suddenly received a message.</p>
 <p>PhantomThief: 「Hajin, I see you. You’re with Aileen, right? Keep her there and catch her attention. I’m going to try the Snatch skill I learned.」</p>
 <p>Basic Skill – Snatch.<br>It was a skill that stole items or TP from the inventory.</p>
 <p>“How about it? It doesn’t hurt to use it, right!?”</p>
 <p>“…Yeah, I guess.”</p>
 <p>As I said that, I peeked over her shoulders.<br>I could see a woman waving her hand excitedly from the distance.</p>
 <p>“Sure, I’ll do it.”</p>
 <p>“Really? What level is your Dismantling technique?”</p>
 <p>“…3.”</p>
 <p>“Reaaally? Nice! So that’s why those skeletons instantly disappeared~”</p>
 <p>Aileen smiled brightly. She tapped on the air a few times and pulled out a giant boar from her inventory. Although it wasn’t rotten, it wasn’t fresh either. If I didn’t dismantle it soon, it would surely rot.</p>
 <p>“Big, isn’t it? I’ll give you a fifth… no, a fourth.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>I nodded silently. Meanwhile, Jain had sneaked up to Aileen. Judging by the way her hands were moving, I suspected that the following was happening to Aileen’s pocket.<br>-10TP<br>-20TP<br>-10TP<br>-20TP<br>…</p>
 <p>“Hmm….”</p>
 <p>I examined the boar.</p>
 <p>“W-Why? Is it too big?”</p>
 <p>Aileen stared at me with worried eyes.</p>
 <p>“…No, it should be doable. Dismantle.”</p>
 <p>After Jain finished her work and backed away, I used Dismantle.<br>In an instant, the giant boar was split into meat and leather. With my high-level Dismantling technique, the boar was cleanly cut.</p>
 <p>“Uwoah!”</p>
 <p>Aileen widened her eyes in surprise.<br>While she was busy gawking at the boar meat, I quickly messaged Jain.</p>
 <p>[How much did you steal?]</p>
 <p>PhantomThief: 「ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 989 TP ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ I took it all ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋiiya, the kid sure had a lot ㅋㅋㅋㅋ un~ but they’re all mine now~ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ」</p>
 <p>I scratched my neck and looked at Aileen.</p>
 <p>“Uwoah, look at all these!”</p>
 <p>With her tiny hands, she was putting the meat into her inventory. Unaware that she just had her money stolen, she seemed happy like she just won a lottery.<br>I felt a bit sorry, but the food I got her was enough to last two weeks. She could sell them to other hungry Players, so I didn’t feel too bad.<br>Leaving Aileen behind, I turned around and walked towards the undead cave I came here to visit.</p>
 <p>“Ah, you should take your portion!”</p>
 <p>Aileen shouted.<br>However, I responded without looking back.</p>
 <p>“You can have it.”</p>
 <p>Aileen. She was a powerful competitor for Medea’s quest.<br>I ended up giving her food in exchange for taking her money. I wasn’t sure how effective it would be in slowing her down.<br>But well, I just had to perform well and get first place.</p>
