 <p><br></p>
 <p>KOONG!<br>I touched the ground with a rough thud. However, I wasn’t hurt thanks to covering my back with Aether.<br>I quickly got up and looked around.<br>I was in an empty cave-like complex.<br>The only thing even remotely noteworthy were the rocks on the ground.</p>
 <p>“…The Tower I know isn’t like this.”</p>
 <p>In truth, there was only one Tower that I carefully designed.<br>Tower of Wish, the largest Tower in history that was on a league of its own compared to other Towers.<br>The place would be called an alternate world, and it was the place I would go in the future. In fact, I <em>had&nbsp;</em>to go.<br>But that was for a future time.</p>
 <p>“What am I supposed to do now?”</p>
 <p>“Uwoooah!”</p>
 <p>While I was looking around, a scream rang out from above as someone else fell to the ground.<br>A familiar face and a familiar body.<br>It was Chae Nayun.<br>Was it a coincidence? Or were stupid people more likely to fall for the trap? Though, that would mean I was stupid too.</p>
 <p>“Auuu….”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun rubbed her back, then widened her eyes when she saw me.</p>
 <p>“Well, well, well, if it isn’t Kim-ssi.”</p>
 <p>Then, she narrowed her eyes and said some strange words.</p>
 <p>“…Is your head hurt?”</p>
 <p>I put my hand forward. Chae Nayun seemed to hesitate for a moment, but she soon grabbed my hand and got up.<br>She dusted off the dirt on her butt and back, then asked.</p>
 <p>“Where are we?”</p>
 <p>“How would I know? Rather, how did you fall down?”</p>
 <p>“Well, a crossbow shot an arrow at me. When I destroyed it, the floor suddenly collapsed.”</p>
 <p>Crossbow… ah, come to think of it, the color of that crossbow was white.<br>One of the three commandments was [Cooperate with White].<br>But how the hell were we supposed to cooperate with a crossbow that tried to kill us?</p>
 <p>“Wait a minute.”</p>
 <p>I widened my eyes and looked forward. My Thousand-Mile vision quickly expanded out.<br>About a kilometer past the empty cave complex, I could see a group of dwarves at work. They were standing in front of a stone door, diligently pulling on a rope connected to it.</p>
 <p>“I found the way. Follow me.”</p>
 <p>I gestured at Chae Nayun and walked forward. Chae Nayun looked at me somewhat grumpily, then began to follow me.</p>
 <p>“Where are we going?”</p>
 <p>“There are NPCs up ahead.”</p>
 <p>“NPCs?”</p>
 <p>Tower NPCs, beings created by the Tower’s magic power that can only live inside the Tower.<br>These magic power existences were officially called ‘Tower residents’, but people liked to call them by the gaming language, NPC.</p>
 <p>“There are even NPCs in this Tower?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t see why not.”</p>
 <p>Even an artificial Tower like this one was still a mystical space.<br>In any case, the two of us walked together in a running pace.<br>After about five minutes, we could see the dwarf NPCs.</p>
 <p>“Wow, your eyes really are freak… amazing.”</p>
 <p>“Just say freakish.”</p>
 <p>It wasn’t like her to use more kid-friendly language.</p>
 <p>“W-What do you mean? I’m always like this.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun dodged my eyes as she flipped her hair over.<br>Ignoring her, I observed the NPCs up ahead. They were all wearing the same green clothes, but that was the only special thing about them.</p>
 <p>“Ah! Who is it!?”</p>
 <p>Once we walked a bit closer, one of the NPCs found us, causing the others to also look over.</p>
 <p>“They must be here to help us!”</p>
 <p>“O Venerable Giants! Please open this door for us!”</p>
 <p>The dwarves ran up to us and pleaded.</p>
 <p>“What do we do?”</p>
 <p>“Hold on.”</p>
 <p>One of the three commandments was [Have Faith].<br>I didn’t know what that meant exactly, but I couldn’t be too careless.</p>
 <p>“…What are your names?”</p>
 <p>“I’m One!”<br>“I’m Seven!”<br>“I’m Twelve!”</p>
 <p>“Nevermind then.”</p>
 <p>I counted the dwarves.<br>One, two, three… seven.<br>I couldn’t tell if I was supposed to trust them.</p>
 <p>“Is there anyone else?”</p>
 <p>“We have other brothers!”</p>
 <p>“How many?”</p>
 <p>“100!”</p>
 <ol start="100">
  <li><span id="footnote-ref-c7dd"><span>
     <ul>
      <li>White.</li>
     </ul></span><a href="#footnote-c7dd">[1]</a><span><br>It was a stupid play on words, but that’s what made it more believable.</span></span></li>
 </ol>
 <p>“Fine, I’ll help you.”</p>
 <p>I looked at Chae Nayun, signaling to her that it was her turn.<br>Chae Nayun grabbed the rope hanging on the stone door.</p>
 <p>“I just have to pull on this?”</p>
 <p>“Yes! But it’ll be difficult to open alone!”</p>
 <p>“You hear that?”</p>
 <p>Without a choice, I also grabbed the rope.<br>When we pulled on the rope after a count of three, the stone door opened easily.</p>
 <p>The problem was what was inside.<br>As soon as the door was opened, a giant praying mantis jumped out. From its black carapace, I could surmise that it was a fairly high-ranked insect-type monster.<br>Swinging its front legs, the praying mantis charged toward us.<br>However, Chae Nayun took out her sword before the praying mantis could get anywhere near us.<br>Moving faster than light, she slashed out in a clean motion.<br>The magic power extending from her sword cleanly cut the praying mantis’ shoulder.<br>Chae Nayun then kicked the shrieking mantis’ abdomen and slashed at it again as it flew backwards.<br>Swish—<br>A crescent wave of magic power plowed through the ground, obliterating the mantis upon contact.</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun closed her eyes and put her sword back in its scabbard, her short hair softly fluttering from the wind caused by the attack.<br>I blinked several times as I watched her display of power.<br>She was crazy strong.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, thank you!”</p>
 <p>The dwarf NPCs bowed and walked through the door.<br>We probably had to go in as well.</p>
 <p>“…Let’s go.”</p>
 <p>“Take the lead, Kim-ssi.”</p>
 <p>“…Hm.”</p>
 <p>We quickly walked through the stone door.<br>However, what lied past the stone door was completely different than what it looked like from the outside.<br>In the blink of an eye, we found ourselves in a forest, with the dwarves waddling forward. Following the dwarves, we reached a town.</p>
 <p>“Are Towers normally like this?”</p>
 <p>“…Towers have intelligence, so I’m sure they can change their structures however they want.”</p>
 <p>According to my settings, Towers had intelligence exceeding that of humans. The only problem was that the goal of their intelligence wasn’t survival, but another reason.</p>
 <p>“Let’s follow those NPCs. It looks like there are other cadets in the town.”</p>
 <p>“Sure, Kim-ssi.”</p>
 <p>“…Ehew.”</p>
 <p>We followed the NPCs into the town.<br>The town had all sorts of facilities, such as inns, restaurants, and weapon shops. Like I mentioned, there were other cadets here as well.</p>
 <p>“Oh, it’s Nayun!”</p>
 <p>One of the cadets shouted after seeing Chae Nayun.</p>
 <p>“Nayun~~”</p>
 <p>It was a high-ranking supporter, Yi Jiyoon.</p>
 <p>“Yi Jiyoon? What is this place? How do you climb up?”</p>
 <p>Hearing Chae Nayun’s barrage of questions, Yi Jiyoon pointed at the noticeboard in front of the town’s community hall.</p>
 <p>“Take a look at that first.”</p>
 <p>I began to read the noticeboard.<br>Chae Nayun also joined in, standing right beside me.</p>
 <p>[Stage – Dwarven Town]<br>[Dwarves are being terrorized by enemies and are seeking outside help.]<br>[If you would like to join the war effort, please leave a thumbprint here.]<br>[You will be awarded 25 points for every enemy invasion you stop.]<br>[You require 100 points to get to the next stage.]<br>[You will be given bonus points based on your contribution.]</p>
 <p>Once we finished reading, Yi Jiyoon spoke.</p>
 <p>“Hurry up and sign up. It’s the only way you can get points.”</p>
 <p>We promptly left our thumbprints on the noticeboard.<br>It was then.</p>
 <p>“Enemies—!”</p>
 <p>A dwarf standing on the watchtower shouted at the top of his lungs.<br>I turned to the direction the dwarf pointed.<br>Goblin warriors in the front, goblin archers in the middle, and goblin magicians in the back.<br>A group of about 300 goblins was marching forward.</p>
 <p>“Hey! Gather up!”</p>
 <p>Adapting quickly to the situation, Chae Nayun shouted loudly. Soon, all the cadets in the town gathered around her. There were 27 in total 17 warriors, 8 supporters, and 2 sharpshooters including me.<br>After calling everyone over, Chae Nayun seemed to be at a loss for words. I nudged her shoulder.</p>
 <p>“Everyone’s here, Chae-ssi. What should we do?”</p>
 <p>“Um… argh, who cares? They’re just goblins, just fight.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>A brief silence descended.</p>
 <p>“Then I’ll snipe the goblin magicians.”</p>
 <p>“Huh? Oh, sure.”</p>
 <p>I looked around.<br>Sharpshooters wanted to fight from a high ground. Although the town had a watch tower, I wanted somewhere higher. Thankfully, there was a tall 40-meter tree nearby.<br>I ran to the tree and using Parkour, I jumped up and sat down on a large branch.<br>Looking at the goblin magicians in the distance, I took out the cadet handgun.</p>
 <p>“Scan.”</p>
 <p>40%. It wasn’t too bad.<br>The attack power of the cadet handgun was incomparable to the Desert Eagle, but we were fighting goblins, and goblin magicians had especially weak defense.<br>I should be able to instakill them by hitting their heads.</p>
 <p>—Kieeeeek!</p>
 <p>One goblin raised its staff and howled.<br>Was that the leader of the group?<br>I fired at the howling goblin. The bullet drew a clear arc and pierced through the goblin’s head. As soon as I confirmed the goblin leader’s death, I fired at the goblin magicians.</p>
 <p>Each bullet killed one goblin magician, and soon, there were none left on the field.</p>
 <p>“Nice, Kim-ssi! Let’s go, guys!”</p>
 <p>Along with Chae Nayun’s command, the warrior cadets charged forward.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>Once the easy fight ended, the sun set, making this place even more realistic.<br>Chae Nayun and I walked into the town’s restaurant, wondering if we really were in a Tower.</p>
 <p>“So, Chae-ssi, what are you going to eat?”</p>
 <p>“Just fruit juice. By the way, why are you calling me Chae-ssi. It’s kind of annoying.”</p>
 <p>“You started it.”</p>
 <p>“But that doesn’t mean you can do it too.”</p>
 <p>I had no clue what she was saying, so I ignored her.<br>I looked around the restaurant, then turned back to Chae Nayun.<br>She was admiring the sunset with a smile of joy.<br>I let out a bitter sigh with a heavy heart. Then, I called Chae Nayun’s name.</p>
 <p>“Hey, Chae Nayun.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun turned around and faced me.</p>
 <p>“Eh? What’s up, Kim-ssi?”</p>
 <p>“…How’s your oppa doing?”</p>
 <p>Immediately, Chae Nayun made an obscure expression.</p>
 <p>“What, you’re finally worried about him?”</p>
 <p>“No, I’m just wondering. It’s probably the same for everyone else.”</p>
 <p>“Heh, don’t lie. I know you were the first one to be at the hospital. Yeonha told me.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>I stared at Chae Nayun.<br>To be honest… I wanted to ask.<br>I wanted to ask how she would feel if someone killed Chae Jinyoon.<br>But that was a question that shouldn’t be asked, so long as you were human.</p>
 <p>“By the way, Kim-ssi…”</p>
 <p>Seeing me just staring at her, Chae Nayun changed the subject, wriggling her fingers.</p>
 <p>“Was it, um, last week?”</p>
 <p>She stuttered, looking down on the ground.</p>
 <p>“What were you, um, doing with Rachel? At night.”</p>
 <p>Was she calling me Kim-ssi because she was sulking about that? Well, it was true that Rachel and Chae Nayun were rivals.<br>I replied shortly.</p>
 <p>“Training.”</p>
 <p>“Oh…. Why are you training so late?”</p>
 <p>Grumbling, she stuck out her lips.<br>But I was more curious about Chae Jinyoon’s condition.<br>Also, I was curious about Boss’ decision.<br>Would Boss help me?</p>
 <p>“…Also, I heard you’re going on a drive with Kim Suho.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun sure had a lot to say.</p>
 <p>“I like motorcycles more than Kim Suho.”</p>
 <p>“No, that’s…”</p>
 <p>“Let’s go on a trip. I’ll pay for all the expenses.”</p>
 <p>“No, I can’t.”</p>
 <p>“Why? Just tell me why you don’t have time. I’ll fit my schedule for when you’re free.”</p>
 <p>Seeing her throwing a tantrum, I just laughed silently.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>Two nights passed by since the start of the final exam.<br>The first day was spent killing goblins, and the second day was spent killing trolls and yetis.<br>Over these two days, there were three attacks on the Dwarven Town.<br>We successfully blocked them all and obtained 75 points. Apparently, the bonus points would be given out once all four invasions were blocked.</p>
 <p>“…Wow, I guess they saved the best for last.”</p>
 <p>Today was the third day.<br>As expected of the last day, a monster on the level of a middle boss appeared.</p>
 <p>“Uaaak! It’s the Black Ogre!”</p>
 <p>The dwarf on the watchtower ran away screaming.<br>Black Ogre.<br>Seeing the appearance of this mountain-sized ogre, a few cadets turned pale.</p>
 <p>“…For real?”</p>
 <p>“This has to be a prank, right?”</p>
 <p>I watched the Black Ogre carefully.<br>Even the weakest Black Ogre was at the level of an intermediate-rank grade-3 monster. One thing to note was that its endurance was especially strong.<br>In other words, it was the perfect target to test my strength.<br>Now that I had 3 streaks of Stigma, I could add quite a bit of power to my attacks.<br>I tapped Chae Nayun, who was looking up at the giant ogre.</p>
 <p>“Let’s do it like usual. I’ll support from the back, so you guys can kill it.”</p>
 <p>“But against a Black Ogre, a bullet wouldn’t… Eh? You’re using a bow?”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun tilted her head, seeing the bow in my hand.<br>I bought one from Cube just in case I needed it. The cadet handgun was just too weak. I also wanted to raise my rank until it was around rank 100.<br>…And who knew, maybe that ogre was sent by Djinns.</p>
 <p>“You’re going to use magic arrows?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, I can’t keep using a gun forever. Alright, I’m going ahead.”</p>
 <p>“Ah, hey, wait!”</p>
 <p>I climbed up the usual tree and looked down at the Black Ogre.<br>Now that I was up high, I could see that the Black Ogre wasn’t as big as I originally thought.<br>Glaring at it calmly, I pulled the bowstring. Then, I imagined the arrow that would sit on the bowstring.<br>It couldn’t be a normal arrow. The tip had to be jagged to increase its attack power, and the entire arrow had to be perfectly balanced like a spear. I should be able to use the arrow as a weapon itself.</p>
 <p>Ssss—</p>
 <p>Sucking in the surrounding air, Stigma’s magic power gathered around the bowstring.<br>Repeating back and forth between compression and condensation, Stigma’s magic power formed the image of an arrow.<br>It was exactly the same as the arrow I imagined.<br>The attribute I infused was ‘light’.<br>As a result, the arrow shone with a brilliant light.<br>However, I let out a sigh.<br>…This single arrow was all I could make using almost all 3 streaks of Stigma.<br>Of course, that meant its destructive power was unimaginable.</p>
 <p>I pulled the bowstring using all the power I could muster.<br>The light shining from the arrow swirled like a tornado, and the light only grew brighter.<br>After a short breath, I let go of the bowstring.<br>The arrow shot forward like a beam of light. The Black Ogre seemed to have noticed its intense light as it raised its hand to block it.<br>However, the moment the arrow touched its hand… a silent explosion erupted.<br>With no flames or thunderous quakes, only a blinding light blazed, burning the Black Ogre’s flesh.</p>
 <p>—Guooooo</p>
 <p>The Black Ogre’s arm burned white. Its bloodcurdling scream rang out.<br>Although it only lost an arm, it simply couldn’t fight against Chae Nayun and over a dozen other warriors with one arm.<br>Not to mention, Yi Jiyoon had several buffs on Chae Nayun….</p>
 <p>“…Wow.”</p>
 <p>However, Chae Nayun was only blankly looking at the Black Ogre and not trying to charge in.</p>
