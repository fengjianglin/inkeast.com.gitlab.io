 <p><br></p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha glimpsed at the endless sea of monsters in her foggy vision.<br>One, two, three…<br>Again, one, two, three…<br>She couldn’t continue counting for long, as everything felt like a distant dream to her groggy consciousness.<br>However, there was one thing she was sure of. That was that she wouldn’t survive against this army of bloodthirsty monsters.<br>Beast-like creatures growled, baring their black teeth. She hallucinated one of them biting off her neck as her consciousness faded away….</p>
 <p>Soon, when she opened her eyes, she saw a man standing in front of her.</p>
 <p>Beyond him lied an army of monsters.<br>He looked small, like a praying mantis standing in front of a colossal building.<br>He alone shouldn’t be able to withstand that dark sea. But he alone should be able to escape.</p>
 <p>She forced her unmoving arm to move and grabbed onto his sleeve. Then, she spoke faintly.</p>
 <p>—Leave me… and run….</p>
 <p>However, the man didn’t listen to her, and returned a warm look.</p>
 <p>—Don’t worry about it and sleep.</p>
 <p>His deep voice rang out softly along with his warm smile.</p>
 <p>—It’ll be over by the time you wake up.</p>
 <p>His hand reached out and closed her eyes.<br>Her vision went black.<br>Within her closed eyelids, she began to see a world of her dreams.<br>It was the same dream she always had.<br>She had achieved success, and several people were bowing to her. People who ignored and disdained her, people who mocked her clan as being a hunting dog... they were all kneeling in front of her.<br>This was her earnest wish, one that she would have to achieve alone.<br>This was her dream, one that she couldn’t give up on.</p>
 <p>Slowly, she opened her eyes.<br>As darkness faded away and light entered her eyes, she saw his back.<br>She… couldn’t remember his name.<br>In his hands lied an assault rifle, a mass-produced weapon that couldn’t shoot out magic powered spears like spear artifacts or shoot out sword strikes like sword artifacts.<br>An unstoppable army stood in front of this shabby gun.<br>Because of her groggy consciousness, time seemed to flow slowly.<br>The sea of monsters rushed toward him.<br>Beasts running on four legs, orcs charging on two legs, spiders scuttling on eight legs, snakes crawling without legs, birds flapping their wings, one-eyed cyclops shooting out magic.<br>All these demonic beasts formed a single tidal wave, rushing forward, ready to devour and tear apart everything.</p>
 <p>Against this raging wave, the man raised his gun.<br>Immediately, a flash of light erupted against the black hail. White brilliance began to rage fiercely, his bullets turned the world white as it pushed back against the black wave.<br>The foreheads of beasts.<br>The hearts of orcs.<br>The abdomens of spiders.<br>The mouths of snakes.<br>The eyes of cyclops.<br>His bullets pierced through their vital points meticulously, and the fearsome wave continued to be pushed back.<br>The barrage of bullets never stopped.<br>An endless rain of bullets tore the limbs of monsters apart. Slowly, corpses stacked up, forming a mountain.<br>His perfect marksmanship didn’t allow a single attack or a single monster to approach him.</p>
 <p>He was decimating the army of monsters alone.</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha felt an incomprehensible coziness.<br>She realized how relaxing it was to be protected by someone.<br>Just like he said, she calmed down.<br>Then, she slowly closed her eyes.<br>Kim Hajin.<br>Before she even noticed, his name had entered her mind once again.<br>She hoped that when she opened her eyes again... she would be even more relaxed.</p>
 <p><br>**<br><br></p>
 <p>Kim Suho swung his branch. In that instant, his magic power formed a crescent-shaped arc that stormed forward. Yoo Dongsuk managed to block it with his steel pipe, but his subordinates were sent flying far behind him.<br>With no one left to interfere, Kim Suho charged toward Yoo Dongsuk.<br>Yoo Dongsuk asked as he swung down his steel pipe.</p>
 <p>“…Is it true?”</p>
 <p>After lightly parrying the steel pipe, Kim Suho replied.</p>
 <p>“What is?”</p>
 <p>“That the person left behind is stronger than you.”</p>
 <p>Kim Suho smiled, finding it funny that this was his question.</p>
 <p>“…I don’t like lying.”</p>
 <p>Of course, Kim Suho couldn’t be sure as he had only sparred with Kim Hajin once.<br>However, he believed.<br>He believed that Hajin would succeed.</p>
 <p>“That’s not good for—”</p>
 <p>“Kuaaaa!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a horrible shriek rang out.<br>Kim Suho and Yoo Dongsuk both glanced sideways.<br>Shin Jonghak was brandishing his spear, causing a mess. Although he looked a bit ridiculous, the result was outstanding. He freely mixed stabs and slashes, fluidly and viciously attacking his enemies. In a way, he looked like an ancient warlord.<br>Seeing his subordinates getting sent flying, Yoo Dongsuk asked.</p>
 <p>“…Is he as strong as you?”</p>
 <p>Kim Suho simply smiled in response.<br>Although he didn’t speak, silence served as an answer.<br>Yoo Dongsuk also laughed heartily as he swung his steel pipe.<br><em>KWANG!</em><br>His steel pipe clashed with Kim Suho’s branch, both sides pushing against each other without hesitation. Their tug-of-war continued, forming somewhat of a balance between them.</p>
 <p>“…Well, it looks like our strategy failed.”</p>
 <p>“It’s not too late to turn back. There’s no reason for us to fight.”</p>
 <p>Amidst the fierce battle, the two men stared into each other’s eyes and spoke.</p>
 <p>“The one you’re calling Boss isn’t human, but a Djinn… uh, he’s an evil person who’s using the power of a ghost.”</p>
 <p>The concept of Djinns didn’t exist at this point in history. According to the textbooks, the rise of Djinns only happened in the late 1990s.</p>
 <p>“…Huup!”</p>
 <p>Yoo Dongsuk pushed Kim Suho back without replying.<br>Kim Suho sighed somewhat reluctantly as he enveloped his sword with magic power. The sword’s blue glow transformed into a brilliant gold.</p>
 <p>“You were hiding a rather interesting power, eh?”</p>
 <p>However, the same applied to Yoo Dongsuk. His body suddenly glowed red, and suddenly grew several times bigger.<br>Kim Suho put on a serious expression as he fixed his stance.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>At first, it was only laughable. Seeing the young man’s overgrown hair and beard, Asura felt nothing but pity.<br>But as time went by and his army dwindled in number, Asura began to feel fear.<br>He could feel a chilling killing intent from the young man’s eyes, and the outpouring bullets seemed to overwhelm him.</p>
 <p>Even now, Asura’s army was rushing toward him nonstop. He also didn’t forget to sneak in long ranged attacks.<br>However, the demonic beasts’ venom and teeth were blocked by the magic power reinforcement of his mysterious bracelet, and monsters that specialized in long ranged attacks only became first-priority targets for his bullets to kill.</p>
 <p>Asura couldn’t understand what was going on.<br>When he saw the young man take out an assault rifle, he thought he would only have to wait until his magazine emptied once.<br>However, the unloading, loading, and refiring process took him less than a second to perform. There wasn’t a single exploitable opening.</p>
 <p>But what Asura couldn’t understand the most was his bullets’ destructive power.<br>The instantaneous wind pressure created from the moment of firing scattered magic power, and Asura's demonic beasts disappeared the moment they were hit. A single bullet often killed two demonic beasts, and there were several instances where a single bullet killed three.<br>Asura’s demonic beasts were being slaughtered by the young man’s bullets.<br>Not even a single claw of his army could reach the gunman.</p>
 <p>“Impossible….”</p>
 <p>As Asura watched this incomprehensible battle in a daze, the once countless number of beasts became countable.<br>Asura stopped his remaining forces from advancing and took a step back.<br>He wanted to assess the situation more carefully.</p>
 <p>When the army stopped, Kim Hajin also stopped firing. Then, he murmured tiredly.</p>
 <p>“Since you can summon so many of them… you must have merged with the ghost. What did he want? Revenge? Wealth? Honor?”</p>
 <p>Kim Hajin stared at Asura, who remained silent.<br>He aimed his gun at Asura.</p>
 <p>“You don’t really have to answer that.”</p>
 <p><em>Click.</em><br>Kim Hajin pulled the trigger. Asura unleashed his magic power, forming a barrier. At the same time, dozens of demonic beasts moved to block Kim Hajin’s line of fire.<br>However, no bullets came out.<br><em>Click. Click. Click.</em><br>Kim Hajin pulled the trigger a few more times.<br>However, the result was the same.</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p><em>Whish.</em><br>A brief wind blew. Asura and Kim Hajin stared at each other for a moment.<br>Kim Hajin rummaged through his pocket, but he was out of ammo. He then spoke graciously with a calm expression.</p>
 <p>“…But Asura, I don’t really hate you for it. In fact, I kind of understand where you’re coming from.”</p>
 <p>A character with no background story, a stepping stone for the main characters and the supporting cast. An extra, rather than a villain.<br>Asura, or rather Cheonhwa, became a Djinn for a simple reason.</p>
 <p>“That’s how I created you.”</p>
 <p>That was why Kim Hajin felt sorry. Even if he truly didn’t feel sorry, he needed to feel sorry at the moment.</p>
 <p>“You probably had no other choice to become strong. By merging with the ghost, you probably thought you could become a Djinn who would enjoy wealth and honor, leaving your name behind in the world….”</p>
 <p>Kim Hajin sounded sentimental all of a sudden.<br>Asura responded with just one sentence.</p>
 <p>“…You’re out of bullets.”</p>
 <p>“I’m not.”</p>
 <p>Kim Hajin took out a single magazine from his pocket. He slowly reloaded his gun and asked.</p>
 <p>“I want to know. What kind of a life have you lived?”</p>
 <p>A smile emerged on Asura’s face.</p>
 <p>“…It’s empty.”</p>
 <p>“What? Can’t you see this?”</p>
 <p>Kim Hajin tapped on the magazine loaded into his gun, but Asura retorted leisurely.</p>
 <p>“Then shoot.”</p>
 <p>“…Tsk.”</p>
 <p>The moment he clicked his tongue, the assault rifle transformed into a handgun.<br><em>Tang, tang, tang, tang, tang—!</em><br>Then, Kim Hajin quickly pulled the trigger.<br>A whole magazine was used up in less than a second, and the monsters protecting Asura were reduced to dust.<br>Asura flinched in shock.</p>
 <p>“See? I’m not lying. Plus, this story already ended on a cliché.”</p>
 <p>He pointed behind Asura.<br>Kim Suho and the others were standing there.<br>Asura’s subordinates were also standing there, giving Asura complicated looks.</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Asura looked around with a blank look.<br>He had wasted too much time dealing with a single person.<br>It was clear that there was no chance of victory.<br>Now, he only had about a hundred demonic beasts, along with a partner that resided in his heart.</p>
 <p>“…Uk!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, his heart beat violently.<br>The ghost of the past was telling him something.<br>Asura shook his head.<br>However, in the next moment, his body twisted strangely, and the ghost shot out of his heart.<br>Then, Asura’s body disappeared from the world, removed by the ghost.</p>
 <p>—….</p>
 <p>A black ghost floated in the air, making intimidating gestures with eerie howls. However, a formless being couldn’t pose any threat.<br>Kim Suho brought Misteltein up to the ghost’s body, and the ghost was instantly sucked into the divine-grade weapon. Misteltein grew stronger by absorbing spirits. The ghost of the past would now continue to stay inside Misteltein for eternity.</p>
 <p>A short silence descended.<br>Kim Suho, Shin Jonghak, Chae Nayun, and Yi Yeonghan stared at the scenery spread out in front of them.<br>Kim Hajin was standing alone, amidst a desolate battlefield with a mountain of corpses.<br>Soon, his clear voice rang out.</p>
 <p>“Welcome back.”</p>
 <p>Kim Hajin smiled at the four of them, who came back before it was too late.<br>Everyone’s gazes became focused on him. Kim Suho’s eyes carried trust, while other eyes carried shock.</p>
 <p>“…W-What?”</p>
 <p>Kim Hajin couldn’t understand the meaning of the looks he received at first, but he soon realized.<br>The cause was the mountain of corpses in front of him.</p>
 <p>“Oh… this? T-These will disappear soon.”</p>
 <p>Since the magic power connection was cut off, the corpses would disappear in about two minutes.<br>However, the onlookers’ shocked expressions didn’t disappear for a while.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>I didn’t ask Kim Suho how he convinced the people of the past. Although the story took a different direction than the original story’s, the result was more or less similar.<br>That was enough for me.<br>I sat down on the ground, feeling exhausted and dizzy.<br>I wasn’t physically fatigued, even after using all 900 bullets. However, I was mentally taxed.<br>I turned on my smartwatch, looking to see messages that would alleviate my exhaustion.</p>
 <p>[You massacred a large number of enemies! You receive a huge experience boost in Master Sharpshooter!]<br>[You pierced the vital points of countless enemies! Master Sharpshooter evolves to grade 5!]<br>[Luck applies! By decimating thousands of darkness attribute demonic beasts, understanding of the darkness attribute has been added to Aether!]<br>[You obtain 330 SP!]</p>
 <p>“Wow.”</p>
 <p>There were several new alerts.<br>Master Sharpshooter leveled up to grade 5, but the best gain was Aether’s understanding of the darkness attribute.<br>Understanding of an attribute was a great reward, especially when it came to Aether.<br>When Aether fuses with the Desert Eagle, Aether’s understanding of an attribute would also apply to the Desert Eagle. That was also why my bullets let out white flashes.<br>Of course, attribute bullets created with SP were much more powerful than ordinary bullets used with Aether’s understanding of an attribute.</p>
 <p>“…What?”</p>
 <p>I couldn’t think properly because of my surroundings. Chae Nayun, Shin Jonghak, and Yi Yeonghan kept giving me suspicious looks.</p>
 <p>“I mean, it doesn’t make sense.”</p>
 <p>“What doesn’t make sense?”</p>
 <p>I shrugged in response to Chae Nayun’s question.</p>
 <p>“…Stop kidding around.”</p>
 <p>However, Chae Nayun was serious. She looked somewhat wronged.<br>I grinned, then took out the Desert Eagle transformed into the assault rifle form. Chae Nayun’s eyes, as well as Shin Jonghak’s and Yi Yeonghan’s eyes, widened. They were clearly wondering where I got such a weapon.</p>
 <p>“I told you. I have a gun-related Gift. I was just a good match for Asura.”</p>
 <p>“Good match?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah. Against a large number of weaker opponents, pulling the trigger 2000 times is easier than swinging a spear or a sword 2000 times.”</p>
 <p>After giving a brief explanation, I turned to Kim Suho, who was resting nearby, and asked.</p>
 <p>“Did you bring the crystals?”</p>
 <p>“Ah, yeah.”</p>
 <p>Kim Suho handed me three crystals.</p>
 <p>“Are we going back now?”</p>
 <p>I shook my head in response.</p>
 <p>“No, we’re going to return these crystals where they belong.”</p>
 <p>“…Huh?”</p>
 <p>“This is the greatest training area you could ask for, so we’re going to stay here for the next two weeks. It would be a shame to leave before we milk it dry.”</p>
 <p>In a way, this place was an inferior version of the Hyperbolic Time Chamber.<br>We should be able to grow stronger here.</p>
 <p>“We have plenty of people to spar.”</p>
 <p>I pointed at Asura’s past subordinates, who were standing behind us awkwardly.</p>
