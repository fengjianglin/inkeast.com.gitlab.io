 <p><br></p>
 <p>—Nayun, your father was afraid that you would find out about Jinyoon’s secret. That’s why he hid his corpse from you.</p>
 <p>Kim Joongho showed Chae Jinyoon’s corpse to Chae Nayun. The corpse was kept in an ice coffin, which Kim Joongho said was a magical artifact used for preserving dead bodies. Although the corpse didn’t have a head, Chae Nayun could tell that it was Chae Jinyoon.</p>
 <p>Looking at Chae Jinyoon’s corpse, Chae Nayun clutched her chest. She trembled from the depths of her heart.</p>
 <p>—Jinyoon was already engulfed in great evil. His right arm is proof.</p>
 <p>Kim Joongho pointed at Chae Jinyoon’s right arm, which was now entirely black. The demonic energy in his right arm didn’t subside even after his death and continued to undulate ominously in the ice coffin.</p>
 <p>—….</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun couldn’t say anything.<br>Chae Jinyoon, her beloved older brother, was a devil? Who could believe such a ridiculous story?<br>Faced with the unbearable truth, Chae Nayun agonized in pain. Her head hurt, like someone was pounding it with a hammer.</p>
 <p>Kim Joongho waited for a long time for her to calm down.</p>
 <p>—…Then, what, what happened?</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun cried for a long time and finally mustered the courage to ask. Kim Joongho fell in thought. Would she be able to handle the truth?</p>
 <p>—Tell me.</p>
 <p>However, Chae Nayun’s voice carried a strong determination. She had plowed through the tough mountain range, defeated vicious monsters, and even persuaded the Nine Star with the heart of steel to arrive at this place.<br>It was all to discover the truth.</p>
 <p>—…Understood.</p>
 <p>Kim Joongho nodded. He felt like he shouldn’t hide anything from the girl who had now become an adult.</p>
 <p>—…I do not know who killed Jinyoon. But that person must have known that a devil was inside Jinyoon’s body. After all, he would have needed to prepare an appropriate weapon to kill a devil.</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun listened to Kim Joongho in a daze. His clear voice rang in her ears.</p>
 <p>—And… Jinyoon must have accepted his death as well.</p>
 <p>But Chae Nayun couldn’t accept this. She glared at Kim Joongho and yelled.</p>
 <p>—H-How do you know that!?</p>
 <p><em>Oppa promised to be by my side forever, he swore he would never leave me, it was thanks to him that I came back alive and lived on after Mother’s death…</em></p>
 <p>—H-How could anyone…</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun asked while crying.</p>
 <p>—….</p>
 <p>Kim Joongho didn’t say anything. He sympathized with Chae Nayun.<br>As a father who lost his beloved wife and daughter and as a forensic pathologist who had pride in his work, Kim Joongho pointed at Chae Nayun’s right shoulder.</p>
 <p>—There’s a saying that the dead don’t talk. That’s false. A corpse has more stories to tell than you think.</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun’s eyes also fell on Chae Jinyoon’s body. The muscles in the shoulder area connected to his devilized right arm were completely dead.</p>
 <p>—His shoulder blade is broken, and the muscles there are thoroughly destroyed. This is an injury resulting from Chae Jinyoon’s will, his attempt to stop his right arm from moving.</p>
 <p>Kim Joongho continued solemnly.</p>
 <p>—I can only imagine the great willpower Jinyoon must have had. He didn’t yield to evil and resisted until the very end… That’s what this means.</p>
 <p>…Chae Nayun’s knees buckled and she fell on the ground.<br>She reached out to Chae Jinyoon’s corpse while crying, but the ice coffin prevented her from touching him. The coldness of the ice made her cry even louder.</p>
 <p>—This also shows that whoever killed Jinyoon hesitated greatly. As I said before, I don’t know who killed Jinyoon. But if he didn’t hesitate, Jinyoon wouldn’t have received such an injury.</p>
 <p>With that, Kim Joongho put a jacket over Chae Nayun. Although he was forced to hide in this mountain because of Chae Joochul, he didn’t hate Chae Joochul’s granddaughter for it.</p>
 <p>—Chae Jinyoon and the person who killed him. I suspect that they were equally in pain.</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun cried while holding Chae Jinyoon in her arms. Her tears fell on the coffin and froze. Her regrets, resentments, and sorrows all came together to form a cold ice crystal.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>“…Nayun, Nayun! Are you okay?”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha quickly ran to her mansion’s front entrance. Chae Nayun was standing under the pouring rain. Yoo Yeonha tried to let her in.</p>
 <p>“Did, did you already know?”</p>
 <p>However, Chae Nayun didn’t move an inch. She asked while glaring at Yoo Yeonha. Her wet, disheveled hair blocked her eyes.<br>Yoo Yeonha was shocked, but she quickly regained her composure and grabbed Chae Nayun’s wrist.</p>
 <p>“First, come in.”</p>
 <p>“No.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun snatched her hand out.</p>
 <p>“I’m asking you, Yeonha… if you already knew.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun’s trembling voice touched Yoo Yeonha’s heart. Yoo Yeonha stared at Chae Nayun with downcast eyes. Chae Nayun was crying, her tears flowing down along with the rain.</p>
 <p>“…Yeah.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha nodded. She wanted to pretend she didn’t know. Many excuses popped up in her head, but she cast them all aside. She didn’t want to make the same mistake she did with Kim Hajin. She wanted to acknowledge the truth, not give any excuses.</p>
 <p>“If you did, then why didn’t you say anything?”</p>
 <p>“…Nayun.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun’s body began to tremble violently. Yoo Yeonha first formed an umbrella with her magic power and stopped the pouring rain. Chae Nayun then buried her face in Yoo Yeonha’s chest.</p>
 <p>“Why didn’t you tell me? Why? I, I feel like I’m going to die right now….”</p>
 <p>“…Nayun.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha patted Chae Nayun’s back and continued sorrowfully.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry… I’ll… explain everything….”</p>
 <p>Since Nayun mustered up the courage to seek the truth, it was time for me to tell her everything. The fact that Kim Hajin was a Returner, the full account of the Kwang-Oh Incident, and how that person died.</p>
 <p>“So first… come inside.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha gently led Chae Nayun into the mansion.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>…In a faraway world in a different plane than Earth.</p>
 <p>The Akatrina Continent was home to nine nations: four kingdoms, two principalities, and three island states.<br>Kim Suho was born in the outskirts of the Plerion Kingdom, the most powerful nation among them. No, perhaps he was born in another country. His exact origin was unknown as he was a child abandoned by his parents.</p>
 <p>The nameless and faceless parents abandoned their child in a remote temple of the Plerion Kingdom. In this poor, rural temple, the child grew up healthy and happy.</p>
 <p>Under the kind words and affectionate teachings of the temple’s priests, the child was able to awaken his Sword Saint Gift.</p>
 <p>When he was four years old, he learned the continent’s wide-spread basic swordsmanship, and when he was five, he single-handedly defeated three kobolds who sneaked into the temple.</p>
 <p>The priests didn’t want such a gifted child to rot in a rural temple. They gathered what little money they had and sent him to the kingdom’s capital. With their help, the child was able to become an apprentice knight of the Royal Knights at the age of six.</p>
 <p>However, the child’s story ended there. It was because life on the Akatrina Continent went extinct only four years later.</p>
 <p>“…Ah.”</p>
 <p>Kim Suho opened his eyes in nostalgia. It seemed he fell asleep after sending Kim Hajin off.<br>It had been a while since he dreamt of his homeland. The happy childhood he spent in the temple and the marvelous royal palace he saw flashed before his eyes.</p>
 <p>“Huu….”</p>
 <p>A sigh left his mouth naturally.<br>Today, he had talked to Kim Hajin about his past.<br>The world he used to live in, the calamity known as ‘Demon Realm Transformation’ that descended on his world, the death he faced when he was only 11 years old, and waking up as ‘Kim Suho’ in a world called Earth.</p>
 <p>Kim Hajin believed in what could easily be construed as a mere fantasy.</p>
 <p>“Should I not have told him…?”</p>
 <p>Kim Suho felt refreshed but also regretful.<br>He never planned on living his life without telling anyone about it. But he wanted to be a good son for his current parents. The original Kim Suho had died at a young age and the current Kim Suho’s soul had taken over his body. His parents didn’t know this, of course, but Kim Suho was thankful for the love he received from them.</p>
 <p>Kim Suho clenched his fists and looked up at the ceiling.<br>‘Demon Realm Transformation.’<br>The tragedy caused by this calamity resurfaced on the white ceiling.</p>
 <p>The Demon Realm Transformation began in the central region of the continent. It corrupted the soil, killed the livestock, and polluted the water to prevent humans from living. ‘Demons’ didn’t need to participate. Five of the nine nations fell from an unprecedented famine, and the remaining four nations waged war with each other to steal food.</p>
 <p>It was the bloodiest and longest war in the history of the continent, one that quickened the fall of the continent by at least 50 years.</p>
 <p>“…You’re awake.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, a cold voice woke him up. Kim Suho turned around and saw the Witch facing him. Kim Suho asked her.</p>
 <p>“Is the Demon King here?”</p>
 <p>The Witch nodded silently.<br>Kim Suho raised his body and infused magic power into the equipment Kim Hajin made for him. The equipment resonated with his magic power and stuck to his body. Even the Witch was surprised by the battle equipment adorning Kim Suho.</p>
 <p>“Follow me.”</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>Kim Suho followed the Witch into the hallway. While walking through the long silk pathway, he began to ask the questions he had in his mind.</p>
 <p>“…I have a question I want to ask.”</p>
 <p>“Go ahead.”</p>
 <p>The Witch immediately answered.</p>
 <p>“Have you heard of Demon Realm Transformation?”</p>
 <p>“It’s the phenomenon in which human territory transforms into the Demon Realm. The King’s Demon Realm Transformation extends to the 16th floor. If there are no more challengers worthy of his attention, he plans on expanding this range further.”</p>
 <p>“…Then I guess I have to win.”</p>
 <p>The Witch didn’t react in any way to Kim Suho’s bold remark.</p>
 <p>“Kuhum, there’s actually another question I want to ask.”</p>
 <p>“…Go ahead.”</p>
 <p>The Witch narrowed her eyes. Kim Suho walked while looking forward and asked.</p>
 <p>“Will the Demon Realm Transformation… happen on Earth?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>The Witch replied in a monotone voice. She made it sound as though it was the most natural thing.<br>Kim Suho clenched his teeth. The Witch’s answer was one that he expected to hear. After all, Towers and Dungeons were harbingers of the Demon Realm Transformation. It was the same for his home world, Akatrina.<br>Kim Suho nodded calmly.</p>
 <p>“I see.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>The Witch glanced at Kim Suho and asked.</p>
 <p>“Do you plan on stopping it?”</p>
 <p>Having been asked a question with such an obvious answer, Kim Suho burst into laughter. This was his way of answering her.</p>
 <p>“Of course.”</p>
 <p>This answer didn’t come from an arrogant sense of duty that only he was capable of stopping the world’s end.<br>He simply wanted to protect the people precious to him, the world he grew up in, and the feelings he held dear. Hoping that this beautiful blue world wouldn’t turn out like his old home, he planned to risk his life to protect it.</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>The Witch didn’t respond. Her steps stopped soon after. They arrived in front of a huge door.</p>
 <p>Kim Suho stood a step behind the Witch. The Witch turned around and stared at the Hero. The Hero also stared back at the Witch.</p>
 <p>“…Go in. I will be watching to see how long you can last.”</p>
 <p>“Okay. You can look forward to it.”</p>
 <p>Kim Suho smiled brightly. The Witch stared at him for a long time before nodding.</p>
 <p>…For the record, in the original story Kim Hajin wrote, the Witch fell in love with Kim Suho.<br><br></p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p><br>[Central Asia – Chameleon Troupe’s Base]</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, I returned to the Chameleon Troupe’s base of operations. The place looked a lot scarier than I remembered it to be. Of course, in Pandemonium, a building looking fancy and pretty only made it a target for attacks, so the hideout was located deep underground.</p>
 <p>“There are five floors below ground?”</p>
 <p>“Yep~ This is your room. How’s the interior decoration?”</p>
 <p>Jain asked with a blooming smile.<br>We were currently inside a room labeled ‘Black Residence’. Simply put, it was Black Lotus’ office.</p>
 <p>“It’s great. Should I bring the Goblin Tablet from the cave?”</p>
 <p>“No, leave the goblins there. We’ll use that cave as our secondary base.”</p>
 <p>“Okay.”</p>
 <p><em>Kiik—</em> At that moment, the sound of a door opening rang out. Glancing to the side, I saw a pair of eyes peeking at us from behind the door. The round, black eyes obviously belonged to Boss.</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>She was staring at me while hiding. She then began to roll her eyes, as if to search for me inside the room. I smirked, then walked over and yanked the door open.</p>
 <p>“Ah!”</p>
 <p>Boss jumped in surprise.<br>She blinked her eyes then let out a dry cough before nonchalantly entering the room.<br>I was happy to see Boss after a long time.</p>
 <p>“It’s been a while, Boss.”</p>
 <p>“…Yeah. You were away for too long.”</p>
 <p>“I had something to do in the Tower.”</p>
 <p>“…You only left a letter.”</p>
 <p>I smiled at the grumbling Boss.</p>
 <p>“Come sit.”</p>
 <p>I didn’t know what this room was exactly for, but it had chairs and a desk. I led Boss to one of the chairs. Boss, who spotted Jain, kicked the chair she was sitting on.</p>
 <p>“Jain, why are you here alone without telling me?”</p>
 <p>“You said not to wake you up when you’re sleeping~”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>Boss sat down without saying anything in response. I sat down next to her. Perhaps because we hadn’t met in some time, Boss scooched to the side somewhat awkwardly.<br>I began a conversation to resolve the awkwardness.</p>
 <p>“How are things going recently?”</p>
 <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
 <p>“About the humanoid monsters.”</p>
 <p>“Mm, that—“</p>
 <p>“Ah~ that~?”</p>
 <p>Boss tried to say something, but Jain interrupted her.</p>
 <p>“It’s a mess. It looks like they sent envoys to most of the Djinn groups, including Evil Society and Satan’s Servants.”</p>
 <p>“…Mm.”</p>
 <p>So far, nothing was new. The Monster King Orden wished to conquer all of Earth, so he sent envoys to both humans and Djinns alike.<br>Of course, humans couldn’t possibly accept Orden’s offer.</p>
 <p>“Also, Hajin.”</p>
 <p>Boss looked at me and said.</p>
 <p>“Yes?”</p>
 <p>“Your revenge is under way.”</p>
 <p>“Revenge… Ah, him?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, that insect bastard.”</p>
 <p>Boss muttered in a voice full of rage.<br>In truth, I was worried about Kurukuru as well. He was simply too powerful.</p>
 <p>“But don’t push yourself too much.”</p>
 <p>I shook my head. Kurukuru was a tough opponent even for Boss. In fact, not many people could take him on easily.</p>
 <p>“Rather than taking revenge on that guy, it’s better for Boss to stay safe.”</p>
 <p>I stared at Boss with a gentle smile. I did it without much thought because I had not seen her in a while.</p>
 <p>“…Y-Yeah, o-okay.”</p>
 <p>But Boss’ eyes began to shake. Her white skin became slightly flushed. Her overreaction made me think…</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry about it too much, Hajin~”</p>
 <p>Jain interrupted my thought.</p>
 <p>“We put a curse on him.”</p>
 <p>“A curse?”</p>
 <p>“Yep. Remember the arm Boss got from him?”</p>
 <p>“…Ah~”</p>
 <p>I just remembered. Kurukuru’s right arm. Or was it his left arm? In any case, I was planning on turning it into a weapon.</p>
 <p>“He’s probably dying as we speak. At the very least, he won’t be as fast as before.”</p>
 <p>“Mm, that’s good to know.”</p>
 <p>Even still, the threat Orden possessed didn’t decrease by a bit. Orden was a wicked one for sure.</p>
 <p>Unlike normal monsters, Orden didn’t try to solve everything by force. His weapon was his wily intelligence and overwhelming wealth.</p>
 <p>Orden possessed all of the resources in Africa. He was arguably the wealthiest individual in the world, and he would use this to obstruct governments, corporations, and Heroes.</p>
 <p>“Oh, I need to go somewhere now.”</p>
 <p>I slowly got up. I just came back to Earth, so I had a lot to do. Out of habit, I looked down at my left wrist. However, the smartwatch wasn’t there.</p>
 <p>“…Oh right.”</p>
 <p>‘My smartwatch burned up when I obtained my fifth streak of Stigma. It feels weird not having it on me.’</p>
 <p>“Where are you going now? You only just came back.”</p>
 <p>Boss pouted and pulled on my sleeve.</p>
 <p>“Oh, I have work to do.”</p>
 <p>I didn’t have time to waste. If Orden sent envoys, a few corrupt politicians should have taken his bait.<br>I began to put on Black Lotus’ outfit when Boss asked again.</p>
 <p>“Work?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, work.”</p>
 <p>I planned to find out those who betrayed humanity with the Book of Truth and execute them.<br>I should start with the politicians in Korea who accepted Orden’s bribery. If left alone, I didn’t know what they’d do to Kim Suho, who would clear the Tower of Wish, or Yoo Yeonha, who was leading Essence of the Strait.</p>
 <p>After taking out the trash, it would be Evandel’s time to shine.</p>
 <p>‘But before that… I should visit Yoo Yeonha and get myself a new smartwatch.’</p>
 <p>I planned my next course of action.</p>
 <p>“…I’m going too.”</p>
 <p>Boss also stood up.</p>
 <p>“You stay here, Boss.”</p>
 <p>“No, who knows when that mantis will show up again.”</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>“Damned mantis. I’ll kill you for sure if you appear again….” Boss murmured seriously.</p>
 <p>Looking at Boss’ expression, I thought, ‘…Well, it wouldn’t hurt to be with Boss.’</p>
 <p>I replied, “Sure. Feel free.”</p>
