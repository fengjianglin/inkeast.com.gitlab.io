 <p>[Kim Hajin’s Apartment]</p>
 <p>I carefully placed the Black Lotus Uniform and the Desert Eagle on the couch. After longingly staring at them for a while, I looked inside the box again to see if there was anything else.<br>A small, black box was tucked away on the bottom. A box inside a box? I tilted my head as I unwrapped it.</p>
 <p>“Mm?”</p>
 <p>Inside the black box was a smartwatch and a small envelope.<br>I first took out the smartwatch. Both the strap and the case were decorated with obsidian, giving it a luxurious look. It was the same high-tech watch that Yoo Yeonha specially created for me.</p>
 <p>I tried turning it on, and it functioned properly. It had no problem recognizing me as its owner either. I could immediately see the [Kim Hajin]’s ID along with my bank accounts, stock accounts, and other personal assets stored in the [User Wallet].</p>
 <p>I first checked how much money I had.</p>
 <p>“Eh?”</p>
 <p>The wealth stored in the accounts was more than I thought. It was to the point that a surprised gasp escaped my mouth.<br>Just my bank account alone held 30 million won. In terms of stocks, I had 10 shares of Essential Pharmacy, 10 shares of Essential Dynamics, 10 shares of Essence of the Strait - all totaling to 60 million won.<br>It was faaaaaaaar less than what I had before, but I was still extremely grateful.</p>
 <p>“….”</p>
 <p>But looking at my stock holdings, I suddenly remembered something from the past.<br>Whenever Boss was sulking or down, I would sell her my stocks. As Essence of the Strait’s unlisted stocks were trustworthy assets that were hard to acquire even with money, they were the medicine for elevating Boss’s mood.<br>Even though she always said she didn’t need them, the corners of her mouth would twitch up and her face would redden. She really couldn’t be cuter if she tried.</p>
 <p>“…Tsk.”</p>
 <p>But when my thoughts reached this point, I had no choice but to put my smartwatch down.<br>The ripples caused by old memories spread to form a huge wave.</p>
 <p>Feeling like I might lose consciousness, I leaned against the couch and sank deeper into reminiscence.<br>I began to miss everyone too much - Evandel and Rachel, Chae Nayun and Kim Suho, Yoo Yeonha and Boss., and even the friends and family who should be in my homeworld.</p>
 <p>Well, I didn’t have any close friends, but I really did want to see my mom and dad. I couldn’t even imagine how they would feel once they found out I was gone.</p>
 <p>‘But don’t worry. I made this decision myself. Since this world’s time flows differently, even if I die of old age, less than 100 days would have passed there….’</p>
 <p>I found myself justifying my choice.</p>
 <p>“…Eubebebebebe.”</p>
 <p>I slapped my cheeks. Since I decided not to regret my decision, I couldn’t just stay here so pathetically.</p>
 <p>I forced myself up and put on the Black Lotus Uniform. Because I got a little shorter, the tail edge of the uniform touched the ground. But the moment I thought this- <em>whish!</em>- the uniform automatically shrunk to fit my body.</p>
 <p>It seemed the functionalities I added to the uniform were still there.</p>
 <p>“Hm.”</p>
 <p>I looked at myself in a full-length mirror before storing the Desert Eagle in the holster. The Desert Eagle was extremely light.<br>I then sat down on the couch. It was time to think about what to do from now.<br>But because I couldn’t come up with anything, I picked up my smartwatch to surf the Internet.</p>
 <p>“…She said it had Internet connection, right?”</p>
 <p>I remembered Yoo Yeonha bragging to me about it in the past - that this smartwatch was higher-tech than most high-tech computers on the market.</p>
 <p>I placed the smartwatch on the table and changed to the desktop mode. A hologram keyboard and a monitor projected themselves into the air.<br>While I was browsing through web portals, a certain website caught my attention.</p>
 <p>It was a webnovel site.</p>
 <p>When I saw it, a smile emerged on my face.</p>
 <p>“…Should I write a novel?”</p>
 <p>If I wrote the past ten or so years I’ve experienced as a novel…. No, it probably wouldn’t be that fun.<br>I had no plans to write another novel ever again.</p>
 <p>I threw the thought away and began to search for other websites, mainly focusing on job boards.<br>I wanted to work. At the very least, I wanted to feel that ‘I was alive’.</p>
 <p>[Welcome to Korea’s biggest mercenary website - Desert Soul.]<br>[Open Recruitment for Mercenaries]<br>[Mission Requests]<br>[Check/Cancel Missions]</p>
 <p>“Mercenary?”</p>
 <p>This was quite tempting. I had the Desert Eagle for offense and the Black Lotus Uniform for defense. It should be difficult for most attacks to penetrate the uniform’s defensive power.<br>However, the problem was my lackluster sharpshooting ability.<br>I also didn’t want to jump back into the midst of battle when I only barely managed to escape from it.</p>
 <p>“Oh right, there was something else.”</p>
 <p>I approached the black box again, remembering the small envelope that came with the smartwatch.<br>The envelope was thick as if it had a letter.</p>
 <p>“Let’s see….”</p>
 <p>Feeling lonely, I muttered to myself as I tore open the envelope.</p>
 <p>“Huh?”</p>
 <p>From the envelope, a small water droplet fell down and clung to my body. I was surprised at first, but I immediately became grateful.</p>
 <p>I recognized this water droplet.<br>It was the ‘formless’ weapon that was neither a fluid nor a solid and was the first Unique-ranked item I ever obtained in this world.</p>
 <p>Although it was far smaller than what it was in the past, this was, without a doubt, Aether.</p>
 <p>“It’s nice to see you again.”</p>
 <p>I stopped myself from tearing up at Aether’s familiar sensation and accepted it. Aether stuck to my body like glue.<br>But even after Aether popped out, the envelope remained thick.<br>Wondering if there was something else inside, I peeked into it.<br>There was a paper inside.</p>
 <p>“This is….”</p>
 <p>I reached into the envelope with my fingers and pulled out the paper. On the surface of this coupon-like paper were words written in strange handwriting.</p>
 <p>[Physique Acquisition Coupon - Medicinal Memory Physique]</p>
 <p>“…Pft.”</p>
 <p>The moment I saw it, laughter escaped my mouth. It was a happy, pleasant kind of laughter.<br>It seemed this was the last gift the co-author left for me.</p>
 <p>But I didn’t know why it was [Medicinal Memory Physique]. Why wasn’t it Master Sharpshooter, Magic Dysfunction Physique, Random Consolidation System, or Parkour?<br>Well, I couldn’t really complain.<br>Since this was the only Physique the co-author left for me, I had to formulate my future plans using it.</p>
 <p>I looked at the hologram monitor again. After entering the [Help Wanted Cafe] again, I searched for a certain keyword.</p>
 <p>===<br>「Search」 - 「Essential Pharmacy」<br>「15,321 posts including “Essential Pharmacy”」</p>
 <p>—The open recruitment notice for Essential Pharmacy is out. It looks like they’re going to hire a large number of people this time. Is anyone here looking to apply?</p>
 <p>—Essential Pharmacy’s test is too hard and unpredictable…. Last time, I hear the question was how to kill a dragon or something.</p>
 <p>—I heard the salary for the researcher position is incredible. And because of the war against the New Evils….<br>===</p>
 <p>“…That’s right.”</p>
 <p>After reading through the posts for about three minutes, I nodded my head.<br>This was the best way I could utilize the Medicinal Memory Physique.<br>Thinking about it, I had killed too many people of this world.<br>At first, I justified myself by saying they were only characters in the novel. After I recognized this world as a real world, I changed the story to it being necessary.</p>
 <p>Perhaps this was the reason that the co-author left this Physique.<br>He had left me an ability that could <em>save</em> people, rather than kill….</p>
 <p>Suddenly, what Kim Suho told me in the past brushed past my ears.</p>
 <p>‘Everyone in this world is the main character.’</p>
 <p>He was right.<br>Even if everyone forgot about me, I could lead my own life. Perhaps I might be able to live a much more faithful life than before. At the very least, the current me wouldn’t do something as stupid as treating this world as a novel.</p>
 <p>With a grin, I gripped the [Medicinal Memory Physique Coupon].<br>Then, <em>chweeek—</em> I ripped it in half.<br>A blue current flowed out from the torn cross-section of the coupon.<br>Thus, the current carrying the ‘Physique’ slowly seeped into my body.</p>
 <p>“…Whew.”</p>
 <p>Although the medicinal effects I had memorized before should have been reset, it didn’t matter. I could just start over from the beginning.</p>
 <p>“Let’s see….”</p>
 <p><em>Chak, chack—!</em> I clapped my hands energetically and accessed the website.</p>
 <p>…And 5 minutes later.</p>
 <p>I realized that Essential Pharmacy’s open recruitment… required an ‘educational background’.</p>
 <p>It made sense. I mean, what pharmaceutical company would accept someone who didn’t attend med school? Because it was such an obvious thing, it wasn’t even listed on the employment site.</p>
 <p>“Ehew. Well… I don’t want to give up…. Guess I’ll apply to the sales department or something….”</p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p>[England - Buckingham Palace]</p>
 <p>Inside a private office in Buckingham Palace, Rachel was with Evandel, who was busy talking to her friends over a video call.</p>
 <p>“Un~ See you later! I have lots of time now!”</p>
 <p>—Evandel, you’re famous now! Are you sure?!</p>
 <p>“Mhm! Don’t worry, I have time! Heehee.”</p>
 <p>—Yay! Then we’ll be waiting for you~!</p>
 <p>Seeing Evandel smiling brightly as she talked to her friends, Rachel had a rather random thought. Did young kids always use exclamation marks (!) when they were talking to their friends…?<br>No, that wasn’t it.<br>Then what was it that she was thinking about?<br>Rachel furrowed her brows but failed to find out.</p>
 <p>“Un~ See you~”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Evandel hung up. Evandel smiled bloomingly, then spat out ‘those words’.</p>
 <p>“I want to see you~”</p>
 <p>I want to see you. Rachel didn’t know what that meant.<br>Recently, either as a form of sleep talking or an instinctual calling, she began to say the words ‘I want to see you~’<br>She would say this in the middle of eating, showering, running around, and even sleeping.</p>
 <p>“I want to see you~”</p>
 <p>It was almost like a habit. Even when Rachel asked who she wanted to see, Evandel would only tilt her head.</p>
 <p><em>Tok, tok-</em></p>
 <p>At that moment, a couple knocking noises rang out, and the royal court’s secretary spoke.</p>
 <p>—She is almost here.</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha seemed to almost be here.<br>Rachel returned a simple yes and walked out of the palace with Evandel. The Prime Minister, his Cabinet, and the members of Parliament were gathered in the garden.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be nervous, Princess. The negotiation is looking favorable.”</p>
 <p>Despite saying this, the Prime Minister was trembling nonstop.</p>
 <p>“…Yes, don’t be too nervous either, Prime Minister.”</p>
 <p>“Hahahaha, nervous? Never. Never, ever nervous. Hahahaha.”</p>
 <p>In any case, after about five minutes of waiting, Yoo Yeonha’s limousine appeared along with an incredible entourage of guards.<br>After getting off, Yoo Yeonha entered the meeting room while receiving a warm welcome from the Prime Minister and Parliamentary members.<br>Yoo Yeonha replied to the Prime Minister’s joke extremely coldly.</p>
 <p>“Now, let’s start the negotiation… but before that, why is there a kid here?”</p>
 <p>Inside the meeting room, Yoo Yeonha found Evandel sitting inside the room full of suited politicians and slightly lost her calm.</p>
 <p>“Princess Rachel?”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha’s sharp gaze turned to Rachel.</p>
 <p>“Yes?”</p>
 <p>Rachel blinked her eyes and pretended to be oblivious. Evandel also blinked her eyes and stared at Yoo Yeonha.<br>Sitting on a chair that was far bigger than her body, Evandel found it difficult to even place her two arms on the table. Yoo Yeonha found this incredibly cute.<br>But she knew not to mix business with pleasure.</p>
 <p>“…This is an important negotiation meeting. Please leave Evandel out of it.”</p>
 <p>“No, Evandel is here because she wants to be a part of the talk.”</p>
 <p>Rachel spoke as she looked at Evandel.</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha frowned. This princess was trying to use a kid for the negotiation…?</p>
 <p>“Evandel wants to become a Hero in the future, and the English Royal Court plans to support her as much as possible. After all, her talent is great. We were hoping that, through this meeting, Evandel would become a member of both a Korean guild and an English guild.”</p>
 <p>Yoo Yeonha’s shoulders turned stiff.<br>What Rachel was saying was clear.<br>Yoo Yeonha racked her brains before letting out a dry cough and nodding her head.</p>
 <p>“I see. Well, I’ve heard of our little Hero’s accomplishments. You were great, future Hero Evandel.”</p>
 <p>“Eh? Ah, hehehe…. Th… thank you….”</p>
 <p>Evandel tried her best to hide her laughter at Yoo Yeonha’s praise.<br>Yoo Yeonha also smiled lightly and spread out the documents she brought.</p>
 <p>“…Then let’s start the negotiation, including future Hero Evandel-nim’s guild status.”</p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p>[Korea, Seoul - Chae Joochul’s Mansion]</p>
 <p>“We’re here, Grand Hero-nim.”</p>
 <p>On the other hand, a voice from the driver’s seat woke Chae Nayun from her sleep. She had returned after completing her mission as a Hero.<br>She opened her eyes narrowly, She was drooling from her mouth, and tears were flowing down from her eyes.<br>The drool was one thing, but why was she crying?</p>
 <p>“Ah, thanks. Huaaaam—”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun yawned and wiped away the tears and drool.</p>
 <p>“…What time is it?”</p>
 <p>“1:30 a.m.”</p>
 <p>“Wow~ Really? I fought for 18 hours? I was wondering why I was so freaking tired.”</p>
 <p>“Why don’t you form a team too? It will reduce your exhaustion significantly.”</p>
 <p>“Hm? Ah, no, I like being alone.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun’s official position was ‘Grand Hero’. It was equal to a team leader position, and she was one of the highest-ranked officers in Essence of the Strait.<br>Although she had the right and authority to form her own team, she didn’t. She completed her missions almost exclusively alone.<br>Chae Nayun herself didn’t know the reason.<br>She simply thought she had to.</p>
 <p>“You can go back. I’ll go on my on tomorrow, so rest up.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, thank you.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun got off from the limousine and sent the driver home. Just like always, she walked past the Hanok’s front door. But today, she was roused by a certain presence.<br>It wasn’t the presence of an assassin.<br>In fact, this presence was making it clear that it was there.<br>Chae Nayun stopped and turned in that direction.</p>
 <p>“Oi, crazy woman. It’s been a while.”</p>
 <p>From the darkness, a destructive figure appeared.<br>Terrifying muscles and protruding veins. A human monster that seemed impossible to kill with a blade.<br>Chae Nayun reached back and grabbed her Balmung.</p>
 <p>“…Ah, don’t be so wary. My business isn’t with you.”</p>
 <p>Cheok Jungyeong waved his hand and walked proudly to the front door.<br>Chae Nayun didn’t relax and spat out.</p>
 <p>“What business do you have with me?”</p>
 <p>“I told you, my business isn’t with you…. I’m here for your grandfather.”</p>
 <p>“…Grandfather?”</p>
 <p>“Yep. I came to make your grandfather atone for his past sins.”</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t pretend like you don’t know. The Kwang-Oh Incident.”</p>
 <p>Chae Nayun flinched. She knew what the incident was.<br>Killing innocent people to silence a political opponent, hiding all records and manipulating the media - a truly heinous massacre.<br>And…<br>And… mm… what was it?<br>Wasn’t there something important?</p>
 <p>“So tell me. Where is your grand—”</p>
 <p>When Cheok Jungyeong asked, suddenly, an arrow flew forward and struck the back of Cheok Jungyeong’s head. It must have been quite strong, as his head bent forward in a 90-degree angle.<br>Cheok Jungyeong remained in that position for a while before gritting his teeth and glaring back.</p>
 <p>“That stupid woman…. Does she think she’s the leader now?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t be violent.”</p>
 <p>A clear voice rang out from the sky. Startled, Chae Nayun turned to the direction of the voice.<br>A hooded archer was sitting on top of a pine tree near the mansion.</p>
 <p>“Sorry for visiting you all of a sudden, Chae Nayun-ssi.”</p>
 <p>The archer said so as she lifted up her hood.</p>
 <p>“But this is something that must be done. We wanted to get your opinion too, so excuse us for our rudeness.”</p>
 <p>When the archer’s face was revealed, Chae Nayun’s eyes became dyed in shock.</p>
 <p>“…Senior Jin Seyeon!?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>Jin Seyeon smiled faintly and gazed at Chae Nayun.</p>
 <p>“Nice to meet you, Junior Chae Nayun.”</p>
 <p>“W-Why are you here? Or rather, what relationship do you have with this crazy muscle-pig….?”</p>
 <p>“Muscle-pig? Are you out of your—”</p>
 <p><em>Tak-</em> Jin Seyeon lightly landed. She walked up to Chae Nayun, who was in a mild state of panic and spoke with a stiff expression.</p>
 <p>“I know this might be sudden, but I wanted to ask for your opinion.”</p>
 <p>“Opinion? Mine?”</p>
 <p>When Chae Nayun asked back in a daze, Jin Seyeon answered seriously.</p>
 <p>“I’ll get to the point. We plan to rob Essential Pharmacy and return ‘emotions’ to Chae Joochul.”</p>
 <p>“…Huh?”</p>
 <p>As Jin Seyeon’s skipped a few explanations, Chae Nayun’s already-empty head was wiped clean.</p>
