 <p><strong>Chapter 442: Ghost King(4)</strong></p>
 <p>The huge black tiger’s eyes ominously glinted upon seeing the transformed flood dragons that were attempting to constrict him. With a low growl, it opened its mouth wide and shot out over ten, head-sized black light orbs in succession.</p>
 <p>The transparent azure flood dragon was able to swipe away the first few light orbs, but it wasn’t able to block the rest. With a mournful wail, the flood dragon was shattered, revealing the flying swords.</p>
 <p>The flying swords were knocked over forty meters away by the remaining light orbs. The swords’ azure light dimmed as if their spirituality had suffered damage.</p>
 <p>When Han Li saw this, he felt slight regret and hastily pointed at them, causing them to streak back into his body for recuperation. Then with a wave of his other hand, he sent out another four azure flying swords, stabbing towards the huge tiger in a blur.</p>
 <p>The black ghost shadow grew impatient upon seeing this. After taking a deep breath, it released a long, deafening shriek.</p>
 <p>When the demon tiger heard this, it immediately lowered its head. Its neck became twisted and its two front claws dug into the ground. An astonishing scene followed!</p>
 <p>A huge protrusion began to swell from the side of the tiger’s head. With a flash of black light, It grew to become a smaller tiger head. With the appearance of its second head, the demonic Qi surrounding its body soared. The transformation of this two headed tiger caused Han Li to tightly crease his brow.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the two heads of the demon tiger artifact spirit widely opened their mouths and shot out a dense, overbearing barrage of black light balls towards Han Li.</p>
 <p>Han Li didn’t dare to be careless. He formed an incantation gesture and caused his four flying swords to violently sway in mid-flight, making them appear as eight blades. With a burst of radiance, the eight flying swords then combined together to form a ten-meter-long azure sword.</p>
 <p>When Han Li looked at the sword, his eyes flickered with a strange expression. He opened his mouth without hesitation and spat out a cloud of glowing azure light towards the huge sword.</p>
 <p>The cloud of pure true essence caused the huge sword to radiate brilliance and release a long, clear ring, before transforming into an azure blur. As it fiercely chopped towards the black light orbs, it faintly released the sounds of thunder.</p>
 <p>Black and azure radiance scattered upon collision, followed by a series of explosions. This display released an astonishing pressure.</p>
 <p>The huge azure sword chopped through the light orbs with unstoppable momentum in a display of divine might. However, the black light orbs were endless. For every destroyed light orb, it seemed as if the two tiger heads would just release another wild torrent</p>
 <p>This scene caused Han Li’s expression to sink. This was unexpected.</p>
 <p>As he considered using other magic techniques to strike the enemy or send out more flying swords, a series of slight fluctuations occurred about thirty meters behind him, where the elusive gray ghost shadow had appeared.</p>
 <p>Apart from its blood red eyes, its body contained no other detectable auras. It seemed Han Li hadn’t detected any abnormalities from behind him..</p>
 <p>The grey shadow glanced at the flying beetles surrounding Han Li. After its gaze flickered around, it silently pounced towards Han Li’s back as a thin streak of grey light, wanting to shatter Han Li’s gold core.</p>
 <p>It didn’t care about the beetles in the slightest as it was most adept in stealth techniques. At that moment, his body had already become formless, with nothing to fear from the beetles. Under these circumstances, it was confident its claws would end Han Li before he could even react.</p>
 <p>The ghost shadow’s cultivation art was extremely strange. It shot towards Han Li as a grey blur at amazing speed without producing the slightest sound.</p>
 <p>As the grey blur quickly approached Han Li’s back, the gold-silver beetles began to hum and swarm towards it.</p>
 <p>The grey shadow was startled. Before it could react, the swarm of gold-silver beetles had blocked his path forward and were swarming towards him. In an instant, the grey blur became covered in the swarm of gold-silver beetles, creating a silhouette of twinkling gold and silver glints.</p>
 <p>With furious alarm, the grey shadow trembled several times in an attempt to throw off the beetles. This proved completely ineffective, and soon his body began to feel an intense, strange sensation.</p>
 <p>After a moment of daze, it turned its head downward, resulting in a gaze of terror from its blood-red eyes.</p>
 <p>The beetles that it had disregarded were now eating away at its incorporeal ghost body. Although their bites took much effort, they were truly eating away at his formless ghost body a mouthful at a time.</p>
 <p>The grey shadow became panicked and started to undergo continuous transformations. In one moment, it had turned into a pitch-black fog; in another, it turned into a scaled phantom. But regardless of the transformation, the cloud of beetles firmly stuck onto his body, and he was incapable of breaking away from them.</p>
 <p>In a short moment, his body was being devoured by at least several thousand exotic insects.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Han Li finally turned his head to coldly glance at the grey shadow.</p>
 <p>Without wasting the breath to say any nonsense, he released two more spirit beast pouches into the sky, summoning two additional swarms of droning, gold-silver insects into the air. The two huge swarms joined the existing swarm in devouring the grey shadow.</p>
 <p>The grey ghost shadow eventually released a deafening, fearful scream towards the black ghost shadow for aid.</p>
 <p>When the black shadow heard this, it revealed a trace of apprehension.</p>
 <p>It glanced at the huge azure sword that was deadlocked with the huge tiger artifact spirit and appeared hesitant. But soon it narrowed its green glowing eyes before transforming into a ghost cloud and merging with the body of the demon tiger. The black tiger immediately released a pained, violent roar. Its body then stood erect and underwent a transformation, shrinking its forelegs and thickening its hind legs.</p>
 <p>One of the faces of the tiger heads became indistinct for a moment before turning into a shaggy man’s face that was covered by dense black Qi. As for the other tiger head, its eyes became even more brutal.</p>
 <p>“Spirit Possession Technique!” Han Li felt his breath go cold as he involuntarily whispered the name of this magic technique.</p>
 <p>This technique was similar to the “Greater Possession Technique” that allowed one to enter a living body, but it had an entirely different use.</p>
 <p>Not only did the “Greater Possession Technique” not increase one’s strength, it only allowed one to make use of the original body’s strength. It was only a convenient magic technique to control a body from a long distance away. There also weren’t many consequences from using it.</p>
 <p>As for the Spirit Possession Technique, it couldn’t be used on other cultivators. It could only be used on demon beasts that didn’t hold much intelligence.</p>
 <p>After possession, not only would the cultivation of the caster and the target’s cultivation fuse, but their lives would be fused after a single use. If either party were to perish, it would bring the other party down with them. But what was most inconceivable was after fully making use of the Spirit Possession Technique, an entirely new individual will be created with a consciousness that possessed the memories and experiences of both parties, but neither of their wills.</p>
 <p>Although the duration of the spirit possession was short initially, the more frequent the technique was used, the longer it would last. Eventually, the consciousness of the newly created individual would become dominant, and the technique would become incapable of reversing.</p>
 <p>Ironically, the lifespan of this half human, half demon monster was pathetically short despite its great cultivation. Its astonishing power came at the cost of consuming an astonishing portion of its own life essence. It wouldn’t last long before it eventually expired.</p>
 <p>Additionally, rumor had it that cultivators that used the Spirit Possession Technique would have their souls forever wandering the abyss, incapable of reentering the cycle of reincarnation. This topic had caused many cultivators to pale while chatting about it.</p>
 <p>But fortunately, very few cultivators knew about the Spirit Possession Technique, and even fewer actually practiced it. After all, it could end with oneself turning into a half human, half demon abomination.</p>
 <p>The appearance of the ghost shadow and demon tiger’s fusion was exactly as was rumored of the Spirit Possession Technique. However, this secret technique should only be capable of being used by cultivators. He hadn’t heard that demon ghosts were capable of using it. But what was most astonishing was that he had done it with his own artifact spirit.</p>
 <p>Doubt was unconsciously written all over Han Li’s gloomy face while vigilance surged in his heart.</p>
