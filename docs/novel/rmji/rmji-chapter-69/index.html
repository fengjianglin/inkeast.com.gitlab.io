 <p><strong>Chapter 69 Li Feiyu and the Young Lady.</strong></p>
 <div id="chapterContent" class="innerContent fr-view">
  <p><strong>Chapter 69: Li Feiyu and the Young Lady</strong></p>
  <p>Elder Li’s residence was not extravagant; instead, it was merely a small, humble house.<br></p>
  <p>Surrounding several houses in close proximity was a two meter high, half a meter thick dirt wall encircling a simple courtyard. Facing the path was an arched, half-moon gateway through which Han Li could see that the courtyard was filled with many visitors.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Stepping into the courtyard, Han Li realized that the actual number of people was much higher than what he saw from outside the gate. They gathered in groups of twos or threes, discussing Elder Li’s state in low voices.</p>
  <p>Han Li had already heard that Elder Li was a good-natured person in the Seven Mysteries Sect. Regardless if one was a lower-ranked disciple or an esteemed colleague, he rarely got angry with anyone, nor did he scramble for power and profit in the sect. As a result, many figures in the sect, both the important and the insignificant, had nothing but compliments for the old man, causing his popularity to be very high.<br></p>
  <p>Not that Elder Li was suffering from an poison-induced illness, everyone with high status in the sect would eventually pay their respects either personally or through a representative. Not a single person failed to do so regardless if their reason for coming was heartfelt or hypocritic.As a result, the courtyard soon became filled by a throng of people.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Once Han Li came in, he was recognized by the people in the courtyard. The lowest Protectors immediately surrounded him, each striving to be the first to greet him</p>
  <p>“How are you, Medicinal God Han?!”</p>
  <p>“Doctor Han came!”</p>
  <p>A wave of well-wishing rang out and continuously battered his hears. Even if he didn’t want to hear the endless noise, he had no choice but to endure.</p>
  <p>Seeing these faces brimming with enthusiasm, Han Li similarly showed a bright smile that did not lose to the crowd in terms of splendor. However, although he appeared to be extremely courteous, he was actually sick of false pleasantries.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, those with high status, such as the Vice Sect Leaders and Consecrated Elders, implicitly nodded their heads in Han Li’s direction, showing their acknowledgement of his arrival without making a move to approach him.</p>
  <p>Seeing that they did not make it uncomfortable for Han Li by making him greet them, Han Li had a good impression about these esteemed individuals.</p>
  <p>Because of Ma Rong’s low status, he was unable to anything besides stand to the side with a look of concern. As the Protectors tried to get closer to Han Li with their constant stream of pleasantries, Ma Rong’s face revealed worry while both of his bands rubbed against each other nonstop.</p>
  <p>Finally, after Han Li finished greeting the last person, Ma Rong couldn’t wait any longer and immediately rushed forward, grabbing Han Li’s arm with one hand and charging straight into the house. This rude and impetuous action angered a few people who wished to get on good terms with Medicinal God Han, revealing a bit of their displeasure.</p>
  <p>On the outside Han Li had a forced smile, but he was actually quite pleased with Ma Rong’s decision. This way, he could finally get rid of those incessantly annoying people without having to offend anyone.</p>
  <p>With a sense of urgency, Han Li was pulled into living room by Ma Rong.</p>
  <p>There were not very many people inside, except a few family members and two Elders. Sect Leader Ma was also there, but what surprised Han Li the most was that Li Feiyu was also inside the room.</p>
  <p>Han Li was shocked. According to what he knew, there was no relationship between Li Feiyu and Elder Li, so why did he showed here?</p>
  <p>Just as his stomach was about to burst with questions, Han Li noticed that Senior Disciple Li was comforting a petite girl with tears flowing down her face. Li Feiyu’s highly focused expression was laced with traces of emotion, a look that was very different from the one he usually showed to his fellow disciples.</p>
  <p>Looking at Li Feiyu’s enamoured appearance, Han Li suddenly realized what was going on. Startled, he couldn’t help but think that it was extremely funny.</p>
  <p>Han Li promptly and carefully scrutinized the young lady’s appearance, wanting to see just what kind of beauty could make Li Feiyu disregard everything for the sake of love.</p>
  <p>The young lady looked to be around fifteen to sixteen years of age and was wearing a jasper hairpin. In addition, she wore a lotus green dress, giving the originally sweet and pleasant facial features a naughty and mischievous air. Despite of this, her two eyes were swollen red, making her seem lovely yet pathetic. Her dejected appearance gave people an urge to lovingly bring her into a hugging embrace.</p>
  <p>“Zeze! She really is one fair young lady.” Han Li exclaimed for several moments in his heart, thinking that Li Feiyu falling under this lady’s love snare was pardonable. In his heart, there was still a trace of envy and jealousy, not knowing when he himself would also be able to have an intimate companion.</p>
  <p>Maybe it was because he realized that Han Li was studying this young lady, but Ma Rong was quick to introduce everyone within the house to Han Li in order for him to establish a sense of familiarity.</p>
  <p>Sect Leader Ma and a white faced Elder Qian whom Han Li had saw before naturally did not need any introductions, and he immediately took the initiative to step forward to check the body.</p>
  <p>“Greetings Sect Leader Ma, Elder Qian!</p>
  <p>“Hehe! The young Doctor Han has arrived!” Sect Leader Ma acted as if he were Han Li’s close friend, almost as if there was no difference between their status.</p>
  <p>“Doctor Han is Doctor Han, why do you have to mention the word ‘young’?” Han Li silently curse within his heart in disagreement with Sect Leader Ma’s phrase.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, Elder Qian’s attitude was cold and detached. He merely nodded his head, acting in complete opposite to Sect Leader Ma. Han Li was not offended by Elder Qian’s indifference, since he knew that Elder Qian practiced a special cultivation method that required him to sever his feelings and desires, causing him to treat everyone with the same cold and indifferent attitude.</p>
  <p>In addition to Sect Leader Ma and Elder Qian, there was another tall, sturdy, and red-faced Elder with whom Han Li wasn’t familiar with. This Elder’s palms were rough and coarse, and all ten of his short fingers were thick and solid; from this, it was evident from a single glance that this Elder trained in a special martial art.</p>
  <p>“This is Elder Zhao, my master’s close friend. His previously job was to supervise the Treasure Gathering Division outside the mountain. He just came back two days ago.” Ma Rong said while introducing the Elder to Han Li.</p>
  <p>Towards Han Li, Elder Zhao was neither cold nor warm. He made an “en” sound with his nose, not saying a word, but the doubt in his eyes was evident. He clearly didn’t trust the invited Medicinal God Han’s skills due to his young age.</p>
  <p>Since Elder Zhao didn’t seem to have a favorable attitude towards him, Han Li would naturally not take the initiative to fawn over Elder Zhao. Following Elder Zhao’s example, Han Li used a flat tone to give his respects, then tried his best to avoid the other person.<br></p>
  <p>(TL: The original raw Chinese was “attach himself onto the other person’s hot buttock”</p>

  <p>Tomorrow I will bring myself together and amend all the unreasonable areas the readers have brought to my attention, so I can only release one chapter today.
