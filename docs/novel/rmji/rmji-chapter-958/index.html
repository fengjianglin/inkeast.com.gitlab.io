 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After some thought, Han Li conceded, “Since a noble clan like the Ye Clan was capable of creating a Divine Spirit Treasure replica, other great sects should’ve been able to do so as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There is no point in being dejected,” Monarch Soul Divergence sourly said, “Although they may be replicas, they were refined from rare materials. I reckon that most of these materials are extinct in this world and were only gathered together over a long period of time. Besides, don’t you have a genuine Divine Spirit Treasure in your possession? If you are able to fully wield it, none would be able to stand against you in this world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Han Li heard this he wryly snickered. “As if that would be easy. It will only be a daydream unless I am able to reach Deity Transformation stage. But if I reach that level, I’ll be able to reign over the mortal world without the Heavenvoid Cauldron in hand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Monarch Soul Divergence chuckled and said nothing else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hall was filled with an overpowering silence after the introduction of the Mountain Crushing Seal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The white silhouette could read the pressure from the crowd and didn't delay any further with the explanation. After a light cough, he began to describe the conditions to acquire the seal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Ye Clan has already prepared a list of the items it desires. Whoever is able to produce the most of these materials will be able to acquire this treasure. Of course, if the value of the highest trade is obviously insufficient, it will not be accepted. The final method of trade will be an auction with a minimum bid of three million spirit stones.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When this was said, a majority of cultivators present became restless, but none had raised any objections. Although that number of spirit stones was most of the wealth that a mid-sized cultivator sect possessed, it truly was a low price for it. When the auction started, it was more than likely that the bids would reach several times the minimum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Han Li heard the conditions of the trade, he felt a chill shake his heart as a strange thought came to mind. If he were to take out his last Devil Essence Diamond and put it on auction, he could acquire a significant amount of spirit stones.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it wasn’t quite comparable. The most famous treasure of the Devil Dao, the Devil Dragon Blade, was something he had done a bit of research on. It appeared that only one of them was able to be refined and this was during ancient times. It was said that some devil cultivators were able to kill Deity Transformation stage cultivators with the weapon, and its might was no inferior to a Divine Spirit Treasure. Since the Devil Dragon Blade was a magic treasure, it had immense potential but it couldn’t be refined with only one or two Devil Essence Diamonds. Even so, a devil cultivator could greatly increase their cultivation by absorbing the diamond’s pure devilish Qi, which caused its immense value.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as these random thoughts appeared in his head, the old man took out a jade slip containing the list of materials and began to read them out loud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although his voice was soft, everyone in the hall could clearly hear him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After this was said, Han Li grew indifferent and no longer had any intention of fighting over the treasure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It wasn’t that he couldn’t be tempted by the treasure, but that he was aware of his own limits. As a lone cultivator, how could he possibly compare to the vast wealth of the greatest sects of the Jin Empire? Even the entire fortune of a smaller sect couldn’t hope to compete! After hearing out the list of items they wanted in exchange, Han Li became certain the Ye Clan was willing to take out the Mountain Crushing Seal at this auction because they taking advantage of being pressured by the various superpowers to sell the item.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old man hadn’t uttered the name of materials as rare as Elemental Jade or Auric Essence, but since the requested items were both uncommon and essential, large sects would always keep a stockpile of them. It appears the Ye Clan were planning to deal a striking blow to these sects.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With that in mind, Han Li stood up and headed towards the teleportation formation of the hall.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The action had aroused quite a bit of attention and bewilderment, as many cultivators had taken note of him after he produced two Devil Essence Diamonds..</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Li paid little notice of this and continued on his way out. But just as he was about to enter the glowing formation, he heard the sound of a familiar voice, “Fellow Daoist Han, why are you leaving now?” Old Man Fu had sent him a voice transmission.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Li stopped and replied, “I’ve become a target of attention. It’d be best for me to depart before I attract problems. I still haven’t forgotten about Brother Fu’s affair. If you aren’t in a hurry, how about we talk about it in a few years after I finish refining a treasure?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My matter isn’t urgent at all. However, Brother Han has taken quite the effort to conceal himself from me. I didn’t have the slightest clue you possessed something as precious as Devil Essence Diamonds. It is no wonder the Yin Sifting Sect is pursuing you. Anyways, in four years time, could you meet me in Nanjian Province’s Chaoyun Prefecture? At that time, I will have arranged for other Fellow Daoists to meet me at Twin Scorpion Mountain. I guarantee that although the matter will require some effort, you will most certainly be rewarded.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Four years? That will be enough time. I’ll see you then.” with that said, Han Li stepped into the formation and disappearing in a flash of white light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the time it took to finish a cup of tea, Han Li flew out from the underground trade meet, flying a circle in the air before heading east.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A short moment after Han Li departed, several cultivators quietly departed from the trade meet as well, having more or less had the same thoughts about the Mountain Crushing Seal. Most, however, decided to remain behind. After all, there were to be even more rare materials, along with the fierce competition involved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After quickly flying five hundred kilometers away, he passed by a nearby mountain and had heard a peculiar sword cry. Han Li’s expression vastly changed and he came to a sudden stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He took a deep breath and sharply glanced around him. Tens of golden flying swords were simultaneously released to densely fly around him with great momentum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With blue light flashing from his eyes, he stared at an empty space and coldly said, “Your tracks have already been revealed. There is no point in hiding, come out!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hehe</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">! &nbsp;You are truly clever. As expected of the cultivator who slew my main soul.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Black light flashed from where Han Li was standing to reveal a youth with a similar appearance to himself. He also wore azure robes and had a calm expression, but a dim black-purple light shined from his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Han Li saw this person, he felt his heart drop despite having already anticipated this. “So it was you! Why have you come to find me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After examining Han Li for a moment, he lazily said. “It seems you already know who I am. I didn’t expect to find you so quickly. It seems my luck is quite good.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Li emotionlessly said, “My two swords are in your possession. I’d have to be stupid to not know who you are.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right, Your flying swords are right here.” The Elder Devil’s soul fragment raised his hand and revealed two small swords that were violently trembling. They were attempting to return to Han Li with all their might, but layers of black thread were firmly keeping them in place. “Your flying swords possess quite a bit of sentience to take the initiative to warn you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Li’s expression turned sullen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Elder Devil mysteriously smiled and said, “To think, these swords were actually refined from the evil-slaying Golden Lightning Bamboo! The others should be the same, revealing quite an unbelievable amount in total. It appears my main soul hadn’t perished for nothing. Although I was able to avoid being consumed, with his death I will&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">forever</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;be unable to recover my complete cultivation. Should I thank you... or kill you?”</span></p>
