 <p><strong><a href="https://i.imgur.com/EqJhvGU.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Bone Sage’s Death</a></strong> [/expand]</p>
 <p>Han Li’s expression became unsightly.</p>
 <p>The web of lightning around Han Li had stopped the grey flames for the time being, but it appeared as if there was nothing that the flames couldn’t burn. The lightning had already been set aflame, transforming the web of lightning into a cage of grey flame, trapping Han Li within. Now, he couldn’t even escape if he wanted to.</p>
 <p>But what worried Han Li even more was that as the grey flames burned away at the net of golden lightning, he could slowly feel the lightning contained inside his body slowly withering away.</p>
 <p>The decaying nature of the flames gave the Sacred Asure Flames an overwhelming advantage.</p>
 <p>The Bone Sage deeply sighed in relief and smiled. He felt confident that Han Li had no method of breaking free of the prison of grey flame.</p>
 <p>Based on the flame’s legends, the Bone Sage believed that even a Nascent Soul cultivator trapped by it would have to greatly damage their Origin Qi by using a secret technique in order to escape. Once he refined his own asura flame and restored his Nascent Soul to the peak of his cultivation, he was convinced that it would be possible for him to rule over half of the Scattered Star Seas.</p>
 <p>With that thought, the Bone Sage let his imagination run wild. In his eyes, Han Li was already a dead man.</p>
 <p>The situation was growing increasingly dire!</p>
 <p>As the golden net of lightning shrank, it eventually arrived on the verge of collapse. In response, Han Li expressionlessly spread out his palms and shot out dense arcs of golden lightning towards the net.</p>
 <p>The seemingly unending stream of golden lightning from Han Li’s palms merged with the net, causing the withering net to immediately flourish brightly once more. Not only was it restored to its original size, but it also began to astonishingly launch an unending storm of lightning against the surrounding grey flames, pushing back the flames with great momentum.</p>
 <p>The Bone Sage’s eyes widened and he nearly jumped! He now truly understood what it meant for Heaven’s will to overturn man’s.</p>
 <p>The absurd amount of Divine Devilbane Lightning in Han Li’s body was wreaking havoc on the Bone Sage’s nerves.</p>
 <p>Even though the Sacred Asura Flames were an existence a level above the Divine Devilbane Lightning, there was just far too much lightning. It was uncertain which would win!</p>
 <p>The Bone Sage glared at Han Li as if he were looking at a monster.</p>
 <p>Yet again, his mind was plagued by doubts. Just how many Gold Lightning Bamboo magic treasures does Han Li have stored in that small body of his? Was it possible that his supply of Devilbane Lightning was endless?</p>
 <p>Just as that thought entered his mind, the Bone Sage fiercely bit down on the tip of his tongue. With sharp pain and the taste of blood, he managed to regain clarity of mind. He lightly shook his head and dismissed such absurd thoughts.</p>
 <p>Endless amounts of Devilbane Lightning? That was obviously impossible. He was merely unsure about the quantity of Han Li’s lightning.</p>
 <p>However, the Bone Sage was convinced that with few a more bursts of lightning, Han Li was certain to run dry. When that happened, he would be able to easily kill Han Li, and take his many Gold Lightning Bamboo magic treasures for himself.</p>
 <p>With that thought, the Bone Sage roused his spirits and fiercely gazed at Han Li with newfound greed, raising his orb of light above his head.</p>
 <p>Earlier, the Bone Sage had only refined less than half of his Celestial Ice Flames into Asura Flames in order to reduce the odds of backlash. But it appeared that this wouldn’t be enough to kill Han Li as he still had Devilbane Lightning in reserve. In order to kill Han Li in one move, he would have to refine all of his remaining Celestial Ice Flames.</p>
 <p>He then nodded his head in approval of his thoughts and formed an incantation gesture once more. The orb of light quickly rotated, glowing once more with dazzling brilliance.</p>
 <p>When Han Li saw this, his heart broke out into a chill.</p>
 <p>It was as the Bone Sage had anticipated. Han Li’s continuous use of the Devilbane Lightning had left it on the verge of being exhausted after having dealt with the Bone Sage’s Celestial Ice and Sacred Asura Flames. Having seen the Bone Sage about to launch another attack with his Sacred Asura Flames, Han Li pondered whether or not his remaining Devilbane Lightning would be enough to break himself free.</p>
 <p>His only option was to break through the cage of flames and flee. After all, no matter how mighty the Sacred Asura Flames were, their power meant nothing if it couldn’t connect.</p>
 <p>With that thought, Han Li came to a decision. He released the remaining Devilbane Lightning in a single, instantaneous burst, shooting out two arm-thick bolts of lightning from his hands into the net.</p>
 <p>The gold net of lightning rapidly swayed with muffled rolls of thunder before exploding in a burst of golden brilliance. Countless arcs of golden lightning pushed back the few remaining grey flames far away.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Han Li’s body flickered several times and reappeared about ten meters away. During that moment, Han Li was filled with apprehension.</p>
 <p>He feared that if he wasn’t careful, he would make contact with a sliver of grey flame, something that would prove to be absolutely deadly. But now that he had made it past the barrier of Sacred Asura Flames, he used his cloak without the hesitation. With a flash of blood-red light, he started to float off the ground.</p>
 <p>He had already decided to shoot straight towards the stone stairs and have his Cloudswarm Bamboo Swords break through the barrier, allowing him to make a clean escape.</p>
 <p>The Bone Sage guessed what Han Li intended and immediately grew anxious. He immediately surged his magic power into the light orb and quickened its transformation. With a huge rumble, the entire light orb was set alight with grey flame as if it were made completely out of Sacred Asura Flames.</p>
 <p>But strangely, the center of the orb still had a small ball of blue light. It continuously flickered, appearing quite unstable.</p>
 <p>The Bone Sage was initially surprised when he saw this, but he didn’t take it very seriously. As his current magic power wasn’t much, it wasn’t particularly alarming if the transformation was incomplete..</p>
 <p>He was currently focused on Han Li’s imminent escape. Nothing he could say would stop him now.</p>
 <p>The Bone Sage lightly beckoned to the orb of grey flames. The orb of flames lightly trembled several times and started to follow his orders to attack.</p>
 <p>But a sudden transformation had occurred.</p>
 <p>The remnant of blue light inside the orb suddenly flickered several times before it ruptured from the center of the orb. The orb suddenly became uneven and distorted, releasing a faint but shrieking whistle from it.</p>
 <p>The Bone Sage was greatly frightened and hastily attempted to control the orb’s distortions. He had long since forgotten that the Sacred Asura Flames wasn’t something that he had truly refined. He was only able to manipulate it through the aid of external forces.</p>
 <p>Now having encountered the disturbance of its core rupturing, the flame orb was completely unstable and had gone frantically out of control. His meager magic power didn’t have the slightest effect in controlling it!</p>
 <p>As his head was lined with sweat, the flame orb suddenly dissolved into the colors of white, green, and black, and ruptured above the Bone Sage’s head, releasing countless embers of grey flame.</p>
 <p>The Bone Sage’s expression turned bloodlessly pale! He hastily started to turn his body without a thought, forming a vortex of black and green ghost Qi towards the embers in an attempt to restrain them.</p>
 <p>In the following instant, an arrow-like bolt of black lightning shot towards the ruptured orb in an attempt to save the Bone Sage’s life.</p>
 <p>Although the vortex of ghost Qi appeared overbearing, they melted away into nothingness upon touching the embers of grey flame to no effect.</p>
 <p>While the embers did not fall at a fast speed, they were widely spread out over a great distance and drifted from place to place. But he should still be able to run from them, if just barely!</p>
 <p>When Han Li witnessed this reversal, he immediately changed his mind. He made use of the opportunity to shoot out ten streaks of Azure Essence Swordlight from his fingertips and blocked the Bone Sage’s path of escape.</p>
 <p>The Bone Sage inwardly cursed with alarm and fury.</p>
 <p>He was too preoccupied at that moment to dodge! He could only cross his arms in front of him with gritted teeth and emit a thin layer of green Qi before charging forwards.</p>
 <p>Just before a streak of azure light struck him, he shot out a black streak of light from his mouth, his magic treasure - the Gold Lightning Bamboo arrow. After striking the fifth streak of azure light, it was knocked to the side. As for the rest of the sword streaks, the Bone Sage directly received them with his arms.</p>
 <p>Five muffled explosions sounded out.</p>
 <p>The Bone Sage had clearly underestimated the might of Han Li’s Azure Essence Swordlight. Although he managed to repel the first four streaks of azure swordlight, the last strike had broken through his green Qi and struck his true body, pushing him back by several steps.</p>
 <p>In that moment, the Bone Sage’s mind froze in terror! With a faceful of panic, he hastily reached to take something out from his robes. But before that happened, a miniscule, faint ember of grey flame had landed on his shoulder.</p>
 <p>Woosh. Grey flame wildly ignited.</p>
 <p>Without even the slightest scream, the Bone Sage’s body succumbed to the flames, leaving nothing but drifting ash behind.</p>
