 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While the three cultivators were dealing with the Elder Devil Corpse, bright light began to wind around Han Li’s body and his surroundings turned dim and hazy. Countless specks of white light danced around in the air around him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Li clasped his hands in an incantation gesture and spiritual light flowed without end around his body. A whirlwind of light rose from the ground and enveloped him in a gorgeous display.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon after, gales began to blow with ever greater force and frequency as time went by. As for the white light specks in the distance, they were swept up like moths to the flame. Not long after, the winds formed a huge pillar that reached into the sky, picking up stones and sand wherever it went as if possessed by a devil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, Han Li’s incantation echoed through the fierce winds, causing the pillar of wind to tremble before dispersing thin, glowing clouds through the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The incantation was quickly spoken and the glowing clouds turned blue. Soon, the sound of rushing water filled the air and countless surging waves rose as far as the eye could see. Waves up to three hundred meters tall began to rise around him. As for Han Li, he was standing within a huge pillar of water and blue light shined from his incantation gesture, appearing as if he were a water god.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, Han Li’s incantation gesture changed and the light became muddled.The huge waves of water disappeared in the blink of an eye as if they were an illusion and were replaced with waves of scarlet flame. Over ten, hundred-meter-long fire dragons emerged from them, each of them spitting fire from their mouths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, the flames disappeared only to be replaced with a verdant sea of trees, then an endless desert, a world of ice, and many other worlds as Han Li willed them into existence. For the moment, he appeared to be a godlike existence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Li appeared satisfied with what he had done and used his magic power to condense a three-kilometer-tall giant. He had it beat its chest before roaring at the sky. Afterwards, silver light began to streak from every corner of the horizon and surged towards the giant in a silver wave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blinding silver streaks filled the sky and the giant melted underneath the silver lights as if it were ice before a flame. But when this light covered Han Li, he immediately covered his eyes with his hands and miserably scream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following his scream, the silver lights in the sky scattered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Li felt completely dazed, but he soon opened his eyes in alarm as both the silver light and the world around him had completely disappeared. He was sitting inside a secluded room, his body completely drenched in sweat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Li took a deep breath and calmed himself, finally recalling that he was within a sealed room inside Devilfall Valley. Not long before, he had taken the Nature Origin Pill that he had refined and was enveloped in an illusory world made by the medicinal power erupting from the pill.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He blankly remained seated and didn’t immediately stand up. As he reflected upon his own experiences in the illusory world, his expression wavered from revelation one moment and confusion the next. He then touched his back and found his robes to be drenched.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Li bitterly smiled. The Nature Origin Pill was beyond miraculous for it to be capable of sinking his mind into a world of illusions in spite of his vast spiritual sense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for his time inside the illusion, he had become an entirely different person and experienced inconceivable events. He had grasped tremendous power with ease, capable of shifting mountains and seas or calling wind and rain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But when Han Li recalled what he had done in the illusion, the incantations became incredibly vague and he couldn’t recall a single word that he spoken, but the sensation from wielding &nbsp;worldly spiritual power of that level was remembered with complete detail. He felt as if he had experienced it with his body and believed it would prove beneficial for him when breaking through to the next cultivation realm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Li then closed his eyes once more and in place for half a day before opening his eyes with restored calm. Any trace of confusion had disappeared from his face. He stood up and raised his hand, striking the stone door in front of him with a spell seal. The door flickered with spirit light and slowly opened, allowing Han Li to calmly walk out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as he walked out, a white streak of light flew out from the stone wall and into his sleeve. It was Silvermoon in her fox form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Li slowly walked towards the cave’s entrance and asked, “How long was I in seclusion? Did anything happen while I was in there?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silvermoon replied with a respectful tone, “Master was in seclusion for two days. During this time Violet Spirit had emerged, but she saw that the restrictions protecting your cave had yet to be removed and returned to her residence.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Li indifferently said, “Given her lower cultivation, the Nature Origin PIll should’ve had a lesser effect on her. It is no wonder that she left seclusion earlier. Rather, I am more surprised that you don’t want to take one.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silvermoon’s helpless voice came his sleeve, “Master should know that I am quite a bit different from a human cultivator. I am a Silvermoon Wolf that is possessing the body of a demon fox. In addition to medicine pills used to advance cultivation, I don’t dare to negligently take any other types of cultivator medicine pills. Who knows what harm they could cause me? I would rather just spend more time cultivating than take that risk.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a moment of thought, Han Li frowned and nodded without speak further.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, Han Li hadn’t wasted the remaining Spirit Kindle Fruits. He had chosen to consume them before taking the Nature Origin Pill. When their medicinal power dissolved into his body, he experienced a small but noticeable increase in cultivation. It truly deserved to be a spirit medicine rarely seen in this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Han Li arrived near the exit of his cave residence, he found his puppets obediently guarding the gate. He took several steps forward and swept them into his storage pouch in a flash of white light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, Han Li opened the stone gate of his cave residence with a magic technique and calmly walked out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the instant Han Li walked out, a streak of light shot out from one of the neighboring mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Han Li saw the light approaching, he calmly waved his hands around him, causing all the nearby formation flags and plates that were placed in the ground to fly into his hands one after another in streaks of azure light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, the streak arrived in front of Han Li, revealing Violet Spirit’s figure. She sweetly smiled at Han Li as she floated in the air. Her gorgeous beauty soon unfolded as the light faded away around her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Han, you’ve finally emerged. I had believed it would’ve taken you another half day before you came out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Li smiled and said, “It seems Violet Spirit has experienced rather fine results after taking the Nature Origin Pill. You are only a few years away from ascending to mid Core Formation stage. Allow me to offer my congratulations ahead of time.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Violet Spirit’s gaze flickered and she happily said, “Brother Han must be joking. The Nature Origin Pill only saved me several tens of years of bitter cultivation. However, Brother Han now has a good chance of reaching mid Nascent Soul stage after taking the pill. This is worthy of even greater congratulations.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fellow Daoist Violet Spirit can’t have believed that the Nature Origin Pill has the same effect on a Core Formation cultivator as a Nascent Soul cultivator,” Han Li calmly said, “Although it was said that the pill is effective to everyone under the Deity Transformation stage, the lower the cultivation one possesses, the greater the effect. When Core Formation cultivators take the pill, there is no doubt that they will be able to ascend to the next level, but this isn’t guaranteed for a Nascent Soul cultivator.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Regardless of how it is said, the Nature Origin Pill is greatly useful towards ascending to the next level of cultivation. There is no need for Brother Han to be so modest. And give the aptitude Brother Han displayed after reaching the Nascent Soul stage in only two hundred years, he should only be a step away from entering mid Nascent Soul stage.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Aptitude?’ When Han Li heard Violet Spirit say this, he couldn’t help but bitterly laugh. Although he didn’t correct her, he did shake his head in silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Violet Spirit pursed her lips in a smile and thought to say something more when a huge rumble sounded out in the distance. It appeared as if a fierce tremble shook the entire world. Han Li handled it well enough, but Violet Spirit was shaken by this and started to fall from the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She hastily stopped her fall with a burst of light and shouted in alarm, “What happened? What’s going on?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Also shocked, Han Li turned his head in the direction of the source of this sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Yi! That is the area that the map indicated.’ Han Li’s heart stirred and he felt somewhat bewildered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At that moment, a white line howled as it streaked over from the horizon, carrying booms in its wake. In the blink of an eye, the white light grew thicker and countless waves of white Qi suddenly appeared nearby.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As far as the eye could see, a boundless and unimaginably tall wave of white Qi engulfed the surrounding mountains as it made its way towards Han Li and Violet Spirit. In the blink of an eye, it was only about a kilometer away from them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not good!” When Han Li saw this, his expression changed and he summoned the small blue shield with a shake of his sleeve. It revolved around him once before expanding into a huge shield in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He pointed at the huge shield and a layer of blue light was emitted from it, enveloping Han Li. Still feeling uneasy, he spat out a ball of blue icy flame and had it rupture thirty meters in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blue flame radiantly glowed and crackled. The large icy ball of Qi rapidly expanded and in the blink of an eye, a twenty-meter-tall ice mountain appeared in front of Han Li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Violet Spirit, she had also reacted with alarm and released an embroidered scarf that released a mist of light to protect her. When she saw that Han Li had condensed an ice mountain, she hastily flew to his side with delight. At that moment, the rushing wave of Qi arrived before them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire sky grew dim while the violent sounds of the earth shattering burst around them. A huge tremble went through the ice mountain before them as tens of boulders smashed into it, each impact releasing a sharp clank. The sound was discomforting and made one’s heart stir.</span></p>
