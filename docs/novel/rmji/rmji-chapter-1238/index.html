 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Li's expression also changed upon hearing this. How did Xiang Zhili know that he owned more than one Divine Spirit Treasure?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he quickly realized the underlying reason behind this; this information had to have been leaked by the North Night Palace. Many years ago, Master Arctic Dragon had already guessed that he possessed the Heavenvoid Cauldron, and he had to have discussed this matter with other cultivators from the palace. Otherwise, Xiang Zhili could've obtained this information from the Scattered Star Seas. His location had always been a mystery, so it wouldn't be a surprise if he'd made a trip to the Scattered Star Seas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several possibilities appeared in Han Li's mind while a wary expression surfaced on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiang Zhili seemed to have identified Han Li's unease, and he consoled, "There's no need for you to be concerned, Junior Martial Brother Han. Divine Spirit Treasures are extremely sought-after for normal cultivators, but Deity Transformation cultivators like us already stand at the pinnacle of the human world. These spirit treasures may indeed be quite powerful, but they'll only be the icing on the cake for us, so they're not treasures that we must obtain. Besides, all of us have lived for so long in this human world, we all naturally have one or two spirit treasures in our possession. However, using such spirit treasures requires a vast expenditure of magic power, and we wouldn't unleash them unless we were in mortal danger. Otherwise, if we stir up the world's origin Qi, we'll be doing a lot of harm to ourselves."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I see. Looks like I was overthinking things." Han Li's expression eased slightly upon hearing this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiang Zhili's words were quite reasonable, but Han Li naturally wasn't going to completely believe him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After all, no one would reject a spirit treasure if they had the chance to obtain one. He could clearly see the greed in Eccentric Wind's eyes when he was looking at the Eight Spirit Ruler.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it sounded like Xiang Zhili was going to side with him in this situation. Perhaps he was wary of Han Li's abilities or simply wanted to appease Han Li for some other motive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Li's mind was quickly scrambling to figure out a reason behind this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Hmph, what are you trying to say, Brother Xiang? Why do you insist on siding with this Han brat? He may have two spirit treasures, but I can surely take him down if I'm willing to sacrifice over 10 years of my lifespan," Eccentric Wind harrumphed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"You're greatly underestimating Junior Martial Brother Han, Brother Feng. Even if you fight with everything you have, you may not be able to kill Junior Martial Brother Han. However, what's guaranteed is that you'll have to sacrifice at least several decades or even more than a century of your lifespan. Are you really willing to make such a huge sacrifice over a trivial matter like this?" Xiang Zhili shook his head with a serious expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Over a century of my lifespan? Do you hold this brat in such high regard?" Eccentric Wind's heart jolted with shock as he appraised Han Li in an incredulous manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Junior Martial Brother Han, you were the one who killed that Qian brat, Arctic Dragon, and the Yin Sifting Sect Master who recently disappeared, right?" Xiang Zhili asked with a faint smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Indeed, they were all slain by me," Han Li replied in a calm manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eccentric Wind's brows furrowed upon hearing this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Junior Martial Brother Han, you've already witnessed the power of a Deity Transformation cultivator in the Kunwu Mountains. Using that as a reference, if you were to engage in a battle with Brother Feng now, what do you think will be the outcome?" Xiang Zhili asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"If we fight in a battle to the death, I have around a 10% chance of securing victory, a 30% chance of taking him down with me, and an over 50% chance of escaping, albeit with severe injuries," Han Li replied after carefully contemplating the question being raised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Xiang Zhili faltered before bursting into laughter upon hearing this reply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Junior Martial Brother Han, I know that you're quite powerful, but isn't that too much of an exaggeration? Setting aside everything else, you proclaim that you have a 30% chance of taking Brother Feng down with you? What gives you the confidence to say that?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eccentric Wind also chuckled coldly in a disdainful manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Li appraised Xiang Zhili with a calm expression before flipping over a palm to summon a crimson ball. "That's an Immortal Vanquishing Bead!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As expected of Deity Transformation cultivators, the two of them immediately identified the treasure, and every last hint of disdain was wiped away from Eccentric Wind's face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Li didn't say anything else, but he raised his other hand and produced a similar black ball.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Xiang Zhili was quite astonished now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I happened to obtain a few Immortal Vanquishing Beads. If Fellow Daoist Feng insists on engaging me in a battle to the death, then death may well be what's waiting for him," Han Li said in a calm voice before azure light flashed over his palms, upon which the two Immortal Vanquishing Beads disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eccentric Wind and Xiang Zhili glanced at one another, and both of them could see their own bewilderment mirrored in each other's eyes. If there was something in this world that even Deity Transformation cultivators had to be wary of, then Immortal Vanquishing Beads were definitely one of them. If they were to take a direct hit from one of those things, it would really be quite a troublesome situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Han Li had four or five of those beads, then it really wouldn't be an exaggeration to claim that he could take them down with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I didn't think that Junior Martial Brother Han would have such powerful treasures. However, I'm sure Fellow Daoist Feng will be willing to let bygones be bygones, so you won't have to use those Immortal Vanquishing Beads. Your powers far exceed those of other cultivators at the same cultivation base, so it's not an insult for us to regard you as an equal. What do you think, Brother Feng?" Xiang Zhili turned to Eccentric Wind with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eccentric Wind's expression changed several times, but he could only concede in the end. "Hmph, I guess we'll do as you say, Brother Xiang. I'm willing to set aside our minor differences, but he has to answer my questions about spatial nodes."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Haha, I was planning to ask the same thing. Please don't be so quick to jump to denial, Junior Martial Brother Han. After you reach the Deity Transformation Stage, you're also planning to ascend to the Spirit Realm through a spatial node, right? In that case, why don't you collaborate with us old folk?" Xiang Zhili chuckled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Collaborate?" Han Li faltered slightly upon hearing this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Indeed. I'm sure you possess some information that we're unaware of. However, most of your time will be dedicated to making a breakthrough to the Deity Transformation Stage, so you won't have much time to search for spatial nodes. Once we find the spatial node, all of us will be able to use it. In that case, we should join forces and work together for mutual benefit. What do you think, Junior Martial Brother Han?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Eccentric Wind was also staring intently at Han Li, eagerly awaiting his response.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Li's brows furrowed, and he didn't immediately give a reply. Instead, he fell silent with a contemplative look on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiang Zhili continued to hover in mid-air with a calm smile. He seemed to be quite confident and wasn't in a hurry at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After mulling the notion over for a long while, Han Li finally asked, "Will you and Fellow Daoist Feng be the only ones involved in the collaboration, Senior Martial Brother Xiang?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Aside from the two of us, Fellow Daoist Hu of the Heavenly Devil Sect will also be involved. Initially, Fellow Daoist Bai from the High Zenith Sect was also interested, but he has other important matters to attend to, so he won't be able to join us. As such, the three of us will the only ones participating in this collaboration. Hehe, don't look down on us old folk, Junior Martial Brother Han. Aside from Old Devil Che of the Myriad Demon Valley, we are the only Deity Transformation cultivators in the Great Jin," Xiang Zhili explained with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Are there only so few Deity Transformation cultivators? I'd thought that for the Great Jin to be known as the cultivation holy land of the human world, there'd be at least seven or eight Deity Transformation cultivators here." Han Li was rather surprised to hear this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Three or four centuries ago, there were two other people. However, the conclusions of their lifespans were approaching at the time, so they decided to cultivate an extremely dangerous secret technique as a final roll of the dice. In the end, both of them were forced into self-detonation," Xiang Zhili explained with a wry smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Han Li also heaved a faint sigh upon hearing this before asking, "I recall that Fairy Ling Long left you some information, pointing out the location of dozens of spatial nodes. Have you been unable to find even a single one of them, Senior Martial Brother Xiang?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Of course not. Even though most of the spatial nodes have indeed ceased to exist or are nowhere to be found, we still managed to find three spatial nodes. However, two of them are completely inaccessible due to extremely fierce spatial storms at their openings. Entry would spell certain death for us. The final spatial node can be entered, but it's already extremely unstable, and could collapse at any moment. As such, we didn't dare to take the risk. We heard from Old Devil Che that he found a spatial node near the North Night Palace, but the North Night Palace Master caught wind of his intentions, and detonated the Heavenvoid Hall of the North Night Palace, destroying the spatial node in the process. Old Devil Che almost coughed up blood, such was his fury." It was Eccentric Wind who replied on this occasion. Even though he was speaking in a rather forlorn manner, it was quite clear that he was taking pleasure in Old Devil Che's misfortune.</span></p>

I was wondering why so many high-grade demon beasts attacked the North Night Palace all those years ago. Isn't the North Night Palace Master afraid that Old Devil Che will seek revenge and slaughter her entire palace?" Han Li was rather perplexed again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"He wouldn't dare to do that. You have to realize that the human world is, as the name suggests, a world dominated by our human race. Almost at all points in history, the number of human Deity Transformation cultivators have far exceeded that of demonic cultivators at the same cultivation base. The old devil has managed to survive to this point as all of the human Deity Transformation cultivators find it too troublesome to hunt him down. However, he wouldn't dare to do anything out of line, either. That's why we've allowed him to found and expand the Myriad Demon Valley for so long. Even so, he was forced to make an agreement with the Deity Transformation cultivators of the past, stating that his true body wouldn't be allowed to leave the valley for no good reason, and that he was strictly prohibited from the widespread slaughter of humans. Otherwise, all of us human Deity Transformation cultivators would join forces to kill him," Xiang Zhili explained with a cold smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"I see. I was wondering why such a massive gathering of demonic cultivators such as the Myriad Demon Valley was allowed to exist in the Great Jin."Han Li nodded with an enlightened expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"However, I recently heard that Old Devil Che seemed to have discovered another spatial node. I'm not sure if this is true or not, and nor do I know whether this spatial node is actually accessible," Eccentric Wind suddenly said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"There's no need to mention that. Both Fellow Daoist Hu and I have examined that spatial node, and it's only accessible to Old Devil Che due to his superior constitution as a demonic cultivator. There are also spatial storms raging at the opening, and even though it's slightly milder than the spatial storms raging in the other spatial nodes we'd found before, they would still be lethal to us. Hehe, Old Devil Che is already planning to rely on his powerful body to enter that spatial node," Xiang Zhili chuckled.</span></p>
