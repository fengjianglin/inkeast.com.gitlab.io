However, the Seven Great Truths cultivators were now running out of magic power and they could no longer endure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were two old men that were particularly strained, a red-faced old man with dimming spiritual light and a pale-faced old man with white Qi visibly wavering around his nose and mouth. The two were clearly pushing past their limits using secret techniques.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Han Li frowned and glanced at some dead cultivators nearby before looking at the spell warrior, who was standing guard nearby the ancient lanterns.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Look after the Weeping Soul Beast and don’t let anything happen to it. Withdraw it if it is ever in danger. I’m going to head off to exterminate the ancient lanterns.” Han Li spoke in an inaudible voice and tossed the Weeping Soul Pearl behind him. In a flash of weak white light, the pearl disappeared from sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes! Master, please be careful. That peacock’s abilities are truly powerful.” Silvermoon’s worried voice came from behind him. Han Li calmly nodded and when he saw that nobody nearby paid him any notice, he blurred from sight and disappeared.</span></p>

Although Han Li’s concealment techniques were vastly inferior to Silvermoon’s techniques, this Qi retraining technique was able to rival her own.</span></p>

Not only could he completely erase the spiritual Qi from his own body, he was also able to forcefully conceal the aura from his own body. As of current, not only was he concealing himself from Spell Warrior Le, but also the unfathomably profound Moulan Sacred Bird.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the distant, Spell Warrior Le faintly revealed a trace of worry when she saw the cultivators tangle with the shriveled old man. Although she still guarded the ancient lanterns, she turned to the huge bird and beseeched the bird in an ancient language.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the azure flame bird heard this, it couldn’t help but pause and turn around to glance at the shriveled old man’s battle. With a trace of disdain from its eyes, it immediately turned its head back and shot several balls of azure flames into the sky, repulsing the Seven Great Truths cultivators and leaving them in confusion. Then with a clear cry, it spread its wings and took to the skies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It circled once in the air before facing the direction of the shriveled old man’s battle. Then with a tremble of its wings, a large expanse of azure feathers began to drop down from its body, and in a flash of light, each of the feathers turned into foot-long azure firebirds. Without any need for a command, these several hundreds of firebirds cawed and spread their wings, shooting towards the battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spell Warrior Le felt relieved at the scene. With these phantom birds, it was only a matter of time before victory was theirs.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, she suddenly heard a series of explosions from the center of the battlefield. Spell Warrior Le bewilderedly glanced over at the source of the noise. Han Li who was carefully&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">sneaking closer to Spell Warrior Le was also astonished by the noise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the very heart of the battlefield, a most important contest was taking place. The Myriad Soul Formation, the mist that formed under the combined effort of several tens of Ghost Spirit Sect disciples, had finally come to a stop and motionlessly floated in the air. Blocking it was an army of hollow spirit beasts formed by several Moulan Sages as well as the stone giant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the command of the Moulan Sages, the stone giant moved to block the Myriad Soul Formation once it defeated the Heavenly South cultivators attacking it. The recent noise was actually the stone giant slapping its hand down against the ghost mist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before its palm even landed, countless boulders fell from its hand. No matter how confident were the Ghost Spirit Sect disciples in the Myriad Soul spell formation, they didn’t dare to receive the attack. With a prompt hiss, the ghost mist dodged out of the way, traveling a distance of a hundred meters before stopping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Heavenly South and Moulan combatants saw this, they all realized that the battle had reached its most critical point. As a result, the Ghost Spirit Sect elder in charge of the formation came to a decision to use the spell formation’s killing maneuver, regardless of the cost.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before the stone giant could further pursue the ghost mist, a gloomy incantation was uttered by the cultivators within the ghost mist. As ghostly wails screamed from the mist, a pillar of crimson light soared into the sky and the eerie black ghost mist followed suit as if tainted by the light, turning crimson as the incantations continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the two Moulan Sages who were standing on top of the stone giant’s shoulders saw this, they appeared bewildered. A short moment, the incantations came to a stop and the crimson mist roiled to reveal several tens of various colored lights fleeing from the mist at utmost speed. They were the cultivators from the Ghost Spirit Sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two Moulan Sages were at a loss at the sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At that moment, crimson mist came to life after being abandoned by the Ghost Spirit Sect cultivators. Several various-sized tentacles intermittently emerged from the mist and wildly danced around as the center of the mist began to rapidly shrink.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Ghost Spirit Sect Elder in charge of the formation turned to face it after flying twenty meters away. He glanced at the crimson mist and thought, ‘Having absorbed so much blood essence from the spell warriors and the voluntary blood sacrifice, surely it will succeed!’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the Ghost Spirit Sect elder watched with restlessness, the crimson mist shrunk to over half its size before beginning to squirm. When the two Moulan Sages controlling the stone giant saw this, they immediately ordered the giant to fiercely stomp down upon it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, the level ground was obscured from sight by sinister yellow Yin winds, chilling to the core. Even the stone giant couldn’t help but pause for the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By the time the Moulan spell warriors could see what was happening, they astonishedly discovered that yellow gusts of Yin wind were surrounding the crimson mist, obscuring it from view. But then the yellow winds were forcefully blown open by a crimson silhouette as it emerged from within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the two Moulan Sages saw the appearance of the silhouette, they felt their breaths turn cold. It was a thirty-meter-tall Bloodvile Ghost.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Its devilish head had two horns and two glistening fangs, both incisively sharp, and a ponytail seemed to form behind it. Its arms appeared to be sculpted out of wood with dagger-like fingers and a layer of translucent scales seemed to wrap around them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although vile ghosts were ordinarily said to be huge, it was several times smaller when compared to the stone giant. However, the ghost showed no fear and instead screamed at the giant as it stared at it with a cold glint in its eye.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It lowered its head and its body darted like an arrow, launching itself at the lower leg of the stone giant. It extended its claws and swiped, immediately cleaving off a large portion of stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two Moulan Sages couldn’t allow this to continue and immediately had the stone giant to form fists and strike down at lightning speed, knocking the Bloodvile Ghost over thirty meters away. The strike had blown off half of its head, but it stood up as if nothing had happened. Then in a flash of crimson light, its head was restored as it charged to the stone giant once more.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the two Sage’s furious alarm, they ordered the hollow spirit beasts to attack and released their own magic treasures to assist the giant. As for the Ghost Spirit Sect cultivators that had fled from the ghost mist, they immediately turned around and joined the battle. Explosions continuously ruptured as crimson light continuously flashed from the battlefield.</span></p>

As a Moulan Sage, she knew of the might of the stone giant and was surprised to see that the Heavenly South cultivators were able to match it. But she wasn’t overly concerned over the matter. So long as the stone giant could persist for a moment more, she could call for the Moulan Sacred Bird to exterminate them and decide the battle. With that thought, she glanced at the huge bird a short distance away.</span></p>

In a spread of its wings, it separated the seven old men and the Yin Yang Devils.</span></p>

With two devils neutered, it then focused a majority of its attacks on the Seven Great Truths cultivators. Unable to endure, these seven old men soon found their lives to be in danger.</span></p>

When she turned around and saw that the lanterns were still half-full with oil, her heart appeared particularly steadfast.&nbsp;</span></p>

In a swift motion, she summoned an ember of fire from one of the lanterns and in a wave of her hand, it disappeared. Azure light flashed in an area a hundred meters away, followed by a shout of alarm. A silhouette appeared with his body sparkling in azure light; a layer of flame enveloped him.</span></p>

Then with a miserable scream, the flame turned the figure into ash.</span></p>
