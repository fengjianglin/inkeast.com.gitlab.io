 <p>“Divine Devilbane Lightning!” The black-robed woman shouted in alarm. Just as she thought to retaliate in fury from having her attack countered, she suddenly saw the lightning emitting from Han Li’s body, a net of crackling thunder rushing to envelop her. Horror on her face, her body transformed into smoke as she shot back, attempting to avoid the lightning at all costs.</p>
 <p>With an emotionless face, Han Li unfolded his wings and disappeared from sight. When she saw this, the black-robed woman immediately recalled what she had heard about Han Li and hastily formed an incantation gesture with her hands, her body of smoke blurring and shifting into eight identical copies, each one standing side by side.</p>
 <p>Each of them appeared real, and took actions of their own, splitting up and scattering in different directions in streaks of yellow light. It was unknown which copy was the true!</p>
 <p>In a flash of silver light, Han Li appeared where the woman original stood, thunder ringing behind him. He glanced at the scattered streaks of yellow light in a calm manner. There was even a trace of a sneer on his face. Spiritual power entering his eyes, blue light shined from deep within his pupils, activating the Brightsight Spirit Eyes.</p>
 <p>Han Li raised his head and peered into the distance. The silhouettes within the yellow light were all dim and possessed sparse spiritual Qi; they were all fakes.</p>
 <p>Han Li’s heart trembled and he hastily looked around him to suddenly discover that a nearly invisible thread of smile was silently approaching him from behind.</p>
 <p>The woman had used an illusion technique to capture his attention, and decided to use this gap in attention to seize the opportunity to launch a surprise attack on him rather than escape. The woman was both capable and bold. Were it not for his Brightsight Spirit Eyes, he wouldn’t have been able to detect her. The woman’s evasion techniques are no less skillful than Silvermoon’s, spiritual sense wasn’t enough to find any trace of her.</p>
 <p>Shocked to the core, Han Li silently turned around and flew straight towards the huge ape as if he had no further intention to chase after the black-robed woman.</p>
 <p>The faint thread of smoke had already arrived about ten meters away from Han Li. It paused and the woman’s body suddenly manifested in the air. An inch-long blade of yellow light shined from her hand in an attempt to strike Han Li from behind. From how it appeared, it seemed she was about to incisively strike at Han Li’s heart. If her attack struck true, his body was certain to be destroyed.</p>
 <p>But in the moment the woman was about to strike, Han Li turned around in a blur, his eyes immediately locking onto her. He opened his mouth, shooting golden light from his mouth.</p>
 <p>“Ah!” The black-robed woman’s face turned deathly pale and she hastily attempted to dodge, but she was too late. She couldn’t avoid the attack from such a close distance.</p>
 <p>Bang. A bolt of golden lightning shot out of Han Li’s mouth and directly struck the woman’s shoulder, filling the air with a burning scent. The woman screamed before falling down from the sky.</p>
 <p>Han Li flapped his wings, disappearing with thunder ringing behind him. Suddenly, Han Li reappeared behind the woman with a single hand enveloped in faint blue flames. He gently pressed it against her neck.</p>
 <p>Woosh. A dense layer of blue ice covered her entire body, isolating her from any other sensation but the cold. She then continued to fall from the sky, clad in ice.</p>
 <p>Han Li motionlessly floated in the air, already prepared with a handful of lightning arcing from his hand. He released the lightning and caught the iced woman inside of it. Then with a malicious glint from his eyes, golden light brilliantly shined around her iced figure and in a series of explosions, the black-robed woman turned into specks of icy light before disappearing without a trace.</p>
 <p>The sole thing that remained in the lightning net was the woman’s Nascent Soul. The Nascent Soul’s complexion was deathly white as if it held the Divine Devilbane Lightning in complete fear.</p>
 <p>Han Li glanced at her and just as he was about to exterminate the Nascent Soul, the Nascent Soul shrieked, “You cannot kill me! I am the Dao Companion of the Jin Empire’s Sifting Yin Sect Master. If you kill me, my sect will not rest until you are dead!”</p>
 <p>“The Yin Sifting Sect Master’s Dao Companion!” Han Li coldly watched the Nascent Soul for a moment before suddenly relaxing his grip on the lightning and turning away. The woman’s Nascent Soul was stunned for a moment before joyously flying through the gap, her mind filled with malicious thoughts of revenge.</p>
 <p>But just when she was thirty meters away from Han Li, the net suddenly tightened once more, tightly binding the Nascent Soul into the net. Soon after, thunder roared and the black-robed woman’s Nascent Soul turned to ash.</p>
 <p>“Now that I’ve already destroyed your body, how could I possibly allow you to the chance for revenge?” Han Li muttered to himself helplessly and deeply sighed before turning his attention back to the huge ape.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Although the series of events in which Han Li had exterminated the woman was complex, the matter had only occurred in the blink of an eye. The shriveled old spell warrior was already flying towards her in a streak of golden light during her time of danger.</p>
 <p>But in that moment, a strange pink light appeared nearby and turned into a large pink cloud, directly enveloping the shriveled spell warrior.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In a series of rumbles, the shriveled old spell warrior managed to scatter the pink mist, and the light around him scattered to revealed an ashen complexion. He rigidly stared at the pink mist with eyes of rage. He truly didn’t know what the Yin Sifting Sect Master would do when he found out his Dao Companion was killed. He could only grit his teeth in rage at Han Li and whoever it was that blocked him.</p>
 <p>A series of soft chuckles came from the pink cloud and soon it disappeared to reveal a handsome youth with a soft face. He was the Harmonious Bond Sect’s Devil Cloudpart.</p>
 <p>Devil Cloudpart chuckled and glanced at Han Li. “Fellow Daoist Han, now that I’ve helped you, the debt is repaid.”</p>
 <p>Having just flown back from killing the black-robed woman, Han Li replied, “It was only a chance matter that I freed you. I wasn’t looking to be repaid. More importantly, Divine Sage Zhu isn’t something the two of us can deal with, and he isn’t alone.”</p>
 <p>Once that was said, Han Li swept his gaze past the shriveled old man. In addition to the black-robed spell warriors that were doing their utmost to stop the huge ape’s massacre, there was an army of spell warriors flying across the horizon. As bold as Devil Cloudpart may be, his expression immediately revealed surprise when he saw their great numbers.</p>
 <p>Earlier, Han Li had managed to rescue Devil Cloudpart from the barrier in a fluke by using two of the lightning beads. But just as Han Li was making plans to fight together with him, he suddenly saw the Yin Sifting Sect release a vast quantity of Copper-armored Corpses. It was then that Han Li decided to release the Weeping Soul Beast, curious about its abilities now that he had refined the Weeping Soul Pearl in its entirety. As soon as it had appeared it caused an uproar with great enthusiasm and began to vigorously absorb the refined corpses around it.</p>
 <p>But what came as a surprise was how effective the Weeping Soul beast was against corpses that cultivators have refined. Han Li knew that the Weeping Soul Beast was adept at devouring the souls of demons and ghosts, but it seemed its strange abilities had undergone an evolution along with its body. A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.</p>
 <p>Now that they’ve found themselves facing so many spell warriors, Han Li and Devil Cloudpart glanced at each other, both intending to flee. However, the Weeping Soul Beast was still rampaging amongst the armies refined corpses. Han Li was unwilling to abandon it there.</p>
 <p>Just as Han Li thought to use the Weeping Soul Pearl to order it to retreat, he suddenly heard roaring laughter from behind him. “Have no fear, Fellow Daoist Han! Since you’ve released this great beast to deal with the refined corpses, we will help you deal these spell warriors.”</p>
 <p>When Han Li heard Long Han’s voice, he felt his heart stir. He quickly turned and saw Long Han a hundred meters away, leading a squad of cultivators.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Han Li was delighted. It was no wonder the spell warriors didn’t immediately launch an attack. It seemed they were treating the situation carefully, having seen cultivator reinforcements were approaching them as well.</p>
 <p>When Long Han saw Han Li’s demonform self, a trace of astonishment momentarily appeared on his face, but he soon turned a blind eye to it. Now was not the time to ask about it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The cultivators were all watching the spell warriors across from them. The entire battlefield had already gone through a bitter struggle, and the time has come for the decisive battle.</p>
 <p>Both sides had their own victories and defeats as well as a vast number of losses. However, these battles weren’t merely spars. Those that lost the battle, lost their lives, and those that won would have to continue the fight, exhausted.</p>
 <p>Long Han had sent other cultivators to keep Tian Zhong occupied, freeing his Dao Companion Feng Bing for a different battle. It was only when they were together that he would mobilize their true strength. Now that matters have reached this stage, Long Han had nothing else to say to the shriveled old spell warrior.</p>
 <p>Long Han softly waved his arm. The troops that he had preserved until now were elites. They promptly summoned their magic treasures and began their momentous attack, their bodies glowing with bright light.</p>
 <p>The spell warriors they were facing were unordinary as well, and they summoned their spiritual Qi to confront them. Suddenly, the final confrontation between each army was about to begin.</p>
 <p>Although the spell warriors had an additional late Nascent Soul spell warrior, with Devil Cloudpart present along with four other mid Nascent Soul cultivators, they would be able to forcefully restrain him. Han Li thought to join the attack against the shriveled old man’s spell warriors, but when he swept his gaze over to the Sacred Bird, his expression vastly changed.</p>
