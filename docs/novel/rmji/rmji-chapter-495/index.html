 <p><strong>Chapter 495: Mysterious Scroll Painting</strong></p>
 <p>Han Li had already been prepared for the arrow to attempt to escape. Within the arrow’s first few meters of flight, Han Li shot out an azure swordstreak that intercepted it, causing it to tumble.</p>
 <p>In that opening, the Weeping Soul Beast wrapped the small arrow in a yellow radiance, causing the magic treasure to incessantly flash. The arrow dashed back and forth within the cage of light as if wanting to escape, but the yellow light appeared immensely more powerful than it. No matter how much the arrow struggled, it was unable to escape. This was to be expected of the beast that was known to be the bane of all ghosts.</p>
 <p>As the small arrow’s resistance grew weaker, yellow threads shot out from the cage of light and tightly bound the small arrow in an instant. The yellow threads then grew taut and dragged out a ball of green light from within the small arrow.</p>
 <p>The green light was ensnared by many yellow threads and incessantly transformed into all sorts of animals and insects as well as fluctuating in size in its attempt to break free. Despite its efforts, it was unable to escape from the yellow threads and was gradually drawn closer and closer to the Weeping Soul Beast’s nose.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the green light grew panicked and transformed into the face of an old man. The light loudly pleaded towards Han Li, “Young Friend Han, I beg you to let me go. So long as you spare my life, I will willingly serve you for the rest of my life. The number of strange and secret techniques I know are countless, and I am willing to give you all of them! Moreover, doesn’t Young Friend Han wish to learn the entirety of the Profound Yin Arts? I didn’t even teach the last few layers to my traitorous disciple Zenith Yin. Doesn’t Fellow Daoist Han also wish to know about the wonders of Profound Soul Demonification? Although my own estate had been seized by Zenith Yin, I still have many secret cave dwellings, each containing their own hidden treasures. This old servant is willing to fully devote himself to you...”</p>
 <p>The more the ghostly face spoke, the quicker the words came out and the more panicked it appeared. He even took the initiative to offer to become a servant because at that moment, he was only about a foot away from the Weeping Soul Beast’s nose.</p>
 <p>If he were to truly be absorbed by the beast, even if his soul were more tenacious, he would never be able to escape.</p>
 <p>Despite having a will far more staunch and unwavering than others, Han Li’s heart thumped upon hearing the Bone Sage’s offers, and his face revealed a trace of hesitation.</p>
 <p>Perhaps due to having seen Han Li’s hesitation, the ghost revealed his greatest trump card with a low roar, “Even if Fellow Daoist Han doesn’t want those things, don’t you want to know the weaknesses of Zenith Yin’s cultivation arts? And how about removing the tracing mark he placed on your body?”</p>
 <p>Han Li’s gaze flickered several times and his expression continuously shifted. He sighed and lightly waved his hand, causing the radiance encasing the Bone Sage to grow still, preventing him from continuing towards the Weeping Soul Beast’s nose.</p>
 <p>The thread-bound ghost rejoiced and sighed with relief, “Young Friend Han, you are truly wise! By sparing this old man...” The ghost face forced a smile and intended to ingratiate himself to Han Li.</p>
 <p>But when the Bone Sage was about to continue, the Weeping Soul Beast snorted and resumed sucking in the Bone Sage. With his guard now down, he was sucked in without the slightest resistance.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Han Li wore a cold sneer.</p>
 <p>The Weeping Soul Beast burped as if it was quite satisfied with his meal and clumsily patted its stomach.</p>
 <p>With a faint smile, Han Li shook the Weeping Soul Pearl in his hand and returned the beast to his storage pouch.</p>
 <p>Han Li walked forward with the small green arrow now in his grasp. As he gazed at it, he muttered, “You want to be my servant? How could I possibly choose to act against my own interests?! You lived for over a thousand years! It would already be baseless flattery to say that I could possibly stand to outscheme you. Killing you now will save me quite a bit trouble. Who knows when you would betray me.”</p>
 <p>Even now, Han Li was unable to understand whether the ghost had been the Bone Sage’s true soul or a soul shard that he had split off earlier! Han Li wouldn’t be surprised if Ghost Daoists had such soul splitting techniques.</p>
 <p>After Han Li picked up the Five Element Bands that were lying nearby, and lingered for a moment. The ghost face had reminded him of the marker that Zenith Yin had placed on him. If he didn’t figure out how to remove it, he might be detected immediately after he left the barrier.</p>
 <p>Han Li had already examined himself several times with his spiritual sense, but hadn’t been able to find the slightest trace. However, Han Li still had another way to look for any markings. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have so rashly exterminated the ghost.</p>
 <p>Han Li released several thousand Gold Devouring Beetles into the air and had them crawl all over his body.</p>
 <p>After a short moment, a few of the Gold Devouring Beetles on his lower leg released a peculiar shriek.</p>
 <p>Han Li rejoiced and issued the command. The Gold Devouring Beetles on his leg became restless for a moment, before they all returned to his spirit beast pouch. Han Li then flew towards the stone steps without further delay.</p>
 <p>He felt that he had tarried for far too long and was on edge with fear.</p>
 <p>He traveled the hundred meters down the stairs in the blink of an eye. Han Li then opened his mouth and spat out a streak of blue light, cleaving open a three meter hole in the light barrier with his Bamboo Cloudswarm Sword. He then shot out of the hole in a streak of light.</p>
 <p>According to his calculations, his best bet would be to stealthily return to the first or second floor and enter one of the doors. Afterwards, he would break the restrictions on the secret room and return to Heavenvoid Hall. As for the rooms on the other floors, they were far too dangerous for him.</p>
 <p>Han Li shot along the path he remembered in complete silence. On his way back, the restrictions and puppets had all been long since eliminated. Apart from being careful about avoiding the old devils, he didn’t have any other worries, and flew as boldly as he could.</p>
 <p>Because Han Li could see the path ahead with his spiritual sense, he took out the shabby scroll he had acquired from the hollow wall and decided to use the time to read it.</p>
 <p>“Yi!”</p>
 <p>After taking several quick glances at it, he couldn’t help but yell in shock and slow down, despite having planned to rush through the passageway. The scroll didn’t appear exceptional and didn’t contain the slightest spiritual power. Rather, the scroll contained a rather crude and simple drawing, depicting a vague map.</p>
 <p>After Han Li studied it several times, he immediately recognized it to be a map of the fifth floor of the Inner Halls.</p>
 <p>Needless to say, there was a drawing of a stone platform along with a cauldron that had two handles and three legs at the very top. This was clearly a picture of the Heavenvoid Cauldron. There was also a crossed marking in front of it that was certain to be indicating a secret room!.</p>
 <p>But what shocked Han Li the most were the passageways that were traced with bright red ink, standing out from the rest of the black ink map. The route led to a picture of a high wall with a transportation formation behind it.</p>
 <p>According to Han Li’s original plan, he would return to the first or second floor and pray that he wouldn’t encounter any of the old devils along the way. If this map was accurate, then couldn’t he just use the transportation formation it showed to leave this place? Even if it didn’t take him outside of the Heavenvoid Hall, it would almost certainly be much safer than foolishly forcing his way through the fifth floor.</p>
 <p>Han Li was more specifically tempted by how close he already was to the marked path. He was only an intersection away from entering the red lined path.</p>
 <p>However, his sole worry was whether or not he would encounter any restrictions or puppets along the way. He had no worries towards the validity of the map. How could it possibly be fake? Not only was it hidden behind a hollow wall, but it seemed to be as old as the Heavenvoid Hall itself. Who would spend so much effort just to play a joke?</p>
 <p>After extended period of indecision, Han Li arrived at the intersection. He continuously glanced around as he was still unsure of what path to take.</p>
 <p>‘Whatever! If I come across any dangers, at worst, I’ll just return to the previous path. According to the map, the route isn’t very long. As such, it should prove much safer than returning to the previous floor.’ Moreover, he didn’t believe that the map would mark out a route for escape that would include many dangers along its path.</p>
 <p>With that thought, Han Li spread out his arms. Many lights flashed around him to reveal a crowd of huge ape puppets. Under his command, they immediately set forth down the passage as he closely followed after them with a solemn expression.</p>
