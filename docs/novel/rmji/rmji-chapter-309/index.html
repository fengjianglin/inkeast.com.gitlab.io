  <p>“You can’t withstand it! Quickly, dodge!”</p>
  <p>Resisting sharp pain, Steward Wang loudly shouted while in Han Li’s grasp in an attempt to warn the young prince.</p>
  <p>Obviously, his warning came too late.</p>
  <p>Hearing this, the young prince subconsciously leaned to the side, wanting to dodge the point of the huge azure sword. However, the sword suddenly changed its cleave to a slice, softly sweeping past his legs. The black Qi protecting his body scattered from the attack and didn’t have the slightest of effect.</p>
  <p>As a result, the sword sliced through his two calves with great ease. The young prince loudly shouted, fainting on the scene.</p>
  <p>This person who had lived a life of luxury since birth, though he may be exceptionally shrewd, had never experienced such sufferings before. Naturally, he wasn’t able to bear the pain of lacerated legs.</p>
  <p>However, this scene scared Han Li; because he hadn’t used the azure essence sword streak in so long, he believed that he had accidentally killed him!</p>
  <p>After figuring out what just happened, Han Li happily laughed as he picked this person up and flew back to the Four Friends of Meng Mountain.</p>
  <p>Han Li grew very cheerful from his decisive victory, but at the same time, he felt somewhat puzzled.</p>
  <p>From the feeling of danger the young prince and Steward Wang gave him, these two should’ve been far more dangerous. However, he was able to capture them alive very easily. Could it be that his mysterious intuition had started to fail him?</p>
  <p>Han Li shook his head and felt something was strange.</p>
  <p>At this moment, the black-clothed men lingering around had witnessed this scene and knew that remaining there any longer would be unfavorable. After exchanging mutual glances, they started to scatter and escape in the blink of an eye, leaving behind no traces of them ever being there.</p>
  <p>Han Li had no intention of chasing after them. There were only foreign elements, much like the Four Friends of Meng Mountain. They were fundamentally unworthy of a strenuous pursuit.</p>
  <p>As he thought this, he flew back to the Four Friends of Meng Mountain and casually threw down his two captives, saying indifferently, “Treat their injuries. We still need to interrogate them!”</p>
  <p>The youth and the second brother immediately acted, catching the two. They didn’t dare to show the slightest negligence.</p>
  <p>At this moment, not only did the Four Friends of Meng Mountain appear respectful, but their hearts were also filled with reverence toward him. Han Li’s recent display of great and profound power left them with an unforgettable impression.</p>
  <p>“Senior’s cultivation is truly profound. It has greatly broadened these juniors’ perspective,” the dark-faced old man said with complete respect.</p>
  <p>“It was nothing but minor skill!”</p>
  <p>When Han Li saw the four friends’ expressions of reverence, he couldn’t help but feel somewhat proud. However, he put on an appearance that such a thing wasn’t worth mentioning, causing the four to feel that Senior Han was profoundly mysterious!</p>
  <p><em>Dang! Dang!&nbsp;</em>At this moment, these loud bangs caused Han Li’s complexion to slightly change.</p>
  <p>The four friends hastily looked over. After the middle-aged woman took a clear look, she pointed with a panicked appearance and shouted to Han Li, “Senior, quickly look! Your magic tool!”</p>
  <p>Han Li had already turned his head over to look at the “Heaven Shrouding Cup” trapping the large bald man. Startlingly loud noises rang from within, accompanied by unimaginable deformations appearing on its exterior.</p>
  <p>With each following sound, the wall of the Heaven Shrouding Cup protruded even more. After over ten more large sounds, the cup was no longer recognizable, and slightest resemblance to its original shape could not be seen.</p>
  <p>But what was even worse was that the cup’s yellow light had grown far duller. It seemed that the large bald man could break through the cup at any moment.</p>
  <p>Han Li was overwhelmed with shock!</p>
  <p>Although he didn’t know why this inconceivable scene occurred, it was obvious that this Heaven Shrouding Cup couldn’t contain him. His only choice at the moment was to take other actions.</p>
  <p>With this thought, Han Li retrieved the many magic tools that were orbiting above him and took out seven to eight puppet beasts. He had the four puppets he had originally taken out form a line in front of Han Li and the four friends, creating a barrier.</p>
  <p>Just as this was accomplished, the sound of a huge explosion could be heard as the “Heaven Shrouding Cup” magic tool shattered into multiple pieces. Then, an inhuman monster flew out from its remains.</p>
  <p>“What is that?”</p>
  <p>When the middle-aged woman saw this, she involuntarily cried out. The complexions of the three at her side also turned green with disbelief.</p>
  <p>Even Han Li was astonished at what he saw.</p>
  <p>The large bald man who had leap out completely resembled a demon in both appearance and physique.</p>
  <p>His height was now over six meters. His teeth were sharp and wild. Two black horns protruded from his head. A long, scaled iron tail dragged behind him. But what was most astonishing were the black and red demonic patterns covering his entire body. A majority of his bare body had been concealed by an unspeakably fiendish Qi.</p>
  <p>The large bald man’s original appearance could faintly be made out from his face, but his eyes were glowing with a green ominous light, completely filled with the desire for blood and slaughter. The slightest of humanity no longer remained. He looked toward Han Li and the others with an ice-cold glance and crouched down, like a drawn arrow ready to be shot.</p>
  <p>When the Four Friends of Meng Mountain saw this, they dreaded disaster. But just as they were at a loss as to what to do, they suddenly heard Han Li’s voice.</p>
  <p>“Release your magic tools!”</p>
  <p>Following Han Li’s command, over ten puppets in front of them simultaneously opened their mouths and shot out over ten beams of light, striking the transformed demon like lightning. The unguarded opponent was sent tumbling to the ground.</p>
  <p>Seeing this, the Four Friends of Meng Mountain couldn’t help but be greatly joyous and impulsively released their magic tools, attacking the large man from every direction. They wished to quickly dispatch of this frightening monster.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, their beautiful dream only lasted for a fleeting moment before a stream of fiendish Qi shot toward the sky from the large man as he furiously jumped up. Regardless of what magic tool was attacking him, there wasn’t the slightest of injury. This caused the four friends’ eyes to open wide from shock.</p>
  <p>The transformed demon madly roared to the sky and suddenly started to wildly flourish his arms like windmills, striking at the magic tools that surrounded him. In an instant, his incredibly sharp fingers thoroughly sliced them to bits and turned them into scrap metal fragments.</p>
  <p>Without waiting for the four friends to recover from their shock, the transformed demon’s eyes glowed with jade light and his body shook several times, appearing in front the barrier protecting Han Li and the others. It extended its claws and fiercely swung.</p>
  <p><em>Crash.</em></p>
  <p>The dark-faced old man quickly acted and activated the shield blocking the attack just in time. However, five deep claw marks remained on the shield. Furthermore, the old man’s complexion turned extremely pale in an instant; it was obvious his magic power was not enough to maintain the shield against the onslaught.</p>
  <p>Seeing this, the large man laughed evilly and used his other claw to strike the shield at the speed of lightning.</p>
  <p>However, his expression immediately changed. He abruptly withdrew his claw and pulled back his arms, forming a cross in front of his body.</p>
  <p>At this moment, the second wave of light beams came from his front, harshly striking him once more.</p>
  <p>However, this time the transformed demon wasn’t knocked down by the attack. He was only forcibly pushed back by the wave of attacks by about a hundred meters. This caused the dark-faced old man, who received the first claw attack, to finally let out a long breath. He wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and nervously said to the other three, “His attacks are too ferocious. A single person’s magic power won’t last against his strikes. Everyone, gather your strength to power the shield!”</p>
  <p>Hearing the words of their eldest brother, the remaining three friends reached out without hesitation and placed their hands on the old man’s shoulders, frenziedly pouring spiritual power into his body.</p>
  <p>In an instant, color returned to dark-faced old man’s complexion.</p>
  <p>The second attack had no effect on the man transformed into a demon, which appeared to become even more violent. As soon as the puppet beasts’ light beams faded away, it immediately charged forward again, brandishing its fangs and claws. But as it was about to strike the white scale shield, another wave of light beams struck it back to its original location.</p>
  <p>Seeing this, Han Li tensely wrinkled his brow.</p>
  <p>Since this monster was able to break through the “Heaven Shrouding Cup” and its body could resist the puppet beasts’ light beam attacks, it was clear that common top-grade magic tools wouldn’t have any effects. Only treasure talismans would do any damage.</p>
  <p>With this thought, Han Li didn’t hesitate any further and commanded the Four Friends of Meng Mountain, “Keep it busy with the puppet beasts. I need some time to cast my magic!”</p>
  <p>With that said, Han Li did not wait for their response. He took out the azure mist talisman from his storage pouch and solemnly sat down with his eyes closed, the talisman in his hands.</p>
  <p>Han Li didn’t tell them about the matter of the treasure talisman because he understood that as loose cultivators, they most likely would not have known of such a thing, More importantly, now was not the time to explain.</p>
  <p>His neat and incisive methods illustrated that Han Li simply did not tolerate opposition from the Four Friends of Meng Mountain. These four friends also clearly understood this. After they mutually glanced at each other, the dark-faced old man could only gather his courage and agree.</p>
  <p>After that, the transformed demon threw itself forward seven to eight more times in successive attacks, but each attack was met with dejected failure.</p>
  <p>Although that white scale shield was riddled with traces of damage from the opponent’s claws, under the control of the four friends, it was able to obstruct his incisive jade-shattering claws. They were even able to repel it a certain distance away with the additional aid of the puppet beasts’ light beam attacks. Without an immediate succession of attacks from the transformed demon, the four friends were able to somewhat catch their breath.</p>

 <p>When the Four Friends of Meng Mountain saw this, they dreaded disaster. But just as they were at a loss as to what to do, they suddenly heard Han Li’s voice.</p>
 <p>“Release your magic tools!”</p>
 <p>Following Han Li’s command, over ten puppets in front of them simultaneously opened their mouths and shot out over ten beams of light, striking the transformed demon like lightning. The unguarded opponent was sent tumbling to the ground.</p>
 <p>Seeing this, the Four Friends of Meng Mountain couldn’t help but be greatly joyous and impulsively released their magic tools, attacking the large man from every direction. They wished to quickly dispatch of this frightening monster.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, their beautiful dream only lasted for a fleeting moment before a stream of fiendish Qi shot toward the sky from the large man as he furiously jumped up. Regardless of what magic tool was attacking him, there wasn’t the slightest of injury. This caused the four friends’ eyes to open wide from shock.</p>
 <p>The transformed demon madly roared to the sky and suddenly started to wildly flourish his arms like windmills, striking at the magic tools that surrounded him. In an instant, his incredibly sharp fingers thoroughly sliced them to bits and turned them into scrap metal fragments.</p>
 <p>Without waiting for the four friends to recover from their shock, the transformed demon’s eyes glowed with jade light and his body shook several times, appearing in front the barrier protecting Han Li and the others. It extended its claws and fiercely swung.</p>
 <p><em>Crash.</em></p>
 <p>The dark-faced old man quickly acted and activated the shield blocking the attack just in time. However, five deep claw marks remained on the shield. Furthermore, the old man’s complexion turned extremely pale in an instant; it was obvious his magic power was not enough to maintain the shield against the onslaught.</p>
 <p>Seeing this, the large man laughed evilly and used his other claw to strike the shield at the speed of lightning.</p>
 <p>However, his expression immediately changed. He abruptly withdrew his claw and pulled back his arms, forming a cross in front of his body.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the second wave of light beams came from his front, harshly striking him once more.</p>
 <p>However, this time the transformed demon wasn’t knocked down by the attack. He was only forcibly pushed back by the wave of attacks by about a hundred meters. This caused the dark-faced old man, who received the first claw attack, to finally let out a long breath. He wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and nervously said to the other three, “His attacks are too ferocious. A single person’s magic power won’t last against his strikes. Everyone, gather your strength to power the shield!”</p>
 <p>Hearing the words of their eldest brother, the remaining three friends reached out without hesitation and placed their hands on the old man’s shoulders, frenziedly pouring spiritual power into his body.</p>
 <p>In an instant, color returned to dark-faced old man’s complexion.</p>
 <p>The second attack had no effect on the man transformed into a demon, which appeared to become even more violent. As soon as the puppet beasts’ light beams faded away, it immediately charged forward again, brandishing its fangs and claws. But as it was about to strike the white scale shield, another wave of light beams struck it back to its original location.</p>
 <p>Seeing this, Han Li tensely wrinkled his brow.</p>
 <p>Since this monster was able to break through the “Heaven Shrouding Cup” and its body could resist the puppet beasts’ light beam attacks, it was clear that common top-grade magic tools wouldn’t have any effects. Only treasure talismans would do any damage.</p>
 <p>With this thought, Han Li didn’t hesitate any further and commanded the Four Friends of Meng Mountain, “Keep it busy with the puppet beasts. I need some time to cast my magic!”</p>
 <p>With that said, Han Li did not wait for their response. He took out the azure mist talisman from his storage pouch and solemnly sat down with his eyes closed, the talisman in his hands.</p>
 <p>Han Li didn’t tell them about the matter of the treasure talisman because he understood that as loose cultivators, they most likely would not have known of such a thing, More importantly, now was not the time to explain.</p>
 <p>His neat and incisive methods illustrated that Han Li simply did not tolerate opposition from the Four Friends of Meng Mountain. These four friends also clearly understood this. After they mutually glanced at each other, the dark-faced old man could only gather his courage and agree.</p>
 <p>After that, the transformed demon threw itself forward seven to eight more times in successive attacks, but each attack was met with dejected failure.</p>
 <p>Although that white scale shield was riddled with traces of damage from the opponent’s claws, under the control of the four friends, it was able to obstruct his incisive jade-shattering claws. They were even able to repel it a certain distance away with the additional aid of the puppet beasts’ light beam attacks. Without an immediate succession of attacks from the transformed demon, the four friends were able to somewhat catch their breath.</p>
