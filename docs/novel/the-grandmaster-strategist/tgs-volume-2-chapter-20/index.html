    Before Suiyun fully recovered, the Prince of Qi paid a personal visit. At this time, a clear distinction had been made between the Crown Prince and the Prince of Yong. Many were left puzzled by the Prince of Qi’s behavior, later learning that the Prince of Qi was adept at self-preservation.…

  <p>On the morning of the second day, while I was still half-asleep, I could faintly sense that someone was covering me with a blanket. The person’s movements were extremely unfamiliar. I suddenly woke up. To tell the truth, after gaining a new lease on life, I was no longer so apathetic about the affairs around me. I opened my eyes slightly, catching sight of Prince Li Xian of Qi sitting beside the bed, a fearful look in his eyes. Xiaoshunzi was nearby, glaring at him like a tiger stalking its prey. I was moved. From what the Prince of Yong told me, while I was struggling on the border between life and death, the Prince of Qi learned that I needed a bear gallbladder to prolong my life. Disregarding suspicions that could be engendered, he delivered the bear gallbladder in his possession. Princess Changle sending Ningpo figwort and bear gallbladder was already outside my expectations. The Prince of Qi’s actions were even more shocking. Why would he do this, knowing that it would anger the crown prince? However, I did not fully open my eyes. What could I say? I had already made my choice. Even if I did not serve the Prince of Yong, it was unlikely that I would follow the Prince of Qi. This being the case, it was preordained that our relationship would never be that of a liege and vassal, so why should I incite something additional to worry about?</p>
  <p>The Prince of Qi heaved a sigh, turning to leave. As he walked out, he was stopped. Xiaoshunzi followed him out, closing the door behind him. Pricking my ears, I heard the Prince of Qi softly speak to Xiaoshunzi, “I know that you are not an ordinary individual. Remember to ask your master the point of getting mixed up in this situation. He is someone who does not cherish fame and money. The Fengyi Sect cannot be provoked lightly. Even if they don’t act, do you think that the Crown Prince does not have experts by his side? Suiyun is only a weak scholar. He was able to luckily preserve his life this time, but what about next time? Urge him to leave Chang’an.”</p>
  <p>I could hear Xiaoshunzi’s impersonal and placid reply, “Your Imperial Highness lectures correctly. This servant will naturally pass this message on to the young master.”</p>
  <p>After a while, Xiaoshunzi pushed open the door and walked in. He radiated an icy killing aura. I looked at him strangely and asked, “What’s going on? Do you greatly dislike the Prince of Qi?”</p>
  <p>Xiaoshunzi angrily answered, “Who wanted him to come cry crocodile tears?<sup><span data-toggle="tooltip" title="猫哭耗子, maokuhaozi – idiom, lit. the cat weeps for dead mice; hypocritical pretense of condolences, crocodile tears">1</span></sup> Don’t tell me that he believes that we are aware of the role that he plays?”</p>
  <p>I raised my eyebrows, signaling my lack of understanding. Xiaoshunzi calmed down and stated, “These days, His Imperial Highness, the Prince of Yong, and I have both been occupied with young master’s recovery. Responsibility for interrogating and investigating of this residence was assigned to General Sima. General Sima discovered that the bow and arrows abandoned by the assassin came from the army. However, it is easier said than done to bring arrows and a bow into this residence. The security screening of guests for the banquet on the sixteenth day was extremely tight. On that day, there was absolutely no way for anyone to bring in a bow and arrow. The only possibility is if there was a traitor inside the prince’s household who hid the bow and arrows. However, General Sima’s investigation did not turn up any clues. Afterwards, we remembered that the Princess of Qi had come to pay a visit to the Princess of Yong on the fifteenth. We definitely could not carefully search the Princess of Qi’s carriage. Therefore, General Sima suspects that the bow and arrows were brought in by the Princess of Qi to be used by the assassin.”</p>
  <p>I calmly replied, “This kind of thing cannot be confirmed. The only thing that can be done is reorganizing the defenses of the prince’s residence. Although His Imperial Highness previously repeatedly suffered dangers, at the time, the Fengyi Sect had not yet formally supported the Crown Prince. Therefore, the defenses were sufficient. However, these defenses were naturally unsuitable faced with assassins from the Fengyi Sect.”</p>
  <p>Xiaoshunzi neutrally inquired, “Young master, can you confirm that the assassin was from the Fengyi Sect?”</p>
  <p>Seeing the fire in his eyes, I was afraid that he would recklessly go out to kill if I answered in the affirmative. Thus, I could only shake my head and respond, “I only say that the assassin’s level should not be below that of the Fengyi Sect. However, I did say that this was perpetrated by the Fengyi Sect. That day, I only caught a glimpse of the assassin. If I were to see that person again, I would be able to recognize the assassin. It is sufficient as long as I can affirm that Qin Qing was not involved.”</p>
  <p>Xiaoshunzi frowned and replied, “Apart from him, there is only Xiahou Yuanfeng and Li Hanyou. General Pei was by young master’s side. The Duke of Wei’s identity should preclude him from committing such a deed.”</p>
  <p>I lightly explained, “Xiahou Yuanfeng stated that he went out to relieve himself. Li Hanyou said that she did not like the raucous noise of the banquet; therefore after extending her congratulations, she went to the inner residence to see the Princess of Yong. These two individuals are both possible suspects. However, we cannot eliminate the possibility that someone else snuck in. We all know that those skilled enough to directly head towards the Cold Courtyard to assassinate have to either be that day’s guests or traitors within the prince’s household. However, this cannot be used as proof. Therefore, although those two are the most suspicious, the Prince of Yong cannot have them arrested.” I could not say that the act was perpetrated by Li Hanyou. After all, I had never even seen her before. It was better to not utter such a conjecture without proof.</p>
  <p>Xiaoshunzi calculatedly remarked, “Matters that the Prince of Yong cannot handle, I can handle. As long as young master permits it, I will go immediately to kill them.”</p>
  <p>I smiled. “Don’t cause trouble. How can we not be reasonable? If this was perpetrated by them, they will make things difficult for us in the future. Do you believe that you won’t have the opportunity to deal with them? All right, it’s better if you go chase and kill Vicious Killer. Whatever happens, we cannot allow him to get away and cause trouble in the future.”</p>
  <p>Xiaoshunzi coolly voiced, “Do not worry, young master. I have already rearranged the defenses of the Cold Courtyard. Previously, young master did not like having the guards too close. This time, we cannot do as young master wishes.”</p>
  <p>I awkwardly conveyed, “This … I won’t drive them off.”</p>
  <p>Seeing that I was this way, Xiaoshunzi said, “Once I have returned, we will do as you wish. If I am not present, young master cannot have nobody waiting by your side.”</p>
  <p>I repeatedly nodded my head. Because of this assassination, Xiaoshunzi felt extremely guilty, constantly feeling that he had not properly protected me. However, he was not a remorseful individual. Therefore, from now on, he would absolutely not allow me to do as I pleased. Although I was fond of being free and unrestrained, I valued my life more. Previously, they did not know of my importance and yet I had almost lost my life. Now, it was likely that every step I took was dangerous. How could I dare to act willfully? In any case, it was only more guards around me. I only needed to ignore them.</p>
  <p>Xiaoshunzi hurriedly departed. I knew that he was chasing after Vicious Killer to kill him. Apparently, this was because the assassin had escaped several attempts to capture him. If Xiaoshunzi did not chase after him, it was likely that he would escape back to Southern Chu. If he could not personally participate in killing the assassin, then Xiaoshunzi could not forgive himself.</p>
  <p>I comfortably lay out. My most important mission right now was to recover. Thinking of Sang Chen’s warnings, I did not wish to live only ten more years. I needed to start practicing the abandoned nourishing methods again. Life was so richly colorful; wouldn’t it be a pity if I were to die before my time? Narrowly escaping death this time, I viewed many things with tranquility. Even when thinking of Piaoxiang, my heart no longer dwelled on the pain and suffering, instead remembering her beauty and the happiness we once shared.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center">***</p>
  <p>Leaving the Prince of Yong’s residence, Prince Li Xian of Qi casually returned to his own residence. When he arrived at the entrance of the Golden Valley Courtyard that only he could enter, Li Xian saw Qin Zheng waiting with several maids. The Golden Valley Courtyard was Li Xian’s own chambers. Without permission, no one was permitted to enter. Even the Princess of Qi, Qin Zheng, was not permitted entry. Therefore, she waited by the entrance.</p>
  <p>Seeing Qin Zheng, Li Xian revealed a mocking smile as he said, “<em>Aiyah</em>! The Princess is pregnant, why are you standing here? This Prince cannot afford to take responsibility if something untoward were to happen. I wonder if the Princess has any admonishments?”</p>
  <p>Qin Zheng trembled before she replied, “Your Imperial Highness, I, your servant, do not understand why Your Imperial Highness so treats this servant’s good intentions. The Crown Prince and you are in the same boat. However, days earlier you not only sent precious medicines, but also made inquiries, causing the Crown Prince to feel unhappy. Doesn’t your visit just now completely disregard the existence of the Crown Prince? I, your servant, am only giving consideration to Your Imperial Highness. Why does Your Imperial Highness …”</p>
  <p>“Shut your mouth,” hollered Li Xian coldly, grim and heartless. “Princess, do I need to speak of what you have done? Why did the Fengyi Sect suddenly think to assassinate Jiang Zhe? How was that bow and arrows brought into my brother’s residence? Do you really think this Prince is an idiot? Jiang Zhe once saved this Prince’s life. Although this Prince did not have the fortune to attain his service, who allowed you to exceed your place and meddle in these affairs,<sup><span data-toggle="tooltip" title="越俎代庖, yuezudaipao – idiom, lit. to go beyond the sacrificial altar and take over the kitchen; fig. to exceed one’s place and meddle in other people’s affairs">2</span></sup> inviting your sect to kill him?”</p>
  <p>Qin Zheng’ grew frenetic. Although Li Xian was temperamental in the past, he was never in such a violent rage as today. She could not help but try to justify herself. “This wasn’t your servant’s idea. I, your servant, only mentioned that both Your Imperial Highness and the Prince of Yong both greatly valued Jiang Zhe. The order was issued by the Inner Hall. Your servant was only following orders.”</p>
  <p>When she finished speaking, Qin Zheng paled. She only just realized that she had admitted to keeping a close eye on Li Xian. Moreover, she had admitted to participating in the assassination attempt on the major of the household of the Marshal of Heavenly Strategies.</p>
  <p>Li Xian callously glared at Qin Zheng, unsympathetically replying, “If you weren’t my wife, why would I go to the trouble of trying to remedying this situation? Zheng’er, you are truly stupid, not knowing who really treats you well. Fine.… Go and rest well. For the time being, you must not go out. Properly nurture the baby at home.”</p>
  <p>Finished speaking, Li Xian turned and entered the Golden Valley Courtyard. Watching his departing aloof and distant figure, Qin Zheng wanted to catch up, but she could only watch as that painted black door closed. Qin Zheng felt her heart grow increasingly cold. She did not know why, but her vision blurred and she felt faint, weakly collapsing into the arms of her maids.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center">***</p>
  <p>Under the bright moonlight and the dim stars, the black-robed Vicious Killer stood on the riverbank, looking at the cluster of reeds on the opposite bank under the misty moonlight. He was joyous. This place was on the outskirts of Yongning County in Qizhou Prefecture<sup><span data-toggle="tooltip" title="蕲州, Qizhou – a prefecture that centers on modern-day Qichun County (蕲春县) in Hubei Province">3</span></sup> and the Tian Family Town of Guangji County.<sup><span data-toggle="tooltip" title="广济县, Guangji Xian – Guangji County is now the modern-day county-level city of Wuxue (武穴)">4</span></sup> Although the small ferry crossing here was obscure, this was someplace he was quite familiar with. This place was located on the remote boundaries of three counties. The surging Yangtze River flowed between the two shores here. The layers of unbroken chains of mountain peaks served as obstacles. The vegetation was verdant and lush. The river here was also very narrow. This ferry crossing was most frequently used by spies from Southern Chu and Great Yong. He looked at the precipice on the shore, espying the four large characters, “<em>Jiang Nan</em> Strategic Place.” However, there wasn’t the slightest hint of relaxation in his countenance. Although this place was only known to certain individuals as the optimal location to steal across the river, those chasing after him weren’t only operatives from the army, but also experts from <em>wulin</em>. They would definitely set an ambush here. Although he would be safe after crossing that narrow strip of water, it was easier said than done.</p>
  <p>Over the course of the entire journey, he had felt as if skating on thin ice. The Prince of Yong’s order had spread to all the checkpoints within the borders of Great Yong. Although he had disguised himself and moved in secret, his trail had been discovered several times. Fortunately, his martial arts were outstanding and he was adept at moving in secret, and thus was fortunate enough to escape. Most dreadfully, even the members of Great Yong’s <em>jianghu</em>, unconstrained by the authorities, had set him as their target. One reason was because the Prince of Yong had a majestic status in their minds. The other reason caused him to not know whether to laugh or cry. The only reason why Xiahou Yuanfeng was acknowledged as the greatest young expert of Great Yong was because he was able to defeat the commander of the Imperial Guard, Pei Yun, in the competition. However, many believed that if the fight had continued, the outcome of the battle would still be in doubt. Therefore, when those youthful experts of <em>jianghu</em> learned that he had fought Pei Yun to a draw, they believed that as long as they were able to defeat Vicious Killer, they would have the qualifications to challenge Xiahou Yuanfeng. Thus, these various youthful experts began to also chase after the assassin. After he had broken through several encirclements and obstacles, these youthful experts felt that had lost face. Unexpectedly, rumors spread that if Vicious Killer were to successfully escape back to Southern Chu, then the experts of Great Yong’s <em>jianghu</em> would be thoroughly discredited.<sup><span data-toggle="tooltip" title="颜面扫地, yanmiansaodi – idiom, lit. for one’s face to reach rock bottom; fig. to be thoroughly discredited">5</span></sup> When this happened, Vicious Killer truly found himself surrounded by enemies on all sides. Although he had luckily reached this location, it was extremely likely that there were enemies waiting ahead for him. The assassin smiled slightly, arranging his clothes, before walking towards the river bank.</p>
  <p>When he was about a hundred paces from the river bank, Vicious Killer heard the twang of a bowstring. Like lightning, a silver arrow flew past his face, disappearing into the night. He immediately stood still, leisurely turning his head. Under the dim light of night, he caught sight of a white-robed youth carrying a silver bow proudly gazing at him. By the youth’s side was a red-robed woman, smiling sweetly. Vicious Killer’s expression changed. Callously, he remarked, “Good. So it is the Silver Bow Wastrel Duanmu Qiu and the Red Clothed Rakshasa Qiao Yan’er. That day, if it weren’t for your assassination attempt, how could the Prince of De be wounded? If I can kill you two today, then this journey to Great Yong will not have been in vain.”</p>
  <p>At this moment, someone lightly laughed from behind him and stated, “<em>Aiyah</em>! Duanmu, your glorious achievement is still remembered by others. Pity. It would have been better if you were successful that day.”</p>
  <p>Following that clear and bright laughter, a small boat floated over from the center of the river. On it stood a thin, young Daoist priest. His two arms were longer than those of an ordinary person, matching his distinctly strange appearance, seemingly an immortal. However, his eyes were nimble and lively. It could be clearly seen that his temperament was cheerful.</p>
  <p>When Duanmu Qiu heard the priest’s words, he could not help but flash a slight, wry smile, as he replied, “Priest Bitter Bamboo,<sup><span data-toggle="tooltip" title="苦竹子, kuzhuzi – lit. priest/master bitter bamboo">6</span></sup> truly no good words are to be expected from a scoundrel.”<sup><span data-toggle="tooltip" title="狗嘴里吐不出象牙, gouzuilitubuchuxiangya – idiom, lit. no ivory comes from the mouth of a dog; no good words are to be expected from a scoundrel">7</span></sup></p>
  <p>At this moment, several individuals walked out from the left and right. On the left were two young women who were as beautiful as immortals—one looked like an alluring immortal, while the other looked innocent and pure. On the right were three young men with exactly the same appearances. The two young women had swords tied to their waists. The three young men each carried different weapons, a sword, a saber, and a bullwhip.</p>
  <p>Vicious Killer smiled slightly and stated, “As expected, it is only you lot that have been able to catch up. Isn’t it strange that even though the Prince of Yong’s household isn’t anxious, the Crown Prince, the Prince of Qi, and the Fengyi are actually quite anxious?”</p>
  <p>These words were like a sharp sword penetrating into the hearts of these individuals. Aside from the youth on the boat, the expressions of everyone present changed. In passing, Vicious Killer took a leather canteen from his waist, slowly taking a drink of the fine liquor within. He declared, “Everything is good about Great Yong. The only blemish is that its wine cannot compare with that of Southern Chu. Alas, I can only endure it for now. Once I’ve crossed the river, I’ll go to a wineshop to drink some fine liquor. Which of you will come first today? Is it the Silver Bow and Rakshasa in the service of the Prince of Qi? Or the Three Stalwarts from the Crown Prince’s household? Or the Third and Seventh Misses from the Fengyi Sect? Or is it possible that you are waiting for the Dragon Roaming the Waves, Daoist Priest Bitter Bamboo to make the first move?”</p>
  <p>The three young men advanced one step. The sword-carrying youth coldly said, “Vicious Killer, it’s enough that you ran amok in the Prince of Yong’s residence. And yet, you also caused the Crown Prince to be implicated. His Imperial Highness has ordered that you be brought back to the Prince of Yong’s residence to be punished for your crimes. It will be fine if you are willing to surrender. If you are unwilling, then don’t blame us for being merciless.”</p>
  <p>The assassin smiled, unconcerned. “That’s fine. Let me first experience your combined moves. I have heard that you three were born of the same parents, sharing a connection. Our fight, the day before yesterday, was rushed and I did not have the opportunity to experience your skills. Since we have the opportunity today, let’s begin.”</p>
  <p>The three young men moved forward as one. Although they stepped simultaneously, there were slight differences in their strides. The sword-carrying young man took the lead, while the other two were half a step behind him. The three advanced like so. The jagged and yet harmonious cadence caused people to feel gloomy for no reason. After they had taken several steps, the three youth’s figures shimmered and surrounded Vicious Killer. The glint and flash of cold steel combined with the river dragon-like bullwhip to encircle him. These three were connected mentally, their combination flawless. Vicious Killer had long ago experienced their ferociousness. In order to handle these three, he had already thought of a method beforehand. Just as their formation was about to completely surround him, he used his full strength to throw himself at the whip user. He knew that of the triplets, the whip user had wisdom surpassing others. Intelligent people were often the most likely to show timidity. Sure enough, that youth involuntarily retreated half a step. If the formation was fully formed, then his two brothers would have seized the opportunity to attack from both sides. However, right now, his two brothers were slightly off. This slight variation was the difference between life and death. When Vicious Killer’s body swept past the whip-using youth, blood spurted from the youth’s throat. However, he was also not having an easy time. The sword and saber slashed across his back, blood spraying forth. The two youths did not chase after the Southern Chu assassin, gazing at the corpse of their deceased brother. They were left dumbfounded.</p>
  <p>At this moment, the two young women blocked Vicious Killer; they were the Red Clothed Rakshasa and the Fengyi Sect’s Seventh Miss. Although the Red Clothed Rakshasa was a woman, she was valiant and formidable looking. In comparison, the Seventh Miss’s face was childish and innocent, her appearance sweet. However, both women were vicious and fierce. Of the two, one was fierce and ruthless, while the other although gorgeous, had a greater killing aura. The assassin only exchanged a few blows before he was drenched in sweat. At this moment, Duanmu Qiu notched an arrow to his bow. A silvery light shot towards Vicious Killer. Although he was able to dodge to the side, Qiao Yan’er took advantage of the distraction to use several sword techniques to place him in an even more dangerous situation. The Seventh Miss’s swordsmanship became increasingly gorgeous. The two women were becoming fiercer the longer they fought. At this time, the two remaining young men of the Three Stalwarts had already pounced on Vicious Killer from behind. The four combatants surrounded him, causing the Southern Chu assassin’s situation to become increasingly precarious.</p>
  <p>To the side, the expression of the simple and yet elegant fairy, the Third Miss of the Fengyi Sect, was somewhat uneasy. In a loud voice, she called out, “Seventh Sister, be careful! That man is crafty and cunning!<sup><span data-toggle="tooltip" title="诡计多端, guijiduoduan – idiom, lit. deceitful in many ways; wily and mischievous, full of craft and cunning">8</span></sup> Defend yourself against his tricks.”</p>
  <p>The four combatants became vigilant at the same time. They knew that not only did Vicious Killer have excellent martial arts, he was also extremely wily. Otherwise, how would he have been able to escape to this place? But at this moment, the assassin abruptly laughed heartily. “It’s too late! Hahahahaha!”</p>
  <p>Suddenly all felt dizzy, and everyone weakly collapsed to the ground. Third Miss was baffled, wondering when she had fallen into the trap. Suddenly, she could feel the river breeze gently begin to puff. Looking towards Priest Bitter Bamboo, she sighed and said, “Who would have thought that Priest Bitter Bamboo, famous throughout all over China, is actually a Southern Chu spy. Truly unexpected.”</p>
  <p>Priest Bitter Bamboo smiled slightly, putting away the silver cylinder in his hands. Rowing hard, his boat swiftly reached the shore. With a smile, he said, “The Pavilion of Heavenly Strategies’ ‘Secret Floating Fragrance’ is good as expected, colorless and odorless. I only need to spread it using the breeze and yet its power is not diminished. Unfortunately, I can only use this silver cylinder once. To cost a thousand taels of gold is truly too expensive.”</p>
  <p>Vicious Killer smiled and replied, “If I had not asked His Highness to purchase a cylinder, you wouldn’t have the opportunity to get your hands on it.”&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Turning to the collapsed experts, he continued, “Clearly you do not know that younger brother, Priest Bitter Bamboo, is a descendant of a prestigious family of Southern Chu. Although he became a priest at a young age, he has remained loyal to Southern Chu, surpassing those who sell their soul for gain.<sup><span data-toggle="tooltip" title="见利忘义, jianliwangyi – idiom, lit. to see profit and forget morality; to act from mercenary considerations, to sell one’s soul for gain">9</span></sup> He should not be blamed for the calamity you lot will suffer.”</p>
  <p>Finished speaking, he walked towards the remaining two brothers of the Three Stalwarts. He picked up and tested a sword. Just as he was about to stab down, a clear, cold, and sinister voice rang out. “Wouldn’t it be a shame to kill them and leave no spectators for the following performance?”</p>
  <p>Vicious Killer trembled. Raising his head, he glanced over, catching sight of an azure-robed young man standing not too distant. He was no more than twenty years of age, his appearance delicate and handsome, and yet he carried with him a sinister aura. Under the dusky moonlight, he stood with his hands clasped behind his back, looking white as snow.</p>

   Before Suiyun fully recovered, the Prince of Qi paid a personal visit. At this time, a clear distinction had been made between the Crown Prince and the Prince of Yong. Many were left puzzled by the Prince of Qi’s behavior, later learning that the Prince of Qi was adept at self-preservation.…

 <p>On the morning of the second day, while I was still half-asleep, I could faintly sense that someone was covering me with a blanket. The person’s movements were extremely unfamiliar. I suddenly woke up. To tell the truth, after gaining a new lease on life, I was no longer so apathetic about the affairs around me. I opened my eyes slightly, catching sight of Prince Li Xian of Qi sitting beside the bed, a fearful look in his eyes. Xiaoshunzi was nearby, glaring at him like a tiger stalking its prey. I was moved. From what the Prince of Yong told me, while I was struggling on the border between life and death, the Prince of Qi learned that I needed a bear gallbladder to prolong my life. Disregarding suspicions that could be engendered, he delivered the bear gallbladder in his possession. Princess Changle sending Ningpo figwort and bear gallbladder was already outside my expectations. The Prince of Qi’s actions were even more shocking. Why would he do this, knowing that it would anger the crown prince? However, I did not fully open my eyes. What could I say? I had already made my choice. Even if I did not serve the Prince of Yong, it was unlikely that I would follow the Prince of Qi. This being the case, it was preordained that our relationship would never be that of a liege and vassal, so why should I incite something additional to worry about?</p>
 <p>The Prince of Qi heaved a sigh, turning to leave. As he walked out, he was stopped. Xiaoshunzi followed him out, closing the door behind him. Pricking my ears, I heard the Prince of Qi softly speak to Xiaoshunzi, “I know that you are not an ordinary individual. Remember to ask your master the point of getting mixed up in this situation. He is someone who does not cherish fame and money. The Fengyi Sect cannot be provoked lightly. Even if they don’t act, do you think that the Crown Prince does not have experts by his side? Suiyun is only a weak scholar. He was able to luckily preserve his life this time, but what about next time? Urge him to leave Chang’an.”</p>
 <p>I could hear Xiaoshunzi’s impersonal and placid reply, “Your Imperial Highness lectures correctly. This servant will naturally pass this message on to the young master.”</p>
 <p>After a while, Xiaoshunzi pushed open the door and walked in. He radiated an icy killing aura. I looked at him strangely and asked, “What’s going on? Do you greatly dislike the Prince of Qi?”</p>
 <p>Xiaoshunzi angrily answered, “Who wanted him to come cry crocodile tears?<sup><span data-toggle="tooltip" title="猫哭耗子, maokuhaozi – idiom, lit. the cat weeps for dead mice; hypocritical pretense of condolences, crocodile tears">1</span></sup> Don’t tell me that he believes that we are aware of the role that he plays?”</p>
 <p>I raised my eyebrows, signaling my lack of understanding. Xiaoshunzi calmed down and stated, “These days, His Imperial Highness, the Prince of Yong, and I have both been occupied with young master’s recovery. Responsibility for interrogating and investigating of this residence was assigned to General Sima. General Sima discovered that the bow and arrows abandoned by the assassin came from the army. However, it is easier said than done to bring arrows and a bow into this residence. The security screening of guests for the banquet on the sixteenth day was extremely tight. On that day, there was absolutely no way for anyone to bring in a bow and arrow. The only possibility is if there was a traitor inside the prince’s household who hid the bow and arrows. However, General Sima’s investigation did not turn up any clues. Afterwards, we remembered that the Princess of Qi had come to pay a visit to the Princess of Yong on the fifteenth. We definitely could not carefully search the Princess of Qi’s carriage. Therefore, General Sima suspects that the bow and arrows were brought in by the Princess of Qi to be used by the assassin.”</p>
 <p>I calmly replied, “This kind of thing cannot be confirmed. The only thing that can be done is reorganizing the defenses of the prince’s residence. Although His Imperial Highness previously repeatedly suffered dangers, at the time, the Fengyi Sect had not yet formally supported the Crown Prince. Therefore, the defenses were sufficient. However, these defenses were naturally unsuitable faced with assassins from the Fengyi Sect.”</p>
 <p>Xiaoshunzi neutrally inquired, “Young master, can you confirm that the assassin was from the Fengyi Sect?”</p>
 <p>Seeing the fire in his eyes, I was afraid that he would recklessly go out to kill if I answered in the affirmative. Thus, I could only shake my head and respond, “I only say that the assassin’s level should not be below that of the Fengyi Sect. However, I did say that this was perpetrated by the Fengyi Sect. That day, I only caught a glimpse of the assassin. If I were to see that person again, I would be able to recognize the assassin. It is sufficient as long as I can affirm that Qin Qing was not involved.”</p>
 <p>Xiaoshunzi frowned and replied, “Apart from him, there is only Xiahou Yuanfeng and Li Hanyou. General Pei was by young master’s side. The Duke of Wei’s identity should preclude him from committing such a deed.”</p>
 <p>I lightly explained, “Xiahou Yuanfeng stated that he went out to relieve himself. Li Hanyou said that she did not like the raucous noise of the banquet; therefore after extending her congratulations, she went to the inner residence to see the Princess of Yong. These two individuals are both possible suspects. However, we cannot eliminate the possibility that someone else snuck in. We all know that those skilled enough to directly head towards the Cold Courtyard to assassinate have to either be that day’s guests or traitors within the prince’s household. However, this cannot be used as proof. Therefore, although those two are the most suspicious, the Prince of Yong cannot have them arrested.” I could not say that the act was perpetrated by Li Hanyou. After all, I had never even seen her before. It was better to not utter such a conjecture without proof.</p>
 <p>Xiaoshunzi calculatedly remarked, “Matters that the Prince of Yong cannot handle, I can handle. As long as young master permits it, I will go immediately to kill them.”</p>
 <p>I smiled. “Don’t cause trouble. How can we not be reasonable? If this was perpetrated by them, they will make things difficult for us in the future. Do you believe that you won’t have the opportunity to deal with them? All right, it’s better if you go chase and kill Vicious Killer. Whatever happens, we cannot allow him to get away and cause trouble in the future.”</p>
 <p>Xiaoshunzi coolly voiced, “Do not worry, young master. I have already rearranged the defenses of the Cold Courtyard. Previously, young master did not like having the guards too close. This time, we cannot do as young master wishes.”</p>
 <p>I awkwardly conveyed, “This … I won’t drive them off.”</p>
 <p>Seeing that I was this way, Xiaoshunzi said, “Once I have returned, we will do as you wish. If I am not present, young master cannot have nobody waiting by your side.”</p>
 <p>I repeatedly nodded my head. Because of this assassination, Xiaoshunzi felt extremely guilty, constantly feeling that he had not properly protected me. However, he was not a remorseful individual. Therefore, from now on, he would absolutely not allow me to do as I pleased. Although I was fond of being free and unrestrained, I valued my life more. Previously, they did not know of my importance and yet I had almost lost my life. Now, it was likely that every step I took was dangerous. How could I dare to act willfully? In any case, it was only more guards around me. I only needed to ignore them.</p>
 <p>Xiaoshunzi hurriedly departed. I knew that he was chasing after Vicious Killer to kill him. Apparently, this was because the assassin had escaped several attempts to capture him. If Xiaoshunzi did not chase after him, it was likely that he would escape back to Southern Chu. If he could not personally participate in killing the assassin, then Xiaoshunzi could not forgive himself.</p>
 <p>I comfortably lay out. My most important mission right now was to recover. Thinking of Sang Chen’s warnings, I did not wish to live only ten more years. I needed to start practicing the abandoned nourishing methods again. Life was so richly colorful; wouldn’t it be a pity if I were to die before my time? Narrowly escaping death this time, I viewed many things with tranquility. Even when thinking of Piaoxiang, my heart no longer dwelled on the pain and suffering, instead remembering her beauty and the happiness we once shared.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">***</p>
 <p>Leaving the Prince of Yong’s residence, Prince Li Xian of Qi casually returned to his own residence. When he arrived at the entrance of the Golden Valley Courtyard that only he could enter, Li Xian saw Qin Zheng waiting with several maids. The Golden Valley Courtyard was Li Xian’s own chambers. Without permission, no one was permitted to enter. Even the Princess of Qi, Qin Zheng, was not permitted entry. Therefore, she waited by the entrance.</p>
 <p>Seeing Qin Zheng, Li Xian revealed a mocking smile as he said, “<em>Aiyah</em>! The Princess is pregnant, why are you standing here? This Prince cannot afford to take responsibility if something untoward were to happen. I wonder if the Princess has any admonishments?”</p>
 <p>Qin Zheng trembled before she replied, “Your Imperial Highness, I, your servant, do not understand why Your Imperial Highness so treats this servant’s good intentions. The Crown Prince and you are in the same boat. However, days earlier you not only sent precious medicines, but also made inquiries, causing the Crown Prince to feel unhappy. Doesn’t your visit just now completely disregard the existence of the Crown Prince? I, your servant, am only giving consideration to Your Imperial Highness. Why does Your Imperial Highness …”</p>
 <p>“Shut your mouth,” hollered Li Xian coldly, grim and heartless. “Princess, do I need to speak of what you have done? Why did the Fengyi Sect suddenly think to assassinate Jiang Zhe? How was that bow and arrows brought into my brother’s residence? Do you really think this Prince is an idiot? Jiang Zhe once saved this Prince’s life. Although this Prince did not have the fortune to attain his service, who allowed you to exceed your place and meddle in these affairs,<sup><span data-toggle="tooltip" title="越俎代庖, yuezudaipao – idiom, lit. to go beyond the sacrificial altar and take over the kitchen; fig. to exceed one’s place and meddle in other people’s affairs">2</span></sup> inviting your sect to kill him?”</p>
 <p>Qin Zheng’ grew frenetic. Although Li Xian was temperamental in the past, he was never in such a violent rage as today. She could not help but try to justify herself. “This wasn’t your servant’s idea. I, your servant, only mentioned that both Your Imperial Highness and the Prince of Yong both greatly valued Jiang Zhe. The order was issued by the Inner Hall. Your servant was only following orders.”</p>
 <p>When she finished speaking, Qin Zheng paled. She only just realized that she had admitted to keeping a close eye on Li Xian. Moreover, she had admitted to participating in the assassination attempt on the major of the household of the Marshal of Heavenly Strategies.</p>
 <p>Li Xian callously glared at Qin Zheng, unsympathetically replying, “If you weren’t my wife, why would I go to the trouble of trying to remedying this situation? Zheng’er, you are truly stupid, not knowing who really treats you well. Fine.… Go and rest well. For the time being, you must not go out. Properly nurture the baby at home.”</p>
 <p>Finished speaking, Li Xian turned and entered the Golden Valley Courtyard. Watching his departing aloof and distant figure, Qin Zheng wanted to catch up, but she could only watch as that painted black door closed. Qin Zheng felt her heart grow increasingly cold. She did not know why, but her vision blurred and she felt faint, weakly collapsing into the arms of her maids.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center">***</p>
 <p>Under the bright moonlight and the dim stars, the black-robed Vicious Killer stood on the riverbank, looking at the cluster of reeds on the opposite bank under the misty moonlight. He was joyous. This place was on the outskirts of Yongning County in Qizhou Prefecture<sup><span data-toggle="tooltip" title="蕲州, Qizhou – a prefecture that centers on modern-day Qichun County (蕲春县) in Hubei Province">3</span></sup> and the Tian Family Town of Guangji County.<sup><span data-toggle="tooltip" title="广济县, Guangji Xian – Guangji County is now the modern-day county-level city of Wuxue (武穴)">4</span></sup> Although the small ferry crossing here was obscure, this was someplace he was quite familiar with. This place was located on the remote boundaries of three counties. The surging Yangtze River flowed between the two shores here. The layers of unbroken chains of mountain peaks served as obstacles. The vegetation was verdant and lush. The river here was also very narrow. This ferry crossing was most frequently used by spies from Southern Chu and Great Yong. He looked at the precipice on the shore, espying the four large characters, “<em>Jiang Nan</em> Strategic Place.” However, there wasn’t the slightest hint of relaxation in his countenance. Although this place was only known to certain individuals as the optimal location to steal across the river, those chasing after him weren’t only operatives from the army, but also experts from <em>wulin</em>. They would definitely set an ambush here. Although he would be safe after crossing that narrow strip of water, it was easier said than done.</p>
 <p>Over the course of the entire journey, he had felt as if skating on thin ice. The Prince of Yong’s order had spread to all the checkpoints within the borders of Great Yong. Although he had disguised himself and moved in secret, his trail had been discovered several times. Fortunately, his martial arts were outstanding and he was adept at moving in secret, and thus was fortunate enough to escape. Most dreadfully, even the members of Great Yong’s <em>jianghu</em>, unconstrained by the authorities, had set him as their target. One reason was because the Prince of Yong had a majestic status in their minds. The other reason caused him to not know whether to laugh or cry. The only reason why Xiahou Yuanfeng was acknowledged as the greatest young expert of Great Yong was because he was able to defeat the commander of the Imperial Guard, Pei Yun, in the competition. However, many believed that if the fight had continued, the outcome of the battle would still be in doubt. Therefore, when those youthful experts of <em>jianghu</em> learned that he had fought Pei Yun to a draw, they believed that as long as they were able to defeat Vicious Killer, they would have the qualifications to challenge Xiahou Yuanfeng. Thus, these various youthful experts began to also chase after the assassin. After he had broken through several encirclements and obstacles, these youthful experts felt that had lost face. Unexpectedly, rumors spread that if Vicious Killer were to successfully escape back to Southern Chu, then the experts of Great Yong’s <em>jianghu</em> would be thoroughly discredited.<sup><span data-toggle="tooltip" title="颜面扫地, yanmiansaodi – idiom, lit. for one’s face to reach rock bottom; fig. to be thoroughly discredited">5</span></sup> When this happened, Vicious Killer truly found himself surrounded by enemies on all sides. Although he had luckily reached this location, it was extremely likely that there were enemies waiting ahead for him. The assassin smiled slightly, arranging his clothes, before walking towards the river bank.</p>
 <p>When he was about a hundred paces from the river bank, Vicious Killer heard the twang of a bowstring. Like lightning, a silver arrow flew past his face, disappearing into the night. He immediately stood still, leisurely turning his head. Under the dim light of night, he caught sight of a white-robed youth carrying a silver bow proudly gazing at him. By the youth’s side was a red-robed woman, smiling sweetly. Vicious Killer’s expression changed. Callously, he remarked, “Good. So it is the Silver Bow Wastrel Duanmu Qiu and the Red Clothed Rakshasa Qiao Yan’er. That day, if it weren’t for your assassination attempt, how could the Prince of De be wounded? If I can kill you two today, then this journey to Great Yong will not have been in vain.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, someone lightly laughed from behind him and stated, “<em>Aiyah</em>! Duanmu, your glorious achievement is still remembered by others. Pity. It would have been better if you were successful that day.”</p>
 <p>Following that clear and bright laughter, a small boat floated over from the center of the river. On it stood a thin, young Daoist priest. His two arms were longer than those of an ordinary person, matching his distinctly strange appearance, seemingly an immortal. However, his eyes were nimble and lively. It could be clearly seen that his temperament was cheerful.</p>
 <p>When Duanmu Qiu heard the priest’s words, he could not help but flash a slight, wry smile, as he replied, “Priest Bitter Bamboo,<sup><span data-toggle="tooltip" title="苦竹子, kuzhuzi – lit. priest/master bitter bamboo">6</span></sup> truly no good words are to be expected from a scoundrel.”<sup><span data-toggle="tooltip" title="狗嘴里吐不出象牙, gouzuilitubuchuxiangya – idiom, lit. no ivory comes from the mouth of a dog; no good words are to be expected from a scoundrel">7</span></sup></p>
 <p>At this moment, several individuals walked out from the left and right. On the left were two young women who were as beautiful as immortals—one looked like an alluring immortal, while the other looked innocent and pure. On the right were three young men with exactly the same appearances. The two young women had swords tied to their waists. The three young men each carried different weapons, a sword, a saber, and a bullwhip.</p>
 <p>Vicious Killer smiled slightly and stated, “As expected, it is only you lot that have been able to catch up. Isn’t it strange that even though the Prince of Yong’s household isn’t anxious, the Crown Prince, the Prince of Qi, and the Fengyi are actually quite anxious?”</p>
 <p>These words were like a sharp sword penetrating into the hearts of these individuals. Aside from the youth on the boat, the expressions of everyone present changed. In passing, Vicious Killer took a leather canteen from his waist, slowly taking a drink of the fine liquor within. He declared, “Everything is good about Great Yong. The only blemish is that its wine cannot compare with that of Southern Chu. Alas, I can only endure it for now. Once I’ve crossed the river, I’ll go to a wineshop to drink some fine liquor. Which of you will come first today? Is it the Silver Bow and Rakshasa in the service of the Prince of Qi? Or the Three Stalwarts from the Crown Prince’s household? Or the Third and Seventh Misses from the Fengyi Sect? Or is it possible that you are waiting for the Dragon Roaming the Waves, Daoist Priest Bitter Bamboo to make the first move?”</p>
 <p>The three young men advanced one step. The sword-carrying youth coldly said, “Vicious Killer, it’s enough that you ran amok in the Prince of Yong’s residence. And yet, you also caused the Crown Prince to be implicated. His Imperial Highness has ordered that you be brought back to the Prince of Yong’s residence to be punished for your crimes. It will be fine if you are willing to surrender. If you are unwilling, then don’t blame us for being merciless.”</p>
 <p>The assassin smiled, unconcerned. “That’s fine. Let me first experience your combined moves. I have heard that you three were born of the same parents, sharing a connection. Our fight, the day before yesterday, was rushed and I did not have the opportunity to experience your skills. Since we have the opportunity today, let’s begin.”</p>
 <p>The three young men moved forward as one. Although they stepped simultaneously, there were slight differences in their strides. The sword-carrying young man took the lead, while the other two were half a step behind him. The three advanced like so. The jagged and yet harmonious cadence caused people to feel gloomy for no reason. After they had taken several steps, the three youth’s figures shimmered and surrounded Vicious Killer. The glint and flash of cold steel combined with the river dragon-like bullwhip to encircle him. These three were connected mentally, their combination flawless. Vicious Killer had long ago experienced their ferociousness. In order to handle these three, he had already thought of a method beforehand. Just as their formation was about to completely surround him, he used his full strength to throw himself at the whip user. He knew that of the triplets, the whip user had wisdom surpassing others. Intelligent people were often the most likely to show timidity. Sure enough, that youth involuntarily retreated half a step. If the formation was fully formed, then his two brothers would have seized the opportunity to attack from both sides. However, right now, his two brothers were slightly off. This slight variation was the difference between life and death. When Vicious Killer’s body swept past the whip-using youth, blood spurted from the youth’s throat. However, he was also not having an easy time. The sword and saber slashed across his back, blood spraying forth. The two youths did not chase after the Southern Chu assassin, gazing at the corpse of their deceased brother. They were left dumbfounded.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the two young women blocked Vicious Killer; they were the Red Clothed Rakshasa and the Fengyi Sect’s Seventh Miss. Although the Red Clothed Rakshasa was a woman, she was valiant and formidable looking. In comparison, the Seventh Miss’s face was childish and innocent, her appearance sweet. However, both women were vicious and fierce. Of the two, one was fierce and ruthless, while the other although gorgeous, had a greater killing aura. The assassin only exchanged a few blows before he was drenched in sweat. At this moment, Duanmu Qiu notched an arrow to his bow. A silvery light shot towards Vicious Killer. Although he was able to dodge to the side, Qiao Yan’er took advantage of the distraction to use several sword techniques to place him in an even more dangerous situation. The Seventh Miss’s swordsmanship became increasingly gorgeous. The two women were becoming fiercer the longer they fought. At this time, the two remaining young men of the Three Stalwarts had already pounced on Vicious Killer from behind. The four combatants surrounded him, causing the Southern Chu assassin’s situation to become increasingly precarious.</p>
 <p>To the side, the expression of the simple and yet elegant fairy, the Third Miss of the Fengyi Sect, was somewhat uneasy. In a loud voice, she called out, “Seventh Sister, be careful! That man is crafty and cunning!<sup><span data-toggle="tooltip" title="诡计多端, guijiduoduan – idiom, lit. deceitful in many ways; wily and mischievous, full of craft and cunning">8</span></sup> Defend yourself against his tricks.”</p>
 <p>The four combatants became vigilant at the same time. They knew that not only did Vicious Killer have excellent martial arts, he was also extremely wily. Otherwise, how would he have been able to escape to this place? But at this moment, the assassin abruptly laughed heartily. “It’s too late! Hahahahaha!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly all felt dizzy, and everyone weakly collapsed to the ground. Third Miss was baffled, wondering when she had fallen into the trap. Suddenly, she could feel the river breeze gently begin to puff. Looking towards Priest Bitter Bamboo, she sighed and said, “Who would have thought that Priest Bitter Bamboo, famous throughout all over China, is actually a Southern Chu spy. Truly unexpected.”</p>
 <p>Priest Bitter Bamboo smiled slightly, putting away the silver cylinder in his hands. Rowing hard, his boat swiftly reached the shore. With a smile, he said, “The Pavilion of Heavenly Strategies’ ‘Secret Floating Fragrance’ is good as expected, colorless and odorless. I only need to spread it using the breeze and yet its power is not diminished. Unfortunately, I can only use this silver cylinder once. To cost a thousand taels of gold is truly too expensive.”</p>
 <p>Vicious Killer smiled and replied, “If I had not asked His Highness to purchase a cylinder, you wouldn’t have the opportunity to get your hands on it.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Turning to the collapsed experts, he continued, “Clearly you do not know that younger brother, Priest Bitter Bamboo, is a descendant of a prestigious family of Southern Chu. Although he became a priest at a young age, he has remained loyal to Southern Chu, surpassing those who sell their soul for gain.<sup><span data-toggle="tooltip" title="见利忘义, jianliwangyi – idiom, lit. to see profit and forget morality; to act from mercenary considerations, to sell one’s soul for gain">9</span></sup> He should not be blamed for the calamity you lot will suffer.”</p>
 <p>Finished speaking, he walked towards the remaining two brothers of the Three Stalwarts. He picked up and tested a sword.
