 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thriving Prosperity’s great owner was also watching from shore right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the great owner of a merchant company on the level of Thriving Prosperity, his abilities might be far greater than those of any official in Breath River.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the initial assassination to the pursuit and arrest, bringing out the corpse, letting the mother arrive, and then forcing his superior officer through the will of the people, Lin Xi’s actions could be said to be extremely meticulous, exceptionally beautiful. Moreover, the strength of character he displayed was something that even made this great owner feel a heart of cherishing talent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, when Lin Xi’s sword actually stabbed straight through Xu Chengfeng’s body in front of everyone’s faces, while he was filled with shock, his brows also furrowed tightly, his heart even more so filled with extreme disappointment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yunqin law strictly permitted interrogation under torture only when there wasn’t enough proof, let alone this type of direct assassination, threatening with death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Doing this in full light of day, under everyone’s eyes, this was completely ignorant bravery, completely opposite of the beautiful way of doing things before. Moreover, Yunqin law strictly prohibited extorting confessions, precisely in order to prevent miscarriages of justice from appearing. Compared to mediocre officials who always paid attention to the rules, those officials who always acted rudely and unreasonably because of their own feelings were even more useless and terrifying. This was especially the case for some vigorous and hot-blooded youngsters, even more so because of their own impulsiveness which led them to &nbsp;commit extremely bad things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his eyes, Lin Xi’s performance immediately dropped from heaven down to underground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It could even be said that even if he wanted to help Lin Xi, he couldn’t help him at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This sword was thrusted out in the open, it could already be said that Lin Xi was no longer an enforcer, already a criminal guilty of terrible crimes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since the position he held was different, the great owner of Thriving Prosperity was naturally extremely rational. However, for the surrounding people, Lin Xi’s sword represented an unyielding bravery that didn’t care about life or death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For Xu Chengfeng who was directly stabbed, this type of feeling was naturally even stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You… you dare do something like this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw his own blood flow along the sword, Xu Chengfeng, this prince of a Three Towns Battalion Commander was in a bit of disbelief. “For the sake of of someone that had nothing to do with you, you don’t even care about your own life anymore?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi looked at Xu Chengfeng coldly, starting to slowly move the sword, making the blade’s ice-cold terror completely spread through Xu Chengfeng. “I don’t want my life anymore, but do you want yours? If you don’t speak, then you’ll lose your life immediately. I’ll accompany you in death to uphold justice for everyone, this still isn’t a loss for me. If you speak up now, I believe your father won’t care, perhaps still having a chance to keep your life.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Lin Xi… you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lian Zhanshan, the military official, and all of the others’ faces completely changed, but they didn’t dare take a step out of fear that Lin Xi would move his hands a bit, thus causing Xu Chengfeng to die on the spot. “Hurry, call over a doctor in preparation!” An Internal Affairs Sector official roared out. “Contact Town Supervisor Dong!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Chengfeng’s teeth were grinding, feeling the ice-cold sword moving in his body. Under the true threat of death, he completely lost his original calmness and arrogance, his entire body trembling, yet not daring to tremble as he screamed, “They are in Exquisite Boat’s inner cabin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Exquisite Boat?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi didn’t ask any more. Du Weiqing, Second Grandpa Zhang, and the others whose faces became snow-white already looked towards the decorated pleasure boats in the south.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was one decorated pleasure boat that was white, the word ‘exquisite’ written on the archway.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, Lin Xi was still a bit confused, but when he saw this rather distant pleasure boat, as well as Du Weiqing and others’ eyes, he completely understood. He coldly looked at Xu Chengfeng, saying, “Turns out it was this close… those girls that were captured by you, they are all just inside that boat?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes… so what… doing this type of thing, what benefits are there…” When he felt his blood continuously flow out and his body that was becoming more and more cold, Xu Chengfeng screamed out hysterically. “You still aren’t letting me go?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi laughed, not releasing Xu Chengfeng, instead saying to Du Weiqing and the others, “Go and search that Exquisite Boat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following these words, Gao Zhe and the other Silver Hook Lane’s people all fell weak onto the ground, their entire bodies shaking all over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw Gao Zhe and the others’ reaction, Lin Xi turned around, seeing Lian Zhanshan and the others who already couldn’t help but come over, their expressions becoming even more furious, the people who were becoming even more stirred up, he instead said in a relaxed and carefree manner, “Return.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Time returned to several minutes ago. Lin Xi had just called Du Weiqing and the others to a stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw the clearly complacent Gao Zhe, under everyone’s confused eyes, Lin Xi calmly made a gesturing motion towards Gao Zhe. “Boss Gao, please come here to the side for us to discuss some things.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I wonder what sir wishes to ask of me alone?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Gao Zhe followed Lin Xi a dozen or so steps out. When Lin Xi stopped at the edge of the boat, he cupped his hands, asking with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you know why I have so much confidence today?” Lin Xi looked at this extremely confident middle-aged merchant, also smiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While detaining Xu Chengfeng for a night, he already saw that even though Xu Chengfeng was fierce, it was only because of his status. In reality, Xu Chengfeng was also greedy for life, afraid of death. Otherwise, if it was someone who was a bit more ruthless, Xu Chengfeng could have completely purposely made some injuries to frame him. This way, Lian Zhanshan and the others could directly use this as a reason to interfere. However, Xu Chengfeng didn’t even dare do this, taking the initiative to spill everything, everything going just as he planned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The reason why he waited a night wasn’t just to wait for some information and people, but also to wait for his ability to recover.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now, everyone thought that he had his hands bound, but in this grand play, victory was already in his grasp!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You all really are brazen, truly treating the safest place as the most dangerous place. Indeed, when normal people search your entire decorated pleasure boat, they definitely wouldn’t think that the people they wanted were actually precisely in another boss’ pleasure boat. With a town Enforcer’s ability, if I searched your ship here but couldn’t find anything, there might not be any chance of searching another place. Even if there was enough manpower, the higher ups won’t approve of it.” Lin Xi looked at Gao Zhe whose expression became a bit shocked because of his words. “If I told you that I already knew that you all hid the people I’m searching for in the Exquisite Boat’s inner cabin secret room, would you still remain as calm as you are right now? Do you still dare claim to be this pleasure boat’s boss?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An explosion erupted in Gao Zhe’s head, his body immediately going soft, about to fall weak onto the ground. However, Lin Xi didn’t let him fall, reaching out a hand to support him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw the change in Gao Zhe whose face lacked the slightest trace of color, sweat covering his entire body like starch, Lin Xi seriously said, “Since you have already handled matters to this extent, you should know that capturing girls to sell them as prostitutes, someone who did this type of nasty deed, the punishment will be even more severe than a homicide case. Not only will the main people involved be tortured and executed with a thousand cuts, the culprit’s family members will all be sent out to serve in the border armies.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After saying this, Lin Xi paused slightly, asking seriously once more. “I wonder if you can endure the taste of lingering death, if you can endure seeing all of your household be transferred to the border army for penal servitude?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sir Lin, please spare me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as Lin Xi’s words finished, Gao Zhe whose entire body was like mud already broke out into sobbing pleas.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You have one chance to slightly reduce your guilt, I can at least guarantee that your family members won’t be harmed.” Lin Xi looked at Gao Zhe, calmly and seriously saying, “You need to testify against Xu Chengfeng, and there has to be conclusive proof, not the type that can still make him leave this case unsettled. Otherwise, you should also understand that with his position, in the end, you are still the main culprit, this Silver Hook Lane is still related to you, unrelated to him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have an account book, it is precisely in the wall of my residence in East Port Town, some silver dealings recorded inside of it.” Gao Zhe almost completely lacked the ability to think, the previous calm and scholarly aura completely disappearing without a trace. He looked at Lin Xi with a sluggish expression, saying, “Also, those girls trapped in Exquisite Boat, some of them have gone through his hands, they all know that he is the boss of Exquisite Boat, all of this can be used as evidence against him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Good, take a moment to calm down. If others said that you were terrified or went crazy, the confession you gave inaccurate, there will be a powerful witness missing, unable to bring him down. At that time, the ones affected will still be your family.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi looked at this middle-aged merchant who was previously loyal to Xu Chengfeng without much sympathy. He turned around, and then headed towards the sneering, still a bit confused Xu Chengfeng. He faced everyone on the river deck and river bank.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xu Chengfeng, Gao Zhe has already spoken, you are precisely Silver Hook Lane’s true owner. Those people that you captured are precisely in Exquisite Boat!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He took a deep breath, and then reached out a finger, pointing at the distant white pleasure boat, his biting cold voice ringing through the entire shore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When his cold and raw voice which was like thunder sounded, it completely shocked everyone here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When everyone’s eyes couldn’t help but follow his finger, concentrating on that white pleasure boat, after Xu Chengfeng stared blankly for a moment, he cried out and jumped, crazily screaming at Gao Zhe, “Gao Zhe, you f*cking dog… you actually dare frame me!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Help me watch them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi said to Second Grandpa Zhang who was incredibly shocked. Without even giving Lian Zhangshan and the others a look, he directly jumped down from Silver Hook Lane, walking towards Exquisite Boat under the furious shouts that became louder and louder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Just what did he say to Gao Zhe to receive such breakthrough progress?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the shore, Thriving Prosperity’s great owner was also speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t know that Lin Xi already used his unique ability, victory long within his grasp. He originally thought that the situation already reached an impasse, yet judging from Xu Chengfeng’s crazy reaction and the changes in the expressions of Silver Hook Lane’s important figures, he knew that things already came to a huge turning point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No one dared stop Lin Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because when one walked the path of righteousness, there would naturally be a type of grandeur that left everyone in admiration. That was why right now, even though Lin Xi was walking alone, what surrounded him was actually the roaring sea-like spirit of the people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kacha!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entrance into Exquisite Boat’s inner cabin was directly smashed open by Lin Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dawn radiance scattered from Lin Xi’s hands, within the faint green light, this wooden decorated pleasure boat was directly cut apart. Lin Xi directly tore down the ship, exposing everything to broad daylight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, everyone’s breathing stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the walls of the ship were cut through by Lin Xi, some figures were exposed from within.</span></p>
