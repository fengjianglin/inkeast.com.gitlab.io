 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The red-clothed zither master was a bit apologetic, to the extent where her expression was a bit deeply moved, carrying sympathy as she looked at this skinny and weak young lady covered in a black robe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She understood what kind of mission Green Luan Academy’s Watchmen carried, and it was precisely because of this that she felt this skinny and weak young lady carrying this type of mission was a bit cruel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, as soon as these words sounded, her back instead also became a bit rigid, the center of her palm releasing a bit of cold sweat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She slowly turned around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An especially arrogant and untamed single-eyed black-robed man appeared not far behind her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On his back was a massive longbow, the bow not much smaller than his figure.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bow’s body was thick and broad, carrying a faint cold green, silvery radiance, like a curved moon. The bowstring was a faint yellow color, like the color of mature ginkgo fruit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The instant this skinny and weak looking young lady in the black robes saw this wild and untamed black-robed middle-aged man, her body went even more rigid. However, the instant she saw the black robes and his facial features, she instead completely relaxed, only silently watching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cold Moon Gingkyo… Tong Wei, I never expected that even you arrived here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When this red-clothed zither master saw this man’s single eye, she also immediately recalled this man’s identity with shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This single-eyed black-robed lecturer was precisely the single-eyed lecturer Tong Wei who imparted Green Luan Academy’s Windstalker archery!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You know me… and you also recognize that she is a Watchman, if I have not guessed wrong, you should be the zither master who stopped Ye Wangqing in East Forest Province. Just who are you exactly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While carrying the academy’s unique pride, the black-robed lecturer Tong Wei who was like a hawk on a snowy peak coly stared at this red-clothed zither master, asking with a cold voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can I choose to not reply?” The red-clothed zither master revealed a forced smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tong Wei shook his head. “You cannot.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One who could grasp Windstalker archery… able to instruct Windstalkers in Green Luan Academy, was naturally a Windstalker himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The red-clothed zither master also understood the other party’s identity, knowing that unless a Windstalker had absolute confidence, able to take down the enemy with a single strike, only then would they reveal themselves before their opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tong Wei’s ‘you cannot’, these words, despite being simple to the extreme, also allowed her to sense Tong Wei’s determination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps for Green Luan Academy’s true inheritors… apart from their people, everyone under this sky could be considered their enemy?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The red-clothed zither master released a bitter laugh, and then said with a light sigh, “I am someone under Grand Secretary Zhou.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Grand Secretary Zhou?” Tong Wei’s brows furrowed deeply, as if this was something that was completely impossible in his opinion, something that didn’t make logical sense. “Why?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The red-clothed zither master looked at Tong Wei, with a light sigh saying, “He is the empire’s grand secretary, but at the same time, he is also a father.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tong Wei’s brows furrowed even deeper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his and many Green Luan lecturers’ eyes, Central Continent Imperial City’s Grand Secretary whose ability and wisdom were just as astonishing as his cultivation wasn’t the empire’s Grand Secretary, but rather the emperor’s Grand Secretary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In their eyes, that person was the one who was the most loyal to the emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn’t because he had to rely on Yunqin Empire as his greatest backing, but rather since his heart was originally like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the royal court, the hearts of many officials are also like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Loyalty to the emperor, this was something that already merged into their blood vessels… that was why they definitely wouldn’t do something like going against the emperor’s will.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However now, because of Lin Xi… even this type of individual would change his way of doing things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Seems like the rumors regarding him being the academy’s Windstalker of this generation is true… or else you wouldn’t be here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While looking at the silent Tong Wei, the red-clothed female zither master’s voice became a bit more gentle. “If we knew that even someone like you would come… would there still be any issues regarding his safety? If I knew this, I wouldn’t have wasted this much energy in continuously following him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tong Wei only knew that starting from this spring, Yunqin was already no longer as peaceful as before. He also could not determine whether the change in attitude Grand Secretary Zhou adopted because of the relationship between Lin Xi and Gao Yanan would bring about a positive or negative effect. When he heard what the red-clothed zither master said, he slowly raised his head, his ice-cold and untamed demeanor now carrying a hint of a dignified meaning. He shook his head and said, “Not necessarily.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The red-clothed zither master’s expression changed slightly. “Why?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tong Wei looked at this red-clothed female zither master and coldy said, “Do not underestimate the emperor’s determination… as well as Purgatory Mountain’s cultivators.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Purgatory Mountain’s cultivators?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The red-clothed female zither master understood extremely well just how terrifying Purgatory Mountain’s cultivators were, but she also understood that the empire’s southernmost border’s Great Mang was extremely far from this place. How would Great Mang’s elite cultivators come here?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She knew that if Tong Wei said they were here, then they would definitely be here, but she still found it inconceivable no matter how she thought about it. As such, she couldn’t help but ask, “Why?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yunqin wishes to know why the cave barbarians have undergone such a thorough change this spring, wants to know many mysteries regarding this place. Great Mang naturally wishes to know as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tong Wei coldly said, “One or two great victories, compared to this mystery, are meaningless. If Yunqin or Great Mang can possess a giant lizard army, then how great of a change would there be in the balance of the world’s powers?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since Tong Wei said these things to the red-clothed zither master, this meant that he knew the red-clothed zither master had the qualifications to hear him say these things, and she knew many things others didn’t know, able to understand these things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sure enough, the red-clothed zither master’s face immediately turned pale, slowly nodding, clearly already understanding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, the ones who grasped the giant lizard riders were the cave barbarians… if the one who grasped them was Yunqin, then what? If the one who grasped the giant lizard army was Great Mang, what would happen then?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Yunqin Empire’s wealth and manpower, if they learned about these secrets, just how many of these powerful giant lizard riders could they foster?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they had this type of army numbering in the thousands and tens of thousands… this was even harder for her to imagine. She could only shiver inwardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I will cooperate with you all.” After taking a deep breath, calming herself down a bit, the red-clothed female zither master said without any hesitation, looking at Tong Wei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi and the patrol army arrived at the South Star Slope designated by military orders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apart from Lin Xi, everyone else was breathing heavily, bodies drenched in sweat. They had no choice but to undo the black armor covering their bodies a bit, wipe away the sweat inside their armor with a dry cloth to prevent the following sweat from further draining their stamina.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was currently noon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The patrol army carried out an almost direct rapid advance, and only then could they reach the designated position within the time limit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, all of the patrol army soldiers, including Xin Weigai and Kang Qianjue, were almost at their limit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under year-round training and fighting, all of these soldiers had a clear grasp over the recovery of their own stamina… in this type of situation, only by having at least six hours of undisturbed deep sleep, could they recover eighty percent of their stamina.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two scouting soldiers at the front of the army brought back information.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Fierce Edge Army Chen Yinxiu commanded had long reached the Thorn Date Mound on the other side of them, currently defending that position. However, when he checked the surrounding strategic map, clearly seeing the terrain around them, Xin Weigai’s face couldn’t help but become extremely ugly, releasing a fierce clump of spittle towards the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">South Star Slop and the opposite Thorn Date Mound were both round, steamed bun shaped hills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To the side of Thorn Date Mound was a large expanse of duckweed like plants, from time to time appearing clusters of reed shaped plants that were several times larger and thicker than those outside. From the color of the water, the depth shouldn’t be shallow. Moreover, the water here had large amounts of sludge, if one wanted to move through the waters, it didn’t seem too likely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To the side of South Star Slope was a large expanse of low red pine forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The distinctive trait of this type of red pine tree was that their root systems were extremely great, moreover tangled together like layers of webs. In addition, the roots were extremely sturdy. If one wanted to slowly climb their way through, then it was possible, but forcefully hacking out a path was extremely difficult.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Between South Star Slope and Thorn Date Mound, these two hills, was a wide plains region. This region was full of weeds that were a person in height, slender trees resembling betel palms that only had leaves at the very top.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That is why if one wished to cross this region of twenty to thirty li, pass through this desolate forest between the two mounds, there should only be a single path, there was no other choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though this region had three hills in total, one of them was inside the watery region of Thorn Date Mound, lacking much significance. That was why in terms of tactics, setting up defense on these two mounds was extremely accurate, allowing them to basically watch over twenty to thirty li of distance, guard this path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The arrows and other weapons released from the hills could inflict great damage to the army coming from below.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, as for South Star Slope, this hill was a bit lower in height than Thorn Date Mound. Moreover, apart from some weeds, this South Star Slope’s hillside was extremely moderate, only having a type of white and yellow-colored night blooming wildflower called South Star Flower. Meanwhile, apart from Thorn Date Mound’s slope being much more precipitous, the top was full of thorn dates. Even the skin of cave barbarians, if they wanted to pass through, would be pierced until they couldn’t endure the pain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why according to the cave barbarians’ habits, when they suffered from attacks from both sides, they might choose to directly power through this South Star Slope side, directly cross over this way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Regardless of whether it was numbers or real fighting strength, the Patrol Army and Chen Yinxiu’s Fierce Edge Army should have swapped locations to defend. However now, it was their Patrol Army that was located on the more dangerous South Star Slope!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Weigai understood the unfairness behind this. However, he was a true soldier, so he would definitely carry out military orders to the end. Meanwhile, the moment he prepared to give the orders to have his men separate into three groups to rest, he and all of the patrolling soldiers saw a crimson fire beacon released in the northeast’s skies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was like a giant blood pillar that rushed directly into the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of the patrol army soldiers’ heavy breathing stopped slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wave of exceptionally strong mood swept through this mound and many other places in the Great Desolate Swamp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi who was standing with his hands at his side looked at this blood pillar-like fire beacon, also sensing this exceptionally heroic aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Dragon Snake Border Army, this crimson smoke signal only represented a single order, which was to defend to the death… to continue defending down to the very last drop of blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This crimson fire beacon wasn’t issued to their Patrol Army, but rather to all defending troops who could see this fire beacon… to have all of these troops pay any price to defend their positions, regardless of what kind of enemies they faced!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi and his entire Patrol Army, as well as the troops just like theirs stationed across the Great Desolate Swamp still didn’t know just what kind of things happened here. However, everyone who saw this fire beacon sensed that something extremely shocking was currently happening here.</span></p>
