 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the first strand of dawn scattered down from the sky, Lin Xi saw the legendary Great Desolate Swamp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was like a completely different world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The endless black water that covered the swamp, the hills above, the dark clouds that sunk especially low, all of it made him feel that this wasn’t real, as if this was an artificially produced movie backdrop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were some giant birds he didn’t know the names of who flew across the swamp, disappearing into the dark clouds that were much lower than in other places. From time to time, there were giant birds that landed from the dark clouds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the limits of his line of sight, there were expanses of lakes and muddy areas everywhere. Even the slightly drier muddy earth had reed-like straw plants that were much higher than people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An unimaginable savage pressure rushed at him, giving off a suffocating feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was to the extent where Lin Xi didn’t even see any larger chunks of stone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was rock everywhere in Dragon Snake Mountain Range, yet once Dragon Snake Mountain Range was crossed, when they just arrived at the foot of the mountain, the layers of white rock were like roots that penetrated deeply into the black earth, no traces to be found. Even those hilltops that seemed to reach into dark clouds, surface covered in all types of thorny trees and other large leaved plants were filled with a magical aura, they were all made of piles of black mud. They were all exactly the same as well, round like steamed buns.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">According to the Border Army resources, it was recorded that the cave barbarians normally lived in the caves within these types of hills.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the endless winters, they would use some of the roots and bug pupae as their main source of food.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The white rock mountains and black great earth formed a clear black and white contrast. There was an exceptionally clear dividing line. Lin Xi stood precisely on this dividing line, observing this brand new world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Weigai didn’t rush Lin Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew that the first time one saw the Great Desolate Swamp, anyone would feel deeply shocked. Moreover, the soldiers behind him also needed a set amount of time to rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were all extremely loyal to Yunqin, they were soldiers who pursued glory, which was why they couldn’t try to figure out the meaning behind every single order. As long as the military order was really passed down, even if they were sent to a place of absolute death, they would still decisively advance, carry out the order.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two large and tall cave barbarians made their way through stalks of Traveler’s Root.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Traveler’s Root was the most commonly seen broad-leaved plant in Great Desolate Swamp, these plants not having taro-like stem tubers that could be eaten, but the inside of the stalks and leaves were like a traveler’s palm, containing large amounts of slightly sweet water. As long as a deep hole was made, the water would pour out like a spring. The other most important characteristic of this plant was that it was extremely large, reaching five meters or greater after growing for three years. Not only did it block out sunlight from above, it would also suck out large amounts of nutrients and water suited for plant growth, which is why wherever large amounts of this Traveler’s Root grew, the ground surface would be extremely clean.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, two cave barbarians were precisely in this type of Traveler’s Root jungle with plants already exceeding six meters in height. When their bare, callus covered feet stepped on the soft, dry and weedless black earth, there wasn’t the slightest bit of sound released.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two cave barbarians paid great attention to advancing stealthily as well, continuously looking around them, displaying a strange stance that was entirely different from their massive frames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Traveler’s Root jungle sixty to seventy feet behind these two cave barbarians, there was a troop of over a hundred cave barbarians who also silently advanced, these two cave barbarians clearly the scouts of this troop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the cave barbarians’ strength and endurance, as long as there was fifty to sixty steps of distance between them and Yunqin’s army, unless it was an especially powerful cultivator, Yunqin’s troops had no way of catching any fleeing cave barbarians in this great Desolate Swamp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, a black-armored soldier descended from a leaf above the two cave barbarian scouts, a wide longsword aimed at a cave barbarian’s nape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though this Traveler’s Root was thick and tall, the leaves were rather soft and tender. However, this black-armored soldier actually crawled to the very top, hiding in the leaf there. When he slid down at this time, it was even more so light and graceful like a small water droplet that slid down the center of the leaf, actually not making the slightest sound. Only when he directly approached these two cave barbarians’ heads, did they sense an abnormal wind and coldness, suddenly turning their bodies around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The instant they turned around, one of the cave barbarians saw the sword edge that was rapidly approaching. Before he could make any movements, the forked sword edge dug fiercely into his nape, instantly severing the blood supply to his head. His battle-ax that seemed as light as a feather in his hands just begun to move upwards, but already lost the power to continue up, thus sliding out of his hands in ruin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, a silver spear carrying tremendous power was thrown over, directly penetrating the body of the other cave barbarian who had just turned around.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This cave barbarian released a miserable scream. He wanted to stand still, but just this persistence already exhausted the last of his strength. He stood still and didn’t fall, but could not make any other movements ever again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most of the cave barbarian army in the back saw the two cave barbarians’ blood spraying over the soft and dry earth below, saw a cave barbarian fall after his battle-axe fell, while the other cave barbarian was still standing but already dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, right now, they already didn’t have time to worry about these two black-armored soldiers who were fifty to sixty feet from them. Right above their heads, on the five or six meter tall giant leaves, black-armored soldiers slid down like graceful water droplets one after another, like falling rain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The instant they saw the interweaving flowery and also fine swimming snake-like runes on the black armor, these cave barbarians immediately sensed a world devouring aura of death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Black Snake Army!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cave barbarians might not know the name of this powerful and mysterious army in Dragon Snake Mountain Range, but after decades of battles, Black Snake, Back Dragon, Black Flag, these three armies, for them, always signified death.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Grave and stern black-armored soldiers landed on the ground one after another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The five or six meters of distance didn’t seem to affect their movements in the slightest, only enough to produce blasts of black mist beneath their feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the layers of flower-like black metal armor grinded against each other, there was no sound produced. The blood that splashed on its surface couldn’t remain either, flying off drop after drop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As this dark color descended, chaos ensued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rings of blood waves surged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since all of this happened too quickly and because they weren’t given much time to adapt, even these normally exceptionally ruthless cave barbarians didn’t have time to release any shouts. Only sounds of blades slicing through the air and entering flesh could be heard, making this scene immediately seem extremely grave and tragic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waves of blood splashed out in the sky, landing on the soft black earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were heavy cave barbarians who fell, as well as Black Snake Army soldiers who really were like black snakes that collapsed, only, the number of cave barbarians who fell was always far greater than the number of Black Snake Army soldiers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In this solemn and grave instant, this mysterious and powerful Dragon Snake Border Army group already seized an absolute advantage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When many cave barbarians finally released furious roars, they instead discovered that their line of sight was already filled with a deep, cold black color. Meanwhile, the shining bronze stone-like companions of theirs already fell, only cold black-armored soldiers whose bodies were reflecting blood radiance continued to slaughter their way over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Black Snake Army soldier who wielded the forked sword also already rushed to the intersection point between black and bronze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since his speed was faster than that of everyone here, almost all of the still surviving cave barbarians felt that he was this Black Snake Army’s commander.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A more than two meters tall cave barbarian carrying a rough iron club and a giant hammer made from a massive alligator skull had just sent a Black Snake Army soldier flying, his body now moving towards this Black Snake Army commander like a small mountain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, what he never expected was that after this Black Snake Army commander used the broadsword in his hand to get rid of the giant hammer, he charged straight at his midline, forcibly ramming into his body.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He heard the bones in his chest release shattering noises.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He discovered that even though he was twice the size of the other party, he was forced to continuously back up, his legs drawing out two grooves in the soft black earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The instantaneous feeling of suffocation and intense pain prevented his chest and arms from exerting power. Then, he watched as the other party’s broadsword hacked over, hacking at his neck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>

Behind him, to the side of the cave barbarian’s neck, blood gushed out endlessly. This cave barbarian’s body that was shockingly sturdy slowly fell backwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All members of Black Snake Army, even if they weren’t cultivators, they still experienced endless tempering year-round, becoming powerful soldiers with strength and speed exceeding ordinary warriors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Their running speeds wouldn’t be inferior to these cave barbarian soldiers to begin with, so even if these cave barbarian soldiers wanted to run, they couldn’t escape at all. However, right at this time, the moment this Black Snake Army commander’s eyes landed on a cave barbarian who was even larger than the one he just killed, even stronger, the black earth below him suddenly began to shake intensely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of the Black Snake Army soldiers sensed that something strange was happening, sensing the danger that came from underground.</span></p>

Then, an even larger body followed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The broadsword wielding Black Snake Army commander’s breathing stopped slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As if doomsday suddenly descended, all of the Black Snake Army soldiers saw that around them, and even beneath them, the black earth caved in one chunk after another. Massive lizards roared as they leapt out from underground.</span></p>
