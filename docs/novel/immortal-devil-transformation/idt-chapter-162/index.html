 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within a small courtyard where cantaloupe melons were planted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fourth Grandpa Zhu held a large bowl of spicy braised noodles. There were several small dishes on the small table in front of him, several fried fish and a few side dishes among them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spicy braised noodles were simmered in a broth made from pork belly, chinese cabbage, and soybeans, the color exceptionally appetizing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, the one who sat on the other side of Fourth Grandpa Zhu was Xu Sheng, in front of him also a similar large bowl. This fish market thirteen shops young master already changed into clean black clothes, only, there was still a faint fishy smell that was impossible to get rid of.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why must I lower my head to him?” Fourth Grandpa Zhu picked up a piece of pork belly and several cabbage leaves, chewing them in his mouth, and then drank a mouthful of the spicy oily broth. He looked at Xu Sheng, asking seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he heard Fourth Grandpa Zhu say this, Xu Sheng pushed the course chinaware containing braised noodles in front of him, saying, “You all wish to do business, we wish to do business as well. You wish to go head-on against him, but at the very least, you cannot affect the business of other people.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fourth Grandpa Zhu gave Xu Sheng a look. “Lu Feng’s matter really was unexpected, you should also understand that if I really wished to assassinate him, I wouldn’t send her, and it wouldn’t happen there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sheng silently said, “However, this pretext of this matter is Fourth Grandpa Zhu, your fault to begin with.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fourth Grandpa Zhu laughed, eating large mouthfuls of the spicy braised noodles, instead replying with a question. “I heard that the second shopkeeper of Thriving Prosperity has long favored you, wishing to take you on as a student. You might very well become one of the shopkeepers of Thriving Prosperity, so why are you unwilling?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sheng’s face darkened a bit, giving this youngster even more of a bit of a valiant and fierce aura. He looked at this Fourth Grandpa Zhu, saying with a sunken voice, “Does this have anything to do with this matter we are discussing today?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s actually of the same reasoning.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Four Grandpa Zhu nodded. “In the end, you also understand our background. People like us are precisely shrimp and crab in the river, struggling for a living on this river, what we rely on is bravery, fierceness, the spirit of loyalty and self-sacrifice. What others see in us is also this part of us. However, once we leave the water, leave our birthplace, how brave could we be, how fierce can we be? On the shore, we’ll at most break a few cages, but what if we break our own arms and legs in the process? When others see us, could it be that they’ll forget about our background? That is why you aren’t willing to head to Thriving Prosperity, instead, you’d rather guard your thirteen docks. People like us who rely on bravery, fierceness, the spirit of loyalty and self-sacrifice, what we fight for is precisely face. Elder Mo attacked my face and reputation, if I can’t even purchase his building, how many more people will I be mocked by? Right now, he merely caught two of my people, yet I already have to lower my head to him, then when others catch two of my people in the future, I also have to lower my head, what am I supposed to do? How would I even have any footing?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a slight pause, Fourth Grandpa Zhu looked at Xu Sheng, saying, “Don’t forget that we are the same type of people. At this type of time, you all should stand with me, help my side.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sheng looked at the red and spicy bowl of noodles in front of him. After remaining silent for a long time, he picked up this bowl, starting to slowly eat it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What they’ve committed aren’t serious crimes. The Enforcer Office is only in charge of catching people, imprisonment is the warden’s business. I will get them out.” Fourth Grandpa Zhu looked at Xu Sheng in praise. This later generation’s way of doing things was indeed more honest and decisive than Fatty Xu, no wonder Fatty Xu entrusted all of the work to him. “What did he want you all to do in the fish market today?” While looking at this younger generation in praise, he then asked this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sheng ate the noodles, the spice making his forehead sweat a bit. “Nothing much. He only bought an Old River Lump and two Ironhead Dogfish. Just now, I already sent someone out to deliver them to him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since Xu Sheng calmed down and began to eat these braised noodles that tasted quite good, the fish market and Fourth Grandpa Zhu’s attitudes already became the same. Xu Sheng’s words also appeared extremely calm, when Fourth Grandpa Zhu heard this, he also only frowned slightly, a bit surprised. However, because of these words, an intense coughing sound suddenly sounded from within this small courtyard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These loud and clear, windbox-like coughing sounds made Xu Sheng think of someone. He stopped momentarily, his face also completely filled with shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fourth Grandpa Zhu also turned around in shock, only seeing that the bamboo screen was pushed aside by someone. A green silk clothed middle-aged man walked out from within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This middle-aged man’s condition seemed extremely poor, face pallid yellow, body thin and a bit stooped. While walking, there was a bit of ventilating sounds coming from his lungs and chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After confirming that it was who he suspected it to be, Xu Sheng immediately lowered the rough chinaware bowl in front of him, standing up and saying respectfully, “Little nephew pays his respects to Second Grandpa Zhang.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There is no need for excessive formalities.” The extremely sick middle-aged man reached out a hand, waving towards Xu Sheng, indicating for him to sit down. Then, he sat down at Fourth Grandpa Zhu’s side, saying in admiration, “Fatty Xu has taught his son well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sheng sat down. When he saw this middle-aged man’s shriveled yellow hands, he felt a bit of an indescribable feeling inside. This Breath River’s Dragon King, who would have thought that he would become sick to this degree.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Worthy nephew, how did your fish market end up getting your hands on some Ironhead Dogfish?” This Second Grandpa Zhang didn’t look to be that much older than Fourth Grandpa Zhu, but his condition was incredibly bad, he breathed heavily for a bit, and then looked at Xu Sheng, asking seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sheng explained carefully, “Previously, there was a fishing boat in Five Willows Beach that sank after being scraped by an old drifting tree trunk. Later on, when it was fished up, the two Ironhead Dogfish were found inside. Perhaps because there just happened to be quite a few fish and shrimp inside, these two Ironhead Dogfish went inside, ending up in getting fished up together with the boat. Originally, these two Ironhead Dogfish had already been purchased by Ocean Bowl Restaurant, but because something happened today, he purchased it with silver, so I took responsibility and sold them to him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Second Grandpa Zhang nodded. His head hung slightly, asking, “Then how large are those two Ironhead Dogfish? How large is the Old River Lump? Roughly how many years old?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Sheng said, “The two Ironhead Dogfish are around thirty something jin, as for the Old River Lump, it is at least a hundred and fifty years old, also something that had just happened to have been captured not long ago, at least seventy to eighty jin in weight.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This type of Old River Lump can’t even be eaten, why would he buy it?” Fourth Grandpa Zhu turned around to look at Second Grandpa Zhang, unable to help but ask. He didn’t know why Second Grandpa Zhang would be so interested in the things Lin Xi purchased.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Second Grandpa Zhang shook his head. “Normal people cannot digest it by eating it, but some people, if they have a suitable technique, can receive great benefits from eating this Old River Lump.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Fourth Grandpa Zhu and Xu Sheng simultaneously understood Second Grandpa Zhang’s intentions, their bodies shivering. They cried out in disbelief, “Then your intention is that he might be a cultivator?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Second Grandpa Zhang gave Fourth Grandpa Zhu a look, tapping the noodle bowl in his hands, and then saying with a nod, “Even if ordinary people’s food size is great, eating a jin of fish meat per meal is already quite incredible. This type of fish needs twenty to thirty meals before it can be completely eaten, no matter how delicious the fish meat is, what kind of special taste can it have at that point? That is why even if normal people want to taste delicacies, buying one is enough, why did he need to buy both? Cultivators can finish it in just two or three meals… that is why if there is nothing unexpected, he should be a cultivator.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After saying this, this pallid yellow-faced middle-aged man released a sigh. He looked at Fourth Grandpa Zhu, shook his head, and said, “That is why this matter, I fear that you still have to meet him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Kacha</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An old pomegranate tree’s dried branch just happened to fall at this time, falling into the earth below.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I understand.” Fourth Grandpa Zhu’s face also turned a bit pale, nodding and saying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Green Luan Academy, everyone around Lin Xi was a cultivator. For example, Qiu Lu and others’ ages were even younger than his own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, that was Green Luan Academy, a holy land in the massive Yunqin Empire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The students of Green Luan Academy were all elites of elites, chosen by the empire to begin with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At night, Lin Xi carefully scraped off the aquatic grasses and dirt from the shell of this Old River Lump on the small building’s riverfront terrace, and then he threw this Old River Lump into a large stone pot filled with clear water, pouring in a black medicinal liquid he had long finished preparing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, he removed an Ironhead Dogfish that had been properly bound from another large stone pot. He first removed the fine scales on its body, its innards and cleaned it, and then he directly stored it in a wicker basket, carrying it up to Pine Bamboo Chamber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During this period of time, no one disturbed him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Previously, Elder Mu and the tofu selling elderly woman also heard about the matters related to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They didn’t know that it was precisely because Lin Xi had the status of a ‘Divine General’ Green Luan Academy student, and because he had his ability, which was why he dared offend both the Town Supervisor and Thriving Prosperity at the same time. They only heard that the higher ups only gave Lin Xi a seven day time limit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why when Lin Xi returned at nighttime, Elder Mo and the elderly woman already went out for a stroll, helping Lin Xi ask around for information.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Wang Buping continued to focus on making an umbrella for Lin Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this time, Wang Buping already covered the umbrella surface, currently applying a final layer of oil coating on the umbrella. Even though this umbrella was completed with unprecedented care, it was definitely going to be completed within a few days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only, Wang Buping’s heart and his hands were a bit cold, because not even he knew if Lin Xi could make it through these next few days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He knew that the wind and rain of the royal court were much greater than the wind and rain of this river.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Lin Xi was instead extremely calm, since it was useless even if he was pressed for time, he could only wait.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The water on the riverside window’s furnace already boiled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi began to cut fish fillets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Ironhead Dogfish’s fish head and skin were all dark black, but the fish meat inside was white like fine jade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cuts of spotlessly white fillets carried a special fragrance, like magnolia as they scattered into the pot in front of Lin Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this time, a fine drizzle began outside, some wind and rain sounds could be heard from the surface of the river.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this time,a sharp and clear metal&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">dang</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;sound could be heard from the side the little building’s terrace reached out into.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His body was nimble as a leopard, with an extremely quick and silent stance, he leapt into the attic, opening the large wooden chest that was arranged like a table.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were three wooden cases inside. He carried the largest and smallest wooden cases on his back, and then held the other wooden chest in his hand. Then, he pushed open the two windows of this attic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
