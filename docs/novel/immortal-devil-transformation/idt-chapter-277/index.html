 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Yunqin cultivator took a deep breath. He clenched the golden blade’s handle, drawing it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was named Zhou Qijue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He came from Thunder Academy whose reputation during these years even vaguely exceeded Green Luan Academy’s, one of the most powerful cultivators in Dragon Snake Border Army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why he would defend this place alone here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he never thought that this kind of cave barbarian would walk out here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had seen many cave barbarian cultivators before, killed many of them, but he had never seen such a powerful cave barbarian cultivator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blade grinded against the scabbard, releasing an ear-piercing grinding noise, making his mind calm slightly. His body’s soul force poured generously into the golden long blade. The moment he drew this golden long blade, all of the runes on its surface were already pervaded with electricity, streaks of dazzling electrical arcs jumping along the blade, making this long golden blade in his hands turn into a lightning long blade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The air released&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">pi pa</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;noises, to the extent where there was endless blue smoke released from the lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of the weeds around Zhou Qijue’s body shot outwards, unable to stand up under the powerful aura his body released.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, Zhou Qijue’s body instantly became extremely rigid. The hand that gripped the lightning long blade began to tremble. He looked at the cave barbarian cultivator cultivator at the other side, his eyes that were still full of arrogance and pride only left with disbelief and alarm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That cave barbarian cultivator didn’t have any weapons, nor did he make any excessive movements, only slowly walking over. However, the red light on his body was already strong to the point of becoming fiery light, becoming a true blazing red flame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Qijue’s expression became more and more pale, suddenly recalling a certain legend. His entire body trembled, his soul force that was already rushing through his meridians seemed to have instantly almost doubled in speed, the soul force exceeding his limit making him release a muffled groan. His pale face flushed red, a blast of even greater aura surging from the blade in his hands. Streaks of golden electrical radiance extended in the void, his hand seemingly no longer grasping a long blade, but rather a massive ball of electricity.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Qijue’s body seemed to have been raised by this ball of electricity, losing weight, flying over the ground surface. He hacked towards this cave barbarian cultivator whose entire body was blazing with scarlet red flames.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The golden lightning made contact with the scarlet red flame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scarlet red flame suddenly became even more red, red like blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Qijue’s body stopped in the air, the word in his eyes immediately becoming blood red.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The instant he was swallowed up by this blood red color, Zhou Qijue confirmed that that legend was true.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was rumored that just like Yunqin Empire, Tangcang, Great Mang, the cave barbarians also had unimaginably powerful cultivators that existed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was rumored that there was a cave barbarian who entered Dragon Snake Mountain Range one winter, using his own strength to tear apart an important granary. Moreover, all of the cultivators and soldiers who guarded that granary completely turned into charred coal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the cave barbarians, there actually really were powerful existences with strength comparable to Sacred Experts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Zhou Qijue wanted to understand these things, but he lost his life soon afterwards, blazing hot temperature surging into his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That cave barbarian cultivator directly passed by his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">whoosh&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">noise sounded in the sky. Shou Qijue’s body was wrapped within blood red flames, burning as he fell to the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cave barbarian cultivator continued forward, the red light covering his body becoming more and more dim. He didn’t suffer the slightest bit of damage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This cave barbarian cultivator made his way through the mound full of Thorn Date Trees behind Zhou Qijue, entering a forest filled with trees flourishing with red and yellow leaves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An extremely fine rustling noise suddenly sounded within the forest, as if there were snakes moving through. This was fine voice normal cultivators couldn’t pick up at all, but this powerful cave barbarian cultivator was extraordinary, clearly hearing it. That was why he stopped, his grave and stern, features as if sculpted face instead produced a trace of a heavy expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ever since my martial uncle was killed because of Yunqin cultivators seven years ago, my Purgatory Mountain didn’t have anyone else who could cultivate this Demonic Flame Art. Who would have thought that I would see my Purgatory Mountain’s Demonic Flame Art blaze brilliantly on your body today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a sigh that sounded from the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This voice was still extremely soft, as if formed from the slight noises of countless snakes moving about. When they moved through the forest, even this cave barbarian cultivator couldn’t judge where this noise came from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Chased by Yunqin cultivators, before my martial uncle’s death, did he pass this cultivation method to you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Only, this Demonic Flame Art can only be successfully cultivated through my Purgatory Mountain’s secret medicines and body tempering methods… Who would have expected that purely by relying on your own aptitude, you could forcefully succeed.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A sigh sounded once more, as if a gust of wind separated into countless strands, wandering about the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This cave barbarian cultivator continued to remain silent, but red light appeared on his body once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry, I bear no malice against you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since my martial uncle passed this cultivation method to you, you can already be considered a disciple of my Purgatory Mountain, of the same root as me, so why would I harm you? Moreover, my purpose in coming here is the same as yours… I don’t wish for Yunqin to have their way, want to deal with Yunqin’s cultivators.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wisps of voices gathered into one, suddenly giving one a calm and warm feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This cave barbarian still didn’t say anything, but he could understand every word this person said. He nodded, all of the red light on his body completely disappearing again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go, we need to intercept two people first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I might not be able to deal with them alone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This faint voice sounded in the forest, and then there was no trace left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The yellow browed sword master dressed in the relaxed light yellow clothes and the Yunqin commander with the giant axe on his back made their way around the swamp full of giant black lotuses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The trees in the valley in front of them all seemed like peach trees, but they were extremely massive. Meanwhile, the light red fruits growing on them were instead all only the size of a pigeon age.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The high ranking military officer with the giant axe on his back didn’t immediately say anything, only coldly looking forward.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Yunqin high ranking officer still didn’t understand the meaning behind these words, but he knew that since the yellow browed sword master only spoke like this, he would definitely understand soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That is why he didn’t say too much, only nodding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While nodding, in the area ahead of him he continuously stared at, there was already red light that appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That bare upper bodied cave barbarian cultivator who wasn’t particularly large and tall was already walking over step by step.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The red light covering his body burned with greater and greater ferocity, starting to become real around his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yunqin high ranking military officer with the giant axe on his back nodded towards the yellow browed sword master again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After his nod, the calm night scene suddenly released an intense screaming noise. The yellow browed sword master’s body was already like a sharp blade, quickly tearing through the air, shooting towards that cave barbarian cultivator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, the Yunqin high ranking military officer also began to run crazily. His feet stomped heavily on the ground, producing rumbling noises on the great earth, actually completely not inferior to this cave barbarian cultivator’s war drum like footsteps.</span></p>

The majestic aura and brilliance that were released from his body and hands made his body continuously cross more than ten zhang of distance, instantly arriving before the cave barbarian cultivator. However, his feet never touched the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though there was no contact made, his mouth still already released a muffled groan, a wisp of blood flowing out, as if he instantly raised a heavy object he normally couldn’t raise at all. As if forcefully enduring his injuries, his hands were still right before his body, not touching the longsword on his back, but the longsword on his back instead released a draconic&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">zheng</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;cry, turning into a clear and bright streak of sword light. With terrifying speed and power, it hacked at the cave barbarian cultivator’s heart artery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The cave barbarian cultivator released a low roar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The blood like fiery light around his body surged, when the terrifying sword light moved through it, its speed became slow. His hands were raised, and then they clamped down, forcibly clasping this meteor like flying sword.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A blast of blazing gass that carried countless sparks erupted between his palms and this flying sword, flying in all directions. Large areas of plants were burnt black, starting to burn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The flying sword couldn’t advance an inch.</span></p>

His hair, brows, all became scorched black, but his flying body didn’t stop in the slightest. His white jade like hand already reached out, grabbing the flying sword that was released previously. With a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">chi</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;sound, his hand looked like he grabbed fiery red charcoal, releasing an unpleasant burnt flesh smell. The back of his hands and arms became scorched black layer after layer, extending towards his body. However, he instead released another muffled low groan, a wave of majestic power pouring into his flying sword once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The flying sword slid through this cave barbarian’s hands, stabbing through his chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wave of magma like hot blood gushed out, turning into flames.</span></p>

The giant axe with a lonely silver star like runes was revealed.</span></p>
