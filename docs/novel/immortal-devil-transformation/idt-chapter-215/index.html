 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Midday in Yunqin, the sunlight today was the most intense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yunqin’s people believed that executing a criminal at this time was not only true justice and brilliance, revealing everything the criminal did under the sky, they also believed that all resentment and curses could no longer exist under this midday scorching sun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, at East Port Town’s outer crossing, the scorching flame-like sunlight shone on the kneeling Xu Chengfeng and the eleven other prisoners on the execution platform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These people were normally extremely clean and neat, but right now, they were all in sorry states, most of them unable to even support themselves up, falling weak on the execution platform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were already countless civilians gathered under the platform, among them including the mother of Feng Zeyi, the corpse who floated down the river, ultimately triggering the Silver Hook Lane case. Right now, her hair was even more white than when she came to East Port Town to confirm the identity of the corpse, on her forehead was a small scar. Apart from her, the families of many girls who died in the Silver Hook Lane case were present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The crowd in the surroundings moved aside on their own, allowing these individuals to reach the very front, allowing them to witness the fall of these beasts clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi, Jiang Wenhe, Du Weiqing, as well as Lu Mingyi who was now in charge of the Warden Office appeared on the platform. When she saw Lin Xi appear, Feng Zeyi’s mother knelt down in front of him, not saying anything, her grizzled hair falling heavily onto the ground again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Silently, many people in the front row also knelt down, showing Lin Xi a great kowtow of respect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that instant, countless people gathered in front of the execution platform, yet it was completely silent, no excessive noises could be heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Judicial Sector’s officials sat behind a table on the execution platform. When they saw this scene, even these officials were a bit moved. After confirming that these were the criminals’ true bodies, when Lin Xi and the others all signed their names on the Ministry of Justice’s corresponding documents, a Judicial Sector major sixth rank execution official stood up, loudly declaring that there was no mistake with these people’s investigations, formally starting the execution.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A stopped gray-haired elder carrying a small metal case and an iron tower-like tall and sturdy dark faced man who had clearly drank too much strong alcohol walked onto the platform.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Judicial Sector official’s expression became serious, releasing a loud and fierce ‘kill’ !’ shout. The tall and sturdy dark faced man released a fierce exhale, and then stepped up. He reached out his left hand, raised the nape of the criminal that was laying weak on the ground, and then following a loud roar, a blade flashed past, the thick backed executioner’s blade hacked into his cervical vertebra with great precision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;shua&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">sound, that criminal’s head flew into the air, blood shooting out from his neck, splashing far into the distance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">hua</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;noise, the civilians took a large step backwards in fright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hah!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Judicial Sector’s Executioner didn’t feel any hesitation. When the first criminal’s head was still rolling on the stage, he already delivered another blow. Blood radiance splashed into the sky, and then another head tumbled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During the beheading process, the spectating civilliance thought about how wicked these people were, gradually becoming more courageous, cheers starting to sound. Moreover, the cheers became louder and louder, making the midday sunlight even more fiery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Xu Chengfeng was brought out, he was already limp on the stage. When the first criminal’s head fell, he already directly fainted from fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The stooped gray-haired elder with a small iron case on his back only narrowed his eyes slightly, looking at him without moving. Only when all of the other criminals' heads were removed, did he carefully move across the platform behind Xu Chengfeng. Then, he calmly opened the small iron case in his hands, first producing three fine silver needles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under everyone’s heavy breathing sounds, this stooped gray-haired elder, as if delivering acupuncture, stabbed the three needles into Xu Chengfeng’s scalp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Chengfeng suddenly released a groan, his entire body suddenly shaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The stooped gray-haired elder released a lightning fast strike against his spine, and then his originally weak and powerless body immediately straightened, moreover sitting perfectly straight without moving at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An extremely fine knife appeared in the old Judicial Sector Executioner’s hands. After a few strikes, Xu Chengfeng’s clothes were completely removed, leaving him almost naked, a fine layer of wire netting and a large case of ointment were produced from the Executioner’s iron case.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw these two things from the corners of his eyes, Xu Chengfeng’s entire body wanted to frantically jump up from the ground. However, he couldn’t move at all, even his tongue was rigid, only able to release the more simple, ambiguous scream that sounded incredibly miserable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His neck couldn’t move either, but the corners of his eyes were instead staring rigidly towards Lin Xi’s position, full of fear, despair and anger, as well as an expression of being lied to.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi turned his head slightly to the side, he wasn’t that fond of bloody scenes. When he saw Xu Chengfeng’s current expression, he only indifferently thought… even though I agreed to let you pass on a bit easier, I never agreed to let you die without any pain right from the start.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What method did you use to let him die a bit easier?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bian Linghan who was standing behind him sensed a rare hint of coldness appear on his face, asking by his ears with a voice only the two of them could hear right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Limestone Ear… we studied it before in Toxicology, it isn’t normally considered a poison, instead bringing benefits when eaten. After losing large amounts of blood, it would easily allow one’s will to become numb.” Lin Xi quietly replied. “He will likely start feeling numb after a hundred cutsblades or so. Even though I agreed to let him die a bit easier, because of the injustice of those people… these one hundred cutsblades cannot be reduced.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are still too merciful.” Bian Linghan released a cold snort, saying with disdain, “This type of person, even if he really was fooled, so what?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What you said makes sense.” Lin Xi nodded. After taking a deep breath, he then said, “However, I don’t want to think about these things anymore… I just did what I thought of at the time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bian Linghan shook her head helplessly, inwardly thinking that it’s a good thing it was out of an unwillingness to think about it, treating this casually, not because of inflexibility. Otherwise, there would be much bitterness to experience in the future.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fine wire netting tightly wrapped around Xu Chengfeng’s body, almost seemingly cutting him into many small pieces. Piece after piece of fair skin bulged from the netting. Xu Chengfeng’s fear became even greater, but his body still couldn’t move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The civilians under the platform erupted into cheers one after another again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Back then, countless people personally witnessed how Lin Xi judged the case, saw how arrogant this official’s son was, so right now, the more miserable he was, the more the resentment the civilians below felt was vented, this making them feel like the sky above East Port Town was more bright and just.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shua!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The old Executioner gently brandished the blade in his hands, and then following a blood-curdling scream, a piece of flesh separated from Xu Chengfeng’s body, as if noodles were being shaved from a chunk of flowers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">pu&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">noise sounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Chengfeng’s feces and urine flew everywhere, the stage becoming filthy.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While distancing himself from Xu Chengfeng whose entire body was covered in stink, Lin Xi recalled the elder who tried to scream with all his strength in Swallow Descent Town’s river dam, but in the end couldn’t release any noise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the dam reconstruction began, quite a few people from East Port and Swallow Descent already began to spontaneously raise money.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, in the vast Yunqin Empire territory, there were some places even the sunlight couldn’t reach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example, many places in Dragon Snake Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For example, East Orchid Valley which seemed especially barren and inhospitable, yet in Dragon Snake Mountain Range, was extremely normal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dragon Snake Mountain Range was Yunqin’s easternmost area, still Yunqin territory. Meanwhile, Yunqin Empire recognized the Great Desolate Swamp as the cave barbarians’ territory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of Great Desolate Swamp’s size… moreover this place being almost completely muddy marshland that might swallow people up at any time, stretching as far as the eye can see, not even the Green Luan Academy of Principal Zhang’s era had any cultivators who could traverse through this great swamp that stretched for who knew how many li. That is why regardless of whether it was Yunqin, Tangcang, or Great Mang, none of them knew just how massive this Great Desolate Swamp was, what exactly rested within. They only knew that many cave barbarians resided within this massive swamp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cave referred to cave dwellings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Barbarians referred to those who were strong, but uncivilized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Originally, Yunqin and the cave barbarians lived together in harmony, but as Yunqin Empire expanded their borders, when Yunqin’s exploration finally crossed Dragon Snake Mountain Range, when they wanted to try and expand further east, the pioneering caravans of Yunqin and the adventuring troops instead discovered these types of natives who lived in the swamp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These natives lived in some wet and cold caves within the swamp’s mounds, extremely uncivilized. However, these people instead possessed extremely powerful physiques. These cave barbarians, on average, were at least half a head taller than normal Yunqin people, and they naturally possessed strength exceeding that of ordinary people. In a one on one situation, even ordinary soldiers who had experienced much training found it difficult to defeat a young, twenty something year old cave barbarian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yunqin Empire discovered that this Dragon Snake Mountain Range and Great Desolate Swamp had many resources the empire needed, especially medicinal goods that were useful for cultivators, as well as powerful vicious beasts that could be tamed and used in the military. Meanwhile, the cave barbarians also discovered that there was a different world behind Dragon Snake Mountain Range, having some food and new things they lacked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yunqin Empire who had a powerful military wanted to conquer this place, but these simple-minded cave barbarians only had the most basic principles flowing through their blood, what they wanted was to steal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why war was inevitable.</span></p>
