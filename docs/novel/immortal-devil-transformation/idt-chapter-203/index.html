 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moonlight was like frost. This individual’s face could already be clearly seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a man dressed in yellow clothes, his appearance like that of a scholar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His facial features were meager, looking only forty something years of age, but his hair was already like autumn frost, already gray.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His eyes sockets were sunken, his tightly shut eyelids like wilted petals. This was a blind person.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, he slowly walked towards the fat merchant and Lin Xi’s group, but instead said ‘this lake’s lotus flowers truly are fine’, these words of praise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Under the white moonlight, the one who walked out was actually blind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even so, Lin Xi’s mood suddenly became a bit nervous, but not because this person was blind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because this was someone from Yuhua Family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In Green Luan Academy, he had already seen many great figures most cultivators of this world would never have a chance of meeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ordinary local and military cultivators could only be considered large fish in a great river. However, just those Green Luan Academy’s lecturers alone were already like vultures and hawks in the snowy mountains and plains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi understood extremely clearly that a cultivator like him, or even ordinary cultivators who were who were much more formidable, when compared to the truly formidable figures in Green Luan Academy or the royal court, the difference was still like that of heaven and earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many cultivators didn’t even know just how great this type of difference was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because they might not necessarily be able to meet these types of extraordinary cultivators in their entire lives, never meeting these types of top level individuals.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Lin Xi and Jiang Xiaoyi had both personally come into contact with them, so they understood this extremely clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yuhua Family’s ability to have someone sit behind Central Continent Imperial City’s heavy layers of curtains was just like how the current emperor faced Vice Principal Xia, he had no choice but to maintain respect and essential propriety. Even the emperor himself, when facing Yuhua Family and the other eight individuals seated behind the curtains along with the powers they represented, he still had to act with enough respect and concession.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was one of Yunqin Empire’s great heaven supporting pillars.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Conviction and promises, for priests, were the most important things. This was what Yuhua Family represented to begin with, that was why at least in Yunqin, there were basically no families that attached greater importance to promises than Yuhua Family.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why forget about a blind individual coming here, even if the one who came was a paralyzed individual seated on a wheelchair, he wouldn’t feel a shred of doubt that that person could defeat the short staff wielding fatty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fat merchant turned around. He watched this blind individual slowly approach, his eyes narrowing slightly. “Even the blind can see lotus flowers?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though he didn’t know the other party’s identity, this blind person seemingly not threatening in the slightest, just calmly walking over, when the frost-like moonlight scattered across his hair, there was instead an indescribable sense of solitude and bleakness, a wave of coldness continuously sweeping out from his core, spreading towards every pore of his existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There are many things that don’t need to be seen through the eyes.” The autumn frost haired yellow-clothed blind man replied in an indifferent tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fat merchant was still smiling, but the corners of his lips became slightly rigid. “In all of Deerwood Town, in this entire Deer Seeking Prefecture, I have never heard of someone like you? Where did you come from?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The yellow-clothed blind man shook his head. “You aren’t someone from here either. Where are you from? The Wind Fire Staff in your hands, where is that from?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fat merchant naturally wasn’t fond of this type of conversation style. However, this time, he didn’t speak too much nonsense either. After remaining silent for a moment, he said, “If I immediately leave right now, can everyone mind their own business?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That is not possible.” The yellow-clothed blind man shook his head again, saying, “According to Yunqin Law, the assassination of a royal court official is a great crime. Moreover, I believe that before this, there is no way you haven’t done other things.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then I want to see just what kind of skills a blind person like you has.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fat merchant sneered. It was always him toying with his prey, but ever since this blind man came, he knew that Lin Xi bringing his parents here was to guide him into a trap to begin with. When the cat is schemed against by the mouse instead, it already made him suppress the extreme anger he felt inside, but he still felt reservations against this unknown blind man. Meanwhile, at this time, he couldn’t endure it any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following a sneer, his fat body seemed to have instantly become full of air, bouncing up like a ball.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ground below his feet silently caved in, the short staff in his hands also releasing a loud noise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wind and fire sounds erupted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His body flickered with a faint yellow light, the short staff releasing dazzling green and red light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The short staff moved about in the air, the green light as if forming a hurricane, while the red radiance became streaks of true flames, as if streaks of red silk were dancing in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The malevolently smiling fat merchant was like a demonic fiend in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi and the others could all see his intentions. The short staff was brandished about in the air, his figure continuously changing positions as he jumped about. There were extremely loud noises released, clearly to prevent the yellow-clothed blind man from locking onto his position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the yellow-clothed blind man only reached out his right hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without paying the tremendous noises any attention, he only steadily reached out his right hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When this right hand reached out, his entire right arm seemed to have become a spear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A spear that was incredibly domineering, a spear that could sweep through everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The yellow-clothed blind man took a step out. With him as the center, a wave of energy immediately swept out. His body also seemed to have become a spear, a wave of extremely domineering strength erupting simultaneously from beneath his feet and within his body. The power gathered into a wave, viciously stabbing towards the fat merchant with absolute precision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Overlord Spear! You are someone from Zhang Family!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fat merchant suddenly released a scream of alarm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the scream was released, the yellow-clothed blind man’s arm that was like a spear already struck fiercely against the short staff aimed at his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wind and flames swirling around the short staff exploded with noise, forming a torch-like ball of fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The yellow-clothed blind man’s hand and the short staff made contant. His sleeves cracked apart, bursting into flames, but his body didn’t take a single step back, continuing to rush forward like an impaling spear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The area between the fat merchant’s thumb and index finger split apart, his body flying backwards. With a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">peng</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;noise, he fell into the lake water heavily.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A great splash rushed into the air.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The yellow-clothed blind man’s left hand brushed out, and then the burning cloth on his right arm was directly torn off, scattering across the ground. His arm didn’t have the slightest trace of injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fat merchant stood up in the water, extremely frightened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only now did he clearly see that the yellow-clothed blind man had a rectangular object on his back wrapped in cloth. At this time, the cloth had already been removed by the yellow-clothed blind man in a calm and unhurried manner, revealing what was inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inside was a silver-colored zither.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The yellow-clothed blind man reached the lakeside’s shallow waters with a step, his hands flipping around and playing this zither.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The silver zither was still on his back, but as soon as his hands made contact with it, an incomparably powerful aura immediately surged from that silver zither.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The mysterious and indescribable symbols on the silver zither all shone, rising like endless multicolored light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An incomparably powerful aura erupted from the yellow-clothed blind man’s back, forming a whirlpool.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fat merchant’s entire body immediately became drenched in cold sweat, this sweat even colder than the lake water between the lotus leaves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You are someone from Qin Family! …You are from Yuhua Family!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He widened his eyes with extreme horror, staring at this blind man, looking at that zither.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He finally understood just how great the error he made was, what kind of opponent he ended up provoking. However, at this moment, he could already no longer see anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because he had just fallen into the waters heavily, splashing out many droplets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several droplets landed in the way of the incomparably powerful aura released from the zither on the yellow-clothed blind man’s back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When the yellow-clothed blind man’s hands moved, the multicolored brilliance and whirlpool on the zither disappeared, those droplets instead bouncing off. They carried astonishing power, bouncing off the fat merchant’s face, and then exploding into mist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Many fine holes appeared in the fat merchant’s eyes. Blood, pain, and darkness immediately occupied his eye sockets and consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhang Family… Qin Family… Yuhua Family…” In that instant, he called out three titles, but where it ultimately led, was the same source: Yuhua Family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Overlord Spear was a powerful martial skill from Zhang Family, but Zhang Family was loyal to Yuhua Family, the martial skill also not an absolute secret.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Qin Family’s Sunrise Zither definitely wasn’t divulged to outsiders, only Qin Family’s people could use a unique type of soul force to stimulate and accompany this unique soul weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Family didn’t have many people, and Qin Family’s people had received Yuhua Family’s grace, vowing loyalty and devotion only to Yuhua Family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a Qin Family individual who cultivated the Overlord Spear, as well as someone from Yuhua Family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi and Jiang Xiaoyi were still fine, but Second Grandpa Zhang was shocked and speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had never met this type of powerful cultivator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the moment the fat merchant took action, he already knew that what he had anticipated was correct… during these years, this fat merchant’s cultivation already made substantial progress, already reaching mid stage Soul Master level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Wind Fire Staff in his hands was similarly an extremely rare soul weapon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he never expected this fat merchant to be sent flying like a rubber ball from their very first encounter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just from the rising splash of water, and then the scattering back down, the fat merchant who had just stood back up in the lake already became blind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yuhua Family’s people really are Yuhua Family’s people…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi shook his head, sighing in admiration under the moonlight, saying this with a light sigh inwardly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The yellow-clothed blind man didn’t stop here. A gentle zither sound turned into countless water noises, echoing by the lakeside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fat merchant seemed to have heard endless surging lake water crashing down, his consciousness completely losing track of his opponent’s whereabouts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, he felt a spear smash into his dantian viciously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The soul force and blood vessels in his dantian instantly shattered to pieces. This fat merchant who knew that his cultivation was completely destroyed curled up like a shrimp, wishing to release a scream of despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this howl was forcibly plugged up by a blast of cold water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The yellow-clothed blind man who calmly stepped into the river waters grabbed his neck. Like he was grabbing a pig awaiting slaughter, he walked back out, tossing the fat merchant by the lakeside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, his figure that was half drenched didn’t say anything, turning around and slowly leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Many thanks to mister.” While watching this yellow-clothed blind man leave, Lin Xi bowed respectfully, asking, “May I ask for mister’s name?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The yellow-clothed blind man’s figure paused slightly, but in the end, he still replied, “Qin Xiaoyu.”</span></p>
