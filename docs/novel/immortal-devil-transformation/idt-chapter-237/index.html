 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, his steps didn’t stop in the slightest. It was because he knew that these cultivators who showed up to help him right now only had a single objective, which was to help him rush out of this already spread net.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His figure quickly disappeared into the bamboo forest.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sword master’s sword-like long eyebrows moved upwards in an inclined manner, calmly looking at this incoming red-clothed woman. “Your Green Luan Academy has broken the rules.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The red-clothed woman shook her head, voice like silver bells. “That is not the case… because I am not one of Green Luan Academy’s people.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sword master’s sharp brows furrowed slightly, as if he didn’t believe the red-clothed woman’s words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can investigate it if you wish.” The red-clothed woman said with a light chuckle. “If one wishes to stop the River Water Severing Sword Ye Wangqing, no one can hide their true cultivation and martial skill, not even Green Luan Academy’s people. That is why you yourself are clear proof… in the following investigations, you and those people who investigate can be sure that I am not a member of Green Luan Academy’s experts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The grim sword master looked at this woman, saying, “If you aren’t from Green Luan Academy, then who are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The red-clothed middle-aged woman shook her head. “I cannot say.”</span></p>

His right hand moved to the moon white longsword in his left hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sword winds swept about.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Every single small bamboo sword could easily tear through flesh, the moon white sword scabbard flying within even more so able to smash through heavy armor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the red-clothed woman instead calmly took a step forward. When the moon white sword scabbard and endless small green bamboo swords were five feet from her chest, the zither case in her hands opened, splitting to pieces. The pieces fluttered about, becoming an expanse of scattering snow before her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The snow and the small green swords smashed together. The small green swords all split apart as well, turning into bamboo shreds that fluttered about in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Inside the zither case was a scarlet red zither. The zither didn’t have any strings, but instead had a few zither string-like runes that were deeply embedded into the stone-like zither body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The red-clothed woman’s fine fingers moved across the ancient zither. This zither instead floated before her, standing up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The snow-white sword scabbard stopped in the air, stopping in front of this zither. It was as if it had life, frantically moving forward, but in the end, it couldn’t advance an inch, finally falling in ruin. It was completely suppressed by the power permeating from this ancient zither, flying backwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this was only the sword scabbard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The real sword was white-colored, sparkling white and translucent like jade, lacking even a trace of impurity. There were only sculpted runes that winded about the sword body, forming a vivid and lifelike true dragon diagram.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The dragon runed fine jade made up the sword body, while fine ivory made up the hilt, the sword tassels brilliant gold. This sword was in the grim faced swordsman’s hands, while he himself already rushed past the fluttering bamboo threads and snow dust, a blade piercing at the red-clothed woman’s throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bamboo forest suddenly released a miserable and sad cry, as if a child was screaming in the night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A barbed deep blue steel arrow arrived from an unknown location, flying towards the back of this swordsman’s head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The grim faced swordsman’s expression was still silent, not changing his movements in the slightest, his sword form not stopping at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His left hand’s long sleeves moved slightly, seizing the snow-white sword scabbard that flew back, and then thrusted it backwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sword scabbard released a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">wu</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;noise, smashing into that screaming barbed blue arrow with incredible precision. The two both fell onto the ground. Then, borrowing this thrusting motion, he moved forward even more swiftly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Astonishing sword energy poured out from the longsword in his hands. The air in front of him was cut apart, becoming two visible streams of energy that spun at his sides.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The red-clothed woman’s hands began to move across the scarlet red stone zither.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Waves of majestic aura flew out from the stone zither’s string-like runes like scarlet multicolored light wisps. The entire bamboo forest became suffused with beautiful zither sounds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The grim faced sword master frowned slightly, the longsword in his hands trembling a bit. However, everything that stood in his path was still completely cut through by his sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of the powerful vital energy, multicolored brilliance and beautiful zither sounds were cut in half by this sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The longsword landed on this scarlet red stone zither.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scarlet red stone zither standing upright in front of the red-clothed woman was immediately filled with spider web-like cracks, and then it broke apart piece by piece.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black cloth in front of the red-clothed woman’s face was also attacked by sword energy, splitting apart, revealing a beautiful face. There was a small mole on her left cheek, as if it was an extremely fine teardrop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The swordsman’s sword form came to a pause.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this moment, this sword of his actually couldn’t continue forward, his entire body also starting to continuously tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The scarlet red stone zither before him completely shattered like his memories, like countless fine meteors as they smashed into his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moon white long gown covering his body was instantly covered in holes, blood gushing out from his mouth, his body flying backwards.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The grim faced swordsman landed on the ground, coughing lightly. With each cough, there was a bit of red blood that appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You all indeed aren’t Green Luan Academy’s people… Because Green Luan Academy’s people are more arrogant than you all, moreover wouldn’t use such shameless methods.” The grim faced swordsman lowered his head, looking at the specks of red at his feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It isn’t that we are shameless, but rather that it is you yourself who isn’t able to move past your own mental state.” The red-clothed woman looked at him calmly, quietly saying, “This is precisely why you don’t even dare to look at me, all because I can take on the same appearance as her… Ye Wangqing, three years ago, you should have had hope of breaking through into the Sacred Expert level. Even if you retained your cultivation from three years ago, no matter what kind of methods we used today, even if I could disturb your mind, it definitely wouldn’t be able to stop your blade, let alone seriously injure you. However, during these three years, your cultivation not only didn’t advance, it instead declined. Perhaps after just another year, Gao Gongyue who has to step aside when he sees you might even be able to defeat you.”</span></p>

If it was switched around, you who died and she who was here, could it be that you would want to see her in such a state, suffering for an entire life? Since you haven’t died yet, since you couldn’t prevent this separation by death, why do you change such sweet and happy memories into this kind of suffering?” The red-clothed woman looked at this head hung swordmaster, at this individual who was previously known to be able to sever rivers with a blade, someone who no cultivators in East Forest Province dared make their enemy, yet because of the death of his wife, he was unable to recover after this stumble, quietly saying this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After saying this, a hint of a sincere smile appeared on her face. She looked at Ye Wangqing warmly and full of pity, waving her hand and saying, “Goodbye.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wangqing suddenly raised his head, saw her smile, and then slowly withdrew into the bamboo forest, disappearing from her line of sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The true hidden attack from the other side wasn’t the powerful hidden archer, but rather the face identical to his wife’s underneath that black mask.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it was precisely because of this face that was so deeply engraved in his mind, something he couldn’t forget no matter what, preventing him from even entering meditation cultivation that when this woman left, being defeated by this type of method didn’t leave him with much hatred, instead only tears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">kacha</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;sounded.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of the green bamboo within a few dozen steps around him exploded with a loud noise. Countless bamboo leaves fluttered down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He didn’t leave, instead sitting down, closing his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The bamboo leaves scattered down on his body, seemingly enveloping him within.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He recalled all of the happy things, the blockage of the things in his heart loosening. He saw her smiling face… she seemed to be right at his side, never left all this time, just that he never noticed her during these past few years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ye Wangqing was the heir of the state founding general Ye Ningzhi. Even though he didn’t join the royal court, he had received the emperor’s grace, and that was why all of his basic necessities were taken care of, hidden within East Forest Province’s mountains and rivers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why today, he also had to take action, stop Lin Xi from leaving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only Gao Gongyue and a few others knew about his arrival. That was why the interweaving sword energy between this bamboo forest was momentarily unknown to anyone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Gao Gongyue leaping into the air, reaching a height he had never reached before, the expanse of white tree leaves that blossomed in the skies above the large residence and the endless silver snakes that rushed into the sky were seen by many people, leaving them shaken.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The iron faced Xiao Tieleng who stood before a high building’s window felt his face become even more cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He would endure the judgment he carried out on Lin Xi alone, but he never expected his judgment to actually still have been wrong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi made his way out of the bamboo forest. In front of him was a dark expanse of village houses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seemed like all of this village’s residents were poor, all some earthen walled bungalows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He prepared to first rush into this village, but right at this time, he heard the sounds of thunderous hooves.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On a distant street leading into this provincial capital, rows of black cavalry appeared in Lin Xi’s line of sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi released a sigh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the garrisoned army was moved on a large scale, it seemed like all of the return paths from Mu Chenyun’s residence to the provincial capital had already been completely blocked by the army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From the way things were looking, they might even start a carpet search after.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This game completely became one of whether they could or couldn’t capture Lin Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi looked around him, his eyes stopping over the mountain range to the east.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">East Forest provincial capital’s surroundings were plains, there were only a few mountain ranges to the southeast of the city, these mountains named Three Reeds Peak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a daoist temple that carried out trigram divinations there, still rather well-known, named White Cloud Monastery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi bent his body slightly, rushing into a desolate forest, quickly heading towards the mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh!</span></p>
