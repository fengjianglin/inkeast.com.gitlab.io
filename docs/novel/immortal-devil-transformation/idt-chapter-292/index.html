 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi’s body suddenly began to tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because he never felt despair, so while this Purgatory Mountain Sacred Expert exhausted the last bit of his lifespan to fly here, he had always been calculating the time, continuously judging the approximate itinerary, as well as considering what this Purgatory Mountain Sacred Expert wanted to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">According to the final Demonic Transformation state of this Purgatory Mountain Sacred Expert, the almost flying sword-like speed, there should be at least thirty li or so of distance from the swamp they were previously at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just from the way this Purgatory Mountain Sacred Expert passed away, he could sense the emotions he felt towards Purgatory Mountain and Great Mang Dynasty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were some things which, for cultivators like him and Tong Wei, also exceeded their own lives and deaths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That was why in Lin Xi’s opinion, the reason why this Purgatory Mountain Sacred Expert didn’t frantically try to kill one or two powerful cultivators who were extremely precious for Yunqin, instead bringing him and the green-pupiled young lady here, the highest possibility was that this Purgatory Mountain Sacred Expert had someone who would provide support.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The green-pupiled young lady’s injuries were a bit more more serious than his, but taking her life was still something easily done.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the green-pupiled young lady could recover her mobility faster than him, regardless of whether this Purgatory Mountain Sacred Expert had someone to support him, he was still dead for sure. According to this green-pupiled young lady’s previous performance, she definitely wasn’t going to be lenient.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His previous experiences told him that in a situation where he had enough soul force support, the more intense the body’s movements, the greater the blood flow, the greater the benefits Glorious King Destroys Restraints had on his body’s recovery process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The green-pupiled young lady was also doing her best to adjust her breathing. When she saw Lin Xi trying to forcefully move, this likely making his condition worse, her heart instead displayed a bit more hope.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, what made her quickly widen her eyes in indescribable shock, was that she saw that Lin Xi quickly stood up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though his body was shaking, every part incredibly cramped, Lin Xi still stood up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi forcefully stretched out his body, doing the Glorious King Destroys Restraints movements this green-pupiled young lady had no way of understanding. Some muscles and vessels in his body were extended, together with the guidance of soul force, it made him unable to help but release a grunt of pain. However, when these movements were completed, many painfully twitching areas in his body instead produced a fiery refreshed feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some strength began to return to his body. He could finally stand still, able to raise his hands and move his feet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While looking at the green-pupiled young lady who was still sitting on the ground, unable to stand up, looking at himself in shock, Lin Xi released a sigh. He then took a step out, a palm striking at her fine white neck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The green-pupiled young lady released a muffled groan, falling to the ground, clenching her teeth, using a fiery gaze to stare deathly at Lin Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi was a bit stunned.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was originally scared of her cultivation, wishing to first knock her unconscious to be safe, he never expected that because his strength still hadn’t completely returned, together with this green-pupiled young lady’s body being stronger than he imagined, this palm only knocked her over, not completely knocking her out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since he was sure that as long as she wasn’t given enough time to conduct large amounts of meditation cultivation, under her current condition, she couldn’t pose him any threat, Lin Xi didn’t add a second strike, instead not paying her fiery gaze any attention, turning around, starting to examine what this Purgatory Mountain Sacred Expert left behind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This Purgatory Mountain Sacred Expert’s clothes were already stuck together from sweat and blood, and it was releasing an abnormal stench, but Lin Xi searched him extremely thoroughly, not even letting go of a single clothing scrap.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this Purgatory Mountain Sacred Expert’s possessions were extremely simple, only holding an object in his hand. That was why Lin Xi finished his search rather quickly, standing up again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He frowned slightly, looking at the only thing on this Purgatory Mountain Sacred Expert’s body apart from the set of armor with curiosity .</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a round-shaped object formed from countless extremely fine glass fiber-like strands, like a small bath bomb used in bathing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this Purgatory Mountain Sacred Expert naturally didn’t come to Great Desolate Swamp to take a shower, so there was no way this was a bath bomb, a bath bomb definitely wouldn’t be detailed to the point where every single strand was as fine as a hair either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi held this exceptionally detailed item which was not like something of this ancient world at all, examining it with curiosity and confusion. While breathing, his breath sprayed across this thing in his hands. This extremely light object almost rose into the air, wisps of long, transparent threads instead scattered outwards without tangling at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi couldn’t hold himself back, but pulled at some strands. With a pull, this ‘bath bomb’ completely scattered, turning into countless transparent threads, scattering into the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was a small shaft inside, looking like the stem of a flower, the hundreds of thousands of transparent threads seemed to all extend from this flower stem-like small shaft. Every single thread was over a hundred meters in length, lacking the slightest weight, floating in the air with the breeze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi pinched this small shaft, this small shaft was also transparent. However, he saw that this shaft and many of the fine threads had similar fine patterns, not naturally formed. There seemed to be some type of natural attraction towards his own soul force, this immediately making him sink into an indescribable state of shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were runes!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His heavy breathing suddenly became unlike his own voice, releasing countless low hissing sounds along these threads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As his breathing stopped slightly, these hissing sounds also came to a stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi took a deep breath, starting to understand some things as well. Then, he began to quickly clean up these transparent threads that were made of an unknown material, but were definitely extremely hard to refine. Even in death, this Purgatory Mountain Sacred Expert was not willing to abandon this item.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The green-pupiled young lady also saw this scene, also thinking of certain possibilities, inwardly shaken, to the extent where she even forgot the curses she directed at Lin Xi inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this pause in inwardly cursing Lin Xi only lasted for a few breaths of time, because Lin Xi quickly put away this mysterious thing which should be related to a great secret regarding this Purgatory Mountain Sacred Expert, and then turned around towards her. He squatted down, reaching out a hand towards her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You? …you dare?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The green-pupiled young lady’s breathing stopped, reacting to what Lin Xi was going to do, immediately releasing a shrill scream.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, her body went rigid, her screaming sounds also suddenly stopping.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because Lin Xi only said ‘sorry’, and then began to carefully and seriously search her body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ahh!…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only when Lin Xi’s hand really touched her body, did she react, immediately screaming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop screaming!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi felt the bright moon-like ring in her sleeves, making her release a low shout.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">AHH!…</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">” The green pupiled young lady began to scream even more crazily.</span></p>

He produced a wooden small bottle from her waist, inside were more than ten dark green mung bean-sized seeds.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Stop shouting already… or else I’m going to plug your mouth with mud!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you keep screaming, I’m going to use this chance to take advantage of you!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“...” The green-pupiled young lady’s voice came to a screeching halt.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi shook his head, inwardly thinking that she wasn’t even scared of having her mouth plugged up by mud, but was actually scared of him being a pervert?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After examining the two items he removed from this green-pupiled young lady’s body, Lin Xi’s eyes then stopped over the Purgatory Mountain Sacred Expert’s corpse and the set of armor on the ground again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were no soul weapons capable of flight in all of Yunqin, so this set of Purgatory Mountain armor possessed extreme epoch-marking significance for this world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just now, when he was searching this Purgatory Mountain Sacred Expert’s remains, he already discovered that this armor’s equipping features weren’t things he could understand, so it seemed like experts of this level were the true binding force of the armor. Moreover, even though this armor looked light, together with those two giant pairs of wings, the weight was definitely not something he could completely bring away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a bit of hesitation, under the green-pupiled young lady’s murderous gaze, he quickly moved, choosing some armor pieces that could protect the chest, back, arms, legs and other parts, and then threw them into his black clothes that were already incredibly tattered, then carefully began to bind them onto him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he felt the cold and hard feeling of this powerful armor, Lin Xi immediately felt much more confident.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, he ignored the green-pupiled young lady’s gaze, starting to search around this reed field.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Finding a path that they definitely wouldn’t sink into was extremely difficult, but if he wanted to find a muddy land that could easily devour several dozen carriages, it was instead extremely easy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Less than five hundred steps from where they were, there were several sludge pools not even powerful cultivators dared head into.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He dragged the rest of the armor and this Purgatory Mountain Sacred Expert’s corpse over. While carefully removing the traces along the way, he tried to remember everything about this place. Then, he gave this Purgatory Mountain Sacred Expert’s corpse a bow of respect, then threw his corpse and armor into this quagmire that seemed to be able to devour everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Black water gathered from all sides. The corpse of a world shocking expert was thus buried here, no traces to be found again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What are you planning?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she saw Lin Xi quickly walk over, starting to quickly twist cloth into rope, the green-pupiled young lady who still couldn’t move her body immediately became rigid again, releasing another shrill cry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“To tie you up and bring you away obviously.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi said as if it was proper and to be expected. Then, he looked at this green-pupiled young lady, adding, “Don’t shout… or else... you understand.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You… are shameless.” The green-pupiled young lady’s face suddenly became even more pale, spitting out a mouthful of blood with a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">wah</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi wasn’t worried about this green-pupiled young lady killing herself under extreme despair at all, because if this green-pupiled young lady had methods to do so right now, then he still wouldn’t be able to stop her. What he had to be worried about was only to not let this green-pupiled young lady hurt him. He felt like he couldn’t remain here for too long. As such, he was completely focused on binding up this green-pupiled young lady like a sticky rice ball with any materials he could find.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only after completing this did he wipe at his sweat, feeling like this type of binding method was a bit evil.</span></p>
