 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Apart from the fifty something year old meager accountant-like man and the especially aloof and cold short-haired man, the auras of the gloomy faced old woman, the middle-aged man who was a head shorter than normal men, head a bit bigger, as well as that peasant-like robust man were clearly a bit greater than ordinary people, as if their bodies’ pores were all releasing hot air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These three, even if they weren’t cultivators, they were warriors who tempered their bodies far greater than ordinary people. While just walking like this, the cultivators not releasing their soul force, even with Lin Xi’s perception, he couldn’t determine what level these three’s cultivation reached.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Together with the tall bald man, the ‘Black Tiger Slayer’ who was clearly a cultivator as well, seven out of their nine-membered party were cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If the enemy weren’t the troops of Wenren Cangyue, the one who understood war better than anyone else in Yunqin Empire, this type of small group would already be extremely powerful in Yunqin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You all can see that our plan is to head to East Forest Province border’s Singe City, attack there. Before arriving there, our identities will always be the Ten Feral City Wolves. We won’t come into contact with any royal court powers, only using the strength of these ten wolves. That is why you must keep the information recorded on the notes you received in mind, because we are not only putting on a simple play, we also need to deceive some people who recognize the people among our ten wolves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Black Tiger Slayer’ reached out a finger and pointed at Lin Xi. “We won’t receive any new military orders along the way. I am the second in command of this trip, I will be presiding over the path we take to Singe City. He is the Black Wolf Night Black, this mission’s leader. When facing the enemy in battle, he will be the one in charge.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people in the room were all those who didn’t easily reveal joy or anger, their expressions not changing too much. However, Lin Xi himself instead released a cry of alarm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These are orders from above.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Black Tiger Slayer’ gave Lin Xi a look, saying this with a heavy voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This tall bald man whose face was scary enough to make little children cry felt a bit inwardly annoyed. He didn’t know the identities of anyone here either, but he knew that if a leader couldn’t convince those under him, making those under him develop any suspicions towards him, then there might be a terrifying scene that would appear when they encountered a dangerous situation. He hoped that by speaking these obvious words, he could remind this youngster who, unknown because of what abilities, was designated to be the leader by the higher ups, to watch his words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi didn’t think as far as he did. While feeling shocked, he naturally looked at the mask in his hands and the densely packed small words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The human face mask was just as young as him, just that he wasn’t as gentle looking as Lin Xi, naturally giving him a bit of an overcast fierceness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Black Wolf Night Black, from River Field City, age twenty-one, leader of the ten wolves. Gloomy, cold, and cunning, habitually silent, aggressive, doesn’t like female charms…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw these ‘parameters’, Lin Xi revealed a bitter expression, inwardly thinking that this murderer-like nature really was too far from his true nature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Bald Wolf Black Tiger Slayer, from River Field City, age forty-three, calm and cautious, aggressive…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Short Footed Wolf Hu Guipu, from River Field City, age forty-seven. Wordy and loves wine and women, aggressive…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Earth Wolf Deng Shoucheng, from River Field City, age thirty-nine, slow-witted, prefers beef, aggressive…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he read through all of these individuals’ materials, Lin Xi couldn’t help but release a sigh, quietly saying, “Is there anyone here who isn’t aggressive?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Black Tiger Slayer’s brows furrowed slightly, only feeling like speaking too much nonsense during this time when they should be carefully reading the contents of the notes was a sign of frivolousness. As such, his voice became a bit heavier and colder. “These people, or perhaps from here on out, it can be said to be us… there are at least a dozen or so homicide cases of people dying by their hands, so there are no pacifists.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Red Wolf Leek Flower… this is Bian Linghan… thank goodness she isn’t called great red wolf…”<span id="footnote-ref-f481"><a href="#footnote-f481">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw that Bian Linghan’s nickname was Red Wolf, the corners of Lin Xi’s lips couldn’t help but curl upwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These are all strong criminals who specialize in killing and looting in East Forest Province… all of these people have already died?” After enduring his self amused smile and giving Bian Linghan a look, Lin Xi continued to look at the note, randomly asking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Black Tiger Slayer’ nodded. “They were executed three days ago.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“According to this plan, we are to follow the fleet of a retiring fifth rank Justice Sector official… after reaching Singe City, don’t tell me we really have to take action, rob and kill them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Correct. That fifth rank Justice Sector official has privately engaged in black market business, many cases involving him as well, the proof conclusive. In addition, his wife and children have already preceded him. There are only this official and some trusted aides who are escorting his gold, silver and other wealth. We can be at ease and attack, this is equivalent to law enforcement.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While Lin Xi and ‘Black Tiger Slayer’ were chatting, the young waiter who guided Lin Xi in was currently by the doorstep outside this courtyard, chewing on melon seeds, keeping watch.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This courtyard and the alley outside were extremely clear, one could see the end with a single look, extremely peaceful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, in the room where Lin Xi placed his luggage, the ground beneath the bed suddenly caved in. Moreover, the entire chunk of extremely sturdy floor made of lime, sand, stones and glutinous rice water was supported by someone. This individual slowly slid out from the side, actually not releasing the slightest nose. That young waiter, as well as Lin Xi and the others who were several dozen steps out didn’t notice anything at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An entirely black-clothed, only two eyes exposed outside, his entire body drenched in sweat, slim masked individual silently crawled out from underneath the bed like a centipede.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even his breathing seemed to have been adjusted to an extremely natural rhythm, within a halt of time, the number of times he breathed was at least half that of a normal person. Moreover, his voice was also extremely gentle, extremely low.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was clear that he had already done something similar many times. This slim masked man who moved like a black centipede didn’t show the slightest hesitation, directly reaching out an extremely stable hand and undoing the large bag on Lin Xi’s bed in an extremely proficient manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The slim black-clothed man’s slightly gray pupils contracted slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because he saw that after undoing this layer of thin cloth, what was inside of it was actually a large pinewood chest, below the large pinewood chest was a slender cloth bag.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The slim black-clothed masked man shivered inwardly, but his movements instead became even more nimble, even faster.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fine black cloth covering the large black chest was also quickly opened by him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He immediately saw a light green delicate longsword that he had never seen before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The light green sword body’s transparent white runes looked like a layer of transparent crystal was applied over it, emanating from the sword end to the sword hilt that was created from a special gorgeous green shell material, was a type of wondrous flowing feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because he had never seen this type of soul weapon longsword before, moreover, because of that type of strange flowing feeling that ran from the sword tip to the sword hilt naturally, leaving one feeling stunned, feeling a mysterious type of attraction, even this masked individual who understood that he had to move quickly extremely well couldn’t help but be distracted by this longsword for a few breaths of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, he quickly opened up a small deerskin pouch next to this sheathless longsword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What appeared in his line of sight immediately after he opened this pouch were three flickering metal items.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This slim black clad masked man’s hands that were originally extremely steady suddenly trembled slightly, his heart starting to immediately twitch, pulsing quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three Yunqin medals!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just what kind of status did this person have, to actually have three Yunqin medals?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This slim black clad masked individual already did this more than once, long seeing that within the black cloth, apart from the light green sheathless longsword and this small deerskin pouch, there were only some sets of folded clothes. He also saw that two of them were light golden, but he previously didn’t realize what this light gold signified.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, when he saw the three gold medals, his eyes making contact with that light gold again, his body and fingers suddenly went rigid again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Only then did he clearly see that this large pinewood chest and the similar large pinewood chests he had seen before were still a bit different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On this large pinewood chest, there were many fine small holes all around, fully ventilated.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s him?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A name suddenly appeared in this slim black clad individual’s brain, suddenly remembering what might be in this large pinewood chest. His heart immediately began to jump to the point where it began to cramp again. His body turned extremely cold, soybean-sized beads of sweat appearing on his forehead. His body was a bit rigid, using his life’s lightest and quietest movements to take a step back and lower his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lying extremely peacefully in this wooden chest that was extremely spacious for it was Lucky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ever since it learned how to cultivate from Lin Xi, after each instance of cultivation, Lucky would always feel extremely comfortable, incredibly satisfied, so it liked to cultivate.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If this slim black clad individual was a State Master or higher level cultivator, he would have noticed strands of heaven and earth vital energy gathering towards Lin Xi’s bag even before entering this room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, he wasn’t a State Master level or higher cultivator, so he didn’t notice Lucky’s existence. However, his aura that was different from Lin Xi’s woke Lucky up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lucky who followed Lin Xi out of Great Desolate Swamp still didn’t know what kind of world it was outside, didn’t understand good and evil, so even after waking up, it was still confused, it didn’t know what this person wanted to do, if it was a friend or foe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, this slim black-clothed masked man who already roughly guessed Lin Xi’s identity, as well as guessed at what was inside the chest made a fatal mistake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was scared of releasing any sound or causing a disturbance, so he didn’t lower the small deerskin pouch holding the three medals, not returning it to the wooden chest. Instead, he retracted his hand, preparing to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This way, in Lucky’s eyes, he immediately became a thief who came to steal Lin Xi’s things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This person dared steal Lin Xi’s things!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In front of its face!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lucky immediately became angry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yi~~</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As such, it released a furious light cry and then used all of its strength.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pa!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The wooden chest instantly shattered, turning into countless frozen wood shaving crystals. Following a blast of crystalline white light, it rushed at the black clad masked individual who had just lowered his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black clad individual’s eyes immediately widened. He opened his mouth wide, the black mask covering his face caving in. His forehead released yellow radiance, but it was completely useless. His skin released a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">pa</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;sound, as if given a huge slap. Then, his black clothes became snow-white, the sweat on his forehead becoming beads of eyes, his eyes also becoming deathly pale frozen beads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His hands were still reaching outwards, trying to block in front of him as he turned into a white ice sculpture.</span></p>
