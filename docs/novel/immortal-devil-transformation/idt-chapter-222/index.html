 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arrows continuously smashed into the carriages’ wooden slabs, releasing war drum-like muffled striking noises. The horses who were hit by arrows fell onto the ground, rolling all over the ground in pain, shaking the two fleets until they groaned with noise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sounds of arrows flying through the air, entering wooden slabs and flesh, the neighing of horses, all these sounds mixed together, directly turning the areas where those carriages were into a scene from hell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi stared at this hellish scene, his brows furrowing slightly as he quietly said, “You’ve never deceived them before, this is indeed a very good explanation… however, why did you fool them this time?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Feirong said in an extremely innocent and as it should be manner, “Of course it’s because I wish to follow you. Also, by letting them give it a try, it’ll obviously make things safer for us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she heard the word ‘us’, Bian Linghan immediately furrowed her brows in an even more displeased manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Something doesn’t seem to be quite right.” Right at this time, Jiang Xiaoyi suddenly spoke with a deep but quiet voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi’s eyes never left that region either. He also long sensed that something wasn’t quite right.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because those two rows of carriages were too calm. When they faced the sudden rain of arrows, this fleet of carriages that left North Grain Cave Town only used the fastest speed to open the carriage doors, and then rushed inside the almost completely shut carriages as if they were sure none of these arrows could penetrate the carriage’s walls. Meanwhile, most of the men of the fleet arriving from the other side directly hid beneath the carriages.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, there were already no more arrows fired from the forest. The forest swayed like a great wave, figures with red scarfs wrapped around their heads rushed out from the forest while screaming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even if all of the personnel of the two fleets were totaled up, it wouldn’t exceed forty, while these bandits with red cloth wrapped around their heads exceeded a hundred. However, most of the men in these two carriages still didn’t show any signs of counterattacking, nor did they show any fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not having anything wrong is what would be strange.” Chen Feirong also calmed down, her eyes that seemed especially large and clear flickered as she looked in that direction, quietly saying, “Those who dare do business in this type of place obviously aren’t simple… they didn’t even send out anyone in advance to scout the forests around them, this can only mean that the people in these two fleets have absolute confidence in their own strength. Even if a great massacre is carried out here, it wouldn’t startle the Border Army’s wandering cavalry.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It is only those blinded by greed, people who are directly involved, who can’t tell that something isn’t right… for your opponents to even be of this level, it makes me want to follow you even more.” These two lines were spoken in an extremely low voice, as if she was muttering to herself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi heard these two lines Chen Feirong spoke, but he didn’t immediately reply to her. However, his brows instead jumped fiercely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In his line of sight, those red scarfed figures who rushed out from the forest were already less than two hundred steps from the carriage fleet.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this moment, a single figure walked out from the two fleets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky’s color already became much darker, the two carriages not having any lights lit. Originally, Lin Xi and the others, under this type of distance, couldn’t recognize any faces, yet at this time, he could see that person clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because this person’s entire body released bright yellow light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a middle-aged man whose beard was trimmed extremely neatly on both sides, but it was precisely because it was trimmed so carefully, together with the hopeful sinister smile that appeared on his face, that it made his entire figure seem to release a wave of treacherous aura.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi, Jiang Xiaoyi and Bian Linghan’s breathing suddenly stopped, as if a cold bucket of water immediately poured down their heads, the chilliness seeping into their bones. The three of them subconsciously didn’t dare move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That man whose beard was trimmed extremely meticulously, following a few rise and falls, rushed up to those red scarfed figures with unimaginable speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They couldn’t even see just what kind of movements he made clearly. The two red scarfed figures he directly faced couldn’t even release a shout before their bodies directly exploded from the back, turning into countless pieces of fragmented flesh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Immediately, all of the red scarfed figures’ excited shouts completely disappeared, this place becoming deathly still.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Unknowingly when, a black spear appeared in this excessively meticulously shaved man’s hands. At this moment, he tossed it out in a nonchalant manner.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spear released an exceptionally shrill noise in the air, continuously penetrating the bodies of five red scarfed figures in a row, producing a long wave of blood across the sky. Only then did it bring the last corpse with it, nailing itself into the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi’s palm was covered in a fine layer of cold sweat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just what level of cultivation did this cultivator have?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instantly killing several ordinary warriors wasn’t difficult for cultivators, but to directly crush them into pieces, make them explode from the back, this level of power was still completely unimaginable for Lin Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“State Master!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Feirong spoke with an extremely quiet voice, a bit nervous, but extremely certain. “Just what kind of transaction is this! …This little beardie actually has State Master level cultivation!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi!...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distant skies, strange air tearing sounds continuously sounded again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, all of those red scarfed figures’ initial complacency and excitement turned into horror and fear. That meticulously shaved man moved through them with extreme speed, every single person that was near him was smashed into a blast of bloody paste by a single move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The giant iron shields and poisoned chained sickles that were normally used to deal with cultivators didn’t serve any use. All of these red scarfed warriors began to run in all directions like stray dogs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Six individuals walked out from within the carriages side by side, every one of them holding an extremely heavy and massive shadow in their hands. The continuous&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">chi chi chi</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;noises in the air were released precisely by the half human-sized shadow in their hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The frantically running figures produced bursts of blood one after another, and then fell heavily onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Crossbow machines!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bian Linghan said these two words with a somewhat strange voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi and Jiang Xiaoyi couldn’t help but exchange a look, both of them seeing the chilliness in the other party’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two could also see that what rested in the six individuals’ hands were rapid fire crossbow machines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Yunqin didn’t have this type of falcon head shaped giant continuous fire crossbow machines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yunqin’s continuous fire crossbow machines’ greatest effective range wasn’t less than fifty steps, yet the continuous fire crossbow machines in these six individual’s hands clearly reached close to a hundred steps, already practically identical to a normal longbow’s firing range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, judging from this crossbow machine’s torrential rain-like continuous firing rate, even if it was an ordinary soldier, when using this type of crossbow machine, they could deliver great threat to ordinary cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In just a moment of time, a scene of pure massacre already came to an end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Not a single one of those warriors who rushed out from the forest were able to flee.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A red scarfed bandit who ran the fastest suddenly stood still, his entire body shaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because he discovered that unknowingly when, the meticulously shaved man had already appeared in front of him, looking at him with sinister eyes filled with mockery. Meanwhile, all around him were smashed flesh and corpses. Not even a single one of those who rushed out with him was still standing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi slowly closed the wooden chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These giant continuous fire crossbow machines that had never appeared on a formal battlefield were still not much for them, but the existence of a State Master level cultivator made it so that at the very least, right now, they couldn’t make any movements at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This world’s soul force cultivation almost completely lacked all techniques. This was especially the case for State Knight level and higher, no spiritual medicines being useful. If one wanted to increase their cultivation after that, they could only rely on meditation cultivation, relying on the slow accumulation of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, the greater the cultivation, the slower the growth of cultivation itself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This reasoning was extremely simple. The bodies of cultivators were like bowls, if this bowl was only the size of a rice bowl, then when water is added from cultivation each day, one could see visible growth. However, when the bowl became the size of a pond, who knew how many drops had to be added before just a bit of movement could be seen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With Lin Xi and the others’ strength, they still might have a chance of winning against a Soul Master, but against a State Knight, there was already definitely no chances of success.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for State Master… if they faced the enemy from the front, with Lin Xi’s current strength, he was no different from those ordinary warriors, his entire body might be smashed to pieces from the moment they face each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">State Knights should be extremely glorious figures in this world. Meanwhile, State Masters were dragons among men, they shouldn’t appear here at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Feirong’s original excitement completely vanished as well. Her powerful curiosity towards what was inside the two carriage fleets, compared to the shock of a State Master level cultivator, really seemed a bit too frail.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The people in the two groups of carriages already began to sweep through this scene of tragedy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The horses that dragged the carriages were almost completely killed under the initial rain of arrows, but the people in the carriage didn’t seem anxious at all, only dragging the horses to the side of the road.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You have seen these people’s strength as well, so you should understand that following us won’t bring you any benefits.” After remaining silent for a bit, Lin Xi turned around to look at the low lying Chen Feirong, quietly saying, “You can leave now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Leave?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Feirong stared at Lin Xi’s bright eyes, shaking her head and saying with an extremely serious tone, “What I said to you before was real. I want to serve as your advisor, become your attendant.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why?” Lin Xi looked at Chen Feirong. “All things need a good reason.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Feirong looked at Lin Xi and said, “Because of your two medals, because you already have those medals at such a young age. This is already enough value for me to follow you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi shook his head. “You made a mistake… I am not a great figure like you imagine.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Feirong shook her head, “You will become that type of great figure… Moreover, for people like us, if you already became that type of great figure, why would you even pay any attention to us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi’s brows furrowed a bit tighter. He looked towards where the two fleets of carriages were, thought for a bit, and then turned around to look at Chen Feirong, asking, “What is your cultivation level?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Feirong replied quietly without much hesitation. “Initial stage Soul Master level.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If I still wanted to try and attack one fleet of carriages, would you still dare to follow me without any regard for your own life?” Lin Xi pointed at the place where the carriages were, and then at Chen Feirong, asking this.</span></p>
