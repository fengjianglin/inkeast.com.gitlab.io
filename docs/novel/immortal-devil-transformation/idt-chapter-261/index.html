 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Night enveloped the empire’s easternmost Dragon Snake Mountain Range.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Zongwei was leaning against a large rock, not moving at all as he stared into the valley in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The valley in front of him looked like a huge crevice was suddenly torn apart in the level ground before him, the jagged eagle mouth rock at both sides of the mountains blocked the sky’s originally dim radiance. Because of the low topography, much of the surrounding forest’s black waters wriggled into a small stream, flowing into this valley. Over time, most of the valley’s white shale was dyed black, the valley depths covered in thick black sludge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was Sheep Point Field Mountain’s Blackland Canyon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Sheep Point Field Mountain marked out by Yunqin were the four long and narrow mountain ranges shaped like sheep horns. These four long and narrow horns were criss-crossed and connected, Blackland Canyon was located precisely on the easternmost ‘sheep horn’, looking just like a crack on this ‘sheep horn’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Zongwei was a Sheep Point Field Mountain Patrol Army third level soldier. In Yunqin’s border army, ordinary soldiers were only divided into three levels. If Lin Xi didn’t have a military level, even with his cultivator status, if he just entered the border army, he would still only be a first level soldier. First level was a new recruit, third level soldiers were experienced elite soldiers who had accumulated a set amount of military contributions. Above this was a minor tenth rank officer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This canyon that he was currently staring at was impossible for Yunqin’s border army to cross through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black earth below that seemed hard was actually a pool of sludge, able to easily swallow up over a hundred soldiers. However, those cave barbarians instead had a natural type of intuition towards these swamps, able to easily cross this type of place without any casualties.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This ‘sheep point’ already penetrated deeply into the cave barbarians’ Great Desolate Swamp, some of the Great Desolate Swamp’s unique rotten smell already entering this Blackland Canyon. Together with the fact that the patrol army’s manpower was severely lacking ever since last autumn, for the sake of ensuring that more people still had enough stamina, the number of guards at night had changed from the original sixteen down to eight. Right now, he was the only one watching this Blackland Canyon, so he had to always maintain absolute vigilance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he felt a bit of fatigue, he moved a piece of black and plump leaf into his mouth &nbsp;with extremely slow movements, keeping it under his tongue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A bitterness that made one’s scalp go numb continuously seeped out from this Black Snake Orchid Grass which was unique to Dragon Snake Mountain Range, continuously dispelling his fatigue.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the time when Ash Scorpions were active.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the forest around him, rustling sounds could be heard. There were clearly extremely poisonous thumb-sized gray colored scorpions crawling about, the tips of their tails flickering with faint cold light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">huala</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;noise, there was a dried branch-like object that suddenly fell from a tree not far from him, but then, it began to quickly move about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a certain unknown venomous snake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Zongwei remained still, always remaining vigilant as he looked at the black valley.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, his expression froze. There was a clear abnormally tall and sturdy figure that appeared in the valley’s mist like a demon. It advanced slowly in an extremely swift and cautious manner and then stopped again, silently making a hand gesture behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A wave of biting coldness that seemed to even exceed the bitterness of the Black Snake Orchid Grass in his mouth immediately flooded his entire body, making every pore release wisps of chilliness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cave barbarian!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just from his height that exceeded that of an ordinary person, as well as the large amounts of dark skin exposed outside, he was certain that this was a cave barbarian!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, cave barbarians either didn’t show up, or there were at least several dozen to over a hundred of them that showed up, attacking like a swarm. When did they become like Yunqin soldiers, having this type of vanguard scout?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These cave barbarians who have remained stupid for decades, never changed their military strategy, when did they suddenly produce this type of change?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While looking at that tall and sturdy figure, those movements that were nimble like a ghost, not matching its size at all, Wang Zongwei immediately entered a state of extreme shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I feel like he has been waiting for us to give him a chance all this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the forest depths behind Wang Zongwei, dozens of soldiers were resting in black leather sleeping bags hanging from trees. They were already accustomed to this type of resting method. The daytime march already exhausted a large amount of their stamina as well, urgently needing sleep to replenish themselves, which was why these still fully equipped black-armored soldiers were already sound asleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Weigai and Kang Qianjue had just finished quietly discussing tomorrow’s army itinerary. Then, they began to discuss Lin Xi they left behind in Sheep Point Field Mountain Patrol Army Camp.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he heard Kang Qianjue’s words, Xin Weigai said with a cold laugh, “How are we supposed to give him a chance? He’s not a new recruit who just arrived, he is a seventh ranked Patrol Officer, and he is a cultivator as well… If he even slightly refuses to obey orders, there is no way for us to restrict him at all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I understand what you are saying, but he is still a cultivator in the end.” Kang Qianjue looked at Xin Weigai and said quietly, “During these days, we treated him like this, yet he hasn’t showed any signs of retaliating strongly, so perhaps his nature isn’t as wild and untamed as those other cultivators’. Perhaps we should ask him about his intentions… see if he is willing to serve as a first level soldier, completely obey our instructions, to first try to learn and adapt this way.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You should understand.” After a slight pause, Kang Qianjue looked at Xin Weigai and said with a light sigh, “Even Sheep Point Field Mountain’s vanguard camp needs a cultivator, yet they still haven’t obtained any reinforcements. Even if he cannot endure it anymore here and really goes back, we might not necessarily be able to obtain a new cultivator. Moreover, the various fronts this year have all had a harder time than before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Weigai entered a momentary state of silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the slope outside Blackland Canyon, Wang Zongwei whose entire body was suffused with biting cold chilliness didn’t immediately release a warning sign, only lying still, frozen in shock like a rock as he looked at that tall and sturdy silhouette.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because any experienced Yunqin elite soldier would try to remain calm in this type of situation. Under this type of distance, he still had some time to observe them, try to see how large the other side’s numbers were, what kind of strength they had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he was in a hurry to issue a warning, they might miss out on a chance to encircle and annihilate this small cave barbarian troop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That cave barbarian who gave off a really strange feeling leaned against a cliff, this position something only Wang Zongwei who was facing the canyon entrance could see. The hidden sentries in the mountain forest at the canyon’s two sides didn’t have any chance of detecting his whereabouts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After taking another five or six steps forward, this cave barbarian stopped again, seemingly making another gesture behind him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tall and sturdy dark figures made their way out of the mist behind him one after another, also advancing with exceptional nimbleness and care.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ghost-like figures became more and more numerous. A moment later, the mist behind that cave barbarian seemed to have been completely suffused by layers of shadows, scattered away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Zongwei’s breathing immediately stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, he used almost all of his strength to blow the wooden whistle in his chest, releasing a owl screaming shrill noise. His entire figure also leapt out from the ground, using the fastest speed he had ever ran with in his life to head into the forest behind him, towards the Patrol Army campsite in the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These weren’t some scattered cave barbarians who were bored, wishing to mess around at night in Dragon Snake Mountain Range, but rather a large cave barbarian troop!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Weigai remained silent for a moment. He opened his mouth, wishing to reply to Kang Qianjue, but right at this time, a shrill screaming sound rang through the mountain forest!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Weigai and Kang Qianjue’s expressions immediately changed, now frantically sprinting towards a hillside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black-armored soldiers in the forest behind them immediately woke up, a larger half of them directly drawing their blades, cutting the ropes holding their suspended sleeping backs in place, using the fall to completely wake themselves up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hillside Xin Weigai and Kang Qianjue frantically ran towards had a large tree, this area was the highest point of this forest within a few li.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment the two of them began to sprint crazily, that bold and upright tree that could normally hide quite a few tree snakes also already released an extremely loud warning noise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A soldier climbed down from the treetop and jumped off with the fastest speed possible. When he faced the two officers who were running over as quickly as possible, while gasping for breath, he screamed out, “Cave barbarian large troop!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Weigai and Kang Qianjue didn’t reveal the slightest hesitation, continuing forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just from the noise, they knew that the previous alert came from Wang Zongwei in front of Blackland Canyon. Meanwhile, right now, Wang Zongwei’s warning sound was still continuously ringing, proving that they still had some time, able to see just what kind of opponent it was exactly, able to give the most precise orders from this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they arrived at the top of this slope, after taking a moment to breathe heavily, Xin Weigai and Kang Qianjue saw their opponents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Retreat! Stone cave house!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In that instant, Xin Weigai’s pupils contracted rapidly, releasing a sky shaking order.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His voice was loud, to the extent where it even made Xin Weigai, whose breathing still hadn’t become even yet, release a bit of bloodiness from his throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Zongwei was still frantically running, the distance already less than a hundred steps from the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The spacious grassland outside Blackland Canyon was already completely flattened by a group of crazily sprinting tall and sturdy figures.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, these tall and sturdy figures who were running crazily didn’t care about their previous secretive movements anymore, completely filled with an extremely bold and domineering unruliness. Even though in the dark night, they only looked like shadows, the muscles on their bodies were still tough and hard like rocks, their bodies full of explosive power, even the ground was shaking under their feet. This full speed sprinting didn’t seem to use up their stamina at all. As they ran on the slightly inclined mountain land, they actually ran faster and faster, with greater and greater power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the Blackland Canyon behind them, there were shadows that leapt out one after another.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just the number of cave barbarian figures in Xin Weigai and Kang Qianjue’s line of sight already exceeded sixty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Sixty cave barbarians, this was already equivalent to two hundred Yunqin border army soldiers, already a military group, not something their small patrol army could deal with at all!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of the black-armored soldiers already crawled out from their sleeping bags, drawing the weapons in their hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they heard Xin Weigai’s explosive roar, all of these black-armored soldiers didn’t hesitate in the slightest, all of them releasing a uniform shout, withdrawing towards the rear mountain forest at full speed. Only one soldier stopped slightly, forcefully using a sickle shaped flint to produce a spark. This spark alone lit a bonfire that he had long prepared, releasing an extremely strong smoke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They didn’t know what exactly happened, but from these military orders, they already knew that the incoming enemy was not someone they could face at all. Only by fleeing to a rock cave house that they discovered on their way here, not even marked out on the military map, could they have a chance of keeping their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Zongwei was crazily running for his life.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xin Weigai and Kang Qianjue also turned around, frantically running for their lives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of these Sheep Point Field Mountain Patrol Army soldiers withdrew with absolute decisiveness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this time, there was an expanse of dark clouds in the sky, drifting towards the crescent moon that already seemed extremely dim in this Dragon Snake Mountain Range.</span></p>
