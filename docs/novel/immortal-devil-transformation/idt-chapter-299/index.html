 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sharp sword twisted in his inner organs, turning Wei Xianwu’s lower abdomen region into a mangled bloody mess.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Xianwu released another wild beast-like roar, letting go of the longsword which was blocked by Lin Xi and stopped between the two of them. His hands formed claws, grabbing towards Lin Xi’s face, wishing to crush Lin Xi’s face into a lump of badly mangled flesh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The extremely calm faced Lin Xi bent down slightly, charging straight into Wei Xianwu's chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Xianwu’s hands missed. They immediately moved downwards, grabbing towards Lin Xi’s neck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this time, Lin Xi’s dagger was already removed from Wei Xianwu’s underbelly. It then stabbed in fiercely again, twisting once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One thrust!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two thrusts!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three thrusts!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Wei Xianwu suffered the first thrust into his stomach, his hands already landed on Lin Xi’s neck that was covered in his own gushing blood, touching Lin Xi’s blood vessels that were swelling from force exertion. However, his hands just couldn’t produce the slightest bit of strength anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi used his body to prop up Wei Xianwu’s body, intuitively sensing that Wei Xianwu’s hands slid from his neck powerlessly. Only when he sensed that Wei Xianwu’s abdominal inner organs had all turned into mush, did he pull himself back, step backwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wei Xianwu’s body slid down, kneeling on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Crushed flesh flowed out like hot congee from several enormous wounds in his abdomen, flowing along the black earth in front of him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How is this possible…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With the last of his strength, Wei Xianwu forcefully raised his head to look towards Lin Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi’s explosive power and movements completely relied on an unending stream of soul force… Even now, he still couldn’t understand how despite being a cultivator of the same level as himself, after killing so many bandits, Lin Xi could still have this much soul force.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he was in East Port Town, he told Lin Xi to please just wait.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However when today arrived, his ‘please just wait’, actually became the greatest joke. He was actually killed as soon as they faced each other, defeated with almost no strength to retaliate…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is it Green Luan Academy’s medicines?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he sensed the final threat of death descending, Wei Xianwu who felt everything around him go dark used the last of his strength to scream this out in despair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi didn’t say anything, so Wei Xianwu took this as a tacit agreement. However, in reality, Lin Xi was shaking his slightly with a bit of mockery, not wishing to waste any words on this opponent who he didn’t feel the slightest trace of respect for. He even killed cultivators with strength greater than Wei Xianwu’s. After Green Luan Academy’s martial skill slowly merged into his body’s consciousness, became practiced, even if it was a normal true battle, he had confidence in killing Wei Xianwu in a situation where he wasn’t injured, let alone today, in a situation where Wei Xianwu misjudged his soul force consumption.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The only one that made him truly worry was Xu Ningshen who wasn’t far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Ningshen watched indifferently as Wei Xianwu fell and died, and then he began to laugh.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His laugh was extremely sinister, extremely happy, clearly signaling that there was no finally no one who would stand in the way of his revenge, no one able to disturb him from slowly killing Lin Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The sky is about to brighten.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While looking at the vigilant Lin Xi who was doing his best to adjust his breathing, Xu Ningshen only walked up to the two Skyroot Otters, saying these words with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We have to rush at him together, we cannot go alone… or else we will both be killed by this person.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi Xiaoye walked over from behind Lin Xi, standing next to him, saying this to him seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi was already frowning because of Xu Ningshen’s previous ‘sky is about to brighten’ words. When he heard Chi Xiaoye’s words at this time, he nodded, releasing an&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">en</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Judging from Xu Ningshen’s previous movements, both he and Chi Xiaoye could tell that Xu Ningshen’s cultivation was higher than Wen Xianwu’s, that he was a Soul Master level cultivator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi had faced Xue Wantao before, so he understood extremely clearly that unless he paid the price of blood, together with using the ten halt ability, there was almost no chance of victory against this Soul Master level opponent. Moreover, he understood extremely clearly that Xu Ningshen obtained Great Mang’s cultivation inheritance, so he might have some strange methods that were different from Yunqin cultivators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Together with the fact that Xu Ningshen, because of the hatred he felt, already became extremely warped, this made him an opponent that was even harder to judge with normal reasoning, even more difficult to deal with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How much longer can your soul force support you at full strength for?” Chi Xiaoye asked Lin Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A halt and a half of time.” Lin Xi turned his head around slightly towards Chi Xiaoye. “You?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Half a halt of time.” Chi Xiaoye looked at Lin Xi and said, “That is why we must kill him within half a halt of time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi and Chi Xiaoye momentarily stood there without moving, side by side as Xu Ningshen slowly pressed forward.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Ningshen only looked at these two with a more and more excited strange expression, currently standing there without moving.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he was only ten steps from Xu Ningshen, Lin Xi’s legs once again stepped on the ground, producing blasts of mud. The emerald green dagger in his hand directly stabbed towards Xu Ningshen’s throat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the same time, Chi Xiaoye at his left side erupted with a wave of majestic power, her body rising like a swallow, fluttering into the sky. The bright moon-like ring directly hacked towards Xu Ningshen’s left rib.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though Chi Xiaoye’s figure was bent, her speed was a bit faster than Lin Xi’s.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though this was the first time they truly worked together, their coordination was instead full of tacit understanding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi Xiaoye’s blade immediately arrived, this forcing Xu Ningshen to first deal with her attack. Even though she couldn’t continue fighting, when this force was applied to Xu Ningshen’s body, even if Xu Ningshen could take it, his body would still lose its balance from the force. This way, Lin Xi who didn’t have enough strength to face him, had a chance to kill him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi Xiaoye’s movements were still fast to the point where it was impossible to avoid. The bright moon-like ring in her hands was extremely sharp, instantly cutting apart Xu Ningshen’s filth covered, putrid smelling clothes. However, what made Chi Xiaoye and Lin Xi both immediately feel a chill was that even now, Xu Ningshen didn’t have any intention of evading or blocking her attack.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sharp blade entered Xu Ningshen’s flesh, and then it was immediately clamped down in place by a pair of large hands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Blood gushed out from Xu Ningshen’s wound, but Xu Ningshen’s flesh not only became extremely sturdy and thick, the streaks of muscles inside also seemed to squirm about, rigidly holding Chi Xiaoye’s bright moon-like ring in place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi’s emerald green dagger also entered Xu Ningshen’s neck at this moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, when his dagger only entered an inch, he also sensed that it couldn’t advance any further, as if it was clamped down on by steel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two loud noises suddenly sounded by Lin Xi, Chi Xiaoye and Xu Ningshen’s ears.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A dagger unknowingly appeared in Xu Ningshen’s left hand, fiercely stabbing into Lin Xi’s chest. It made its way through Li Xi’s clothes, but couldn’t stab through the plate of armor underneath, producing a blast of sparks. Even though this set of Purgatory Mountain Sacred Expert armor was extremely sturdy, unable to strike through it even with Xu Ningshen’s current cultivation and weapon, the force of this blow still made Lin Xi’s entire chest feel as if it was struck by a great hammer. His face suddenly paled, continuously taking steps backwards. There was a breath stuck in his chest, preventing him from breathing, incredibly uncomfortable. Eventually, even his lungs were injured, releasing a mouthful of blood with a&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">pu</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;sound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The instant the dagger in his left hand smashed into Lin Xi’s chest, the black long blade in Xu Ningshen’s right hand descended towards Chi Xiaoye’s head. Chi Xiaoye subconsciously struggled. Even though she forcefully removed the bright moon-like ring from Xu Ningshen’s ribs, she couldn’t evade in time at all. Only when this long blade already reached her hair, did her left hand manage to strike against this blade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her left hand released dazzling radiance, releasing metallic noises when it made contact with the blade. However, this eruption of soul force exceeding her previous estimation also made her release a muffled groan. Her body became sluggish, one knee landing on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Ningshen’s figure staggered, only taking a few steps back, and then he stood still.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The painful heat within Lin Xi’s chest was terrible, but his limbs became incredibly ice-cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His emerald green dagger was currently nailed to Xu Ningshen’s neck. He was already bare-handed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He previously discussed with Chi Xiaoye that they had to kill Xu Ningshen within half a halt of time, but neither he nor Chi Xiaoye expected Xu Ningshen to be even more decisive than them. Moreover, Xu Ningshen had methods he didn’t know about after all. Right now, he saw that the skin around Xu Ningshen’s neck injury and the wound cut by Chi Xiaoye already became pitch-black and hard, as if the flesh in that region all already went rigid and died.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was definitely a suicidal indiscriminate destruction method.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, even though Xu Ningshen didn’t want to live, both he and Chi Xiaoye still wanted to continue living.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chi Xiaoye’s body suddenly began to tremble.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were only a few steps between Xu Ninghsen and her body. When she just began to stand back up, Xu Ningshen already arrived before her face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Xu Ningshen arrived in front of her, he flung aside his dagger that was already curved, pulling out the emerald green short sword in his neck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her body instinctively struck out with the ring in her hands, hacking at Xu Ningshen’s chest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Xu Ningshen allowed the ring to enter his body. Then, his flesh immediately became rigid, forcibly ‘biting’ down on this ring once more, the dead flesh’s power actually preventing the impact of her strike from even repelling Xu Ningshen, keeping Xu Ningshen connected to her by this ring.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, the emerald green dagger in Xu Ningshen’s hand stabbed towards her neck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of her internal injuries, Chi Xiaoye already couldn’t act like before, she could no longer forcibly use soul force to neutralize this strike. In the corner of her eyes, she saw that Lin Xi was frantically closing in, but she knew that Lin Xi already couldn’t rescue her in time. “Kill him!” In this instant, she knew that she already had no room for choice. She released a long roar, a power within her that was different from soul force entering her feet, turning into two streaks of dazzling green radiance, penetrating the ground beneath her.</span></p>
