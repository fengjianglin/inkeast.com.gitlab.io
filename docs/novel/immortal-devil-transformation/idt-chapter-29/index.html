 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What is the degree of medicinal receptivity?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The single-eyed black-robed lecturer was annoyed once again, but he still couldn’t find it within himself to erupt in anger. He looked at Lin Xi who asked such a stupid question, gave the bow’s body a pat, and then while holding back his annoyance, said, “Perhaps one of the most important factors when we talk about talent. To put it in a nutshell, it is just like eating. Others might be able to extract seventy to eighty percent of nourishment from a bowl of rice, while if you ate a bowl of rice, you would only absorb thirty or forty percent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In the end, it is still an issue of having an aptitude of two.” Lin Xi looked at the vexed single-eyed black-robed lecturer with a somewhat wronged expression. “However, didn’t we already have this aptitude tested? Why did teacher still want to test this…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Even though the Soul Inspection Stone rarely makes a mistake, you are heaven’s choice, so we all naturally still want to hold onto hope. Also, the main purpose of this black bow is to test for Windstalkers.” The single-eyed black-robed lecturer gave the innocent faced Lin Xi a look, and then he truly began to feel a wave of baseless resentment, saying hatefully, “Talent is divided into many aspects, the speed of entering meditation cultivation, spiritual medicine receptivity, degree of resonance between soul force and runes… you have never cultivated before, yet you easily entered cultivation meditation, number one among so many people, it really is rare. Based on what I know, not even the other two new students who entered via heaven’s choice are able to enter meditation cultivation as quickly as you, and that is even during the quiet nighttime. That is why I had you draw the black bow first, but the benefits you obtained from that Clear Truth Pill are no different from others with an aptitude of two.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the same spiritual pill, yet his cultivation increased the lowest. From the test’s results and this single-eyed black-robed lecturer’s expression of impatience and disappointment, he already came to this conclusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Towards this, he didn’t feel all that dejected, because from the bit that middle-aged uncle left him, he knew that both him and that middle-aged uncle’s aptitudes were really ‘second’! … it was because according to the information that middle-aged uncle left on the stele, the interior of the people of this world were like a bowl, while him and that middle-aged uncle’s bodies were like two bowls… when the same amount of water was placed in a single bowl versus two bowls, the double bowls’ water level would naturally be lower. However, in reality, when the two bowls’ contents were added together, there was no difference at all compared to the single bowl.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s why my aptitude should at least be two twos, which is four… moreover, my meditation cultivation speed is even first?” Lin Xi was instead rather self-satisfied, the corners of his lips curling upwards as he looked towards the single-eyed black-robed lecturer, asking, “Teacher, is my speed of entering meditation cultivation really number one? In that case, why did those of other departments have their first cultivation lesson yesterday evening?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“One thing you all have to understand is that even the worst of our Green Luan Academy students, when they go out into the outside world, scattered across the border armies, will still be like cranes among chickens. The students of other departments will unavoidably have to temper themselves on the battlefield, with many special operations even needing the coordination of students from different departments. However, our Self Defense Department is different. If we can’t cultivate during the day, or enter meditation on a war torn battlefield amidst shouts of war to recover our soul force, how will we bear the consumption of soul force? Even if we reach the State Knight level of cultivation, once our soul force is consumed, we wouldn’t even be a match for Soul Experts. That is why it is fine for other departments, but for our Self Defense Department, we must be able to quickly enter that state under any environment… of course, even out of all the students up to the ones who have just graduated, not many are able to enter meditation on the battlefield, replenishing soul force at any time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Based on your performance today, it originally seemed like you could easily accomplish this, having the talent of a great general…” When he spoke up to here, the single-eyed black-robed lecturer looked at Lin Xi and said, “But you have to understand that meditation cultivation and replenishing of soul force are roughly the same for everyone. Even if you can enter this state quickly, able to cultivate an hour or two more than other students, your degree of medicinal receptivity is still the most important aspect of aptitude. Using the academy’s Clear Truth Pill as an example, a single pill is equivalent to two to three years of a beginner cultivator’s cultivation accumulation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They’re that powerful! Then since I’ve entered as heaven’s choice, my speed of entering meditation so great… wouldn’t it be fine if I was just given a few more Clear Truth Pills?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Keep dreaming!” The single-eyed lecturer was triggered by Lin Xi’s shameless words to the point where he almost coughed out a mouthful of blood. “Forget about the rarity of the Clear Truth Pill’s ingredients, each year, our academy can only make enough to supply each new student with a single one. Moreover, the Clear Truth Pill is just like many other medicines, only useful once, there aren’t any additional benefits when more are ingested… if you are able to develop a new pill medicine, or manage to produce one that can be used repeatedly, then congratulations, who knows, you might very well become our Green Luan Academy’s vice principal!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In addition, I might as well just tell you right now that apart from this Clear Truth Pill, which can directly add you to the ranks of cultivators, being a direct gift from the academy, from today on, there are no pills that can be consumed for free. The remaining pills needed for cultivation have to be exchanged for through the points you all acquire. The academy wouldn’t waste the limited medicines on some good-for-nothing’s body.” After a slight pause, when he saw that Lin Xi didn’t seem dejected at all, he couldn’t help but add this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi looked at the single-eyed black-robed lecturer for a long time, and then said, “It seems like reaching the so-called State Knight level of cultivation is extremely difficult, or else teacher definitely wouldn’t become this upset, feeling such disappointment and frustration.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The single-eyed black-robed lecturer stared blankly for a moment, and then in a somewhat speechless manner, said, “As long as you understand. It seems like you do listen rather well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi then asked, “Then why is it that once we reach the State Knight level, pill medicines become useless?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why, why, why, do you think we have answers for everything?” The single-eyed black-robed lecturer said with a sneer, “The principal hated researching these useless things with principles that couldn’t be understood the most… in the thousands of years that have passed, once the State Knight level is reached, everyone has had to rely on their own meditation cultivation. This is, unless you can develop some type of pill medicine that can be used.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I understand.” Lin Xi gave the thin and weak looking Bian Linghan who didn’t say anything all this time a look and said, “Teacher, since your respected self already saw that she was a natural Windstalker, why didn’t you directly say it, instead having her mysteriously stay behind?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Our Yunqin Empire’s wars have never ended. The disciples sent out by the great academies are the cornerstones of our empire’s strength. Every elite student will become the target of other empires’ assassinations. At the very least, a third of the country’s talents weren’t sacrificed honorably on the battlefield, but rather died under the assassinations of various experts.” The single-eyed black-robed lecturer’s face completely became ice-cold. He looked at Lin Xi and Bian Linghan, saying, “Powerful and slippery Windstalkers will always be high up on the lists of assassination.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Which is why if we can keep it a secret, then we should do our best to keep it a secret?” Lin Xi’s expression immediately became serious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This ‘Little Black’ was left behind by the principal. It seems identical to other black greatbows, but in reality, there are some slight differences. That is why not even the academy’s senior students know that I can detect the potential of Windstalkers through this. No one will know that the reason why I had Bian Linghan stay behind isn’t to punish her, but rather because she has this type of talent. That is why if you don’t want her to become a target of assassination before she obtains some accomplishments, then it is best if you also keep this secret.” The single-eyed black-robed lecturer looked at Lin Xi, saying with narrowed eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi stared blankly for a moment, and then gave this black-robed lecturer an extremely serious bow of respect. “This disciple thanks teacher for his trust.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The single-eyed black-robed lecturer withdrew his gaze, and then coldly said, “There is no need to thank me, this trust comes from the vice-principal and the others’ heaven’s choice judgment. Also, you are extremely clean, impossible for you to have any type of corruption in family background. Deerwood Town really is remote, practically no one going through that place. It isn’t only your Lin Family, almost all of Deerwood Town’s residents have been extremely clean for many generations. Moreover, apart from the few nearby towns, you all don’t have much contact with the rest of the world.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi stuck out his tongue, saying in shock, “You guys investigated that thoroughly? Don’t tell me…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your current considerations aren’t bad.” The single-eyed black-robed lecturer saw through Lin Xi’s thoughts, nodding and saying, “Just like how we will plant spies in enemy empires, the other side will do the same in ours. Even though our investigations are extremely thorough, it is difficult to guarantee that none of Yunqin Empire’s enemies have infiltrated our academy. Even though you all will definitely be safe in the academy, there have been assassinations that have happened when students leave the academy to undergo self-tempering trials.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi shivered slightly. He couldn’t help but turn around to look at Bian Linghan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The small face of this thin and weak looking young lady from South Rainmist Region was a bit pale, her small hands clutching the corners of her dress shaking slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi released a light sigh. He knew that her loyalty towards her country and her sense of responsibility would prevent her from ever feeling as flexible and easygoing as himself, purely desiring a life that was a bit more brilliant and interesting, she would instead definitely face this heavy mission that was suddenly placed on her frail shoulders with an attitude of no return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In the following month, I will leave two hours of time open to teach her some techniques of Windstalkers.” The single-eyed black-robed lecturer gave Bian Linghan a look, also releasing a light sigh inwardly. However, the expression on his face was still resolute and ice-cold, shifting back to Lin Xi’s body. “For the sake of not arousing suspicion, I will declare that your words have angered me, that in the following month of time, the two of you have to work in Medicine Valley for two hours as punishment. If you are interested, you can learn a bit as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi couldn’t help but smile, saying, “Teacher, it seems like your respected self still can’t let go of all hope in me, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The single-eyed black-robed lecturer gave Lin Xi an expressionless look, directly saying coldly, “Class dismissed!”</span></p>
