 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything Lin Xi said was the truth, extremely sincere, while Tang Ke was also extremely frank. If it was anyone else, at the very least, they wouldn’t tell Lin Xi that there were casualties every single day in the Thousand Sunset Border Army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was because in the song sung about Principal Zhang that was circulated throughout the outside world, after the battle of Meteor City, Nanmo Country didn’t dare do a thing in the past half century.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course, this wasn’t entirely false, because after that battle of the past, the Nanmo Country that was defeated was later destroyed from internal strife, the ruling regime completely changed, now becoming the Great Mang Dynasty. For more than a decade, the ones Dragon Snake Border Army fought endlessly with weren’t the past domineering Nanmo Country’s Heaven Cavalry, but rather Great Mang Dynasty’s Ghost Rider Army.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, as for the actual differences, anyone with a normal brain naturally understood clearly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When these topics were mentioned, bits and pieces were exposed, naturally also possessing a bit of disrespectful feeling towards Principal Zhang.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was precisely because both of them were extremely honest and direct that Lin Xi and Tang Ke were able to chat so happily. However, Tang Ke still found it hard to understand why Lin Xi wanted to scale Heaven Ascension Mountain Range, enter that barren world of ice and snow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Xi couldn’t tell him that both him and that middle-aged uncle came from an entirely different world, that the words on that monument were simplified chinese characters he could understand. If he did, Tang Ke would definitely think that he was speaking words that couldn’t be any more nonsense.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Because of the difficult trudging they went through to get here, Lin Xi and the other Self Defense Department new students all learned to hide enough rations on them to last a few days. Together with the fact that he didn’t have any thoughts of hastily exploring this place’s mysteries, after chatting away the remaining afternoon hours, Lin Xi slept peacefully in his own room during this first night in the Self Defense Freshman Dormitory. This room was even more quiet than the one in Deerwood Town, the fresh air that seeped through the wooden framed window allowing him to sleep extremely soundly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the distance, there was a shabby looking carriage that stopped on a hill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two old horses’ restraints were undone, allowed to roam about the edge of the forest, their heads currently lowered, slowly chewing on the moist grass shoots on the ground. Next to the carriage was an open fire, the attention of Uncle Liu, who brought Lin Xi through half of Yunqin Empire to Summer Spirit Lake, was currently concentrated on a cut open hare.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The hare was already roasted until it was golden yellow. After evenly scattering a layer of snow-white salt on its surface, the elder tore off a leg, starting to chew on it in his mouth, a hint of satisfaction spreading across his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, his body curled up slightly, figure becoming even more stooped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A bit of noise was released from the jungle. An arrow shot out as fast as lightning, passing over the top of his head, stabbing fiercely into the carriage behind him. After an extremely oppressive&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">thunk</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;noise, the thick and sturdy carriage body was almost penetrated through, only the feathers at the end shaking endlessly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, even after suffering from this type of sudden assault, the expression on this elder’s face still didn’t show any distinct changes. He merely lowered the fully roasted hare and half eaten leg onto a wooden plank next to the bonfire, and then his stooped body stood up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pa! Pa! Pa!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A burst of applause sounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Five assassins dressed in black clothes walked out from the forest. The middle-aged male in the lead was the one who was clapping. He had a pale complexion, his beard rather long, a longsword resting diagonally on his back, giving off a rather refined appearance. However, the old driver wasn’t looking at him, instead giving the tall and sturdy man at his side a look, saying coldly, “So it’s you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tall and sturdy man’s face looked like it had been stomped on, the bridge of his nose caved in a strange manner, making his current smile indescribably strange and sinister. “What, after knocking me down in front of the academy’s entrance examination like that, did you think that you could leave calmly just like that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All this just for that one fist?” The elder’s posture became even more stooped, but a bit of a sneer appeared on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The refined looking middle-aged man said with a light sigh, “That fist was not only aimed at his face, it was also aimed at Pine Academy’s face.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Pine Academy is low class academy to begin with. Even if your faces were stepped on, no one would really notice… this truly is stupid.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ice-cold voice from the elder’s throat and the clear mockery made this middle-aged man couldn’t help but freeze up a bit. However, he still bowed towards this elder. “Since that is the case, then please excuse this later generation…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Following this bow, a space enough for an arrow to fly across was cleared up between the trees he walked out of the group and towards the elder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An arrow immediately shot from behind this middle-aged man, directly aiming at the space between the elder’s brows. At the same time, the middle-aged man’s right hand was raised slightly. The longsword, because of his bowed waist, automatically slid out, the sword hilt entering his hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These five individuals weren’t the only ones here, within the trees, there was an archer whose arrows were extremely accurate even in the darkness of night. The middle-aged man and the archer were well coordinated, several inches of dazzling sword radiance shining, clearly about to spill outwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right at this time, the slight sound of flesh being penetrated sounded. The middle-aged man’s body shook intensely, his right hand suddenly stopped, as if forcibly held in place by an invisible force. His rather graceful attack came to a rigid stop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dang!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meanwhile, the elder’s body suddenly shot straight up like a bent bamboo pole, springing out ferociously. Following a turn of his wrist, an ordinary dagger hacked out viciously, intercepting the tip of the arrow with incomparable precision, drawing forth a string of fine sparks, deflecting this shockingly powerful arrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That robust crushed nose man had just leapt out from the side with an evil grin, a thin and sharp long blade in hand, but he immediately looked towards his own chest with an expression of disbelief. A string of blood was currently shooting out from his body, the end of an arrow still shaking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right now, the second arrow had just left the woods, while the middle-aged man’s entire body was backing up in panic. On the back of his right hand, there was actually also earthworm-like blood wriggling about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Peng!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A cold-faced, black-clothed assassin immediately blocked in front of the middle-aged man, his hands swept towards the elder together with his sleeves. At the same time, another individual stabbed his pike fiercely towards the elder’s waist, the entire silvery-white pike instantly covered in a layer of gleaming green light.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This wasn’t only a two-membered joint attack, but rather three opponents that were attacking together, because at this time, the second arrow also already flew over from within the forest. Moreover, the three assassins were extremely well coordinated, even more terrifying than extremely fierce and nasty bandits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, under this type of situation, the elder’s expression still didn’t show too many changes. A layer of green light also appeared on the surface of his body. As the countless black lights and pike stabbed at his body, the dagger in his hands deflected another arrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Pa!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The assassin currently flanking from another side raised his iron shield, blocking this arrow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the moment the arrow smashed into the iron shield, the elder’s stooped figure suddenly shot up with terrifying momentum, directly headbutting the cold-faced black-clothed assassin. That black-clothed assassin released a miserable scream, as if his body was struck by a moving tree, sent flying backwards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Two fine and long daggers fell from the elder’s body. The pike wielding assassin’s feet entered the fight, but his face was full of horror. There was a part of the elder’s clothes that were rippled, but his body didn’t have any injuries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Scarlet plate armor!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When he saw a unique scarlet red color within the opening of his outer clothing, the middle-aged man whose expression had already changed greatly released a cry of disbelief. “You… you are the Black Flag Army’s…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Originally, I was still willing to let you all off with your lives, but you recognized my identity. You cannot blame this on me anymore.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The elder’s pale yellow eyes that carried a bit of mockery now suddenly became ice-cold. The instant the first word was uttered, his feet were already crushing down on the head of the black-clothed assassin who was previously sent flying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The black-clothed assassin who was previously sent flying immediately became a corpse. Meanwhile, the elder was like a galloping horse treading on a flying swallow, rising up. The dagger in his hands easily blocked the refined looking middle-aged man’s long sword, while his other hand ruthlessly crushed the refined-looking middle-aged man’s throat.</span></p>
