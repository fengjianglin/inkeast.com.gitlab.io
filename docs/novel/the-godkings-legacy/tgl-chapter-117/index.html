 <p>After Lucia concluded her deal with the second prince, she challenged Daniel, who was in first place, and won without a fight. It seemed like they had already dueled before with Lucia winning an overwhelming victory. The demon prince had directly surrendered and challenged the second place person, claiming his spot at the top of the list next to Lucia. Once that happened, the competition began in earnest, and everyone picked their opponents.</p>
 <p>Lucia had pulled out a pillow and blanket, giving Gae Bulg and me the orders to take on any of the challengers for her. I wanted her to watch the following battles, but after I watched them for a bit, I realized they wouldn’t help Lucia in the slightest. There weren’t any warriors who had crossed over to the divine realm. But I did learn more about magicians and how they fought. I think I should give my throwing knife skills a refresher. They seem like they’d be useful against a magician. Why does a sword spirit know how to use throwing knives? Well, that’s what happens when you’re trapped in a secluded space for millennia.</p>
 <p>But surprisingly—or is it unsurprising?—no one’s challenging Lucia. I’m very disappointed. I was looking forward to educating the future leaders of the world.</p>
 <p>“Ah!” Lucia sat up as if she had just suffered through a nightmare. “I was supposed to take care of Ilya Number Two! How’s she doing?”</p>
 <p>“She’s around rank 200 right now.” I’m surprised she’s not last considering her age. Even if her sword is enchanted with a divine inscription, she’s still just a child.</p>
 <p>Lucia hopped onto the stage. “I challenge Ilya Number Two!”</p>
 <p>“You’re not allowed to challenge anyone,” Cain said from his position in the sky. “You’re first place.”</p>
 <p>Lucia furrowed her brow. “Then, Ilya Number Two challenges me,” she said and nodded. “Get up here!”</p>
 <p>Mirta rose to her feet and approached the stage. She hesitated before climbing onto the platform. “Um, Lucia?”</p>
 <p>“Argh.” Lucia fell to her knees and clutched her chest. “I’m defeated. Good job, Ilya Number Two. Go take first place.”</p>
 <p>“Um.” Mirta’s mouth fell open before she raised her head and blinked at Cain. “Is, is that okay?”</p>
 <p>“Of course it’s okay!” Lucia said and appeared behind Mirta. She picked up the poor elf child and tossed her towards me. I caught her and placed her onto the first-place cushion. “If anyone challenges you, just surrender right away. I’ll be sure to cripple them and give you the spot back. Now, I challenge the person in third place!”</p>
 <p>For the longest time, I thought Lucia was a simple person. I still do. But there are times, times like these, where she does things I would never think of. Blatantly abusing her power to control the outcome of a competition that happens once a decade between the three empires, only she would think of doing something like this. This is a slap in the face to all the top brass. …I like it. A person whistled past me and crashed into the coliseum wall. Oh, it was the third place person.</p>
 <p>“Ilya! Do you want third place?” Lucia dusted off her hands and placed them on her hips.</p>
 <p>“I’ll climb up by myself,” Ilya said from her seat. “But I appreciate the offer.”</p>
 <p>Lucia shrugged. “Suit yourself.”</p>
 <p>“What about me?” Reena asked, raising her hand into the air. I don’t think Lucia would take good care of you, Reena; you look too much like Snow.</p>
 <p>Lucia scratched her head. “Err, I did bully you quite a bit, huh?” Her eyes narrowed. “How about this? Make me an offer I can’t refuse.”</p>
 <p>“Now she’s even selling the spots!?” someone shouted. “Lord Thunderfire! Isn’t this too much?”</p>
 <p>Cain yawned. “If you have the power to sell positions in this competition, then go ahead and sell them. I’m just here to prevent deaths.”</p>
 <p>Well, it seems like Lucia’s going to make a tidy sum today. “Is, isn’t this wrong?” Mirta asked and tugged on my pants. “She shouldn’t be allowed to do that, right?”</p>
 <p>Ah, the innocence of children—untainted by the cruel, cruel world. Time to ruin it for her. “Might makes right. Since Lucia is stronger than everyone else here, no one can stop her from doing what she wants to do. That’s how the world works.”</p>
 <p>“No way….” Mirta’s expression darkened. “But, but that’s not right!”</p>
 <p>“That’s life.” Was Lucia right? Am I really a sadist? Just because I love seeing people in despair doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with me, right? Everyone revels in schadenfreude sometimes. “If you don’t like it, then you have to get stronger. It’s that simple.”</p>
 <p>“But some people work really hard, and it takes them a really long time,” Mirta said, biting her lower lip. “Grandma worked really, really hard, but it took her a long time to be as strong as Lucia. It’s not fair.”</p>
 <p>“Correct. Talented people are blessed.” I’m more surprised by how Lucia remained hidden for so long. I wonder if the emperor is kicking himself for not realizing he had a genius within his army that he was treating like shit because of prejudice against beastkin. I bet his expression was glorious when Lucia sent the crown prince flying. I wish I was there to witness it. Maybe I really am a sadist.</p>
 <p>“And we have a winner!” Lucia’s voice echoed through the coliseum. “Come up and fight me, and I’ll surrender.” Moments later, a rich-looking demon magician sat on the third-place cushion. And Lucia shouted again, “Fourth-place person, I challenge you!”</p>
 <p>Am I destined to never have an honorable master? Perhaps it’s because both Roland and Lucia grew up poor that they respect wealth so much. If I had been a noble’s weapon spirit, I’m sure my experiences would’ve been much different. But it’s not a bad thing to be raised by Roland and Lucia. Well, not too bad of an experience. There are some times when I wish Lucia wasn’t so perverted and more dedicated towards training. After all, the stronger Lucia becomes, the stronger I become. But I suppose after today, I’ll have fulfilled my promise to Lucia—making her a legend. Using her strength to manipulate the outcome of the Godking’s Brawl while ignoring the nobles’ wishes. Negotiating a deal to claim half the human empire. Receiving a divine enchantment. There’s no way Lucia’s not going to be famous after this with all she’s done.</p>
