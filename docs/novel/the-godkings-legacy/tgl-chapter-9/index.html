 <p>I’m going to die. I’m really going to die. I’m dying. Ah, the ground feels so cold. It’s nice.</p>
 <p>“D-Durandal.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, Lucia?” Was he smiling? He really is a sadist. Why did I agree to this? Wait, no. He didn’t even give me a chance to disagree!</p>
 <p>“H-help. Please.”</p>
 <p>“Aren’t I helping you get stronger? No need to thank me.”</p>
 <p>You know that’s not what I meant! “I can’t feel my legs.”</p>
 <p>“Just your legs? It seems like you need to work a bit harder.”</p>
 <p>A whimper escaped from my lips. “No more. I can’t do this.”</p>
 <p>“Really? Then I’ll stop,” Durandal said and crouched over my fallen body. “But are you sure you want me to? Since you killed a prince, there’s bound to be people chasing after you. Not to mention that if any rumors spread about you owning me, then thousands of people will want to rob you.”</p>
 <p>You’re the one who made me kill the prince! I have to admit he does have a point, but I really can’t move. My body feels like it’s on fire.</p>
 <p>Durandal sighed. “How about this?” he asked and stood up. Where was he going? Was he abandoning me after leaving me in this state? “Come over here, and we can stop this training for the day.”</p>
 <p>Eh? That’s too far! He only walked three steps away, but three steps seem like three miles when you have a four-hundred-pound sword on your back. “I really, really can’t move my legs.”</p>
 <p>“Then crawl with your arms. I believe in you, Lucia. You can do it. If you couldn’t, I wouldn’t have asked.”</p>
 <p>Please stop looking like you’re enjoying this. Shouldn’t a weapon spirit listen to his owner? Why does it seem like I’m the subordinate? How can someone so handsome be so cruel? What ever happened to chivalry? Wait. Did he say he believed in me? No one’s ever said that to me before. I can’t let him down!</p>
 <p>Ah, my clothes are getting dirty, but that doesn’t matter. This isn’t the first time you crawled on the ground, Lucia, but this time, it’s so you’ll never have to crawl on the ground again. It really is painful though. There’s only one step left. He’s not going to move away at the last second, is he? No one can be that cruel. My fingers reached his toes.</p>
 <p>“Well done, Lucia,” Durandal said and squatted down. His hand ran through my hair and rubbed my ears. The numbness in my body was temporarily replaced by pleasure. His voice was soft and soothing. “You really did a good job. I’m proud of you.”</p>
 <p>I’m sorry for calling you a devil. You’re definitely an angel.</p>
 <p>His weapon body became as light as a feather, and Durandal turned me over onto my back. “You can rest now,” he said and covered me with a blanket. “I’ll make sure you’re safe.”</p>
 <p>What about a mattress? At least give me a pillow. “Lap pillow.”</p>
 <p>Durandal’s face blanked. “Huh?”</p>
 <p>“Be my pillow!” That’s the least you can do for making me suffer!</p>
 <p>“Like this?” Durandal asked and raised an eyebrow. He sat on his ankles before lifting my head onto his lap. Perfect.</p>
 <p>“Yes.” I exhaled and closed my eyes, relishing in the feeling behind my head. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine myself using the Godking’s legendary weapon as a pillow. How many people would want to kill me for this simple action? Too many to count. It’d be best if I got stronger, but I just wish it wasn’t so painful. “Head rub.”</p>
 <p>His fingers ran through my hair and massaged my scalp. Why does this feel so nice? I almost forgot the pain he put me through. Almost. “You were really mean today.”</p>
 <p>“Was I?” His hand scratched behind my ears. “What do you want to eat for dinner tonight? I’ll make it for you.”</p>
 <p>“Pork chops! Beef stew! Walnuts!” Wait. Stop distracting me! I’m trying to be mad at you.</p>
 <p>“If that’s what you want, then that’s what I’ll make.” His smile is a cheat. How can I be mad at something so beautiful? Maybe I should just give up. I can’t stay angry at him.</p>
 <p>Hold on. Isn’t he a weapon spirit? “You can cook?”</p>
 <p>“I can do anything.” Really? You didn’t know how to read a map. “Then I want a salad too. And grilled tomatoes with bell peppers, and three scoops of ice cream for dessert.”</p>
 <p>“I’m not sure we have all those in your bag,” Durandal said as he stroked my tail. A shiver ran up my spine to the base of my head, causing me to flinch. Don’t do that without warning me! “Does that feel nice?”</p>
 <p>My face is definitely on fire. I’m not going to answer him. I wish my arms would work, then I could lift this blanket over my face. Maybe if I close my eyes, he won’t be able to see me. What were we talking about? I think it had something to do with food.</p>
 <p>Before I could say anything, Durandal asked me, “Why aren’t you circulating your qi?”</p>
 <p>Huh? I opened my eyes. Why does he look so confused? “My what?”</p>
 <p>“Your qi? Internal energy? Lifeforce?”</p>
 <p>“I have that?” What is he talking about? Please stop staring at me like that. Your face is turning scary.</p>
 <p>“You don’t know what I’m referring to?”</p>
 <p>I instinctively swallowed my spit. “N-no. Um. Should I?” Tears pooled in my eyes, and his face turned blurry.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry, Lucia,” Durandal said. He resumed massaging my head. “I made a mistake.”</p>
 <p>Mistake? Did he mean choosing me? Was qi or lifeforce really that important? He’s going to abandon me? I started to cry.</p>
 <p>“L-Lucia? What’s wrong? Does your body hurt that much?”</p>
 <p>Liquid ran down my nose. I sniffled, but it didn’t help. My body screamed at me, but I forced myself to turn around and grab Durandal’s leg while burying my face in his thigh. “Don’t leave me.”</p>
 <p>“I’m not leaving. You’re my owner, remember? I’ll always be by your side.”</p>
 <p>Does he really mean that? “You called me a mistake.”</p>
 <p>“Did I? When?”</p>
 <p>“Just now!”</p>
 <p>“I was referring to the training…. If I knew you couldn’t control your qi, I wouldn’t have started with something so … physically intensive.”</p>
 <p>What? “You’re … not leaving?”</p>
 <p>“No. Where would I even go? I can’t go too far away from my weapon body. Silly, Lucia.”</p>
 <p>Oh. Okay. Did I overreact? Maybe just a little. The tears stopped falling, and I raised my head. “Sorry I yelled. I didn’t want to be left behind again.” Was that really my voice? It sounds so frail.</p>
 <p>His hand stroked my back. “Don’t worry, Lucia. I’m not mad or disappointed.”</p>
 <p>What did I do to deserve a weapon spirit like him? Ah, I’m going to pass out. That training really was too much.</p>
