 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p>Do you know the movie <em>The Matrix</em>?</p>
 <p>Neo, the protagonist of <em>The Matrix</em>, was on the search for Morpheus, the legendary hacker. Upon meeting a mysterious force, he realized that the world he was living in wasn't real and was actually a virtual reality created by machines.</p>
 <p>A fake world created to control and rule over humans.</p>
 <p>In fact, <em>The Matrix</em> is just one of many examples that everyone would have pondered over at least once.</p>
 <p>Is this world real?</p>
 <p>Do 'I' really exist?</p>
 <p>Was it possible that the world was the result of someone's program and our memories part of a scenario?</p>
 <p>Is there any guarantee that the world was not created just a day, an hour, or even three seconds ago?</p>
 <p>Wasn't it under such doubts that philosopher R. Descartes arrived at the first principle of philosophy - 'I think, therefore I am'?</p>
 <p>------------------</p>
 <p>Of course, questions like these have no meaning. There will be no end to it if you start to doubt reality.</p>
 <p>If you doubt the world in itself, any evidence or theories derived from within it would therefore be meaningless as well.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, if there are no other external factors beyond this world, there is nothing that could prove these suspicions, so this idea is merely a fallacy.</p>
 <p>Therefore, it is alright to have such thoughts at least once, but they will swiftly fade away.</p>
 <p>Survival in this world was already tough enough without worrying over such unwholesome conspiracy theories.</p>
 <p>But regardless…</p>
 <p>"Is this world truly real?"</p>
 <p>I had always been giving serious thought to this. This concern started when I was in middle school and had always been at the back of my mind up till now when I entered my second year in high school.</p>
 <p><strong>Casanova Bae Jae-seok, Grades deteriorated, Kim Wan-rae, Hasn't slept a wink, Lee Hyung-wook, Struggling with a hangover, Park Jung-shik</strong>...</p>
 <p>All sorts of titles were written on the heads of the people passing by outside the window.</p>
 <p>This is my ability.</p>
 <p>I can figure out their Affiliation, characteristics, current state and name just by looking at them.</p>
 <p>The important thing is that this is all there is to it.</p>
 <p>"This is such a peaceful superpower."</p>
 <p>I don’t have the ability to fly around using psychokinesis, create flames or teleport.</p>
 <p>My ability is thoroughly non-combative. In addition, I know nothing about the principle or theory behind this ability at all.</p>
 <p>I mean, leaving all of that aside, isn't this a strange ability?</p>
 <p>I'm not joking; it's to the point where I don't think it is wrong for me to doubt reality every single day.</p>
 <p>I have done a lot of research on anything and everything I could find on this ability that I’ve had since I was young.</p>
 <p>If I was able to create a spark, I would have thought I was a pyrokineticist. If I could draw out energy from my dantian to strengthen my body, I would have assumed that I had cultivated internal energy.</p>
 <p>But what is this? Seeing words above people's heads?</p>
 <p>From any point of view, this was an ability that was incomprehensible.</p>
 <p>In the end, the only explanation left was…</p>
 <p>"This world is fake."</p>
 <p>It's lucky that I didn't suffer from depression. If I weren't a naturally optimistic and self-centered person, I would have become quite despondent.</p>
 <p>"Huh?"</p>
 <p>As I looked out of the window, I suddenly saw a bag of trash leaning against the wall. It wasn't the standard plastic bag, neither was the contents sorted for recycling; everything was just bundled together and thrown there.</p>
 <p>Ah, damn. Who was this inconsiderate person? It was even written on the wall that rubbish shouldn't be thrown here and they still left it right under the sign!</p>
 <p>I stared at the trash bag and the words<strong>&nbsp;Casually discarded, Trash</strong> were written above it.</p>
 <p>"It's not as if I am going to impose any disciplinary action on the person… but let's find out who threw it."</p>
 <p><em>Concentrate.</em></p>
 <p>Yes, not only can I see titles on people's head, I can also see them above animals, bugs, and even inanimate objects.</p>
 <p>This wasn't the case since the very beginning. Initially, I could only see the titles above people's heads.</p>
 <p>However, it was a pity to let such a strange ability just rot away, so after some training and practice, I could see titles on everything excluding minute things like dust or grains of sand.</p>
 <p>I concentrated as I stared at the title <strong>Casually discarded, Trash</strong> and initiated 'Classification'.</p>
 <p>It was a simple process. It's similar to opening a folder on a computer. You just have to further specify the simple title, just like how you open the folder <strong>Animal</strong>, followed by its subfolder <strong>Birds</strong> and then open the subfolder <strong>Goose</strong>.</p>
 <p>"Disposed from Daehyun Apartments, trash... that's too vague. A little more..."</p>
 <p><em>Classify.</em></p>
 <p><em>Further Specification.</em></p>
 <p>There is a wide selection of choices. The title can be further classified by the <strong>time</strong>, <strong>place</strong>, <strong>subject</strong> and more.</p>
 <p>If I spent more time, I could know who threw the trash, when it was thrown and the reason behind the action (Of course, you don't really need a grand reason to throw trash).</p>
 <p>Well, I wasn't curious to that extent right now, anyway.</p>
 <p><strong>Thrown by Mrs. Shim Moon-soon of Daehyun Apartments, Trash</strong></p>
 <p>"Ah, it's that auntie again."</p>
 <p>And that was my findings.</p>
 <p>The title was much longer than what could usually be seen as I had channeled my mental energy for specification.</p>
 <p>Well, the longer you want a title to be, the longer it will be. I tried once as an experiment and the longest title I got was three lines.</p>
 <p>"Well, it’s not as if I will do anything about it."</p>
 <p>I just probed further into it because I was bored. However, I was slightly bitter that the findings were as expected.</p>
 <p>Anyway, it doesn't matter because it isn't our wall. It just bothered me somewhat that I could see it from the window.</p>
 <p>"I should head to school."</p>
 <p>I shook my head to clear it of the complicated thoughts and changed my clothes.</p>
 <p>I should hurry. Though it's only 6 A.M., considering that we have Zero Period <span id="footnote-ref-27bc"><a href="#footnote-27bc">[1]</a></span> and the time it would take for me to reach school, I didn't have time to waste.</p>
 <p>Click.</p>
 <p>I opened the wardrobe and took out a black uniform.</p>
 <p>Hmm... I have a lot to complain about our school but there was just one thing I like - the school uniform design. In fact, the cool school uniform was one of the reasons why I applied to this school.</p>
 <p>"Ah, Dae-ha, you are awake?"</p>
 <p>"Yes, Dad. Where's Hyung?"</p>
 <p>"He's coming down."</p>
 <p>My dad replied calmly; he had an apron hung around his neck.</p>
 <p>The kitchen was filled with an appetizing aroma that not even a person who had just woken up and had no appetite could resist wanting to eat.</p>
 <p>"What did you make?"</p>
 <p>"Yuxiang Rou Si(鱼香肉丝). Also known as Yuxiang Shredded Pork.<span id="footnote-ref-56d6"><a href="#footnote-56d6">[2]</a></span>"</p>
 <p>"You have been cooking French cuisine for a month and now you are switching to Chinese cuisine?"</p>
 <p>"I have nothing else to make besides bizarre dishes. But Chinese cuisine is fine as well. There are many varieties and the difficulty is just right."</p>
 <p>Accompanying his words, the sliced pork in the dish he served was thinner than thread.</p>
 <p>I mean, how in the world are you supposed to slice the pork meat to achieve that?</p>
 <p>It's a given that Yuxiang Shredded Pork is a dish where the meat is sliced thin and then stir fried. However, there are not many in the world who can cut the meat that thinly.</p>
 <p>Theoretically speaking, the meat had to be cut as thin as a thread, but that was only in theory. It is difficult to achieve that in application.</p>
 <p>At best, some places could slice the meat to be the thickness of a finger, so what was this? And it was even done with a knife!</p>
 <p>"Did you sleep well?"</p>
 <p>My brother yelled energetically and entered the kitchen. With a considerably short height of 171cm and a kind looking countenance, he looked cute (even though he's my elder brother). He received the bowl of rice from Dad and placed it on the table.</p>
 <p>"Why are you in such high spirits despite having just woken up?"</p>
 <p>"I can only enjoy myself! Isn't this world such a fun and happy place? Hahaha!"</p>
 <p>"What?"</p>
 <p>This is absurd. Why is this human like this?</p>
 <p>But I didn't want to shoot him down when he seemed so happy, so I started eating my food obediently.</p>
 <p>"Thanks for the meal."</p>
 <p>"Alright. But these are experimental dishes so give me some feedback."</p>
 <p>"I'm sorry but I have never eaten any food you’ve made that was bad."</p>
 <p>Even the head chef of a 7-star hotel would not be able to match up to my father's cooking skills.</p>
 <p>It wasn't a sentimental comment like "My dad's cooking is the best!" or anything of the sort, but I really wonder if there was any dude on Earth who cooks better than this human.</p>
 <p>In fact, there was a chef who ate my dad's food and followed him for about a month, asking him to take him in as a disciple.</p>
 <p>"Oh man, I won't improve if you say such things."</p>
 <p>"How much more do you want to improve?"</p>
 <p>"I'm not really saying that I want to improve. I'm just treating this as a hobby."</p>
 <p>"That's a statement that killed chefs all over the world twice."</p>
 <p>"Haha."</p>
 <p>The man who shrugged his shoulders before me was my father.</p>
 <p>In Korean, it's 아버지 <span id="footnote-ref-a046"><a href="#footnote-a046">[3]</a></span>, and in Japanese, おとうさん.</p>
 <p>"Why are you looking at me like that?"</p>
 <p>"Nothing."</p>
 <p>He is 36 this year. I'm 18 years old so that dude had me when he was exactly my current age.</p>
 <p>In fact, just this fast-tracked event was enough of a shock, but what's more frightening is that my father looks as though he is in his mid-20s or at most late 20s.</p>
 <p>Frankly speaking, he looked more like my brother than my father.</p>
 <p>What does he look like? There are already three official fan clubs of this human in my school. (I don't know how many unofficial fan clubs there are.)</p>
 <p>Even when they know that my father is a married man! They even know that I'm his son!!!</p>
 <p>It's not just that.</p>
 <p>In order to make this human a singer or an actor, the number of talent scouts who had come looking had already surpassed three digits.</p>
 <p>He has a neat bob cut (In fact, there are few in this world that can pull off such a hairstyle)<span id="footnote-ref-90ef"><a href="#footnote-90ef">[4]</a></span>, manly facial features, calm eyes and a muscular body.</p>
 <p>Also, he has that unique Aura that envelopes his entire body.</p>
 <p>My father had such charisma that just by standing there without saying anything, he could easily seize the attention of those within a 30 meters radius.</p>
 <p>"So what are you looking at?"</p>
 <p>"Nothing, really. Just thinking that you are handsome."</p>
 <p>"Haha. Thank you, but it's useless. It's not as if there's anyone to look at me."</p>
 <p>'There are already many people doing so...!!'</p>
 <p>Though it might be hard to believe, this man had learned as many as 17 languages as a 'hobby' (and there's a high chance that it has already surpassed 17). And whenever he had time, NASA would come to him seeking advice on space physics.</p>
 <p>He's even learned all sorts of martial arts and attained such expert mastery in all of them that even normal people with a machine gun wouldn't stand a chance against him. Also, the book he published under a pseudonym was a bestseller worldwide and had great influence.</p>
 <p>If he entered the stock market with a hundred thousand won <span id="footnote-ref-1459"><a href="#footnote-1459">[5]</a></span>, he could roll it into a hundred million won<span id="footnote-ref-5d1f"><a href="#footnote-5d1f">[6]</a></span> within a month (Luckily, he doesn't do it frequently as he said that it's gambling with money). On my 15th birthday, he created a game all by himself and gave it to me as my present (but the quality was amazing. He even self-made the graphics and audio. As expected of him.)</p>
 <p>-----------------</p>
 <p>Yeap. This fraudulent character is my father.</p>
 <p>Seemingly having rolled a million dice that decided his stats and getting 6's every time, this man is currently 'jobless.' In simple terms, he's unemployed.</p>
 <p>But my father's situation was totally different from an average unemployed person.</p>
 <p>He lived a leisurely and carefree life even though all the conglomerates and national organizations had done everything they could to have him join them.</p>
 <p>"Thanks for the meal! Father's cooking is always the best!"</p>
 <p>"Right, thanks. Ah, I prepared your lunch boxes and they are by the front door. Don't forget to take them."</p>
 <p>"Got it~!"</p>
 <p>As per what I mentioned before, this brother of mine is always so energetic. In an instant, he had finished his meal, took his backpack and left his seat. He has a peaceful countenance, and the attitude to match.</p>
 <p>However, the title he held was far from 'peaceful'.</p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><strong>Blue Dragon Team</strong></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><strong>Ghost Blade, Kwan Yeong-Min</strong></p>
 <p>What the hell is this nonsense? Blue Dragon Team? And what Ghost Blade?</p>
 <p>I have never seen my brother use a knife. He has never even grabbed a kitchen knife because he doesn't cook. So what's with this wuxia-sounding title, Ghost Blade?</p>
 <p>Such bizarre titles are rare, considering all the titles I have seen.</p>
 <p>"Thanks for the food too."</p>
 <p>"Okay. Have a nice day at school."</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, I saw my father's face as he replied in a soft voice while taking a book out from the bookshelf.</p>
 <p>"What now?"</p>
 <p>"... Nothing. I'm heading to school now."</p>
 <p>"We are leaving now!"</p>
 <p>As I opened the door with my brother and exited, I thought, "Right, if this dude's title is considered strange, then that man's title doesn't fall short either."</p>
 <p>Father's title is also unique; it's unlike anyone else.</p>
 <p>And that title is…</p>
 <p>"Hmph, yes, so he’s good at everything, huh?"</p>
 <p>"What?"</p>
 <p>"Nothing."</p>
 <p>"…?"</p>
 <p>I overtook my brother with a perplexed look on his face and headed towards school.</p>
 <p>Though it wasn't considered late, I would have to hurry up since I'm on duty today.</p>
