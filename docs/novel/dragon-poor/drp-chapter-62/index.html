 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A group of people gathered at the border of the Rheinperle and Laylark territories, near the iron mine responsible for the dispute.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He’s being discourteous. How could he be so late?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Baron Laylark had an impressive silhouette and a handsome, gray beard. Einst Jeneger replied.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The duel’s set for noon, so we still have some time left. Please don’t be impatient.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh. I know it’s noon, but shouldn’t we exchange greetings as neighbors before the duel at the very least? It’s reprehensible for him to casually stroll in at the last minute and only take care of his business.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Einst Jeneger scoffed at Baron Laylark’s words. He didn’t have the right to complain, considering he was the one rushing in to stake his claim over the newly discovered iron mine. However, Einst needed to maintain his neutrality today, and so he held his tongue.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Raiden.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, father.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Make sure you put him in his place – so that he doesn’t cause us trouble in the future.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the baron’s words, his second son, Raiden Laylark, wordlessly lifted his sword. His confident eyes showed he thought victory was already in his grasp.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This could have been considered arrogant, but none of the people gathered here doubted Raiden Laylark’s victory. Aside from the one duel against Asha Trail, he had been undefeated at the capital. He was even nicknamed the Sword of Lightning by the royal princess, and there was no way he would lose to a foreigner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Among them,&nbsp;</span><span>Einst</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Jeneger</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was the only one rooting for Viscount Drachen’s victory.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Baron, you should not forget this. Both the Sword of Lightning and the Drake Knight are valued by, and will someday lead, this kingdom. I hope you do not overdo it today, and that you will not do anything that His Majesty would disapprove of.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>However, even as he looked out for&nbsp;</span><span>Seon-Hyeok</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, Einst Jeneger could not help but expect Raiden Laylark to win. As such, he advised the baron to hold back. These types of requests were often made during duels, so the baron did not find it unfair.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You heard Sir Jeneger, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, I will make sure you are not accused of being disloyal to His Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Einst Jeneger sighed at Baron Laylark’s spiteful attitude and stopped talking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The time… hm?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As noon approached, a black spot appeared in the distance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Looks like Viscount Drachen has arrived.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raiden Laylark was the first to notice the shadow of the horse approaching from afar. His comment alerted the others to the horseback rider on the far side of the plains.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But why is he alone?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And what the hell is that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Aside from the fact that there were no squires or attendants in sight, it was even stranger that the man charging at them while holding a long pole wasn’t carrying a banner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“A cavalry spear?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It didn’t take long for them to realize that the pole wasn’t a flag, but rather a weapon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sigh. Did he mistake this duel for a joust?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Baron Laylark clicked his tongue as he saw the cavalry spear, which was useful only for knocking aside the pikes wielded by pikemen in battle. The armor and gear looked more fitting of a common cavalry rider than a knight, and Raiden Laylark also smirked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He doesn’t even have his basics down.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The mocking did not last long.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am Jackson Hamilton, squire for Viscount Drachen! I came first, since there was an incident on our way!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was because the person they assumed to be Viscount Drachen identified himself as a mere squire.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And the viscount?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Only Einst Jeneger wasn’t taken aback by the development, as he had already met Jackson during his stay in Rheinperle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He will arrive before noon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s so important that he is prioritizing it over the sacred trial by combat?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Baron Laylark raged at Jackson’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He will be here in time.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jackson was considered gentle among the Drake Cavalry, but he now coldly responded to the baron’s words. As someone who greatly respected and followed Seon-Hyeok, the baron was a shameless lord coveting his neighbor’s property and blinded by the financial prospects of the mine. There was no way he could have spoken cordially.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How dare a mere squire stay on his horse and so boldly answer me! As befitting an evil foreigner’s squire! Get down on your knees right now and tell me which house you’re from!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Baron Laylark was quite hot-tempered, which was unbecoming of his age. He quickly gritted his teeth at Jackson’s stiff attitude. However, Jackson didn’t even pretend to hear him and simply looked towards the plains, waiting for Seon-Hyeok to arrive.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“He is a member of the Drake Cavalry and a part of the kingdom’s Western Army. He might be acting&nbsp;</span><span>as squire</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, but he’s still a cavalry rider. No one but His Majesty or the royal princess can force him to bend the knee.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Einst</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Jeneger stepped up to calm the baron down. He was amazed and struggled to hold back his laughter upon seeing the gentle Jackson’s new attitude.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nonetheless, it was obvious to any onlooker that Jackson was intentionally ignoring the baron. Raiden Laylark eventually spoke up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am Raiden Laylark, senior knight of the 11th group of the capital’s knights. Dismount and show the lord your respect.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Forward! I heard you’re off duty.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jackson was formidable. This was a completely different side of him from his usual gentleness, and he refused Raiden Laylark’s commands using the excuse that he was currently on leave.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It would’ve been possible to find an excuse to make the rider kneel, but neither the baron nor Raiden did so. Given that the mere rider was capable of being so obstinate with them, they suspected that he himself was a member of a high-ranking noble family.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, he’s arriving.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A black spot appeared in the distance with impeccable timing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t give him time to rest, Raiden. He brought this upon himself, so he can’t resent you even if you show him no mercy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, fa…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raiden Laylark, about to answer in the affirmative, found his jaw dropping in shock. The baron did the same.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Drake!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They knew that their opponent was named the Drake Knight, so it wasn’t surprising that he would come riding a drake. However, this drake was much different from what the baron or Raiden expected.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How is it so big?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wild drakes were only slightly larger than horses. They were tricky to deal with on account of their hard scales and tough jaws, but drakes were still monsters that someone on the level of senior knights could handle without much trouble. It was written as such in the capital knights’ guide on dealing with monsters.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At this moment, however, Raiden Laylark wanted nothing more than to visit the instructor responsible for training him on monster combat and grab him by the collar. How could a senior knight easily deal with this monster, which dwarfed the average horse carriage?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grrrr.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The ferocious eyes scanned the area and stopped. They were trained on Baron Laylark. The baron, befitting a commander who led many fights on the battlefield, showed the courage to stare back at the terrifying monster. The drake roared viciously, as though displeased by this response.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Roar!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The drake’s jaw, hidden by the special armor covering his entire face, was finally revealed for the first time. His fangs, sharper and larger than the average dagger, were covered with blood.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was shocked by the beast’s roar and once again by the sight of his hideous lower jaw. If they had met in the middle of the night, he would have lost control of his bladder and run away in terror. He grew even more disoriented by the screams of the tied-up horses behind them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah. I apologize. My drake’s just seen blood, so I think he’s still a bit excited.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At that moment, Viscount Drachen dismounted and spoke graciously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Viscount Drachen’s presence was relatively small compared to that of his drake, which put immense pressure unthinkable for a normal monster. As a result, nobody noticed him until he stepped up and spoke.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The baron, after showing weakness for a moment, belatedly gathered his expression and shouted in anger.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How dare you put other matters above a sacred trial by combat? Are you looking down on…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please be understanding of the situation. I don’t know what he’ll do when he’s hungry…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His words were a bit informal for a nobleman, but the baron could not find fault with him. The drake growled as he rested its head against Viscount Drachen’s back, and he seemed to be saying he was still hungry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“In any case, it’s nice to meet you. I’m the Lord of Rheinperle, Seon-Hyeok Rheinperle Kim Drachen.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m Enos Haltein of House Laylark.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The baron had already allowed his opponent to lead the conversation. He had vowed to humiliate the foreigner as soon as he arrived, but unknowingly found himself greeting him instead.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s late, so I’d like to get started right away.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Raiden Laylark stepped up, seeing his father lose face in front of the foreigner.&nbsp;</span><span>Einst</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Jeneger gave a displeased look at this sudden comment and asked Seon-Hyeok for his thoughts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Will that be okay? If you want, I can exercise my authority as the impartial observer to give you a moment to catch your breath.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It doesn’t matter.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Einst</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Jeneger looked at him for a moment with a worried look, but Seon-Hyeok simply nodded to say he was okay. The observer immediately went to start the trial duel.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Baron Enos Haltein of House Laylark has disputed ownership over the iron ore found in the Rheinperle territory, claiming that the mine is in Laylark territory, not Rheinperle territory. Is that correct?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Viscount Kim Drachen, Lord of Rheinperle, has responded that the claims are baseless and that he is the rightful ruler of the iron mine and surrounding territory. Is that correct?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, it is exactly as you said.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The observer voiced both parties’ positions to confirm, and the two lords nodded in turn in accordance with standard operating procedure.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Neither doubts his own justice, but there can only be one truth. All who have gathered here believe that God will deliberate, and that only the just will prevail. Do both sides agree?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I agree.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes. I agree.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After checking, Einst Jeneger took a brief pause and declared.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Baron Laylark and Viscount Drachen both have faith in God’s impartiality, and this trial by combat has thereby been established. This duel has been approved by the Adenstein royal family, the legitimate ruler of the land, and notarized by Wittenfeld Royen Mangsk, the great lord of&nbsp;</span><span>Mangsk</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. None may dispute the result of this duel.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raiden Laylark took a step forward following the witness’ proclamation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Raiden Laylark. I am the second son of House Laylark and senior knight of the 11th group of the capital’s knights.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Knight Laylark. I acknowledge that you are standing to deliver your family’s justice.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>While Raiden warmed up and prepared for battle,&nbsp;</span><span>Einst</span><span>&nbsp;Jeneger turned to&nbsp;</span><span>Seon-Hyeok</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And who will prove Drachen’s justice?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Seon-Hyeok Rheinperle Kim Drachen. Viscount, company commander of the Drake Cavalry of the Western Royal Army, and Lord of Rheinperle.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I commend you on choosing to prove your own justice. I acknowledge your right to fight.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Einst Jeneger glanced at both sides.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The trial by combat will commence. The duel will conclude if one side is unable to continue the battle or admits defeat. The victor shall be magnanimous to the defeated, and the defeated will not challenge the justice of the victor.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The initial proceedings of the duel finally came to an end. All that remained was for both sides to fight and prove their righteousness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Take up your weapons. I hope the results of this duel will not linger as a grudge between the two houses.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as Einst Jeneger finished speaking, Raiden raised his eyes and pulled a sword from its sheath.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Jackson.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>At&nbsp;</span><span>Seon-Hyeok’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;call, Jackson dismounted from his horse and handed over the cavalry lance he had been carrying.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“W, wait. You’re going to use that as your weapon…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The pressure Seon-Hyeok gave now was different from when a rider held the lance. Raiden panicked as he saw the specially designed weapon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is there a problem?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok pointed it at Raiden and smirked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, it…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Raiden paled. He was twenty steps away, but the tip of the lance already threatened to pierce his neck.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then let’s begin.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok ignored Raiden’s words and lowered his visor. Raiden reluctantly followed, lowering his own visor and raising his sword and shield.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Then the trial by combat will commence! Good luck to both combatants!”</span></p>
