 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Young lords are slow to act.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>T</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">his saying did not apply to Kim Seon-Hyeok. The moment he confirmed the existence of the sea serpent, he prepared to leave his territory.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You can’t.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, he was faced with an unexpected obstacle. Julian fiercely opposed her lord leaving without attendants. She forcibly dissuaded him, saying it was absurd for a viscount to travel alone, but the problem was that there was nobody around to accompany him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Despite coming into form, his newly trained soldiers were not trained in horseback riding and could not accompany him. Meanwhile, the riders of the Drake Cavalry were a part of the kingdom’s Western Army and did not specifically fall under his jurisdiction. As such, he could not order them to follow him on matters of personal business.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the end, the territory’s soldiers were the only possible option, but taking them meant limiting his mobility and prolonging the already lengthy travel time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How could you travel that far by yourself? If anything happens to you…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I know I was lucky, but I still beat the Judge of House Laylark. Do you really think something will happen to me? I’m the Drake Knight. Come on.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Frustrated, Seon-Hyeok tried to bluff his way out of the argument, but it proved useless against Julian.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You don’t even know the way.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a dilemma. He couldn’t travel alone because he didn’t know how to get to Rugenburg, and there was nobody suitable to take with him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I can accompany you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Julian had the makings of a skilled rider and was multitalented. She was clearly qualified to accompany him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No. Then there will be nobody left here.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>This time, it was Seon-Hyeok who voiced his opposition. Julian was the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;administrator of the territory, and he couldn’t allow her to leave just before the harvest season. Of course, him leaving the land at this busy time was an issue as well, but that was a symbolic problem, not a real one.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s better to have the region temporarily grind to a halt than to let you go alone.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But this time, Julian refused to back down.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is driving me crazy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ideally, he wanted to bring his tireless drake and complete the journey as quickly as possible, but the giant, golden beast was too conspicuous to take. Unless he wanted to announce his travels to the world, he could not take Goldrake.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the third day of these back-and-forth debates without reaching a solution, Jackson came to see him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard that you need to travel far away but don’t have anyone to accompany you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok didn’t know how Jackson had heard, but he was correct.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will go with you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I appreciate the thought, but you can’t. The Drake Cavalry belongs to the kingdom’s Western Army. I can’t allow you to leave your post for my personal business.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hearing his words, Jackson hesitated for a moment. He replied with a solemn expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“In that case, I’ll leave the Drake Cavalry.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok looked at Jackson in shock. He wasn’t sure what Jackson was trying to get at.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m saying I’ll request to be discharged.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Jackson.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s not an impulsive decision. I’ve been considering this for a long time. I wondered whether I wanted to remain under the shadow of the Drake Cavalry, or somewhere else entirely.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jackson seemed determined as he spoke. His usual docile attitude was nowhere to be seen in his current resoluteness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I decided after your trial by combat. I would like to be at your side, my lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok felt both grateful and burdened by Jackson’s blind faith and respect for him. He sighed as he saw Jackson throw away his place as a member of the Drake Cavalry, one of the best positions to be in as a rider.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you for the thought. I’d like you to think about it a bit more. It’s not a decision to make lightly.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I already…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even so, consider it a bit more.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok barely managed to send Jackson back, as the young rider held out until the end. However, Jackson returned within half a day. This time, he wasn’t alone. Clark and the original riders accompanied Jackson, and he seemed orders of magnitude more confident.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Take us as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen spoke up. Hansen had spoken politely to him ever since his ascension to the nobility, but right now, he spoke casually just like when they had first met.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wait. You should be stopping Jackson, not joining him. How’s a senior rider being so easily swayed by his junior?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok felt himself getting a headache at the sudden rush of riders.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even if it wasn’t for this, I was thinking about being discharged.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You expect me to believe that? That’s bullshit.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He thought Hansen was giving an absurd excuse, but Hansen shook his head and explained his thoughts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s Emma. She’s still young, but she has to take care of those kids and can’t even get married. I can’t just stand by and watch.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One of the reasons Hansen and the riders wanted to be discharged was a sense of responsibility for taking care of the kids.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh. This is driving me crazy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If it was for Emma and the kids, he couldn’t just ignore their desire to be discharged. Dumbstruck, he stared at Hansen and the others for a moment before asking Clark.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You too, Clark?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No. I can’t leave. What would our company commander do if I left too? I need to keep this place secure.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Of course.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok was the company commander, but it was Clark who actually led the cavalry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I didn’t come to be discharged. I’m here to tell you that you should grant their wishes. The Drake Cavalry will be fine even if some of the riders leave.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a relief that Clark didn’t insist on being discharged as well, but it was nonetheless a difficult situation for Seon-Hyeok.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Just so you know, there are many besides the three here wishing to be discharged from military service. I barely managed to stop these little bastards from all coming to you at once. The riders here are the ones I couldn’t convince until the very end.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It sounded like a threat – a threat that they’d bring the entire company if he didn’t oblige now. It was terrifying.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh. Do you have plans after you’re discharged?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What plans?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Plans to make ends meet.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This time, it was Jonasson who retorted, saying the question was ridiculous.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’ll be hiring us, of course.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The bold answer made Seon-Hyeok dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Given that Emma was the reason, he assumed they wanted to completely cut ties with the military. However, they really just meant that they would be leaving the Western Army. He wondered what the difference even was, and the answer he got was astounding.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If I remain in the Western Army, I’ll get called in for every war the kingdom fights. But if I’m a part of the Rheinperle military? I can just enjoy my paychecks. Let’s be honest – what could ever happen in this uninteresting territory?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And that sucker on the hook for the salaries is right in front of us.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And if you think that’s unfair, get over it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok watched the men snickering as they replied, then glared at Jackson. Jackson avoided his gaze, knowing he had instigated the entire situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I can’t pay much.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You can make up for it when the mine’s fully operational.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I can’t give you much vacation time because we don’t have enough people.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, you can give us nights out.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll be in and out of the territory doing business.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then we can travel too.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Every excuse he offered was refuted, but Seon-Hyeok found himself smiling.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Okay. Then do as you please.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok raised his hands in resignation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll be coming too.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why, Julian?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As a squire, I can’t bear being left behind every time. I insist on coming along.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This time, even Julian was acting stubborn. Seon-Hyeok tried to leave her behind using the excuse that she needed to keep the territory operational, but Julian had an answer prepared.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s not like I ever learned how to run a territory, and it’s about time we brought in an actual administrator. There wasn’t much going on before, so I was able to take care of the new things that needed my attention, but we’ll need an expert now that the mines are becoming operational.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But why now?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There’s not a big difference between doing it now versus a little later.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Julian said she already sent a letter in search of suitable talent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I can’t trust anyone but you, Julian.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No matter how run down his territory may be, a significant amount of money was coming in now that the mines were becoming operational. Naturally, it was difficult to entrust the management of his land to someone he didn’t know and trust.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If you believe in me, then you must also believe in the expert I invited.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok wondered who Julian could be wholeheartedly recommending. She replied that she had barely managed to bring in an old scholar serving as a bureaucrat in Mangsk territory using her past connections.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He served at Mangsk since before I was born, and he has never caused an issue stemming from self-interest. He wanted to retire and spend the rest of his life in a quiet place, so I invited him to Rheinperle.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was forced to back down at Julian’s assurance. But just as she said, a capable administrator was needed during a time of rapid growth, and Julian was not suitable for that role.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh. Fine. I’ll meet him first and then decide.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Within a few days of receiving permission, he was able to meet the scholar Julian recommended.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s an honor to meet the famed Drake Knight. My name is Antoine Montaigne.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Antoine Montaigne was an old man with a wrinkled face and surprisingly clear eyes. His pursed lips hinted at an underlying stubbornness, but his white beard and hair gave him a friendly look.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I came because Lady Julie said she needed me, but I don’t know what help a decrepit old man like me could possibly provide…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok’s eyes grew wide at the word ‘lady’, while Julian sulked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From what he saw over the following few days, Antoine Montaigne’s abilities were outstanding. The old scholar grasped the situation at Rheinperle within just two days, and he immediately got to work. In contrast to his relaxed and leisurely manner of speaking, he quickly completed any outstanding responsibilities. It was completely different from Julian, who often resorted to foregoing sleep to complete her work.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wow. That’s incredible, especially for an old man.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even to Seon-Hyeok, someone unknowledgeable about administrative work, Antoine Montaigne’s working ability was incredible. It was such that rumors about his skills spread among the servants and soldiers in his mansion within days. And thus, he could no longer deny Julian.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huhu. Is the test finally over?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Antoine Montaigne laughed as he met Seon-Hyeok after completing all of the day’s work before noon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I apologize if I offended you. It’s just that there’s nobody I can trust besides Julian…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At this point, Seon-Hyeok put aside his authority as a lord and showed respect for the elder. It had only been a few days, but Antoine Montaigne had clearly demonstrated his worth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So how about it? Do you think I’m worthy of your trust?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes. I learned that Julian’s compliments weren’t exaggerations.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hearing his response, Antoine Montaigne gave a satisfied smile. He seemed happier to learn that the lord trusted the girl he served than he was at the praise he received.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My intention was to spend the rest of my days somewhere quiet, but the lady threw a tantrum. I served her throughout her childhood, but it was my first time seeing her like that. Before I knew it, I had accepted her invitation.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Antoine Montaigne chuckled when Seon-Hyeok blinked, unable to believe that Julian could throw a tantrum.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If I’m lucky, I might be able to see that side of her a few more times. That is, of course, if you’re willing to hire me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There’s no reason not to. I look forward to your service, Sir Montaigne.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing the lord bowing to him, Antoine Montaigne bowed deeply in return and replied.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I look forward to your kind cooperation, my lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A few days later, Hansen, Jonasson, and Jackson removed the uniform of the Drake Cavalry for the last time. Even though the discarded blue coats of the Drake Cavalry were admired by all cavalry, there was not a single sign of regret on their faces.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will serve you loyally in the future, my lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They entered a new contract, and on that day, they became soldiers of Rheinperle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I can finally leave in peace.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Including Julian, there were four skilled cavalry riders with him. He wasn’t escorted by knights like the powerful nobles of the capital, but it was an impressive retinue for a country lord.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Flanked by the four riders, Seon-Hyeok headed straight for Rugenburg.</span></p>
