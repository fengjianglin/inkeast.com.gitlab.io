 <p style="text-align: left"><span>-</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The ‘poison’ attribute has been added.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>-</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Your poison resistance has more than doubled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Considering that wyverns roamed the skies, Seon-Hyeok had imagined it would be the ‘wind’ attribute. Surprisingly, Redvern’s attribute was not ‘wind’, but ‘poison’.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The attributes unlocked through the dragon subspecies until now had led him to spirits and became the source of his strength, but he was not certain how the ‘poison’ attribute would actually manifest in terms of abilities and spirits.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Shriek!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The wyvern cried out sharply and moved its pointed snout while Seon-Hyeok was briefly engrossed in his thoughts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah. Eat more.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Brought back to his senses, Seon-Hyeok grabbed another piece of meat and stuffed it into the wyvern’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chomp. Chomp.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Still not fully recovered, the wyvern lay flat on the ground and accepted the food it was given while intermittently crying out. It reminded Seon-Hyeok of a baby bird being fed, and before he knew it, he was petting the monster’s pointed snout.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Flinch.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unwilling to let down its guard yet, the wyvern flinched at his touch, but it soon began to concentrate on its meal once again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Flap. Flap.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After devouring an entire pig, the wyvern seemed to have regained some of its strength, as it tried to flap its wings like it would fly away at any moment. However, the ragged wings simply extended a few times and creaked before hanging limply by its side.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I wonder how long it’ll take for your wings to recover.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was evident that the broken and torn wings would take a considerable amount of time to heal. Seon-Hyeok wanted nothing more than to hop on the wyvern’s back and fly high in the sky at that very moment, but he also knew better than anyone that he needed to be patient.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As such, he quietly left the scene to let the wyvern rest. The guards, likewise, followed him out of the warehouse.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why did the hunters run away?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Now that his wyvern had finally regained consciousness, Seon-Hyeok was able to go about his business. He hoped to meet the monster hunters and hear about their situation, but bewilderingly, he received reports that they had fled during the night.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I believe they ran away, afraid of receiving punishment for their failures. After all, by losing the wyvern, there was a chance that significant casualties could have been inflicted on the village.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No matter how significant their accomplishments had been in bringing the monster to the immediate area, it could not completely nullify the crime of nearly causing an unmitigated disaster due to poor management of the ferocious wyvern. The hunters were naturally afraid, fully aware of the reality of their situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their reaction was not particularly strange. After all, this was a world where achievements could disappear and punishments could be handed out at the whim of a local lord. Even if it had been unintentional, the hunters had committed a punishable sin.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, Seon-Hyeok had no intention of punishing them. On the contrary, his intention had been to bestow a generous reward for their efforts in luring the wyvern to Rheinperle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They couldn’t have completely left the territory yet, so we can catch up if we hurry.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Rheinperle territory was full of skilled and experienced cavalry – it would not be too difficult to catch the runaway hunters.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let them be. Saved me some money.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok did not see any reason to do so. The hunters abandoned their rewards for fear of punishment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Why did he need to bring them back just to pay them?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then I’ll let them go on their way.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Julian nodded, expecting this decision from her lord. With that, the incident caused by the wyvern’s escape came to an end.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No, rather, he thought this would be the end.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, he was forced to revisit his decision before the day had even passed. The group of monster hunters he had been awaiting the most, led by Tristan, belatedly arrived at Rheinperle and provided details on all the sins of the runaway hunters.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So that’s what happened? I wondered why they looked to be such a mess for monster hunters capable of catching a live wyvern.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Only then did Seon-Hyeok feel as though one of his biggest outstanding questions had been answered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The runaway hunters had seemed too unskilled to have captured a ferocious monster freely roaming about the skies. Despite this, he had not imagined that they were nothing more than robbers intercepting another group’s mark.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They made their way to the Rheinperle village not because they were worried about potential casualties for the locals, but rather because they lacked the confidence to evade the wyvern on the open plains. They probably imagined it would be better to hide in the village than to be hunted down. The hunters also likely hoped that you and your soldiers would take care of the wyvern for them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m dumbfounded. They thought they could use me like that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok would not have normally cared about a conflict between groups of hunters. However, he was not soft enough to overlook the fact that the runaway hunters had tried to use him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Give Clark our fastest riders and capture them all.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We’ll make sure to detain every last one of them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Julian was enraged that others would try to deceive her lord. She immediately tried to leave and carry out his command, but Tristan stopped her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If you want to catch them, you’ll have to retrace their steps, not head to the border.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The hunters can cross the borders within four days if they tried. There’s no reason for them to travel in a different direction.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Normally, you’d be correct. However, they hid something important on their way here, and thus they have no choice but to go back and retrieve it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tristan calmly replied to Julian’s heated words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Retrieve it? Retrieve what?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Intrigued, Seon-Hyeok paid close attention to the hunter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You didn’t just ask me to locate the wyvern.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even until this point, he had no idea what Tristan was talking about. However, as soon as he heard the explanation, Seon-Hyeok immediately leapt out of his seat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The hunters also stole a fairy dragon egg.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dozens of cavalry rode out of the barracks, accompanied by Seon-Hyeok on Goldrake.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Atiya! We have to find it!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Just leave it to me!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as they left Rheinperle, Seon-Hyeok summoned Atiya and had her search for the hunters’ trail while he also used his abilities to sense his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unfortunately, it was difficult to locate the runaways because they had been given a day’s head start. Hansen’s group located where they first met the hunters and tried to retrace their paths, but an ill-timed rain shower erased all traces of their encounter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We’ll split up and search from here! Anyone who locates them should send a signal and call for backup instead of confronting them head on!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you doing? Aren’t you listening to the lord? Hurry up and split into groups already!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok frowned as he watched the riders scatter in all directions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“To think they were in possession of the fairy dragon egg.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The fairy dragon was&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">creature he was looking for, but he had essentially given up on this pursuit after finding no traces of it outside of fairy tales. There was no way of telling when he would have another opportunity to encounter a fairy dragon if he let this chance slip away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As such, he impatiently scoured the area for any signs of the runaway monster hunters.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If we can figure out which direction they went, chasing after them shouldn’t be a problem. Fairy dragon eggs are incomparably heavy and large compared to any regular egg.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tristan tried to comfort him, saying he knew of the monster hunters’ habits better than anyone else.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If it was light and easy to transport, they wouldn’t have hidden it before entering the town in the first place.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok’s expression relaxed slightly. The hunter’s words made sense.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the monster hunters’ whereabouts remained unknown despite his attempts to wait patiently. To make matters worse, the rain began to pour even harder.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His vision was obscured by the falling rain, and Atiya was unable to fully utilize her abilities in these conditions. Seon-Hyeok was at a loss.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is driving me crazy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At this rate, he would be letting this dragon subspecies slip away between his fingers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Fortunately, however, one of the cavalry parties that continued the search discovered the monster hunters’ tracks.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Whistle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok barely managed to hear the sound of a whistle through the noisy raindrops.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Without waiting for the other search parties, Seon-Hyeok immediately raced towards the source of the whistle. After a few failed attempts, he was able to pinpoint exactly where the alarm was coming from.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Roar!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok encouraged Goldrake to let out a ferocious roar when he noticed the hunters and cavalry in the distance. The shadows that repeatedly engaged and disengaged in the distance went into a panic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My lord!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The rider, noticing his lord, called out with a happy expression. Given that the terrain was a muddy mess, the cavalrymen had dismounted and opted to wield longswords in place of their usual spears. From what he could see, there had already been a battle, as blood poured down the riders’ shoulders. It was evident that the two riders had fought hard, keeping the ten monster hunters at bay.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Didn’t I say to wait for backup?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We thought it’d be impossible to find them again if we let them get away…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two offered a weak excuse when Seon-Hyeok berated them for their recklessness. It looked as though they had been willing to slow down the hunters with their lives if the worst came to pass.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok grew even angrier after realizing how blindly loyal his soldiers were. This time, however, the anger was not directed at his own men.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You sons of bitches…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was enraged at the hunters for deceiving and using him, then turning around and harming his soldiers. Sensing his rage, Goldrake threateningly growled at the group.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Eek!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“S, spare us!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The hunters were already half out of their wits from the drake’s earlier roar. Now, they bowed down and trembled, unable to endure the beast’s overwhelming pressure. A few desperately tried to escape.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Anyone who takes another step dies.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>At&nbsp;</span><span>Seon-Hyeok’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;angry command, Goldrake raised his front legs and stomped down onto the muddy ground. With a bang, the earth became even less stable and sucked in the hunters.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span>Ack!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The hunters screamed in terror as they found themselves waist-deep in the now swamp-like ground.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span>Spare us!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span>F, forgive us!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We were wrong! Please spare our lives!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Upon belatedly arriving at the scene, Tristan and Julian saw the terrified hunters and dismounted from their horses.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My lord. Please give me the chance to avenge my colleagues. If you do, I’ll be eternally grateful.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tristan had lost half of his party in the process of being robbed of the wyvern and his belongings. His eyes seared with a burning rage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok hesitated for a moment, but he did not have to think long.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You have my permission.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you, my lord. I will repay this favor, even if it takes me the rest of my life.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Seon-Hyeok nodded, the hunter pulled out a knife from around his waist.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hiik! Spare us! Tristan, we’re monster hunters li… ugh.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tristan showed no inclination to listen, immediately stabbing the knife into the hunter’s chest. It was a simple and clean act of vengeance befitting his typically calm demeanor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He was the one who instigated this situation.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was clear Tristan wanted to kill the rest of the group as well, but he did not act on his desires. Instead, the monster hunter trusted that Seon-Hyeok would exact appropriate revenge in his place.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Call the others here and send these men away. Put them to work in the deepest corners of the mines, and make sure they never see the light of day again.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">These bastards had harmed others of their kind out of sheer greed, and they had put an innocent village in harm’s way. He had no desire to forgive them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s the fairy dragon egg.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This entire mission had been to find the fairy dragon egg, but Seon-Hyeok had forgotten about the objective at the sight of his injured men. Tristan approached him to point out the large mass wrapped in several layers of ropes and blankets.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was thanks to him that Seon-Hyeok recalled his purpose for coming all the way here. He dismounted from Goldrake and approached the egg.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Here…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tristan’s eyes grew wide as he lifted the blanket, trying to show the lord what was in the bundle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Flash!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>A colorful light emanated from under the blanket, illuminating the world.</span></p>
