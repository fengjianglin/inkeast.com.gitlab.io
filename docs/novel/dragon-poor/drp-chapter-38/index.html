 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Having been thrown from the peak, the drake looked warily at the group for a moment, but soon turned his head and stopped moving. Having already lost his strength due to hunger, he seemed to be even less energetic after receiving the shock from the fall.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>For&nbsp;</span><span>Seon-Hyeok</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, this was a fortunate development. He had succeeded in taming the drake, but the monster wasn’t completely obedient. Considering his innate wildness and ferocity, it was fortunate that the drake remained sprawled out on the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But just in case.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had tied the drake’s body up in rope, with the exception of his four legs. In particular, he made sure to bind the mouth well so that nobody would inadvertently become the monster’s next meal.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>-</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hunger, discontent, frustration, lethargy</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The drake seemed dissatisfied by being tied up, but had followed him nonetheless after being tempted with several pieces of jerky.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The path down the mountain was especially rough. Seon-Hyeok suffered, struggling to drag the immobile drake down the narrow and treacherous path.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>As they travelled down like this, there were a number of spots that could not be traversed with the drake. Each time, he repeated the technique used&nbsp;</span><span>at the Frost</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Peak, rolling the drake down the mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Roar.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen and the party paled as they looked at the monster roaring while rolling down the mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Uh, is it okay to roll that down the mountain like that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He’s pretty tough, and I’m being careful when I do.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He did feel a bit sorry for the drake, but he had no other way of taking the feeble monster down the mountain. To make matters worse, the time he wasted on the peak meant that their schedule in getting back to the 24th Regiment was tight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was no time to find another method.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You can’t take a dangerous monster like that back to our land. He might be docile now because he’s powerless, but he’s more than capable of destroying our territory after regaining his strength.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their descent was difficult, but even more troublesome was the attitude of the group concerning the drake. Drakes were rumored to be ferocious even in this monster-filled world, and they were reluctant to take one back to their territory, no matter how weak the monster might currently be.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And faced with that predicament, an accident occurred. On the party’s trip up the mountain, Atiya had dropped a group of yeti down the cliff. They passed by the piled up bodies on the way down, and the drake caused a scene.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>-</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hunger, hunger, hunger, dissatisfaction</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The sight of the drake charging at the yeti corpses and tearing them apart was the splitting image of an apex predator.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After watching the drake eat, the group, dazed by the sight, found themselves raising their spears and swords defensively as the monster finished his meal.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Rope isn’t enough.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The rope used to previously bind the drake was nowhere to be found, and all that remained was a hideous mass of flesh and blood. The party grew even more afraid of the monster, having seen their safety mechanism overcome in an instant.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Seon-Hyeok. There’s nothing I can do about this. I might be the lord’s son, but right now, I’m just another heavy cavalry rider from the 24th Regiment. My father wouldn’t want me to ignore the others’ opinions and override them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Now, the entire party was opposed to hauling the drake back. Seon-Hyeok was left with the drake at the foot of the mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>-</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hunger</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Again?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He sighed as he saw the drake complaining of hunger not long after stuffing himself with the yetis.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had come all this way to find a mount suitable for a dragon rider, and instead, he had found this beggar of a monster.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His heart grew heavy thinking about the hardships he’d have to go through in the future, but he had no intention of giving up the drake.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If I can get him to listen…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He could imagine the drake charging into enemy cavalry on the battlefield. No matter how well-trained their horses, he didn’t think they could avoid being intimidated by this ferocious monster.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is this the drake?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Baron Wulfmeyer and the other key figures from the territory had gathered, as though they had already been notified of the drake’s presence. They came with high expectations. They were amazed by the rare sight, but at the same time, seemed perplexed by the drake that seemed to be just flesh and bones.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Compared to what I imagined, it’s a lot…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The baron couldn’t bring himself to say that the drake was less impressive than he imagined, but Seon-Hyeok seemed to hear those unspoken words nonetheless and gave an embarrassed look. Even he could tell that the drake’s gaunt appearance was not dignified. The drake was thin, had an overly large head compared to his body, and looked simply ridiculous.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This guy’s necessary for my class…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You said dragon rider, right? Well, that drake does look similar to the dragons from the myths.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The baron nodded with an understanding look and said something unexpected.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But by the way, do you know that that’s an old drake?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had come here after being told of the existence of the drake, but he knew next to nothing about the species. Seon-Hyeok couldn’t help but pay attention as the baron spoke about the drakes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s my first time seeing one as well, and there aren’t too many stories about them. That said, wyverns and drakes are said to go somewhere high up and wait when it’s time for them to die. Considering this drake was dying at the Frost Peak, if I’m not mistaken, he must be quite old.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The information the baron provided was far different from what Seon-Hyeok had expected. He despaired, hearing that the drake, who he thought was in a terrible state simply due to hunger, might be so permanently as a result of old age.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“No. Then again, it doesn’t look like he’ll die anytime soon. I heard he had an unusually ravenous appetite? If he&nbsp;</span><span>climbed the Frost</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Peak to die, he probably wouldn’t act this way now. Just pretend I didn’t say anything.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The baron belatedly retracted his words after seeing Seon-Hyeok’s visible disappointment, but the foreigner didn’t raise his head. They continued their conversation, but nothing else important came out of it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m sorry. The people of the north are widely known to be fearless, but even so, they’ll be agitated if they see such a monster brought into their territory.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I understand.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok needed to recover from his trip, but at the same time, he couldn’t ask the lord for additional accommodations given his current situation. As such, he set up a temporary camp and waited for Hansen to bring him his horse and belongings.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Munch, munch.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Meanwhile, the drake finished eating the pig provided by the baron and lay down. His actions resembled that of an old man, and Seon-Hyeok grew frustrated.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The mental image he had of the imposing, brave dragon riders was gone. He wished for the dragon to call out to him in these troubling times, but no words of comfort came.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok spent a night at the temporary camp and began the trip back with Hansen. The drake seemed much livelier than before, having devoured two pigs over the previous day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Our schedule is pretty tight. I wonder if he can keep up.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen’s concerns were natural. The drake waddling behind them didn’t inspire any confidence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s go. We can’t let ourselves be charged as deserters.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok slowly increased Stella’s pace. Fortunately, the drake was quick to follow. He had been worried, knowing that there was little that could be done if the drake refused to follow or ran away outright, but was relieved to see the monster easily keep up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then should we pick up the pace a bit more?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He increased Stella’s speed to test the drake’s speed and endurance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh? He’s doing pretty well!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen looked back and commented in surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Surprisingly, the old(?) drake refused to fall behind. They picked up the pace a bit more, and the drake did his best to follow.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm. He’s a bit slower than a horse though.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After riding for a while, Seon-Hyeok was able to understand that the skinny drake was unexpectedly fast and persistent. He couldn’t keep up with the full speed of a galloping war horse, but he nonetheless did much better than his appearance suggested.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I can see the drake being pretty useful as a mount.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A war horse became far less mobile when saddled and carrying a fully armed rider. Considering this, it didn’t seem too far-fetched to ride a drake onto the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The only problem was...</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Can you actually ride that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Compared to a horse, which had regular upper and lower-body movements while running, the drake that followed them didn’t move like an ideal mount.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll have to hold on somehow.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok had a gloomy expression, recalling the trials he faced while first learning to ride a horse.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had finally gained a dragon-type mount, but the path of the dragon rider nonetheless seemed treacherous.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Most of the riders had returned to their camp with a day to spare. Even those who arrived late among the cavalry were at their post by that evening and reported on their return.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The only two left were Hansen and Kim Seon-Hyeok.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Did something happen to those two?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh. We shouldn’t have trusted Hansen with him.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clark, Jonasson, and the other riders stared out towards the entrance to their garrison several times a day. Nonetheless, they received no news of the riders’ return even on the last day of their assigned vacation, and they became concerned about the potential punishments for desertion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hansen might get a pay cut and be treated harshly for a bit, but Seon-Hyeok’s the problem.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No. When you think about it, Hansen can’t avoid responsibility either. Our superiors allowed Seon-Hyeok to take his trip because they trusted Hansen.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Foreigners were generally treated well, but the one exception was when it came to the topic of desertion. Those who deserted were given much stricter discipline than the native people, and at this rate, Seon-Hyeok would be on the receiving end of serious punishment, let alone get a reward and promotion for his achievements in battle. Even the company commander looked nervously towards the entrance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though his promotion to senior knight had been confirmed, it would be a terrible black mark on his record to have one of his subordinate foreigners desert on his watch.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The day grew dark, and the fears of potential desertion became more and more real. The 24th Regiment heavy cavalry all went to the entrance of the garrison, hoping that Seon-Hyeok and Hansen would return.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Where’d that crazy bastard go with Seon-Hyeok?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clark swore as he waited. He had trusted Hansen, but both he and Seon-Hyeok hadn’t yet returned. Jonasson and the other cavalry showed a mix of anger, anxiety, and restlessness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The sun continued to fall, and yet the two still didn’t return. They had missed their return deadline.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If they arrived right now, I could use my authority to lightly discipline them myself.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The agitated cavalry quieted down after hearing Company Commander Frederick’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But I can’t wait any longer. Send out a messenger and a search party…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a search party in name only. In reality, the assigned group would pursue the two and catch the deserters, and their fate would be unenviable once caught. The riders’ expressions darkened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At that moment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh? Over there!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A rider with particularly sharp eyesight saw a horse approaching in the darkness and shouted out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s Hansen and Seon-Hyeok!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Those crazy bastards! Making us all worry!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They were late, but the situation was still manageable. The riders cheered at their comrades’ belated return. Even the company commander showed a rare expression of relief and welcomed the late returnees back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh? But what’s that? They’re bringing something weird?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Boom. Boom.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A strange sound was mixed among the sound of horses’ hooves. A large shadow was between the two approaching horses.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“M, monster!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No! No! It’s not a monster!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Panicking, Seon-Hyeok shouted from the distance as he saw the riders trying to prepare for combat. The drake he was riding looked completely different from when he first left&nbsp;</span><span>Frostbegmund</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
