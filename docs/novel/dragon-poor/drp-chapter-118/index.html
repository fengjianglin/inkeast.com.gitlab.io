 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok first noticed the signs around the time he caught up to a moving infantry company. He frowned – the change was so subtle that he would not have noticed if he was not being vigilant.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was no place to hide in the wilderness, and there was no presence among the infantry moving like a line of worker ants that could pose a threat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, he did not ignore the alarms going off in his body.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On this day, he did not even have Aria Eisen to support him. A mage’s body was too frail to endure such a murderous flight schedule, and he had decided to give her a break for the day. So long as he was in enemy territory alone, he could not overlook even the slightest of abnormalities.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Let’s head back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had no reason to overexert himself. He had already made tremendous contributions in this war, and the war situation would not significantly change if he failed to deal with this single infantry company.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s head up, Redvern.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After looking at the back of the infantry for a while, Seon-Hyeok tapped Redvern on the neck and told the wyvern to ascend.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Am I overreacting?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He smiled bitterly when he noticed the danger signs grow as he rose further from the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had taken care to only harass the Noctein forces from the safety of the skies, but the fatigue of battle still accumulated. It was not strange that he found himself stressed from leading dozens of enemy bombings in a short period of time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His expression belatedly hardened upon realizing that he was alone beyond enemy lines, somewhere he could not rely on allied support.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Whew.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok was finally able to exhale once he was far in the air, barely able to make out the figures on the ground. However, it was premature for him to be relieved. Before he could take in another breath, the sense of imminent danger overwhelmed him once again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The ominous sensation felt as though he had a dagger pointed to the tip of his chin, and he pressed Redvern on.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Redvern, hurry…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Before he could even finish, the eerie sensation became reality.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thud.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Redvern bounced off of something invisible as the wyvern flapped its wings.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Shriek?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The wyvern tilted its head in confusion before trying once again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thud.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The results remained the same. Redvern was unable to move forward or rise any higher, as though there was an invisible wall in their way.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What the hell…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok squinted his eyes upon noticing this bewildering situation. The air that Redvern just hit faintly shimmered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Got them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Talisman smiled slyly as he saw the plummeting wyvern. Shockingly, his uniform was that of a common infantryman.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was not just the mage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I wonder if we had to go this far.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Halo, the commander of the Red Wolves, complained as he drew his sword. Like Talisman, he wore a nondescript uniform and not his usual flamboyant armor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Didn’t you just see? He tried to pull away just before he descended. If we didn’t have these disguises, we would’ve never caught that sneaky bastard.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was as Talisman said. Commander Halo’s heart had sank when the Drake Knight stopped trailing them and suddenly ascended.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’re certain he can’t escape from here?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was still concerned that the Drake Knight would just fly away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“From here? This magic was developed to deal with the Seven Knights of the Azure Sky. Stopping one rider is a piece of cake.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old mage confidently addressed his concerns.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Now that the barrier magic has been activated, I assure you that nobody will be able to leave this area for at least a day.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Halo was reassured, seeing the normally wary mage speak up so confidently. He removed his helmet and gestured. Six senior knights, hidden among the infantry, pulled out their swords and stepped forward.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He’s an unpredictable foe, so let’s get this over with quickly.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh? I was just about to get started. You Red Wolves can sit back and watch for a while.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A hideous smile formed on Talisman’s old, wrinkled face as he gave an order to his subordinates.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Begin the hunt.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Five mages began their incantations after hearing their leader’s command.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok realized that he had fallen into a trap. The Noctein knights and mages causing a great commotion from far away were all doing so to bring about this current situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Damn it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was a bird in a cage, caught in the Nocteins’ devious scheme.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">When had this all gone wrong? Did I become overconfident after repeated victories? Did I rely too much on the safety of the skies?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was no way to know.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The only thing that was for certain was that the enemy had been waiting for him from the beginning. It would be difficult to escape through the transparent barrier cast on all sides.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok saw a few soldiers stepping away from the hundred infantry in the distance and wondered why it had taken him so long to notice. He felt a familiar presence from them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their fighting spirit, sharp as a well-honed blade, could only be seen from knights meticulously trained in swordsmanship. It was clear that they were all on the level of senior knights.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">No. That’s not what’s important now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was clear that the knights were powerful, but they could not bother him when he was so high above the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the mages were different. They were the deadly snipers and anti-aerial weapons of this world. Considering he was without Aria Eisen, these mages would be the only ones capable of attacking him at this range.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Where are you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok narrowed his eyes and noticed a mage hiding among the infantry. It did not take long for him to locate them all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To be exact, it was not that he found them. The mages openly revealed themselves.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, damn it!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok swore as he saw the mages moving their lips and making strange gestures in the distance. It was at that moment the mages’ attack began.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Redvern!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At his shout, Redvern folded its enormous wings and accelerated.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A tremendous noise could be heard from just behind him. Seon-Hyeok felt a strange sensation throughout his body as he grabbed Redvern’s reins.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Redvern rolled in the air. At that very moment, six magic arrows passed through where they had just been.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hup.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The six projectiles turned and followed them once again. At the same time, a crimson pillar of fire rushed towards him. Seon-Hyeok once again had Redvern take evasive maneuvers to avoid the incoming attacks.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the magical attacks continued to increase. One evaded projectile became two, and two became four. At a certain point, magical attacks so densely filled the air that he had nowhere to run.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok pulled out his lance and desperately stabbed, trying to create a safe space for him and Redvern. The lance, surrounded by the power of the attributes, quickly crushed some of the magical projectiles and opened up a path. He quickly guided Redvern through the gap as the countless attacks followed right behind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As time passed, he noticed himself blocking more attacks than he avoided. Even this became difficult after a while.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">When did this…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Magical spheres that exploded on contact filled the entire area.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Boom. Boom.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When he momentarily lost focus, Redvern came into contact with a few of these orbs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Shriek!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Redvern had already been directly hit by a number of spells, and the wyvern was even more injured now. Seon-Hyeok gritted his teeth as he heard Redvern scream.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please hold on.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He wanted nothing more than to pour out every last ability he had at his disposal. However, he suppressed this urge.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Just once.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All he needed was one opportunity to deal with the mages. He knew this full well from past experience.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok stabbed at, evaded, and endured the spells flying in all directions as he bided his time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">How much time had passed?</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok suddenly felt an ominous sensation and was horrified.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It can’t be…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Before he knew it, he found himself much closer to the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Damn.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">This</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;is what they were after.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok realized that he had been driven down to the ground. Unfortunately, knowing their plans did not change anything.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even as he understood the situation, he was forced to lower his altitude little by little.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is the magic developed to deal with the Seven Knights of the Azure Sky. To think that we got to try this first against a wyvern and not griffins.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Talisman was in great spirits as he watched the Drake Knight being chased around by the myriad spells cast in his direction. He seemed thrilled that the magic he spent a long time creating proved to be so effective in this real-life situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Calm down. Even a mouse, if cornered, will attack a cat.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the other hand, Halo seemed to disapprove of Talisman and the other mages, and his expression remained grim.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tsk. You knights can always play around if you have swords at hand, but us mages might not have such an opportunity again. Don’t be so disapproving.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Our enemy is the Drake Knight, responsible for instantly annihilating a mage unit under the protection of knights. If you let your guard down, you’ll make a mistake.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Talisman frowned, irritated that the knight was dampening the mood. However, the mage realized that Halo had a point, as he stopped grumbling and prepared to deal the final blow.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“All of you, get ready. If the magic fails, we’ll have to finish him off ourselves.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Talisman openly complained as the knight’s words wounded his pride.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He will regret ever daring to use the heavens as his battlefield.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The mage was confident.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The Noctein Kingdom had always focused on an eventual war against the&nbsp;</span><span>Griffindors</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, as they were more militant than the Adenburg Kingdom. The Noctein mages were no different. During their time locked up in the capital, they meticulously planned for a future conflict against the Knights of the Azure Sky.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, he won’t even have the chance to. He’s going to die here today.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Unfortunately for&nbsp;</span><span>Seon-Hyeok</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, the Drake Knight on his wyvern was the perfect opponent to test out the anti-aerial spells developed to deal with Griffindor’s elites.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The three of you, keep driving the Drake Knight down to the ground. You two, help me finish casting this magic.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hearing Talisman’s instructions, the remaining two mages came forward to cast the spell. It was evidently a powerful spell, as it took a long time to finish.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Howling Gust!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Having completed preparations with the help of his two subordinates, Talisman shouted to bring forth his most powerful magic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok found himself getting lower and lower, and now, he was close enough to the ground that the knights could reach him if they tried. At this rate, he would be driven into their ranks before having an opportunity to retaliate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">There’s no time. I need to make a decision.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even now, if he gathered all of his energy and tried to aim for the mages, he had a good chance of escaping this trap. However, he tried to calm himself and continued to bide his time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was the familiar energy emanating from the mages that allowed him to be patient until the very end. It was around the time his patience finally reached its limit that his opportunity arrived.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Howling Gust!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Anticipating victory, the mage spoke with a voice full of conviction.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Roar!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At that very moment, an artificial storm materialized from thin air.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When he saw this overwhelming magic, Seon-Hyeok did not tremble, but instead cheered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is it!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Without any hesitation, Seon-Hyeok charged straight into the violent storm.</span></p>
