 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Episode 41. Initiation (2)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The well-trained war horses panicked at the sight of the ferocious drake and his stench. Those belonging to the 24th Regiment, hardened through fierce battles, were able to hold their ground, but the reinforcements’ horses had no chance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Chaos erupted as men fell from their horses while others tried to calm down their frantic mounts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hey, be quiet. They’re going crazy because of you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok smacked the smug drake on his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grr.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His drake immediately drooped his head, as though he was a puppy being scolded. Even so, the frightened horses showed no signs of calming down.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I fed the drake already, so I’ll go get Stella instead. Don’t start until I get back.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You really go through so much trouble feeding him. And don’t worry - you’re the first.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, really? Great! I’ll be right back!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok disappeared like the wind, excited by the response. He soon returned on the back of a brilliant white horse.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then should we get started? It’ll get dark soon, and we can’t let this drag on until tomorrow now, can we?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With that, Clark got the men to step back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Further back. Don’t get caught up in the fight.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reserve units felt it was strange, being asked to step back much further than what they imagined would be necessary, but nobody stepped forward to ask why.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Seon-Hyeok.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Having secured plenty of space, Clark whispered to Seon-Hyeok.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That bastard’s notorious in the south. He’s a piece of work who backstabbed his superiors and beat down on his comrades, so teach him a lesson. You can even kill him if necessary.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“T, that’s a bit…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Use your abilities or something. I asked them to send reinforcements, but they just sent us their trash. We should get rid of anyone that’s irredeemable.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, it was too much to ask of Seon-Hyeok, who was reluctant to kill.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you two whispering about? Does he need someone to babysit him?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The newcomer shouted furiously, as if trying to hype himself up after being subdued in front of the drake.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh. I’ll give him a scare at least.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok ignored him and wondered how to best complete the mission Clark had given him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then begin!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After a short pause, the pre-prepared flag was raised. He and the giant stared at each other from afar and spurred their horses on at the same time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh? Huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The distance between the two closed in an instant, and the onlookers watched in anticipation. However, though they started moving at the same time, Seon-Hyeok accelerated much faster. At this rate, the newcomer would meet his opponent before even reaching his top speed, and the end result seemed inevitable.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unlike the surprised reinforcement units, the 24th Regiment riders watched the scene as if it was all too obvious. They knew better than anyone how talented the Widowmaker was. This was Stella, the monster of a warhorse that showed no fear even in front of the terrifying drake.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hup!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The giant lunged forward using his cavalry spear with its tip padded in thick cotton for training use. Despite not being at top speed, it was a formidable attack, worthy of someone who declared himself to be the greatest rider.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, he was facing the wrong opponent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Having already fought in two battles, Seon-Hyeok was no longer a novice, and he was more than skilled enough to easily dispatch someone who had never fought in a proper battle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Do I have to go this far…?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just before they collided, Seon-Hyeok sighed and whispered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wind Piercing.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He didn’t gather the full extent of his attribute’s powers, as he had done in the fight against the Sasteins, but the force of his ability was on a different level compared to an average rider’s charge.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A roaring sound cut through the air, and the challenger was toppled from his horse.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Fortunately for him, because he hadn’t been at full speed, he was able to avoid death from falling. The giant man looked around with a dazed expression before collapsing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Good job.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The 24th Regiment riders didn’t even cheer. They simply nodded a few times, having expected this outcome.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the other hand, the incoming reinforcements were dumbfounded. They had been impressed by the giant, who had attacked with impeccable timing. However, his opponent easily overcame the attack, and they were unsure how he had managed to do so.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All they heard was an explosion following the foreigner’s whispered command, and immediately after, the giant had lost his composure. His shield had been pushed back by the counterattack, and he was thrown off his horse.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a defeat resulting from an overwhelming difference in skill. The reinforcements’ expressions immediately darkened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s the newest recruit? Then what kind of monsters are the others?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Maybe the others also ride monsters like the one we just saw?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok smirked as he heard the voices of the reserves carried to him by the wind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Was it finally time for me to shed the title of newcomer?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He looked at the new riders in anticipation, like a predator eyeing its prey. They shrunk back even more at the sight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Fortunately, or perhaps unfortunately, none of the others chose Seon-Hyeok. Even so, avoiding him didn’t mean that the reinforcement riders were victorious. The 24th Regiment cavalry, having endured battles against other cavalry forces, including the Sasteins, were far too strong for those who lived a more comfortable life.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is that it? Even if you’ve already lost, I’ll give you another chance. Anyone who wants to keep going should speak up now.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reserve forces lowered their heads. Despite fighting round after round, Clark showed no signs of exhaustion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was no victory they could gain from this situation, whether physically, mentally, or spiritually. It was a complete defeat, and they didn’t dare challenge them again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll take that as a no?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reinforcements hung their heads without responding to Clark’s question. Having demonstrated their superiority, the 24th Regiment riders once again welcomed the newcomers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Welcome to our cavalry, newcomers.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Be prepared to hit the ground running tomorrow. We’ll turn you into real men.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll make sure you cry out during training.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their welcoming words were just as terrifying, and the soldiers paled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard you made quite a scene.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, aren’t all cavalry the same? Nobody wants to be subordinate to a weaker soldier or follow a slower rider. They’re all like that, so we had to put them in their place.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clark lightly responded to the company commander.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So will there be a problem?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course not. And anyways, they’re all troublemakers, so nobody would complain even if a few of them died. Actually, I’m sure some of their superiors sent them here hoping for that exact outcome.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, is there a political problem, by any chance?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clark asked with a troubled expression, and the company commander nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard Earl Paslin’s bastard’s among the newcomers.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“By Earl Paslin, do you mean the noble who was troubled because his eldest son was so frail…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s right. Rumor has it that he’d be lucky to live past thirty. He has three sons, but the word is that they might not even be his. I heard that there are quite a few people who want to elevate his bastard son instead.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clark immediately grasped the situation and frowned.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I think he must have understood his position as well, since he decided to accept the transfer order without complaint.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So one side hopes for him to die in battle, and the other thinks that an enemy’s spear is less dangerous than the sword aimed at his back.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Frederick did not answer. However, he did not need to.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So who is it? That bastard son?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Jackson Hamilton.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The replacement soldiers had lost their rebellious spirit, but their anger remained. Among them, there was one who directed his frustration at the wrong place.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You little bastard. You don’t think about your comrades at all, do you? Sucking up to survive on your own?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The rider who had been beaten up by Clark started a fight with Jackson.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s strange about a soldier following orders?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, Jackson, despite appearing timid, responded more forcefully than expected.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’re a bastard who doesn’t know the meaning of comradeship…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Enough.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At that moment, Clark entered the barracks.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Comradeship isn’t something gained through causing trouble together, but rather by enduring challenges together. You dumb bastard.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clark seemed like a wolf agitating a group of rabbits as he walked around the barracks.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Anyone die during the initiation earlier? Speak up if you did.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The dead obviously couldn’t answer. Thankfully, there weren’t any.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How about anyone who’s too injured to speak. Speak up.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reserves once again did not answer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s good. Everyone out.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After asking questions that nobody could reasonably answer, Clark ordered everyone to get out without exception. Unlike when they first arrived at the garrison, the reserve forces followed his command without a word.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is the initiation still going on?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As if liking the attitude of the man fearlessly asking questions despite the earlier scene, Clark answered cordially.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No. After a fight, everyone should move on nicely.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With that, Clark took them to the barracks occupied by the 24th Regiment riders.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh? The new recruits are here? Sit, sit.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hey, be on the lookout. The captain might’ve allowed it, but that won’t mean anything if the commander sees us.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reserves had bewildered expressions as they smelled the burning scent of alcohol.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You all belonged to different units until yesterday. I don’t care how great you did there, or how accomplished you were.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clark made them sit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Once you drink here today, you’ll all be members of the 24th Regiment heavy cavalry.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reinforcements all raised their glass at Clark’s manly words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Good. For the glory of the Drake Cavalry!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Drake Cavalry?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Someone raised a question, confused about the name he was hearing for the first time. Jonasson stepped up to explain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Our unit will no longer be referred to by a number, but instead be given an official name. It hasn’t been announced yet, but there’s a good chance we’ll become the Drake Cavalry.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The new recruits seemed excited. It was rare for a knight division to get its own name, let alone a regular cavalry unit, and they realized their new position was in this glorious cavalry. It looked as though they had forgotten the complaints and unsavory events from earlier.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“For the Drake Cavalry!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“For the Drake Cavalry!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clark shouted out, and the newcomers responded in kind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll be in your care.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s be friends.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well… I’ll follow you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They might have been troublemakers in their previous positions, but the sight of them all raising a glass and acting friendly with one another was nice to see.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes. Welcome to our cavalry.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They didn’t speak or act like newcomers, but Seon-Hyeok nonetheless smiled and welcomed them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was so much alcohol available that a passerby might wonder if it was even acceptable for a military garrison. The atmosphere quickly heated up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But where did everyone go?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Did they all go to the bathroom?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After drinking for a while, the newcomers realized that there wasn’t anyone from the original Drake Cavalry. No, rather, there was just one.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The one remaining was Kim Seon-Hyeok, red faced and drunk.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Where did everyone…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hey.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Instead of an answer, all they got was a single word.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh? Yes?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They had first seen Seon-Hyeok approach on the back of a drake, and he had naturally left quite an impression. He was a senior member of the unit who they had to acknowledge, so they shut their mouths and waited for him to continue.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you know how difficult it is?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What he said was completely different from what they expected.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reserve forces that assembled early the following day showed great spirit, as though they were new recruits being assigned to their first post.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Seems like you took care of them well. Good job.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their faces were a mess, but the company commander took it in stride. In fact, he even looked pleased.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, Seon-Hyeok worked hard.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clark grinned and patted Seon-Hyeok on the shoulder. Having forgotten the events of the previous night after his excessive drinking, he just opened his eyes wide in confusion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We’ll be heading straight to the capital when the Mangsk forces arrive, so get ready.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes! It’s time to get our reward!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The troops cheered at the company commander’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Significant financial rewards, special promotions, and medals were awaiting them. And even among them, it was Kim Seon-Hyeok who was in line for the greatest rewards.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">The title of viscount, huge rewards, and most importantly, the opportunity to proudly face those who disregarded my dragon rider class as a useless one.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That person in charge then…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was looking forward to seeing a royal rating officer, after having his expectations crushed in his first assessment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">I’ll be able to see one soon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His wait was not long. The rating officer arrived at the garrison to adjust his rank before they even headed to the capital.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s been a while.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The official seemed familiar.</span></p>
