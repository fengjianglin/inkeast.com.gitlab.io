 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So anyways, thank you for coming all the way here. You can go and rest.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After examining him with a sharp gaze, the man quickly gestured for him to leave with an indifferent expression. Jackson felt deflated at the insincere attitude towards him, but he kept his composure and saluted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you for your consideration!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At his salute, Company Commander Frederick once again waved his hand.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Follow me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">An infantryman waiting outside the company commander’s barracks took the lead. His attitude wasn’t pleasant, but Jackson didn’t mind. He may never interact with this soldier again, but he was excited about his newly assigned position.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Head to the border.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had felt a wave of emotions when he first received the transfer order. However, his anticipation grew after hearing that his new post would be with the 24th Regiment, and he was barely able to sleep.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The 24th Regiment heavy cavalry was the most elite cavalry unit in the kingdom and had exterminated the notorious Sastein cavalry in just two battles. That was where he was destined to be in the future.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We’re here.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jackson reached his destination while lost in his own imagination.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In his excitement he spoke up to thank the infantryman, but the soldier responsible for leading him here was already on his way. Jackson scratched his cheek out of embarrassment and straightened his clothes. With that, he opened the door to the barracks, looking forward to meeting the heroes of the kingdom.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And who the hell is this?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Oh god. Did they send some apprentice&nbsp;</span><span>knight</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">? Look at his clothes.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sharp criticism flew from all sides before he could even salute.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He even has all his buttons on. Is he from the capital?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jackson had expected the elite cavalry to have a strict and formal attitude like the knights.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">But what were these guys?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The cavalry riders in front of him were scarred and looked more like thugs than heroic warriors. The elite cavalry he imagined was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Hm. Were the units on the frontier different after all?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He tried to think positively, but it proved difficult.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hey, you son of a bitch. That’s my spot!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How’s it yours? How’s it yours?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The shouting and swearing riders seemed like a gang more than anything else.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jackson watched the mess unfold in front of him and had forgotten all about introducing himself when someone grabbed his shoulder. When he turned, a man he had never seen before was looking at him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you the last one?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh? Yes!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man’s voice was plain yet commanding, and Jackson found himself giving a spirited response.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That idiot. He looks like a girl.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Only then, after enduring the giggles and ridicule, did he realize that the clothes worn by the men in the barracks were mismatched and seemingly random. Only the man in front of him wore the blue uniform specific to the frontier cavalry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Shut up, grab your bags, and get ready to come out. You have thirty seconds.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The noisy atmosphere in the barracks quickly subsided as the man spoke in a quiet voice. The men were overwhelmed by the subtle ferocity in his tone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the thug-like men were as crude as they looked, and they grew even more rebellious after realizing they had shown weakness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard those blue-coat bastards were proud. They’re really condescending.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The blue uniforms worn by the border cavalry were an honor and indicated their status as the most elite cavalry in the kingdom. The riders further inside the kingdom envied the veteran cavalry, and some despised them as incompetent riders who simply gained fame for fighting a few battles. The person who stepped up just now seemed to be one of the latter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So I heard you’re good at killing people? You don’t look the part.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man growled as though he would cause a scene then and there, but the man in the blue uniform remained calm. Rather, it was Jackson who became restless as he watched the situation unfold. He found himself in the middle of the conflict, and he looked like he was about to cry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ignoring me, are you? If I say something, you should answer…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“… twenty-eight, twenty-nine.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The indifferent voice interrupted him. Jackson recalled that the uniformed man had given everyone a time limit to get packed and ready to go.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thirty. It’s time. Everyone out of the barracks.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you running away? As I expected, all that about Sasteins was bullshit, and you’re all just cowards… ugh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While approaching the uniformed rider, the belligerent man suddenly grabbed his nose and screamed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t test my fighting spirit. Rider’s don’t fight with their mouths.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Riders don’t fight with their mouths…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The uniformed man was the splitting image of the cavalry he had imagined, and Jackson found himself repeating his words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You son of a…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And I’ll give you a chance even if you don’t cry and whine like that, so shut up. You bastards.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man got up holding his bloodied nose, but his opponent had already left the barracks.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you running? Running away? You saw that, right? That bastard ran away.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He tried to reassert his dominance, but his bloodied nose told a different story.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jackson shook his head at the sight and tried to leave the barracks.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hey! Don’t leave. We’re comrades from now on. Do you think it’ll be easier for you if you turn your back on us?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you ignoring me too? You bastard, what’s your name? I’ll make sure to remember!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jackson ignored the voices behind him. The rider in the blue uniform was more terrifying than all of the men in the barracks combined.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But when he left the barracks, there was not one, but tens of riders all in their uniforms.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Name!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a short question, unlike the aggressive questions asked by the men in the barracks, but it felt powerful. Jackson found himself straightening up before he knew it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Jackson Hamilton! I’m from the Paslin territory to the east!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Good. Jackson from Paslin, go over there. You’re exempted from the initiation.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jackson stepped aside as he was told and glanced back at the barracks. None of the men inside had followed him, and it seemed they were intent on rebelling as a group.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah. It’s better like this. Obedient recruits are no fun.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jackson thought that the blue uniformed man would be angry, but he instead was smiling in satisfaction. However, he felt discouraged, as the man’s words just now seemed to be aimed at him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They won’t come out even if we wait, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Not a chance. They probably all received special treatment as leaders and seniors from their own units.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After talking briefly amongst themselves, the 24th Regiment cavalry seemed to reach a decision and gestured.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh? What are you doing…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hey you, new recruit. Just stay there and watch.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Two horses ran from the end of each side of the barracks. Behind the horses, Jackson could see a rope linking them to the structure. The loose rope soon pulled taut, and soon it dragged down the barracks’ main pillar with a thud.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ack!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“W, what!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In an instant, screaming and shouting broke out from inside the barracks.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you mean, what. It’s your initiation, bastards.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And with that, the uniformed riders climbed onto the collapsed barracks and began to hit those inside.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ack!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh! My nose!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Screams and groans continued for a long while. When they finally subsided, the riders removed the cloth covering of the barracks. The men inside had broken noses, bloody lips, and black and blue bruises all over their bodies. They had tried to hold out inside to intimidate the 24th Regiment cavalry, and this was the pitiful result.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You, you cowardly… ugh.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A particularly well-built man tried to lift himself up and curse at the riders, but before he could even finish, a uniformed rider punched him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Welcome to the 24th Regiment heavy cavalry.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man smiled brightly as he gave a welcoming remark that did not match the situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m Captain Clark. I look forward to working with you, you bastards.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man was trampled by Clark and screamed once again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just as the company commander and Clark had expected, the reinforcements sent from all over the kingdom weren’t particularly desirable. Their individual skills might be respectable, but they all had unwanted attitudes and a spirit of rebelliousness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even after being beaten, they still seemed to want to rebel.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What? Do you think it’s unfair? Do you think you were ambushed by people you could easily beat one on one?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reinforcements did not answer, but it was obvious what they thought. Clark decided to give them another chance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Choose. If there’s anyone here you think you can take on, choose. If you win, you can be in charge.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The look in the reinforcements’ eyes changed at that comment. They hadn’t recovered from their beating just now, but they were convinced they could win in a fight even in their current state.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That guy over there.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wow, really. It’s Hansen again?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The first reinforcement rider pointed to Hansen. The 24th Regiment riders snickered as Hansen stepped forward and grumbled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What makes you think I’m an easy target?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In reality, it was his grumbling attitude and missing front teeth that made him look comparatively weak, but Hansen remained oblivious.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Stop! Stop!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The fight ended in a flash. The reinforcement rider had passed out, caught in Hansen’s patented grab. Even so, the man had shown his pride, being unwilling to tap out and accept defeat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard you’re the captain. If I win, will you hand over your position?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man who stepped up this time was different. Even among the large cavalry riders, he was a head taller than the rest.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If you win.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clark accepted the challenge without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reinforcement rider rushed in, was hit in his Adam’s apple, and immediately crumpled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m fighting you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That guy over there.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reinforcements continued to challenge the heavy cavalry despite the veterans’ overwhelming strength. And naturally, they continued to lose.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is unfair! We’re not at peak condition right now! If only we were on horseback…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, really? Then bring your horses.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clark gave another chance to the reinforcements, who refused to admit defeat until the end.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were no similarities between the reinforcement riders gathered on the training grounds. They had all gathered from different places, and thus, there was nothing they all had in common.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the other hand, the 24th Regiment heavy cavalry, which lined up against them, seemed like a single entity.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reinforcements were greater in number and looked more violent, but in this situation, the 24th Regiment seemed incomparably stronger. Jackson wasn’t sure whether this was because of the standardized equipment or something else altogether, but the difference between the sides became even more pronounced on horseback.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">As expected of a cavalry unit hardened by real battles.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jackson found himself admiring the sharpness of the veteran riders. Their composure was something that could not be imitated through training alone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then let’s begin. We can fight as a group, or one-on-one.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clark showed immense confidence, disregarding their numerical inferiority altogether, but even the nasty-tempered reinforcement riders seemed intimidated by a full-scale battle. They rolled their eyes and began to choose their opponents.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That rider who played the greatest role in defeating the Sasteins. Who is he?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The rider who had just lost to Clark looked for his new opponent, saying that he could not lose on horseback.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I think you’re looking for our most recent recruit?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Newest recruit or not, I want to face him. I’m the best on horseback.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The expressions on the 24th Regiment heavy cavalry were subtle as they listened to the giant man’s words. He frowned, feeling as though they were holding back their laughter and making fun of him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’re confident. Very good. That’s what we want from our riders. But tell me, are you really the best on horseback?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“See for yourself.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, no. I just thought it’d be fun if you said you were. I wonder what would happen if the best rider and that guy faced off.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With that ambiguous comment, the 24th Regiment riders looked off into the distance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He should be here by now…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, there he is.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing the black dot in the distance, Clark laughed and asked the giant once again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You won’t regret it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“A man should follow through with his words. I have no intention of changing my mind.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Good, good. Then you can face him as soon as he gets here.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The tiny dot in the distance quickly grew as it approached. The reinforcement soldiers found themselves with their mouths wide open in shock.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their knees shook as they met the monster’s gaze, and they feared that the beast, with its mouth covered in blood, would reappear in their nightmares.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Has it already begun?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Kim Seon-Hyeok, the black-haired man on the drake, asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s your opponent.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clark burst out in laughter as the giant paled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Growl.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>At that moment, the drake let out a growl, and the gathered war horses ran about in terror.</span></p>
