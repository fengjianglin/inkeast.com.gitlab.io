 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok did not respond to the king’s question. Commander Mangsk spoke up instead.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Your Majesty, there’s no way the timid ruler of&nbsp;</span><span>Griffindor</span><span>&nbsp;would send his prized griffin riders into war. Not only that, they wouldn’t do so for the&nbsp;</span><span>Noctein</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Kingdom after losing in their war.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Yesterday’s enemy becomes today’s ally, and today’s ally once again becomes tomorrow’s enemy. Diplomacy is the willingness to hold hands with foes responsible for the deaths of your own parents when it becomes necessary.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Commander&nbsp;</span><span>Mangsk</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was an exceptional soldier, but he was not a skilled diplomat. Even in battle, Adenburg’s Shield preferred tactics that abided by the fundamentals of war rather than attempts to goad the enemy through trickery. It was inevitable that he would be a neophyte at the interactions and intrigue between kingdoms.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>[We will find out in time what price&nbsp;</span><span>Griffindor</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was promised, but what matters now is not the details of their secret agreement. What is important is the fact that the Knights of the Azure Sky will soon arrive on the front lines.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The king was aware of the commander’s shortcomings, and as such, he refrained from reprimanding the soldier.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Commander Mangsk.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, Your Majesty.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Are you and your soldiers prepared to meet the griffin riders in battle?]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will do my best to stop them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Dependable as always. I will put my faith in Adenburg’s Shield.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After that final exchange, Commander Mangsk held his tongue. The king once again addressed Seon-Hyeok.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[It is as you heard. Sir Mangsk has promised to do his best to stop the knights roaming the skies. Whether or not you are here, he is willing to carry out his duties at all costs, as he has always done.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>He turned to Commander&nbsp;</span><span>Mangsk</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;once again. The old soldier had visibly aged since the last war, but he nodded his head, gaze unwavering.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[You may leave the front lines whenever you wish. However, if you change your mind and decide to remain, I will happily reward you for your efforts. That is the contract I have entered with you.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As expected, King Theodore did not try to forcibly keep him in the war. It was truly up to him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A rumor quietly spread among the major figures within Fort Kalstein. It suggested that Drachen would leave the front lines and return to his lands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh? I heard he was seriously injured by the commander of the Red Wolves. Those rumors must have been true.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even if he can take advantage of the skies, it would’ve been impossible to escape unscathed once caught in a trap carefully laid out by enemy knights and mages.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Those concerned about his situation hoped his injuries were not severe,</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wow, he does as he pleases. He got lucky and found a wyvern, but he’s an arrogant nobody until the very end.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“To think that he’s slinking off alone before the war is even over. Compared to his reputation, his sense of duty is…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And those envious of his accomplishments denigrated him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He fought in over 40 battles in this war alone. Are there any of us who can say the same?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If he didn’t defeat the Blue Wolves and inflict significant casualties on the Red Wolves, we’d have suffered heavy losses as well. Don’t speak ill of our heroes just because you’re jealous.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, gossip concerning Seon-Hyeok failed to gain traction. Some knights were blinded by jealousy and suggested that the battles he fought in did not count because he was attacking from the safety of the skies, but their arguments were put down by the others. After all, even the battles Seon-Hyeok fought with his drake on land exceeded what the vast majority of them had participated in.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmph. His only accomplishment is escorting Aria Eisen around. She should get all the credit.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, those blinded by envy did not listen to reason. They ceaselessly belittled Seon-Hyeok, and they did not hesitate in their attempts to undermine his reputation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was not like this from the beginning.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When they first arrived on the front lines, the knights looked forward to the day they would attain their long-deserved fame. Once here, however, all they could hear was the name Drachen. His fame and accomplishments could not be overcome no matter how much they tried, and for the passionate young knights, Seon-Hyeok was just an obstacle in their way.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If only I had a wyvern…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He’s just a foreigner…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their jealousy and envy deepened day by day, and eventually, these whispers reached Seon-Hyeok’s ears.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Aren’t you upset? The Central Knights are allowed to take it easy here and only fight battles they can comfortably win! How dare they speak ill of you…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wait. Aren’t you also a member of the Central Knights?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He looked at the enraged Kim Woo-Young in bewilderment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I might be one of the Central Knights, but I’m also a foreigner and a comrade who fought by your side, my lord. It’d be strange if I sat back while my comrade was being insulted.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After being taught a lesson for his insubordination, Woo-Young had become his ardent supporter. Though Seon-Hyeok himself did not seem to care much for the rumors, Woo-Young raged at the slander.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So did you say something to those knights?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I can’t fight with my comrades, and I don’t have that kind of authority yet…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In short, Woo-Young was all bark and no bite.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So you’re telling me to reprimand them? Knock it off. It’s more embarrassing to fight with allies over something as meaningless as one’s reputation.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Woo-Young looked on awkwardly as Seon-Hyeok clicked his tongue.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But anyways, why are the rumors spreading so quickly?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s because the commander has given an order. Our wartime strategies are to be revisited under the premise of your absence.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In any case, it was fortunate that the rumor had only spread to the knights and mages.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But will you really leave?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Not immediately.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So you are.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course I will. I’m not a warmonger. Haven’t I done more than enough?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Now&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">that</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was irrefutable. Even if the current war dragged on for another decade, there would not be another individual capable of matching his accomplishments. Seon-Hyeok’s contributions in this war were simply overwhelming.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So when will you leave?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m going to take care of some business before I leave.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Woo-Young pressed him about these matters.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I think I’ll be leveling up soon. I’ll leave once I do.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Woo-Young gave a strange expression upon hearing this answer. When Seon-Hyeok frowned and asked why, the knight scratched his cheek as he replied.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You really are a foreigner like the rest of us. I thought you didn’t concern yourself with things like levels.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, I have to level up to survive.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, it was possible to die while trying to raise one’s level, but that would not be the case this time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This mission was solely targeting Noctein facilities. Whether or not they were enemies, Seon-Hyeok did not intend to get even more blood on his hands for the sake of leveling up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, I wish you good luck. If I ever get the opportunity, I’ll make sure to stop by your territory.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Woo-Young expressed his regret that they could not fight side by side again on the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Like I said before, I don’t know if the royal family will let you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok dryly bade farewell and sent Woo-Young away. They said their goodbyes as though they would not ever see each other again, but it turned out that their reunion would come much sooner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“By now, we have all heard that Griffindor’s griffin riders are on their way here, so we will learn how to deal with airborne enemies from Earl Drachen.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All of the knights had complicated expressions upon hearing Commander Mangsk’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Some showed their excitement, while others calmly watched the situation unfold.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“I knew he wouldn’t stand back and let people insult him like that. I&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">thought</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;he was being too calm.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Woo-Young shuddered as he saw the look in Seon-Hyeok’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The knights’ expressions at the onset of training were all different, but soon, they all made the same face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Heok!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What the hell…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dumbfounded, the knights could not shut their mouths as they watched the wyvern drop like a meteor from the sky. The beast’s speed and momentum was incomparable to a mere cavalry charge.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was not a matter of gathering their sword energy and trying to deflect the attack. By the time they sensed the red dot approaching from the distance, the wyvern’s terrifying maw was right in front of their noses.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Again.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok stared at them expressionlessly before ascending into the heavens once again on Redvern’s back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If any of you bring disgrace upon the Central Knights again, I’ll have you sent to the rear.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The senior knight watching the training growled threateningly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">We won’t be beaten so easily again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vowing not to be humiliated again, the knights stared intently at the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the result remained the same. Seon-Hyeok did not give them room to breathe, and it was as though the first run had been nothing more than a warm-up. This time, he even used Wind Piercing to further pressure the defending knights.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though he held back his strength and aimed slightly away from his target, the power of the attack raining down from the sky was anything but weak.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With a tremendous noise, the solid ground exploded, and the knights almost forgot that this was nothing more than a training exercise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I don’t know how the Knights of the Azure Sky fight because I’ve never seen them before, but so long as they’re fighting from the backs of their griffins, you’ll have to keep these kinds of attacks in mind.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With that brief comment, Seon-Hyeok flew up once again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Were the Noctein knights always facing this kind of incredible attack?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The previously zealous knights came to a realization. Their successive victories on the battlefield were not because of their own skills. They were because their opponents could not concentrate on the battle at hand.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Considering there was a monster like this roaming above them, it would have been strange if the&nbsp;</span><span>Nocteins</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;were able to exhibit their full strength.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was the moment that the existing preconceptions of Seon-Hyeok as nothing more than a foreigner with overrated accomplishments were completely blown away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He’s coming! Don’t lose focus!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The five knights forming a group drew their swords and scattered in different directions upon hearing the red star falling with a tremendous roar. They waited for the right moment before unleashing their counterattack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Boom!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A massive shockwave spread out once again, and the area surrounding the knights was decimated. However, this time, their response was respectable.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This time, I’ll attack for real.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But it was too early for them to be relieved. With a single, emotionless comment, Seon-Hyeok flew up yet again. The knights paled as they watched him ascend.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“See? He really is angry.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Woo-Young shuddered once again as he quietly watched Seon-Hyeok’s expressionless face. It was clear he harbored resentment for the knights’ previous actions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The training continued.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Shriek!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Like that, the red meteor repeatedly descended on the knights, and their faces gradually darkened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was practically impossible for the knights to fully adapt to Redvern’s charge. No matter how much they mimicked real combat, Seon-Hyeok could not actually harm his allies, and the knights were likewise limited in the number of times they could use their greatest weapon, sword energy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>However, though the training took place with these restrictions, the knights were incapable of looking down on&nbsp;</span><span>Seon-Hyeok</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;any longer after facing Redvern’s attack dozens of times.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“I now understand what His Majesty meant. I don’t know how strong those Knights of the Azure Sky are, but I’m certain they won’t be as powerful as you. If they had seven knights like you,&nbsp;</span><span>Griffindor</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Kingdom would have long ago been the conquerors of this continent.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Commander Mangsk also exclaimed in admiration as he finally witnessed the red devil’s attack after only hearing about it for so long. Though his words seemed exaggerated, Seon-Hyeok did not feel bad when he heard them. Nonetheless, rather than show excitement at the praise, he explained the advantage the griffin riders had over him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But there isn’t just one Knight of the Azure Sky.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commander nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok faced the Adenburg mages as he trained with the knights.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Standing in place and raining down attacks is our specialty. But more importantly, I think we should focus on our defenses. Can you help us?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The old, gray-haired mage said not to worry about the mages’ counterattack, but instead suggested that the priority would be keeping themselves protected. It was clear the fact that the Noctein&nbsp;</span><span>mages</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;had died in vain without having the chance to retaliate was on his mind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Endure! Maintain the magic at all costs!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How the hell are we supposed to hold on?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Each mage cast his defensive spells, and Seon-Hyeok beat at the barriers until they shattered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If one layer isn’t sufficient, then overlap our defenses!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The mages’ training method was ignorant and excessive, but it also proved to be effective. After discovering that they were individually incapable of stopping his attacks, they were able to cast multiple layers of magic for a more robust defense.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Dragon riders are truly terrifying.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The mages shook their heads after seeing the might of&nbsp;</span><span>Seon-Hyeok’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;lance as it tore through their defenses like it was wet paper.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I think this should be enough. Our mages can work together from here to strengthen our magic, so your attacks won’t be necessary. Thank you for your consideration.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They even enlisted Aria Eisen’s help for preparations, in case the griffin riders were capable of bombing them from the skies.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>-</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">You have leveled up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Around the time the mages finished acclimating themselves to the wyvern’s attacks, Seon-Hyeok received an unexpected message.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>-</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">You have met the requirements for your 3rd class advancement.</span></p>
