 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“… you mean all the foreigners?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s right. There’s one high-tier class and fourteen mid-tiers – that’s a lot of firepower. If they’re supported by the cavalry, they’ll be able to show more strength than the average knight division. I’ll leave them to you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The marquis spoke like he was doing him a favor, but Seon-Hyeok felt as though he was being given an additional burden.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was true that foreigners were the most powerful entities on the battlefield so long as the knights and mages were held back. However, the problem was that these foreigners belonged to the Central Army, and not the Western Army.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you telling me to be their babysitter?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Despite having low-tier classes, the foreigners in the Western Army were battle-tested as a result of repeated&nbsp;</span><span>Noctein</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;invasions. Even if they did not individually make significant contributions in the wars, they had fought, and they had survived. The foreigners in the Central Army were different. They were like flowers grown in the safety of greenhouses, and they had never been exposed to war.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I don’t want to.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Seon-Hyeok frowned and expressed his displeasure with the prospect of commanding these foreigners, the marquis explained why it was necessary.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“If we carelessly send them into this war, they’ll probably all die in their first battle. All the effort the royal family put into their development will have amounted to nothing. Wouldn’t it be better for them to be led by a commander who knows them well&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">and</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;has experience winning in wars?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I don’t want to. I’m here to fight the Nocteins, not to babysit some foreigners.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok had struggled to come to the decision of participating in this war. He had done his best to suppress his disgust and fear. However, there was no way he would now want to watch over some neophytes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I would rather fight with ordinary infantry over the Central Army’s foreigners.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His new title was honorary and lacked the accompanying territorial rewards, but he was still an earl. In addition, he had a great reputation in the area for his significant contributions, and even Marquis Reinhardt could not deal with him recklessly in the western territories.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was now in a position where he could propose his own wartime operations and have a significant influence on strategy. It reflected his rise in status.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Marquis Reinhardt knew this well, and instead of showing displeasure, he tried to cajole the foreigner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But still, you come from the same background. Wouldn’t it be best for a foreigner to lead other foreigners? Who could possibly appreciate them more? You’re the only one qualified for this role.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok answered coldly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So. Am I still ‘just a foreigner’ in the eyes of the royal family?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It sounded like a simple question, but there was a lot of meaning behind his words. Depending on the marquis’ answer, it could mean that all the rewards and titles Seon-Hyeok had been granted so far were nothing more than the royal family’s attempt to placate him, and that no matter how hard he struggled, he would never be treated like those around him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I was assigned to the Western Army immediately following my class change, and I have spent the past couple years here. During that time, I fought in two wars and over 10 battles. I’ve been awarded medals and titles. I never asked for it, but I even got the title of Adenburg’s Spear. I ask again, am I still ‘just a foreigner’ to the royal family?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The marquis seemed to be caught off-guard, not expecting the foreigner to ask this so directly. Seon-Hyeok straightened up as he watched the dumbfounded knight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If the royal family mandates it, I will follow.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh. Let’s talk about this more later.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The marquis blanched and stepped back. After all, he had no other options considering a more forceful approach would do little but alienate the foreigner. Having been told that Seon-Hyeok would only accept if given an irrefutable command, the marquis left the scene.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Will it be okay? He’s a marquis, after all.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Considering what I know of him, it shouldn’t be a problem. He’s not one to take offense to this level of defiance. The only problem…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As he responded to Clark’s question, Seon-Hyeok suddenly looked in the direction the royal princess had disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The only problem is what the royal family’s intentions are.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If the royal family planned on keeping him at an arm’s length and perpetually treating him as just another foreigner, he would have no choice but to lead the others as ordered. In the end, their intentions would determine whether or not he would have an additional burden on his shoulders as he headed into the battlefield.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I came to see you myself, concerned you might misinterpret the marquis’ words and our intentions.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok did not think the princess would come in person. He quickly extended a greeting at her sudden visit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We have already given you the nickname of Adenburg’s Spear and have guaranteed your noble titles. It’s no different from announcing that you are a valued person to the royal family, so please don’t get us wrong and think that you’ll be treated as an outsider.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The royal princess’ expression looked almost disappointed as she explained her position. Her attitude and speech were resolute and dignified as always, but she was puffing out her cheeks like a sulky child. It was endearing, but Seon-Hyeok could not smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s true that I spent time with the other foreigners during the initial training, but my comrades are not them, but rather the riders of the Drake Cavalry and the soldiers of the Western Army. Please allow me to fight alongside them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a terrifying experience for him to ask for something directly from the royal family. No matter how young she might be, she was still the princess.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir Trail told me something.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thankfully, the princess was not angry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“People going to war must be steadfast and resolute. Others who take their resolutions lightly are insulting their honor and will.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hearing the princess’ words, Seon-Hyeok found himself looking behind her. The female knight had been staring at him emotionlessly, but she gave him a slight nod.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I agree with that assessment. I will respect your resolve and withdraw my orders to the marquis.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a sensible decision befitting of a member of the Adenstein royal family. Seon-Hyeok unknowingly breathed a sigh of relief as he thanked her, but his gratitude was premature.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And in place of the withdrawn command, I’ll ask you something else instead. His Majesty has entrusted me with everything, but I am incompetent and unable to find someone more capable than you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She asked the same thing as the marquis – but in the form of a favor and not a command.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I hope you can guide them so that they can develop into those worthy of being your peers.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The attitude and words were different, but in the end, it was the exact same situation. The royal princess was earnestly asking him to take charge of the foreigners. However, despite feeling déjà vu, Seon-Hyeok was not able to coldly reject the request as he had done with the marquis.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Considering that the princess of a nation was lowering herself to make this request, there was no way Seon-Hyeok could refuse.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If you grant me this favor, I will likewise fulfill one of your wishes. I promise you I will do my best, knowing that I am the one responsible for putting this heavier burden on you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will obey the royal princess.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the end, he had no choice but to accept.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will make you one more promise. So long as the foreigners are under your command, I will give you full authority over their life and death. You may feel free to discipline them as necessary.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Fortunately, he was given the authority to manage the foreigners as he wished. In addition, the princess had also promised to grant him a wish in the future, so Seon-Hyeok decided to make the most of this situation and figure out the best way to properly use the foreigners he was now in charge of.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you for your consideration.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The princess gave a satisfied expression upon hearing his response.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The princess looked extremely happy, having given Seon-Hyeok the role of commander of the foreigner division and spent time with Goldrake. Perhaps because of this, she was casually able to ask Asha Trail if she had anything to say.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you have something you’d like to say?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Asha Trail hesitated for a moment before opening her mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You, the royal princess, asked the foreigner for a favor. I think that’s showing enough consideration without also having to promise him something in the future.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Perhaps she was concerned about the excessive favor the princess was showing to Seon-Hyeok. However, the princess did not show any regret.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“His Majesty has always taught me to pay a reasonable price when enlisting the help of others. All I did was faithfully follow that advice. And also, don’t you think he was being commendable? The earl was willing to accept a responsibility he didn’t want for my sake, and he deserves to be rewarded.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To be honest, it would not have seemed unusual for Seon-Hyeok, an earl and knight of the kingdom, to follow the will of the royal princess. However, the princess seemed pleased as she spoke, and Asha shut her mouth after apologizing for her presumptuousness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“In the past, when His Majesty offered to grant him a wish, he asked for something completely unexpected and made a fool of Marquis Reinhardt. I’m already looking forward to hearing what he will ask of me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The princess grinned in excitement. However, after a while, her expression grew heavy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But all that joy will come only once this war is over, so I will have to hope that he returns safely.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The princess’ words seemed strange, and Asha Trail’s expression hardened. The female knight was worried that the royal princess was showing excessive attention to the Drake Knight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, she was a knight of few words, and she wordlessly followed her liege.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The forces set to participate in the upcoming war were determined before Seon-Hyeok arrived at Fort Mangsk. They would consist of two infantry regiments and three cavalry companies from the Western Army, as well as three additional cavalry companies from the Central Army that had accompanied the princess to the border.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Among them, it was mostly the cavalry that would be crossing into&nbsp;</span><span>Noctein</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;territory. The infantry regiments would be responsible for causing chaos at the border, keeping the Noctein forces in check so that they could not be deployed at will. In essence, the strategy was not much different from the one used by the Nocteins in their invasions of the Adenburg Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Earl Seon-Hyeok Rheinperle Kim Drachen will be commanding the heavy cavalry companies of the Central Army.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As a brilliant contributor in the preceding wars, Seon-Hyeok was given command over the Central Army’s cavalry. However, the cavalry unit did not consist of a single company, but all of the riders within the Central Army. Thus, it was as though the company commander was being elevated to regimental commander for the duration of the war.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was not particularly strange. Wittenfeld Royen Mangsk, the commander-in-chief of the upcoming operation, held the title of earl. Since Seon-Hyeok now had the same noble rank, it was not equitable for him to lead a single company.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will do my best.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok belatedly realized that his status now was too great to be a simple company commander. He looked a bit worried as he assumed this additional responsibility.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Just keep doing what you’ve been doing. All that’s changed is that there are a few more riders under your command. I’m confident you will be able to lead them well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Having given Seon-Hyeok half of the cavalry forces, Commander Mangsk said he would do his best to cause a disturbance along the border using the infantry regiments. In a way, it could have been interpreted as the commander trying to stay safe in the rear while sending his subordinates into danger, but none of the leaders here seemed to think so.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unlike the cavalry, capable of freely roaming about in enemy territory, infantry regiments, by nature, had to remain in one place and would become the constant target for enemy attacks. In addition, they could be called on at any moment to support the invading cavalry, and thus, their role in this war was of paramount importance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“When we begin, I plan on hitting here first.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s a suitable area for both invading and retreating. If we can get a foothold there, even in the worst case scenario, we’ll be able to get the support of the troops stationed at Mangsk.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A map of the entire western territories was sprawled out in front of them, and the strategic meeting began. The participating commanders racked their brains to devise a plan and find any potential weaknesses.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Naturally, Seon-Hyeok was required to attend. It was true that others would be coordinating the operations, but in case of emergency, he would be responsible for the life and death of half the cavalry crossing into&nbsp;</span><span>Noctein</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;territory.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well done. We’ll be able to come up with a better picture if we work at this a bit more. It seems like we’ve become too accustomed to defensive wars – it’s difficult figuring out a plan of attack.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Mangsk commander let out a groan as the meeting ended. However, the remark sounded like an exaggeration to Seon-Hyeok. He knew full well how meticulously they were planning this upcoming invasion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Contrary to what Commander Mangsk said, the geographic and troop-layout information that Fort Mangsk’s intelligence units had provided was thoroughly prepared and mindful of any potential counterattack into Noctein territory. It was clear that the Nocteins would be caught off-guard by the sudden invasion into their lands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“More importantly, how are you doing? I heard you’ve been facing some difficulties lately. How are your responsibilities coming along?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I didn’t know that the Central Army would be so proud and combative. It’s like dealing with someone who’s completely stuck in his ways.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’d be nice if the marquis said a word, but then again, he’s not one to do that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok was not sure whether it was because of their pride as the last bastion of defense for the kingdom or because of the elitist attitude of heavy cavalry riders in general, but the soldiers recently placed under his command were uncooperative.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There isn’t much time until the operation begins, so shouldn’t you do something about it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The ordinary riders, at the very least, pretended to accept and follow his commands. The actual problem was with the company commanders and foreigners of each cavalry company. They blatantly tried to keep his authority in check and antagonize him, and it was giving Seon-Hyeok headaches.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I was actually planning to do so starting today.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, Seon-Hyeok was not soft enough to sit back and watch such behavior ahead of the upcoming war. He had been readying himself for a confrontation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Have you thought of a way?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Commander Mangsk expressed his curiosity, Seon-Hyeok replied, saying there was nothing to think about.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll have to get rid of the head first.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“By head, you mean the foreigners. It won’t be easy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok laughed when he heard the commander’s concerns.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“The royal princess gave me full authority over their lives and deaths. If not now, when will I ever be able to exercise that power?”</span></p>
