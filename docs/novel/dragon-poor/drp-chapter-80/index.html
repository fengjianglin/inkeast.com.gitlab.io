 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were no scouting or spying operations of any kind. This was indicative of the sheer speed of the Drake Cavalry. They ran in one direction and one direction only -- that direction was towards Seon-Hyeok as he rode on Goldrake.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Reduce the speed of the troops.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A while after leaving the barracks, Seon-Hyeok reduced his cavalry’s speed for the first time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Stop in place.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the quiet command, Clark loudly repeated the words to deliver the instructions to the rear of the cavalry before shutting his mouth. The cavalry had naturally stopped with Seon-Hyeok, as they had only been chasing after the drake this entire time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Take a break while mounted.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>They didn’t ride to their fullest ability, but even so, they couldn’t help but feel fatigued after wearing heavy iron armor all day. At&nbsp;</span><span>Seon-Hyeok’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;command, the riders shook their wrists that had been clutching the horses’ reins, loosening their stiff joints and checking on the condition of their mounts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are there enemies nearby?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the sudden order to take a break, Clark approached to ask.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There are 50 cavalry riders heading south from the northwest. At this rate, we’ll catch up to the enemy’s rear.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s the plan?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The rest of the cavalry perked up their ears.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you mean, what’s the plan?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok answered with a determined voice while looking around at his cavalry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We’ll crush them all.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At his words, the short rest ended, and the riders picked up the weapons placed in their saddles.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We’ll smash into the enemy’s rear, then take care of their main forces. Use whatever weapons you see fit, but prioritize mobility. The squad in front will be responsible for taking down the enemy’s rear.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It wasn’t an easy task for heavy cavalry to chase down and annihilate the faster light cavalry, especially those who had taken care to travel even lighter than usual. Nonetheless, none stepped up to question his command.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The trust in the new company commander was simply that great.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At his command, the riders slowly began to move. Interestingly, the sound of horses’ hooves, which would normally have traveled far across the wide plains, remained within the immediate area before disappearing. Even stranger, the dust clouds that usually formed when the cavalry moved scattered quickly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘As you command.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was all thanks to Atiya, the low-tier wind spirit. The enemy would likely be unaware of the approaching cavalry until they reached the troops’ immediate vicinity. And by that point, the Drake Cavalry would be in optimal condition, fully prepared and ready to charge at a moment’s notice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was as expected. The enemy’s rear forces, moving separately from their main unit, did not notice them until they were within line of sight. By this point, the vanguard of the Drake Cavalry was charging towards them, spears extended, and the Nocteins were unable to speed up and evade the attack. They were skewered and exterminated on the spot.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was all as Seon-Hyeok intended. He used the occasional hills found on the sprawling plains to thoroughly hide the movements of his troops, and as a result, he was able to easily deal with the enemy’s rearguard.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok subconsciously furrowed his brow as he noticed the smell of blood coming from the leading squad when they rejoined the Drake Cavalry. He had experienced this many times in the past, but he couldn’t get used to the foul scent.&nbsp;</span><span>Before, he had been intoxicated by the smell, losing his focus in the process. However, it was different now. Having endured two battles, several duels, and the experience in&nbsp;</span><span>Rugenburg</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, Seon-Hyeok had grown, and he was no longer easily shaken as he was before.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Cavalry. Begin moving again.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hearing his orders, the drake, crouched on the ground until this point, raised himself up. The cavalry began to follow.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">How long had they been crossing the plains like this?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Drake Cavalry ran into the southbound enemy light cavalry, still unaware that their rearguard had already been overwhelmed. The Noctein forces were shocked to see their enemies appear without warning, and they completely lost their minds at the sight of the giant monster at the forefront.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing this enemy cavalry unit that didn’t dare engage in combat but instead sought to pivot and immediately ride away, Seon-Hyeok whispered a quick command.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Goldie! Roar!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Goldie had been biting down and holding back until this point, but he let loose at the issued command.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Roar!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Upon hearing the monster’s roar spread throughout the plains, the enemy cavalry became rooted in place even as they tried to escape.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The horses screamed and reared up, and the riders lightly holding onto their reins were immediately thrown off their mounts. The remaining cavalry tried to calm down their horses, but by the time they barely managed to succeed, the lead riders of the Drake Cavalry had already approached.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Charge!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok gave a quick command, looking down at the ranks of the enemy cavalry entangled in a giant mess. His riders lunged forward with the spears tucked under their arms.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The first to reach the enemy, of course, was Seon-Hyeok riding Goldrake.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">An enemy rider, having fallen from his horse and in a daze, looked towards him with a blank expression. His sanity seemed to have completely deserted him at the sight of the terrifying monster.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Crack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Goldrake trampled over the rider without mercy. The drake was able to crush the human with his huge body, without having to exert any force or lower his body. At the same time, he turned his long neck to hit the adjacent rider.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The brave&nbsp;</span><span>Noctein</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;cavalryman clutched his weapon and looked to attack, but he was thrown into the air after being headbutt by the drake. One look at the rider’s badly crushed chest was all Seon-Hyeok needed to know that it was an instant death.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Roar!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unleashed for the first time in a while, Goldrake roared ferociously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clark had kept his distance from the drake to avoid being swept up in the tail swinging in all directions, and he unknowingly lost his grip on his spear as he watched.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What the hell…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He saw the drake going on a rampage, biting and tearing apart enemies on all sides. The enemy riders showed no will to resist in front of the wild monster, and they were trampled, torn to shreds, and slaughtered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ack!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“S, save me!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Noctein soldier stared blankly at the monster with his spear limply pointed down. He was trampled by Goldrake without being able to attack a single time. The soldier next to him, crying out in anguish at his comrade’s death, lunged forward, only to be snapped in half by the drake’s powerful jaw.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Before they knew it, Clark and the riders had stopped to stare at the scene.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is a nightmare…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the midst of the massacre, a soldier had gone insane and begun muttering to himself. He seemed to have lost his mind watching his comrades being slaughtered by monsters. The soldier wished to wake up from the nightmare, but the only ending offered by the nightmare was death.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The monster stamped his foot repeatedly over the crushed soldier as he turned into a formless mass.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ack!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All that could be heard were screams and roars, and the brave Drake Cavalry let out a groan at the unimaginable sight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is the Dra…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The riders&nbsp;</span><span>reveled</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;at this new way of fighting, which went completely against cavalry principles. Their terrifying charge broke into the thick of the enemy units, where they were able to break the enemy ranks from inside out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Focus! Block their retreat from the back forward! Those in front, stand your ground!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clark shouted at the men watching the battle blankly to block any possible enemy retreat. It was a necessary command, but in the end, the instruction proved meaningless.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Drake Cavalry and the monster didn’t allow a single Noctein rider to escape.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Urgent news!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commander had been standing by, aware that there were skirmishes occurring daily, and his expression stiffened as he saw the approaching messenger. He worried that another village had burned down, or that the Adenburg infantry had suffered additional losses.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But contrary to the commander’s concerns, the messenger’s expression was bright.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The Drake Cavalry has destroyed a group of 50 enemy cavalry!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The&nbsp;</span><span>Mangsk</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;commander pumped his fist at the news.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh! Viscount Drachen!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And allied losses?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commander cut off the cheering listeners and asked about the damage dealt to his own forces. When the messenger exclaimed there were no losses with a flushed face, the commander cheered alongside the others.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Urgent news!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even before the Adenburg command had a moment to truly celebrate the victory, another messenger came to deliver news. The atmosphere within the command, which had become heated by the rare good news, quickly became subdued.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, it was good news once again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Our forces have emerged victorious over 25 enemy cavalry!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The command center cheered at the news of victory after victory, and the messenger continued his report.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Seven infantry companies from the 24th Regiment quickly clearing the area and advancing.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“By the 24th Regiment, you mean…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was the Drake Cavalry that had split off from the 24th Regiment to operate independently. Naturally, if the infantry from the conservatively-led 24th were advancing, the reason behind this change was obvious.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s Viscount Drachen’s Drake Cavalry that engaged the enemy!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As expected!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their expectations proved correct, and the command center grew excited about the birth of their new savior.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We have suffered no losses! The enemy cavalry has been completely destroyed!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Once again, the allied troops did not suffer any casualties. Even considering the fact that the Drake Cavalry was more heavily armed than the enemy, such a result was unprecedented.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Messengers continued to arrive the following day, all reporting on the victories won by the Drake Cavalry. The number of enemy riders Seon-Hyeok’s company eliminated was now more than enough to make up an entire regiment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then it should be safe to say that the situation deep within our borders has been taken care of.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Even for the more mobile&nbsp;</span><span>Noctein</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;soldiers, it was unreasonable to penetrate too deep into enemy territory. As a result, the number of enemies disrupting the situation far within the Adenburg borders was not particularly large, and they had been completely annihilated by the Drake Cavalry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The problem going forward was the territory between the now stable lands far within the kingdom and Fort Mangsk. There were four regiments’ worth of enemy cavalry currently operating within this area, and the reports of villages being looted and infantry suffering heavy casualties did not show signs of ending.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We’ll be able to breathe a bit if we can hold out a little longer.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, even this bleak situation was gradually improving. The more the Drake Cavalry handled the situation in the rear, the more restricted the enemy cavalry’s activities became.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Commander! Urgent news!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commander frowned as he saw the messenger approach. Unlike the others before him, this messenger had a stiff expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The scattered enemy cavalry has gathered together and are moving east!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If they’re grouped together, what are their current numbers?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the advisor’s question, the messenger responded, face completely pale.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Three regiments at the very least! Possibly as many as four regiments!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the response, the advisors at the command center all jumped to their feet.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If it’s that many…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s over 90 percent of the enemy forces currently within our borders.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hearing this, the commander flew into a fit of rage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What the hell are the patrols even doing? Why weren’t they aware of the enemy’s movements?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The patrols are already working their horses beyond their limits in an attempt to prevent the enemy cavalry from looting and plundering the villages. Given the sheer size of the front lines, they were forced to loosen up with their scouting, and the enemy was able to find a gap.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Mangsk commander muttered to himself as the advisor offered an excuse. After all, it was his idea to protect the entire frontier. His mobile forces had been worked to their limit and had inevitably shown weakness to the enemy.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He couldn’t blame anyone else at this point.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How much time is needed for our forces to regroup?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“At least four days, and that’s just the time necessary to gather the cavalry spread out on the front lines. However, that’ll be barely enough to keep the Noctein forces in check. If we want to completely drive them out, we’ll need three infantry regiments as well, which will take a minimum of 10 days.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At one point, they had hoped the enemy would group together. If the Nocteins had done so, the Adenburg forces could have finished the war with a single decisive battle. However, the situation now was completely different.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commander had tried his best to prevent the scattering of the enemy forces, but when he finally stopped to look at the forest instead of the trees, his own regiment had also been divided into multiple groups and distributed along the front lines. It would take some time to gather the troops needed to deal with the unified enemy cavalry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They got the better of us. This might’ve been what they were after from the start.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>If the&nbsp;</span><span>Nocteins</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;were fielding a cavalry army the size of four companies, even an infantry regiment would be trampled in an instant in battle. In other words, it meant that it would be almost impossible to stop the enemy, no matter where they were headed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But I don’t understand. There’s nothing for them to gain even if they gather their troops like that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The enemy’s movements meant that the western territories were in immediate danger, but the nobles ruling these lands were battle-hardened soldiers. Even if they suffered heavy losses in the war, they would endure and eventually rebuild their territories. History had already shown the tenacious vitality of the western nobles.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Could they be targeting the breadbasket in the center of the kingdom…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s impossible. Even if they were able to raid the kingdom’s granaries, there’s no way they could leave unscathed. No, they wouldn’t be able to get past the Central Army in the first place.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The power of the Central Army protecting the heart of the kingdom was formidable. They were the kingdom’s elites, and the last bastion in case the front lines were ever breached. The royal knights and mages were all affiliated with this army.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No matter how reluctant the kingdom was to use their superhuman individuals, they wouldn’t spare their strength against an enemy that had invaded deep into their lands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But what could they be after then? They couldn’t possibly have caused all that chaos just to raid some border villages?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Those at the command center wondered about the situation, and the commander suddenly realized when exactly the enemy’s movements suddenly changed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It can’t be? They sent four regiments’ worth of cavalry just to beat one…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One of the aides seemed to have the same idea, as he inadvertently spoke up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s not just any cavalry. It’s the cavalry that destroyed the Sasteins, the pride of the Noctein Kingdom.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The enemy had been waiting for the right moment, and now, they gathered to target the Drake Cavalry. It was indisputable that the Nocteins’ motive was revenge.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Where’s Viscount Drachen right now?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The last we heard, he joined up with the 22nd Regiment to regroup.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Uh. This isn’t good.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At that moment, Seon-Hyeok was staying at the 22nd Regiment garrison to recover from the fatigue of multiple battles, and he froze upon noticing hostile forces approaching from all directions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">When had they grouped together?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was able to sense at least three regiments’ worth of enemies, and some of the enemies felt particularly ominous. His body was screaming at him to retreat.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, he couldn’t.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, eat this.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you, ma’am.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>There were people from the nearby villages who had fled the Noctein invaders, wounded soldiers recovering in the garrison, and two infantry regiments left behind to protect them. If Seon-Hyeok wanted to run away, he would have to leave them all behind.</span></p>
