 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Aria Eisen repeatedly gathered and released clumps of dirt, like a child playing with Play-Doh. Her appearance as she constantly muttered unidentifiable spells under her breath and kneaded the soil was so bizarre that Seon-Hyeok could not bear to look. He felt like he was staring at a crazy person.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even though he wanted to step forth and say something, Seon-Hyeok just watched the mage be engrossed in her work.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After a while, the clump of mud assumed a humanoid form.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Its head was too large, and the lengths of its limbs were all different. The clay doll crafted by Aria Eisen was horribly unattractive and hideous.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok realized that Aria Eisen’s incantations had stopped as he looked at the results of her work. Likewise, the mage’s hands had stopped their busy movements.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Blink. Blink.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When he turned his head, he saw Aria Eisen looking at him, still squatting down on the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was momentarily at a loss.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Should I apologize for entering without authorization? Or maybe reprimand her for ignoring her lord’s call?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Look.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Before he could reach a decision, Aria Eisen suddenly lifted up the mud doll from the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s a low-tier arbeiter. It’s a prototype.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Had she grown attached to it after working on it the entire day?</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok could not help but sigh as she introduced the doll and even gave it a name.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir Eisen.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was fully aware that mages were rare and eccentric, but now that he thought about it, there was no benefit to having her around. He tried to keep a straight face as he called her name.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you think I came all the way here to get a doll like this…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok was determined to break her habit, but he could not even finish his words and made a ridiculous expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Click. Click.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The mud doll perched on Aria Eisen’s palm began to awkwardly move its limbs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is this…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok’s eyes grew wide as he wordlessly stared at the little mud doll moving on its own, and the mage slowly put the arbeiter down.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tap. Tap.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As if trying to show off its strength, the small doll grabbed the leg of a chair and lifted it up. However, perhaps because of the significant difference in size, the doll’s arms were unable to bear the weight of the chair and fell off.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is just a prototype. If you give me the materials and time, I can make one even larger than a human.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Aria Eisen wiped her mud-covered palms on her dirtied robes and rose from her spot. Her usually hazy eyes twinkled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>At this moment, Seon-Hyeok’s mind raced. Lifting the chair was undeniably the&nbsp;</span><span>arbeiter’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;attempt to show off its purpose.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You said that arbeiter is low-tier. Does that mean there are mid and high-tier ones as well?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Aria Eisen nodded without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok stepped forward at her curt and disrespectful response towards her lord.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I will inform Sir Montaigne. Give him the list of necessary materials.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The mage’s typically disagreeable expression filled with warmth like a spring breeze. At the same time, Seon-Hyeok saw the arbeiter wandering around the laboratory despite missing its arms, and he smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll take this.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Aria Eisen seemed to have lost interest in the already ruined arbeiter, and she fiddled around with a new clump of dirt. Seeing this, Seon-Hyeok quietly left the laboratory.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Isn’t this amazing?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was certain. If he could utilize these arbeiters well, the possibilities were endless.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Seon-Hyeok showed Antoine Montaigne the arbeiter, the administrator, after previously treating the mage as deadweight, quickly changed his attitude. The old scholar knew better than anyone that the territory was lacking in able workers, and he immediately began to plan large-scale projects to make use of the earthen creations.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We must hasten the development of flood-control projects and irrigation facilities that we put off due to the lack of manpower. At the moment, our territory is too vulnerable to natural disasters such as droughts and floods. At the same time, we need to work on the estate, build roads…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Despite his old age, Antoine Montaigne’s eyes shone with motivation. As the old scholar was entrusted with the management of Rheinperle, Seon-Hyeok quickly gave him full authority over these plans, and Antoine Montaigne quickly headed towards Aria Eisen’s laboratory to confirm the necessary materials.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Left alone in the office, Seon-Hyeok gave a satisfied expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Through his time with the royal examiner, Einst Jeneger, Seon-Hyeok had learned how well-educated mages were. As such, he had always hoped there would one day be a proper mage in his territory.&nbsp;</span><span>Einst</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;himself was knowledgeable, but his actual magical ability was unexceptional.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This had probably been the catalyst for bringing the unsocial and eccentric Aria Eisen to Rheinperle. Bringing her back had truly been a stroke of luck.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though the Rheinperle mine was now operating properly and the land’s finances became more stable, there were a number of infrastructure projects that he had not even been able to dream about. Seon-Hyeok could finally see these becoming reality.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, this process did not prove to be easy. Arbeiter creation, even low-tier ones, was a field that required significant magical skill, and Aria Eisen had gone through a long period of trial and error to successfully produce a single prototype. The resources spent during this process were so enormous that he wondered whether it’d be better to simply hire another laborer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Any average, rural lord would have gone bankrupt, unable to shoulder this incredible financial burden. However, Seon-Hyeok was able to endure the financial drain because his silver and iron mines had begun to produce tangible monetary gains. The rewards he received from the royal family likewise lessened the burden.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My lord. I wonder whether this kind of investment is worth it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Antoine Montaigne had fully backed Aria Eisen for a while, but he had since cooled off on his support and voiced his concerns.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s consider this an investment for the future and trust her a bit longer.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok soothed the elderly scholar.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This world was largely disinterested in the development of science and technology. It was a world of magic and transcendental forces, and as such, the people had endured for all these years by passing on any necessary tasks to these superhuman beings.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">These predispositions were true even of the wise scholar, and he suggested that it would be more efficient to make use of Aria Eisen during times of need.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What use is it to call on a mage who doesn’t answer my summons?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, Seon-Hyeok had recently come to realize how difficult mages were to deal with. It was better to spend the financial resources to produce arbeiters and use them for construction projects, rather than to try and persuade the capricious mage to help herself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had always held the old scholar’s opinions in high regard, but he remained adamant on this matter. Not long after, his stubbornness showed its rewards, as news arrived regarding the completion of the promised arbeiter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh. Hm.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His first impression of the completed arbeiter was abject disappointment. Its rickety form was no different from that of the prototype – the only difference was its increased size. Seon-Hyeok could not help but feel discouraged.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, this disappointment disappeared once he saw the arbeiter in motion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok exclaimed at the sight of the arbeiter easily lifting a massive piece of wood that would ordinarily require ten people to move.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s complete, but there’s still room for improvement. If I’m able to better balance its body and use stronger materials, I can create an arbeiter capable of building a castle by itself.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Aria Eisen was naturally quiet and spoke only when necessary, but even she could not hide her excitement while giving a demonstration.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That much?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, Aria Eisen was ignorant of the world, and her boasts might be unrealistic, but it demonstrated her confidence in these constructs. She spoke at length about how excellent arbeiters were as workers, and how they never got tired until the end of their lifespan.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, she omitted the most important information – information about the arbeiters’ life expectancy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So how long can they work?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok asked, unable to hold back his curiosity. Aria Eisen confidently responded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Three days.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Three days?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His smile disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">All those resources went into producing an arbeiter that only lasts three days?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sir Montaigne. How much does it cost to produce one arbeiter?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“At least 70 gold.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This estimate even took into consideration the trial and error required for Aria Eisen’s first attempt. Seon-Hyeok was taken aback. The amount spent on this worker that lasted all of three days was enough to maintain two skilled cavalry riders.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“In that case, if the arbeiter is put to work for three days and nights without rest, how much labor do we get out of it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s like having ten people work in shifts, so in total, it would be the equivalent of employing twenty workers for three days. Of course, if we then consider that the arbeiter doesn’t get tired and other potential circumstances, it might be closer to having forty or fifty men.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And how much would they cost?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Assuming they’re experienced workers, approximately 1 gold and 20 silvers.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At this point, even Aria Eisen looked nervously at her lord after boasting of her arbeiters. She lacked social skills and was single-minded in her pursuits, but she was not a fool. It was easy to understand what the lord was trying to say.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“With improvements, the arbeiters’ life expectancy can be increased by up to three times its current length. In addition, they don’t have to be discarded after use. With a little bit of additional resources, they can be brought back to life and put to work once again.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That ‘little resource’ is approximately one gold.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok sighed upon hearing Montaigne’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So you’re saying that if we want to make a profit, until they’ve been upgraded, we’ll have to recycle them hundreds of times.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had invested in her with high expectations, so considering the sorry state of the current results, all he could think about was trying to recoup some of the costs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So you won’t be funding me anymore?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok grew angry. Even in this situation, Aria Eisen brazenly cared only about her research funds.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“You’ve spent nearly 1,000 gold to date, and this is all you have to show for it. You’re worried about&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">funding</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The situation would not have been so dire if he had just listened to Antoine Montaigne when the scholar first tried to dissuade his patronage of the mage. Seon-Hyeok berated himself – he must have deluded himself with fantasies about mages.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I can make things better!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’re just going to ask for more research funding.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Money, money, and even more money. Mages were truly money drains. Seon-Hyeok almost admired how the royal family was able to patiently support hundreds of these financial black holes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Go back to your laboratory for now. I’ll consider the situation for a few days before making a decision.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He started to get a headache. He was beginning to realize why scientists in the other world were treated so poorly, and why they were constantly pressured to find funding. Groundbreaking results were only possible through long and hard work, and in his opinion, he himself lacked the patience and resources to see the projects through.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, I’ll take the arbeiter for now.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Aria Eisen had tried to sneak away with the arbeiter, but was now on the verge of tears. Seon-Hyeok wanted to berate her even more for her impudence. Instead, he just waved her off angrily.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“… everything would be fine if I had that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Aria Eisen muttered something under her breath as she backed away. Seon-Hyeok immediately called her back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Say that again.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I didn’t say anything.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The mage looked dispirited, as though aware of how financially reckless her research had been. Looking at her, Seon-Hyeok realized that mages only pretended to be tactless, but, in reality, were just as smart, if not smarter, than everyone else.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">It’s not that they’re tactless. They just don’t care.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No. I’m not trying to reprimand you. I just want to know what you said.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her attitude was not important right now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Aria Eisen did not respond hastily. She thought that her lord was trying to find fault with her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So, repeat what you just said. What is it that you needed?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Pressed once again, the mage, looking resigned to her fate, responded indifferently.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I said everything would be fine if I had spirits.”</span></p>
