 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After crossing through a treacherous grassy area, the party arrived at a rocky, open space. And finally, they saw a tall peak covered in a thick layer of frost.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is as far as we can guide you. Nobody has ever been up there before.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The hunter’s expression seemed to ask what was so important on this white peak that they had to go through all this trouble to get here. However, he didn’t bother asking. He had completed his duties, and he wanted to be done with everything.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was already getting dark, however, so they all decided to spend another day at the outdoor campsite.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I can’t go with you either. Why the hell do you need to go up there?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After helping the soldiers set up camp, Hansen looked up at the towering peak and shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There’s something I need to find, and it’s supposed to be there.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is? No, rather, who told you?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok simply replied that nothing was certain yet, and that he would explain after he finished his mission. As usual, Hansen accepted the response and asked no further questions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You, you can get up there?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen simply worried about how Seon-Hyeok would ascend the path-less cliff.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll have to try.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok answered in the affirmative, but he also felt uneasy. Until now, the hunters had skillfully found the correct paths and guided them, but he would have to go alone from here on out. Looking up at the peak, which rose up straight like a spear, he wondered how he’d climb up the mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, I’m sure it’ll work out somehow.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Camp preparations essentially meant nothing more than keeping the fire from going out in the biting wind. There was no tent in this world that was both sturdy and light enough to take on such a treacherous mountain trip, and all they could rely on were shabby sleeping bags.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">These sleeping bags, made from the fur of an unidentifiable animal, were each made for two. As baggage needed to be minimized, this was more efficient than preparing individual sleeping arrangements, and it also allowed people to compensate for a lack of warmth by relying on each other’s body temperature. Until now, Seon-Hyeok had endured the nights by sharing a sleeping bag with one of the hunters.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But the wrong person joined him today.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Excuse me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“W, what are you doing!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok panicked as Anne suddenly jumped into his sleeping bag.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hansen’s sleeping bag is over there!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I can’t share one with Hansen anymore. He’s too big – I thought I’d die of discomfort.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Answering casually, Anne skillfully settled down in his sleeping bag without giving him the opportunity to stop her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But, to come here…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m the baron’s precious daughter. Do you think I should share a sleeping bag with the hunters or soldiers over there? There’ll be strange rumors going around…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But I’m also a stranger!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok looked over at Hansen’s sleeping bag. It seemed as though he had already paired up with someone else, as snoring could be heard from under the lumpy animal fur.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hiik!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the brief moment he looked away, a hand, cold from the biting wind, hugged at his chest, and a strong thigh grabbed his waist. Seon-Hyeok tried to pull himself away from the unfamiliar touch, and he heard a whisper from behind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, I should’ve done this sooner. It’s so much better.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was the voice of a traveler who had finally found a place to rest after a long journey. Seon-Hyeok unknowingly relaxed at the soothing voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">But&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">why.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why are you breathing into my ears?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Why was she whispering into my ears breathlessly?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Me? When?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Anne even whispered these words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Just go to sleep. I’m going to sleep too.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Anne wriggled around a bit more, then settled down. Seon-Hyeok froze, unable to do anything, and time passed. His tired body wanted to fall asleep, but his mind was becoming strangely clear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And as this happened, he more clearly felt the soft touch on his back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Ah, this is driving me crazy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>If he hadn’t heard her&nbsp;</span><span>words from earlier in</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;the day, he would’ve been more accepting of her unexpected visit(?). However, he couldn’t do so after hearing her claim that she’d break him down.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m going to break him down. I’m going to break him down. I’m going to break him down. I’m going to break him down…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her voice repeatedly echoed in his head. At this point, he couldn’t help but wonder if she had meant for him to hear those words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Get a hold of yourself! She’s a female Hansen!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok tried to calm down, but his frustration would not go away. Even so, the fatigue from three days of travel eventually overcame his racing mind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He probably would have fallen asleep, were it not for Anne twisting and turning in her sleep.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok unknowingly groaned, but then immediately shut his mouth in surprise. At that moment, he heard Anne’s voice from behind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Can’t fall asleep?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok froze once again as he felt her warm breath.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I know a good way to fall asleep.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Anne moved her hand as she spoke, and Seon-Hyeok, startled, immediately grabbed her wrist.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Y, you can’t do that. Hansen and I are like brothers.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He blurted out in surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’re like brothers, but you’re not actually.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There are other people here, you can’t…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Just call me Anne. And speak quieter. What are you going to do if the others wake up?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So you should stop…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He glanced at Hansen’s sleeping bag upon hearing her words. Thankfully, nobody seemed to have heard their conversation over the fierce wind blowing through the campground. All that could be heard were the sound of wind and the occasional snoring.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As you saw, there aren’t many people in our territory.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the meantime, Anne suddenly began to explain the situation in her land. Because there were so few people living there, there weren’t many who weren’t at least distantly related to one another. Because of this, the lord’s family always sought partners from outside their territory, and she was no different.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The nobles from the capital always talk about consolidating their bloodline, but that’s not the case with us.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In a way, it was unfortunate. As a noblewoman, it would be difficult for Anne to travel freely to find a suitable partner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen’s family had been testing the waters, but it seemed they weren’t doing so for any political benefit. Seon-Hyeok was almost convinced.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had lived an austere life before coming to this world, and his situation had not changed here. Naturally, he longed for material wealth, and Anne was an attractive woman difficult for such a person to resist. However,</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She held his face in her hands and leaned in, but her face too closely resembled someone he knew.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When he saw her face, he was able to regain his composure.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, Anne was too persistent to hold off that easily, and the sleeping bag was too small.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Stay still.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please stop.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Still, Seon-Hyeok held out desperately for his life. And like that, the night passed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ughhhh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As always, the campgrounds were active before the sun came out. Hansen, stretching with a groan, found Seon-Hyeok and approached to greet him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How are you doing? Did you sleep… oh, I guess not.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The area under Seon-Hyeok’s eyes was dark as death, and his cheeks were hollow. His eyes, having lost their focus, shook as though caught in a typhoon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Male Hansen. Female Hansen.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you talking about?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen frowned at Seon-Hyeok, seemingly completely out of his mind, and called to Anne, who was just getting up in the back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why’s this guy like this?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you mean, this guy? I know he’s a rider like you, but isn’t that a bit inconsiderate?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Anne strangely seemed to be defending Seon-Hyeok, and the foreigner jumped up and muttered something about needing to pack his bags.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s going on? It can’t be…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The atmosphere was so awkward that even the tactless Hansen could notice something was up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is there something wrong with his body?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I don’t think so.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then why isn’t he falling for me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Anne tilted her head as though she couldn’t understand, and Hansen made the same expression. They looked so unbelievably alike. The siblings would probably never understand why Seon-Hyeok refused her advances.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, I’ve set things up at least. There’s still the trip back.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen cheered Anne on as she said words that would horrify Seon-Hyeok if he had heard.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The night was eventful, but the upcoming schedule did not change. Seon-Hyeok said goodbye to the group for the time being as he took the ropes and climbing equipment handed to him by the hunter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Come back if it ever gets too rough. I don’t know what’s up there, but nothing’s more important than life.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s the plan.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After Hansen said his goodbyes, Anne approached him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Take care.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Okay.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Anne embraced him as he hesitantly responded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You haven’t seen the last of me yet.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok didn’t respond – he immediately headed towards the Frost Peak as though he was running away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Climbing the peak was not easy. It was even more challenging for&nbsp;</span><span>Seon-Hyeok</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, who had never climbed in his life. However, he was able to secure his rope with Atiya’s help, and he made progress thanks to his high strength stat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After a day of struggling, he had barely managed to get halfway up the peak.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sigh.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok found a suitable ledge and sat along the edge. Seeing his stiff limbs and knotted muscles, it seemed as though he wouldn’t be able to make further progress today.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He found a number of protruding rocks around him and tied himself into place. After a while, he was finally able to catch his breath and look up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s so damn high.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He couldn’t yet see what was at the top of the peak, but his senses kept provoking him. At this distance, even if the dragon hadn’t said anything to him before, he’d be able to tell something major was at the summit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After looking up for a while, Seon-Hyeok suddenly tilted his head in confusion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wait. If drakes can’t fly, how did it get up there in the first place?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, there was no point in wondering. Eventually, he began to climb again. His palms were torn and blistering, but he refused to give up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Be careful.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok lost his footing as he suffered a lapse in concentration. If Atiya hadn’t supported him in a timely manner, he might have fallen to his death.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a hair-raising experience, and he gritted his teeth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was still a long way to go, and he began to wonder why he was going through this crazy trial. Even if he didn’t locate the drake, his abilities as a dragon rider remained excellent and left little to be desired.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok wanted to give up. However, it was too late to go back down again, and he felt dizzy just looking down.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At this point, it was better to just look upwards and continue climbing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After barely hanging on, Seon-Hyeok finally managed to reach his destination.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The drake he had been looking for was there.</span></p>
