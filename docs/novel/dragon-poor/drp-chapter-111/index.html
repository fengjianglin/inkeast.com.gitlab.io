 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though she had overcome the aftereffects of the energy drain, Aria Eisen still looked to be in poor shape. Her previously golden hair was now white like that of an old woman’s, and her young face seemed to have instantly aged 10 years. Any ordinary person would have lamented the loss of their youth, but the mage, focused only on her experiments, was different.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her eyes shone at the thought of her impending experiment and showed no signs of despair. Curious, Seon-Hyeok carefully asked her for her thoughts, and her response shocked him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s common among mages.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was surprised to hear that it was a common occurrence for mages to rapidly age or lose body parts as a result of their experiments. He had known that mages were not normal, but it was at this moment that he realized they were all truly insane.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s get started.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hearing her words, Seon-Hyeok summoned his spirits, his expression suggesting he was resigned to his fate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Master!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The three earth spirits rose from the ground and welcomed their master without understanding his inner turmoil. Seon-Hyeok looked between them and Aria Eisen, trying to recall his pre-prepared excuses.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh! They’re really similar to the arbeiters. Actually, since arbeiters are the manifestation of these artificial and natural forces, maybe I shouldn’t be surprised.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His expectations were completely off the mark. Aria Eisen calmly focused on gathering data for her experiments, even after seeing the spirits resembling her. Seon-Hyeok gave her a moment, wondering if she had not noticed the striking resemblance, but the mage remained calm.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s as I expected. Maybe it’s because they’re earth spirits, but they seem to be a perfect fit for the arbeiters. I think it would be better to use the low-tier spirits than the mid-tier spirit out of consideration for the stability of the experiment. What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He could not respond right away, as he had been deep in thought observing the mage desperate to begin the experiment. Unable to stand it any longer, he blurted out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“More importantly, don’t you think it’s strange?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What is?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Maybe she really hadn’t noticed?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He breathed a sigh of relief at her response, as she belatedly commented.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, the spirits look familiar. They’re a lot like me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That was it for her reaction.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm. Let’s see. First, I’ll open the core…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok looked at Aria Eisen with a dazed expression as the mage once again became immersed in her work.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">This mage. She really is dull.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He knew that mages did not care about matters unrelated to magic, but he had not expected it to be to this degree. He sighed, once again realizing just how little mages cared about the matters of the world.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Shaking his head, he explained the situation to the spirits.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘It sounds fun!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I want to do it!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The spirits made a fuss, each volunteering to participate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘With this, I won’t have to wait around waiting to be summoned!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Yay!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The spirits shouted in excitement and rushed towards the arbeiter. Once they approached, however, they all disappeared, as though sucked into the construct. Surprised, he looked towards Aria Eisen, and she, too, looked back in bewilderment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The experiment has already begun.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She gave an embarrassed look, saying that the core has already been opened for the spirits.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“All three spirits have been synchronized with the arbeiter.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok imagined that the experiment would be a grand affair, but it ended in an instant. The experiment concluded with all three spirits unintentionally becoming one with the arbeiter, and he found himself at a loss for words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even as he was devastated by the development, the spirits were shouting excitedly from inside the arbeiter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Wow! Master! It’s nice and cozy in here!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘What’s this? It’s amazing! I feel full of energy!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>He was not sure what the spirits had done, but the&nbsp;</span><span>arbeiter’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;haphazard shape began to change.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the end of it all, the arbeiter grew to be a giant nearly three meters tall. The giant construct also resembled Aria Eisen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The experiment using the arbeiter was a massive success. After being synchronized with three spirits, the construct grew to be several times stronger than before, with much more natural movements. It also boasted surprising strength, easily lifting up a boulder that twenty humans could not.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He felt a huge dissonance seeing the giant arrogantly lifting up a massive boulder, but those watching cheered at the incredible power. It was only Seon-Hyeok who remained unable to laugh.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s more than I expected!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok shook his head as he looked at Aria Eisen, shouting excitedly about the success of the experiment, and the arbeiter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What did you just say?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Once synchronized, it’s impossible to extract the spirits unless we destroy the arbeiter.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He felt blindsided. It was not one, not two, but three spirits now become permanently conjoined with the arbeiter. Among them was even a mid-tier spirit, Nasita.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He looked at Aria Eisen in bewilderment, but she showed no signs of remorse. Rather, she seemed motivated by the successes of the experiment and eager to synchronize additional spirits and arbeiters in the future.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My spirits…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok kicked the mage out. He was stunned and at a loss for words. It was natural – he had lost three spirits in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But regardless of his feelings, it was true that the arbeiter would be of immense help for the large-scale civil engineering projects planned for Rheinperle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The&nbsp;</span><span>arbeiter’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;strength was not limited to its power and bottomless stamina. At times, it even exhibited the powers of the earth spirits. It was not only an excellent worker, but also closer to a fully-materialized spirit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll focus solely on the production and improvement of arbeiters from now on.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Having found enjoyment in its production, Aria Eisen declared that she would fully devote herself to their creation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>While the Rheinperle territory enjoyed its rapid development thanks to the improved arbeiter, the&nbsp;</span><span>Noctein-Griffindor</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;war intensified. The rumors that Seon-Hyeok heard were terrifying, and he wondered if the conflict would escalate into something massive.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>It was in this situation that a command was given to the Western Army, the forces responsible for defending the frontier from the&nbsp;</span><span>Nocteins</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“As soon as the Nocteins enter an all-out war with the&nbsp;</span><span>Griffindors</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, the Western Army will cross the border and occupy the lands surrounding Fort Kalstein.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though he was not currently in command of the Western Army, he was still affiliated with them. As such, he likewise received the order.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok swore. He realized that the conclusion of the previous war was little more than a stepping stone to an even greater conflict. It was evident that the Adenburg royal family planned to use this opportunity to completely root out its greatest enemy, the Noctein Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Then again, the Adenburg Kingdom had already conquered Fort Kalstein, providing a pathway into the Noctein Kingdom, and had dealt significant casualties to the soldiers stationed in the area. It was the perfect situation to inflict further damage to the&nbsp;</span><span>Nocteins</span><span>. In addition, the Noctein forces would be dispersed at this time, as the&nbsp;</span><span>Griffindor</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;elites would be causing chaos on the opposite border.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If the Adenburg Kingdom wanted war, there was no better opportunity than at this very moment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why is it always the western border! We could wage wars to the north and the east!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His complaint was simply that the western territories, which had barely regained stability after repeated conflicts, would be plunged into yet another war.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But didn’t the royal family say that you don’t have to participate in this war?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Of course they&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">had</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to say that - that is, if they have a conscience. I’ve been a part of three different wars in the past three years. Even now, my body and bones ache when it rains.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That was an exaggeration. Of course, there was no way a dragon rider chief like himself would be in pain whenever he dealt with inclement weather. He just wanted to express how sick and tired he was of war.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Julian gave a bewildered look upon hearing the man ranked 50th in Gradus complain and exaggerate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So you really won’t participate in this war?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok could not respond right away. After all, the royal family had made a very tempting offer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Adenstein royal family was aware of the financial difficulties he faced as a result of feeding his dragon subspecies, and thus, they promised a massive reward for his participation in the war.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh. Am I really going to be dragged into yet another war?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The territory was still underdeveloped, and the mining operations were to be a long-term project. He had been made aware that flooding the market with ores would result in a massive decrease in price, and thus, there was a limit to the amount of money they could bring in each month.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, that amount of income would normally be sufficient to live in abundance, but the problem was that there were three dragon subspecies draining his resources like parasites.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even at this very moment, these monsters were devouring the territory’s cattle and pigs, and now, there were limits to how much livestock they could bring in from neighboring lands. Noticing their excessive needs, the neighboring lords had begun increasing their asking price for their cows and pigs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The royal family has offered to buy iron and silver at a fixed price regardless of what the market dictates. It’s an offer you absolutely must accept.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even if the price is my participation in this war?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Antoine Montaigne shut his mouth upon hearing his question. No matter how much he was focused on the territory’s finances, the old scholar did not want to suggest that the lord be thrown into a battlefield for the good of the territory.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Take some time to think about it. After all, the royal family didn’t give you a deadline either.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s true, but it’s better the sooner I decide. The royal family won’t want me to test the waters like that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They did promise a massive reward, but nobody could guarantee what would happen once the war began. If the public perception was that he joined the war after the situation became favorable, the result would not be to his liking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the end, he decided to put his decision on hold for the time being, but agreed to reach one as soon as possible before sending the territory’s leadership away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the time for a decision came sooner than he expected.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“The Nocteins have sent in their knights. Likewise, the&nbsp;</span><span>Griffindors</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;deployed their knights and elite troops, as though they had expected this to happen.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok’s expression grew grim as he heard the news from Fort Kalstein.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And the royal family? Is the will of the royal family unchanged?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Now that the Noctein Kingdom was willing to deploy their knights, there was no chance they would discriminate between their eastern and western borders. In essence, it would not be surprising to see an enemy knight in battle, should he choose to participate in this conflict.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“His Majesty’s will is firm.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Despite the risks, the Adenstein royal family was insistent. They were finally determined to cross swords after all this time avoiding an all-out war.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They wouldn’t risk the losses if we would be fighting on even terms, but right now, the Noctein forces will be at half strength, considering they will be dividing their knights between the two fronts.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok groaned upon hearing Asha Trail’s words. Ultimately, the royal family had decided that the potential gains from this war were much greater than the losses in knights that might occur.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh. So the royal family had no intention of returning Fort Kalstein regardless of the outcome of the negotiations.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Watching the events neatly fall into place, he realized that plans for this war had been made far in advance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So what will you do?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone turned to him, awaiting the lord’s decision.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Now that the Nocteins have no choice but to go all-out, the casualties of this war will be incomparable from those preceding it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He would no longer be the undisputed powerhouse on a battlefield where knights unleashed their murderous sword energy and mages poured out powerful magic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Whether or not you decide to participate in this war, the war&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">will</span><span>&nbsp;be taking place. In the event of an all-out war, the Noctein Kingdom will send in their knights to disrupt the border territories, and the Rheinperle territory will naturally become a target. After all, the Drake Knight is the individual responsible for humiliating the&nbsp;</span><span>Nocteins</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;the most in their long, storied history.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Asha Trail’s words were convincing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No matter what you decide, you won’t be able to remain a bystander in this war.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It would be better to actively participate in the war rather than wait around passively only to have his territory be devastated by foreign assassins.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He finally reached a decision, and he summoned Aria Eisen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have something to tell the princess.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In case of emergencies, he had prepared communication stones in advance. Upon accepting the mysteriously shining jewel, Aria Eisen immediately began preparing to cast the long-distance communication magic.</span></p>
