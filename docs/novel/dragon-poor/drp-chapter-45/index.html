 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The thing I need most?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, whatever it may be.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And the nobles will offer me that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ahn Yoo-Jung’s answer was full of confidence. However, Seon-Hyeok was not convinced.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’ll never happen.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t take my words lightly. If you accept their gifts without knowing what you’re getting into, you’ll get caught up in their machinations before you realize it. Don’t be so confident in yourself.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yoo-Jung warned him in a sharp tone, as though offended that her thoughtful advice was disregarded so quickly. However, her feelings didn’t change his answer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Like I said, it’ll never happen.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How can you be so sure?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok answered her question in a slightly subdued voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Can they send me back to the other world?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Or perhaps can they offer to undo everything that happened to me here in this world?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But maybe there’s something you need that you’re not aware of…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok cut her off before she could finish responding.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yoo-Jung. War is a terrible thing.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She closed her mouth and listened as he made this unexpected comment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You never know when you could die, or what your last moment might be like. It’s unbearably terrifying for an ordinary person like me. However.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had faced death, and he had killed to survive. Both were terrifying and terrible.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Having experienced all that, I realized what I want.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His experiences in war gave him clarity.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And what is that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yoo-Jung asked cautiously, and he answered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I want to eat kimchi stew. I want pork belly and soju. I want to play games in a PC bang, and I want to watch TV all day long while laying on the sofa.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Having faced death, life in this world felt arduous and hopeless. He desperately longed for ordinary life on the other side.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If none of that’s possible, I just want to live a peaceful life.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A peaceful life would be great, and having his dragon would just be icing on the cake. However, the nobles could offer him neither of those.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You really are unique.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m just a normal person.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s not true. I haven’t met a single high-tier foreigner who was dissatisfied with life in this world, since they’re able to achieve wealth they couldn’t even dream about in the other world.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I just want a long and quiet life. I’ve already been promised more than enough in terms of rewards, so there’s nothing else I want.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then again, even before now, your goal was just to get discharged and live among the people.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yoo-Jung’s expression softened as she finally became convinced of his position.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Just as you said, the nobles will never be able to give you what you want.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She relaxed and smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But even so, try not to get caught up in unnecessary matters. Even us high-tiers are nothing more than ants to those with real power in this world, and we don’t want to get caught in the crossfire of their conflicts.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She got up to leave, as though she was really only there to warn him about the nobility.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you for thinking about me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Seon-Hyeok thanked her, she hesitated at the door. It seemed she had something else to say.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is there anything else?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I don’t know about kimchi stew, but I can treat you to pork belly. It’s not like there aren’t any pigs in this world.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok’s eyes widened at the unexpected remark.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s not like we’ve forgotten about life on the other side either. So please don’t make generalizations about us.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yoo-Jung seemed to have overcome his attribute control when she first came to his room, but it looked as though she was once again falling under its influence as they spoke.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is that so? I see.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok gave a quick response. Ahn Yoo-Jung, as though dissatisfied by the answer, disappeared into the hallway in a huff.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m thankful, but it’s also burdensome.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok was grateful that she came to him and warned him. However, he couldn’t help but sigh as he recognized that she was being influenced by his control.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After some time had passed, someone else knocked at his door.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Ugh, who was it this time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He knew nobody in this castle, but this was his second guest within a few short hours. Seon-Hyeok opened the door with an irritated expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Asha Trail, member of the Royal Knights and Royal Guard.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah. Hello.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She had a fine face that showed no emotions and wore stunning armor. Seon-Hyeok casually greeted the unexpected visitor. Asha looked up and down at him and asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“May I look around the room a bit?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes. Go ahead.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She had disturbed his rest, but he was staying in the royal castle. There was no reason for him to stop her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then excuse me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After getting his permission, a knight named Arthur and a robed woman entered the room and began to poke around.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After watching them for a while, Seon-Hyeok looked out the door. Other knights clad in the same golden armor as Asha were standing at attention at regular intervals.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s going on?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, it’s nothing to worry about. There’s just something that needs to be checked.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Asha answered in a professional tone when he asked, confused about the current situation. In the meantime, the robed woman waved her hand across the room and frowned.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you a summoner?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When the female mage approached him and asked, he hurriedly shook his head in surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s strange. There are definitely traces of a spirit here…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It looked as though she had detected Atiya’s earlier presence in the room. Seon-Hyeok quickly turned and informed them that Ahn Yoo-Jung had visited not long ago.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, so they’re signs of her having been here. Then again, summoners specializing in wind spirits aren’t common. I just wanted to confirm.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But really, what are you doing here?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok was starting to be in a bad mood, realizing that he had suddenly become the target of an inquisition.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There’s nothing wrong here.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There are no traces of particularly threatening magic here either.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After searching the room thoroughly, Asha returned to the doorway and began exchanging conversation with the mage. Seon-Hyeok, annoyed that they were talking to each other while keeping him uninformed, complained.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is there something missing? Are you looking for a thief? What the hell is going on?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Excuse us. We’ve only been fulfilling our duties, so I hope you understand.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What duties…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok was about to complain even more, but he suddenly froze. He realized that Asha had introduced herself as one of the royal guards. Her title explicitly said what her responsibilities were.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She was someone who answered directly to the royal family. It was obvious that she was an important person.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As if confirming his assumptions, a girl was seen approaching past the knights from afar.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her clothing was more casual than during the welcoming ceremony, but the dress still looked elegant. It was the royal princess.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t blame them. It’s my fault for coming here without notice.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok belatedly noticed her and dropped to one knee.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“24th Regiment heavy cavalry, 3rd platoon, Kim…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This isn’t an official occasion, so you can refrain from showing excessive courtesy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The princess passed by him with delicate steps and sat down on a chair in the room. She beckoned for him to come closer with her cute hand, which still showed signs of baby fat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m sorry to interrupt your rest. I’m sure it was difficult being on the road for so long.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her refined manner of speaking once again did not match her appearance. However, Seon-Hyeok was not distracted by the royal princess’ cute appearance this time. He wanted to know the purpose behind this sudden visit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I, I am grateful for your visit.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok reflexively answered when the knight standing behind the princess gave him a look. His face burned in embarrassment. However, the knight seemed satisfied by his response.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“You seem much younger and&nbsp;</span><span>kindhearted</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;up close. It’s the appearance of someone who will bring peace and harmony to this kingdom.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The words sounded ridiculous coming from a thirteen year old. Seon-Hyeok hurriedly bowed his head to hide the fact that he could not keep a straight face. It was truly difficult trying to hold back his laughter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Right. Do you like the title of Drake Knight? It’s not standard practice to give the title of knight to someone who has yet to be ordained, but I felt it appropriate considering your distinguished service and abilities.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">It was her!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok almost shouted in indignation at being given the embarrassing title. He now knew where it originated from.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Considering she was still a child, it was only natural that the name was so childish.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m grateful.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, he outwardly expressed his gratitude. He felt immense pressure coming from the knight standing behind her, as though the knight would decapitate him the moment he said or did anything foolish.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">What a monster.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The pressure he felt from this single knight was greater than what he felt against hundreds of Sastein cavalry. He broke out in a cold sweat and stiffened. This knight must have been one of the truly superhuman beings Ahn Yoo-Jung referred to earlier.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My intent was to compensate you for your suffering, but it feels as though you are still resentful. That is why I am here.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In fact, he was simply tired of the embarrassing titles and uncomfortable parades, but the royal princess had incorrectly attributed this to his disappointment at being initially evaluated as low-tier and being assigned to the kingdom’s periphery.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s not true. If I hadn’t been assigned to the 24th Regiment, I would not have met my comrades and would not be here today.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He wasn’t sure if his point would get across to a young child, but he nonetheless expressed his inner thoughts out of respect to the royal family. Fortunately, the princess understood his position and complimented him with a pleased expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You have a rare disposition.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The royal princess said she was relieved and stood up. With a short farewell, she left the room.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As he watched the princess leave, Asha approached him and said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Keep her visit confidential…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There’s nobody I could tell.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hearing his response, Asha likewise left the room.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, things are crazy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So what did you think, Lord Reinhardt?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Having left the room, the royal princess asked the knight who stood behind her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s been a while since someone’s been able to keep his head up in front of me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Surprisingly, Lord Reinhardt’s response to the princess was overly friendly and casual.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Based on his abilities, I’d say he’s only around the level of a senior knight. However, his future is bright.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So you’re saying…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Support him, and keep him close.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The royal princess nodded with a happy face at his response.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It was worth the visit.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The royal princess then asked Asha and the female mage for their opinions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“At the very least, his eyes aren’t as dim as the other foreigners’.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a bit of a stingy assessment, but it seemed as though Asha wasn’t one to readily give compliments. The princess seemed satisfied.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I don’t trust him.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The female mage was the only one to have a negative impression of Kim Seon-Hyeok.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I thought you’d say that. You have no faith and question everything.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Reinhardt smirked and teased the mage, and she answered nervously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s not it. He’s hiding something.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And what is he hiding?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing the princess show interest, the mage explained the situation from when she first entered the room.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I clearly smelled a spirit. He said it was the traces left behind after a summoner came to see him, but it felt completely different from that. It seems as though he’s unaware of his own scent. Considering that, he is either in possession of something related to spirits, or he is a newly awakened summoner.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He’s a dragon rider, not a summoner.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s why it’s suspicious. I can smell a spirit on him even though he isn’t a summoner.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The royal princess nodded, agreeing with her conclusion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So what do you want me to do about him?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Reinhardt, Asha, and the mage exchanged glances at the royal princess’ question and answered in unison.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Keep him close, and keep an eye on him.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the response, the princess seemed to think for a moment and continued after a while.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tomorrow’s the victory celebration, so I’ll have to see for myself.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Women, wealth, and power. Those debaucherous and sweet things are never more present than at a party. I’ll be able to find out what kind of a person he is.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The princess looked back at the hallway as she spoke. Her words did not match her childlike appearance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He will be my escort tomorrow.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As you wish! We will ensure that nothing unpleasant happens.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The royal guards unhesitatingly responded to her command.</span></p>
