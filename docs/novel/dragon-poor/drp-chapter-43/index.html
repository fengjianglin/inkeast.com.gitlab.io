 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The fact that the Adenburg and Noctein Kingdoms were hostile to each other was common knowledge in this world. The two kingdoms invaded the other’s territory every year, and war was nothing new.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The same held true for the preceding war. Two to four regiments had been mobilized on each side, leading to fears of an all-out war, but the real battles were between smaller units.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Adenburg Kingdom experienced many victories and losses throughout these sporadic battles. The war, which lasted almost two months, resulted in a similar number of casualties on both sides, and it was impossible to determine which side won purely based on the number of dead.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>‘The 627th&nbsp;</span><span>Adenburg-Noctein</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;War.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">War between the kingdoms was nothing special, and each new war was nothing more than a footnote in their respective histories.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>However, this last war was a hot topic in&nbsp;</span><span>Adenstein</span><span>, the capital of&nbsp;</span><span>Adenburg</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Those Noctein bastards tried to fight us and had to run away with their tails between their legs!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ha, how perfect. They probably won’t bother us for the time being.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After each war, it was normal for both sides to claim victory. However, this time, the victor was indisputable.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘The Sastein cavalry – the bane of all cavalry units – has been exterminated.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Those demons that had long terrorized the Adenburg cavalry had been defeated.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a rare major achievement, and an overwhelming victory.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ordinary citizens who cared little about the war simply believed that their kingdom had repelled the invaders once again, but the nobles, who were more aware of the happenings at the border, were out of control with excitement.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s a huge blessing for our kingdom that those terrible demons have been defeated.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I know. I couldn’t even tell you how many riders we lost to them… it’s been a long time coming, but it’s good that we got our revenge.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The nobles knew better than anyone how much the Sastein cavalry had plagued the Adenburg troops and how much they had suffered at the enemies’ hands. This was because the nobles were responsible for supplying horses and trained riders following defeats on the front lines.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They genuinely celebrated this meaningful victory.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“To think that we don’t have to hear that cursed name anymore. It’s like pulling out a rotten tooth.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was a deep smile etched on the nodding man’s face, and everyone agreed. The nobles had always cursed the hellish Sastein cavalry and the Noctein Kingdom they fought for.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard it was a foreigner who made the greatest contribution in this war?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard that as well. I’ve been told he was at the vanguard when fighting those demons.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The royal family has always been so fond of these foreigners, and it looks like they’re finally pulling their weight. I worried that their generosity would go unpaid.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The most common topic of conversation was the foreigner who led the Adenburg cavalry to victory.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“By the way.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A nobleman got the attention of the others.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard something interesting.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He took a dramatic pause before skillfully continuing his story.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There’s a rumor that the foreigner was assessed as low-tier.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You must have heard wrong. I’ve been told that the summoner and knights sent by the royal family played a major role in the battle. They’re all mid-tier at the very least.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A low-tier foreigner wasn’t any better than the most novice of knights. There was no way such an insignificant being could have made a great contribution in fighting the terrible Sasteins.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The nobles sneered at the man who brought up the rumors.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s natural for you to not believe me. It’s shocking that a low-rank foreigner could be the shining star on that horrible battlefield. But wait.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The noble remained calm and collected despite being ridiculed. Rather, he seemed to be mocking the others back for their lack of inside knowledge.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What if the royal family had incorrectly judged the foreigner? We know that the royal family is wise, but even so, it doesn’t mean they’re infallible.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Stop beating around the bush, and get to the point.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The others sensed that there was something more. The noble dragged the story on with a pleased expression before getting to the point.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There was someone unusual among the foreigners. Apparently he was assigned the unusual class of ‘dragon rider’ and treated as low-tier. It seems like the royal family did so because his class was ambiguous and not something well known, like knights or riders.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So what was their mistake?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That foreigner was the one who made the biggest contribution in the recent battle.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old nobles, having spent their entire lives mired in politics within the capital, immediately grasped the situation and found the answer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The royal family made a mistake.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s correct. They should have assigned him the highest tier and treated him well, but instead, they sent him to the dangerous border territories.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The looks in their eyes changed, and the first noble continued on excitedly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My loyalty to the royal family would not have changed if I were in that situation, but as you know, these foreigners know nothing about dedication and service. They can’t be expected to be as loyal as we are.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“At the very least, they’d be disappointed.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They might harbor negative feelings toward the royal family.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He could practically hear the gears turning in the nobles’ heads.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So what’s that foreigner’s name?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The nobleman who brought up the story answered with a pleased expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Kim Seon-Hyeok. That’s his name.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He smiled cunningly as he answered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The royal family’s mistake is also the fault of the nobles. Isn’t it our duty as their loyal servants to come forward and fix the situation before he gets any negative ideas?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’re right. We should intervene. Even if we suffer losses in the process, it’s our duty.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The faces of the nobles had the same cunning expression as the first nobleman as they smiled and looked at one another.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wow! Look at that horse!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They look so strong! As expected of soldiers on the front lines!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They make the royal cavalry look like little girls!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The citizens of Adenstein were completely bewildered by the imposing appearance of the cavalry coming into the capital. It was uncharacteristic of them, as they had often witnessed similar events, but they had never seen the cavalry that manned the borders up close.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">These riders had always been disregarded and relegated to lower ranks, but thanks to their defeat of the infamous Sastein cavalry, they were able to visit the capital for the first time in a long while.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">These riders were completely different from the royal cavalry that occasionally came and went.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They lacked the extravagant armor or neat appearance of the royal cavalry. Instead, their armor was caked in dust and showed significant signs of wear, while the men themselves each had at least one scar.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their appearance was truly that of real warriors, and the citizens of the capital were genuinely thrilled. They cheered and shouted endlessly as they looked at the battle-scarred cavalry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ack!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A scream cut through the cheers and shouts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“W, what’s that!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“G, guards!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The disturbance began far behind the marching troops. The citizens, busy watching the cavalry passing by, grew disappointed when they had all passed, and they tried to either follow the cavalry or leave.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Grr.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, they could not do so. They froze as they heard the low growl. The citizens turned their heads to the source of the noise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They collapsed onto the ground. There was a monster there, growling through his terrifying maw as he blinked at them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The monster resembled both a lizard walking on its hind legs and the legendary beasts found in murals and sculptures, albeit with his wings cut off. Regardless of what they thought the drake looked like, the citizens all went into a panic at the terrifying sight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“M, mommy!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ack!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“M, monster! G, guards!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The people screamed, and they called for both family and the city guards. Some even tried to catch up to the riders to notify them of the monster’s existence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Everyone calm down! That’s not a monster!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With impeccable timing, the royal guards emerged to calm down the citizens.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Look at the beast. There’s a human riding it! While terrifying, that’s not a simple monster. You have nothing to fear from Kim Seon-Hyeok, the Drake Knight, or his mount!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commotion didn’t subside quickly, but it was not because the guards were ineffective in delivering their message. Rather, people were shocked to learn that a human was riding that terrifying monster.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Welcome the hero who annihilated the Sastein – the scourge of the&nbsp;</span><span>Noctein</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He’s the Drake Knight, the new Shining Star of our Kingdom!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The fear was once again replaced by deafening cheers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wow! It’s the Drake Knight!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The Shining Star of our Kingdom!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They were surprised to learn that someone had tamed the terrifying monster and elated to hear that the beast was on their side. Their new cheers were incomparably louder than when they welcomed the riders into the capital.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Th, th, that…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The nobles, watching the procession from the terrace of a building, were just as surprised. They already knew of the Drake Knight’s existence, but they couldn’t help but be astonished.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Drake Knight’s presence was simply that overwhelming. They looked at the drake’s ferocious eyes and couldn’t believe that someone had tamed that monster.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is more than I imagined.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One of the nobles spoke in shock, and the others quickly agreed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“To think that he tamed that wild monster.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s clear that any enemy would lose their fighting spirit if they saw that on the battlefield.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The noble’s eyes were full of greed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Welcome the hero who annihilated the Sastein – the scourge of the&nbsp;</span><span>Noctein</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He’s the Drake Knight, the new Shining Star of our Kingdom!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wow! It’s the Drake Knight!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The Shining Star of our Kingdom!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok lowered his visor nervously, embarrassed by the unexpected attention. He had been told not to lower the visor during the procession, but he couldn’t endure it any longer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh. This is driving me crazy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He felt more and more pressure and shame as the citizens’ cheers grew louder. It was embarrassing being referred to as the Drake Knight or as the Star of the Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Settle down.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok smacked the drake’s head to vent, and the drake, which had been riled up after seeing the people, bowed his head obediently. Those watching grew even more enthusiastic in their cheers as they saw him easily handle the terrifying monster.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He wanted to never hear the words ‘Drake Knight’ or ‘Star of the Kingdom’ ever again. However, they were nicknames and titles specifically granted by the royal family, so they could not be changed so freely.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok couldn’t do anything, so he hoped the procession would end soon. However, the capital road was simply too long.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Welcome, Drake Knight.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thankfully, there was no such thing as an endless road, and the hellish march finally came to an end. With that, he came face to face with the Adenburg royal family for the first time.</span></p>
