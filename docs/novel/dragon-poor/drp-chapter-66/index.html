 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Julian answered Seon-Hyeok’s question with a somewhat reluctant expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There are people known as monster hunters.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Monster hunters?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just thinking about the existence of a group that professionally hunted powerful monsters made his heart race. It weirdly appealed to his masculinity.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes. Some are commissioned to dispose of monsters, and others find and hunt rare monsters on their own. There are none who know more about them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Where can I find them? No, actually, are there people like that in our territory?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Julian expressed her deep concerns when her master showed an inclination to call in monster hunters at a moment’s notice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Their job is to hunt monsters, so their knowledge and experience might be of help to you. However, I would like to dissuade you from bringing such scoundrels into our land.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Julian’s acrimonious comments piqued his interest.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They’re wicked people who don’t recognize a lord’s authority and commit illegal acts like they are nothing. Murder, arson, and rape always happen in the villages they visit, and there have even been severe cases where the village itself disappeared. Bringing such criminals into this territory could have a serious impact on your reputation.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From the looks of it, monster hunters were little more than bandits when they had nothing else to do. Seon-Hyeok found himself worrying as Julian repeatedly expressed her concerns.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But what information could you be looking for that you’re considering bringing such unrighteous people into this land?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, there’s something I need to find.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is it important?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is to me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After a moment’s hesitation, Seon-Hyeok explained that he was looking for a fairy dragon. He couldn’t tell her of the dragon’s existence or the abilities of a dragon rider chief, but felt it wouldn’t be a problem if Julian knew part of the truth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“A fairy dragon? I’ve heard of them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Surprisingly, Julian knew of the existence of fairy dragons. Seon-Hyeok jumped out of his seat and urged her to explain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I just meant I heard about them in a fairy tale a caregiver told me when I was young.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Feeling let down, Seon-Hyeok sat back down. Julian looked at him with an apologetic expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Should I tell you about it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh. I’m sure it’s better than nothing.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He didn’t even know what a fairy dragon looked like, so he waited to hear Julian’s story just in case he could gain useful information.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Once upon a time, there lived a fairy dragon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To his surprise, Julian seemed like she would tell him the fairy tale word-for-word. Seon-Hyeok’s expression conveyed his shock at the start of Julian’s story, and seeing this, Julian stammered an excuse.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My lord, you asked me to…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Right, right. Go on.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His face distorted as he attempted to hold back his laughter. Feeling as though she was being made fun of, Julian’s expression grew cold.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The fairy dragon, who lived in the eastern forest, was suddenly left alone one day, and unable to endure its loneliness, it went down to a human village. Though it made a friend, this friend only knew how to use the fairy dragon and didn’t truly care for it. In the end, the fairy dragon was abandoned after being exploited. Angry, it ate the human alive and made his friends, parents, and neighbors all fall into an eternal sleep. After getting its revenge, the fairy dragon returned to its forest.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Already upset, Julian’s tone as she told the story was horribly businesslike and matter-of-fact, rather than that of a storyteller. Seon-Hyeok had a disappointed look, having missed out on the chance to see her in a different light.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why’s a fairy tale so violent?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I believe most fairy tales are. Are there different kinds?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Come to think of it, the fairy tales from the other worlds could all be interpreted as cruel and scary. Speechless, he quickly changed the subject.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What did the fairy dragon from the story look like?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I was told it was very small and beautiful. The fairy dragon from the tale had sparkling purple scales, butterfly-like wings, and a magical horn.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok listened to the story hoping to get useful information, but he now realized he lacked the information to judge whether the story was helpful. In the end, he had to be content with getting a rare peek into Julian’s childhood and ended the conversation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Try to find those monster hunters. I’ll think about whether or not to bring them here once you find them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh. I will do so if you wish. Please understand that it may take some time to track them down, since monster hunters never stay in one place.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Julian’s actions as she lowered her head and turned around felt rough. It was obvious she was sulking at being treated like a child. However, Seon-Hyeok laughed – even this reaction felt like a child’s foolishness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Children should act like children.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It wasn’t something for him to say, considering he passed on most of the territory’s administrative duties to that very child.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The water wheel was finished without issue. Einst Jeneger even completed the development of a power transfer device that Seon-Hyeok hadn’t brought up, and he showed the lord a complete watermill.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wow! I heard mages were the geniuses of this world, and it was true!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“To be honest, I received some information from the capital. It seems as though there was a similar idea in the past, considering that there was a design that was fairly close to this finished product. Thanks to that, I was able to reduce the amount of trial and error necessary to complete its development.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Seon-Hyeok admired the watermill installed in a shoddy cabin alongside the river. On the other hand, however,&nbsp;</span><span>Einst</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Jeneger showed none of the enthusiasm he first expressed. When asked why, Einst Jeneger responded with a sigh.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“An order came down from the royal family. They permitted the development and testing of the water wheels, but prohibited its installation outside the Rheinperle territory. In addition, they ordered that you, as the lord, manage the waterwheels and prevent normal people from using it freely.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even a simple watermill using the water wheel could reduce the amount of time spent milling and improve the quality of life for his people, but the royal family unexpectedly stepped in to take issue with his actions. Feeling betrayed, he asked Einst Jeneger why.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They also had a separate message for you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Instead of explaining their rationale, Einst showed him the additional message sent by the royal family.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why in the world…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok had a frustrated expression as he read the official document. As always, the royal letter containing all sorts of rhetoric could be summed up in a single sentence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Creating new inventions is permitted, but sharing their benefits with the people is prohibited.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ultimately, they were telling him to use his inventions for his own use only. It was a surprisingly irrational position for the royal family, which had until now been reasonable in their actions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Perhaps…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Einst</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Jeneger looked around for a moment, and confirming there was nobody around, he continued his explanation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’re aware that there have been mass summonings before you, right? It seems like the kingdoms affected suffered serious headaches as a result of them. The foreigners made absurd claims throughout the country, causing a disturbance among those who listened.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The moment he heard this, Seon-Hyeok had a hunch. He realized what kinds of claims were made by the foreigners, and why the inventions developed in the royal capital were all luxurious and intended for the nobility.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I know there were quite a few useful inventions developed at that time, but now there are only traces of them left in the Royal Mages’ library. The rest must have been destroyed by the royal family and the nobles.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“In the end, they’re saying that the elites suffer if commoners are allowed to live a more prosperous life.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His tone turned sour as his excitement at the thought of feeding his people faded away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“V, viscount!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Einst Jeneger panicked as he heard the words that might get him into serious trouble.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I understand. I will do as the royal family commands. I will manage this water wheel myself.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s a wise decision. There’s no reason to ignore the royal family’s wishes and be overzealous with new inventions.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Einst Jeneger only breathed a sigh of relief once Seon-Hyeok quickly clarified that he would obey the royal command.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But by the way, it looks like you’re quite familiar with these events even though they happened a long time ago.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As you know, I learned from a young age that I didn’t have much magical talent, so I focused on reading and expanding my knowledge instead.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok praised Einst a few more times for his humility before asking something in passing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So what happened to those foreigners from then?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Those with discordant thoughts were all ex…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Caught up in the atmosphere,&nbsp;</span><span>Einst</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Jeneger</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was responding before he quickly shut his mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So they were executed.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Was this what he had been aiming for from the beginning?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing the foreigner’s cold expression, the old examiner’s face darkened as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please pretend you didn’t hear what I just said. If this story gets out, my position…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t worry. I will never speak of this to anyone else.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Only then did color return to the examiner’s face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But in turn, will you do me a favor?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, Seon-Hyeok wasn’t finished.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll keep your secret; so can you tell me a bit more about the previous mass summoning?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left">***</p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hello, lord. It’s an honor to meet you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man's armor was mismatched and disorderly, his loose hair was matted, as though it hadn’t been washed in days, and the words coming through his yellowed teeth were those of a delinquent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The monster hunter Julian called in after asking around looked far different from what he expected. Seon-Hyeok had imagined they would be brave and extraordinary warriors who fought against indomitable bests.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Impertinent! Do you know who you’re in front of, daring to raise your head so disrespectfully?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man was on one knee, but had his head held high. Irritated, Julian reprimanded the man for his rudeness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m uneducated and do not know how to properly show my respects. Will this be better?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even when he prostrated himself before the lord, his posture seemed like that of a thug. It was a truly bizarre talent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok raised his hand to stop Julian as she was about to step forward. It was evident that the monster hunter’s attitude would not change much, no matter how much he was reprimanded. In addition, he didn’t pay much attention to his own authority as lord in the first place, so he had no intention of dwelling on this situation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ve been told you know the most about monsters?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My job is to track and hunt monsters, so I do know a bit more than most.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What mattered to him now was not correcting the monster hunter’s reprehensible manners, but rather getting information about the dragon subspecies.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s good. I have something to ask.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok got straight to the point.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Have you heard anything about fairy dragons?”</span></p>
