 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok felt alive looking out into the plains, where nothing obstructed his view. He couldn’t help but occasionally express his admiration when he saw the sun setting beyond the open plains or the stars shining brightly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh. I’m sick and tired of it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, his admiration didn’t last more than a couple of days. The plains he saw today were no different from what he saw yesterday, and he already knew that he’d be greeted with the same exact scenery the following day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m sick of it. I’m really sick of it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Traveling in this world was boring, unenjoyable, and repetitive.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It wasn’t just boring. It was uncomfortable camping out on the plains, where the mornings were cold. It took a lot of work, and there was nothing about it that he liked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh. I’m going to get sick at this rate.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen and Jonasson seemed to agree, as they constantly complained. Only Jackson and Julian remained enthusiastic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Look at the sky. Isn’t it beautiful?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Stop talking nonsense, and go grab some firewood.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jackson admired the sunset every evening as the party set up camp. It seemed that he, at least, didn’t get sick and tired of the sight. And every time, Hansen and Jonasson would angrily grumble at him, telling him to hurry up and help set up camp.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Crackle. Crackle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen began preparing dinner once they had gathered firewood and started a bonfire. “Cooking” entailed putting powdered grains into a boiling pot along with a fistful of dried meat specifically intended for travel purposes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Bleh.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The food was nothing more than sustenance. For&nbsp;</span><span>Seon-Hyeok</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, a noble recently able to enjoy fairly fine dining, the meals were terribly unappetizing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen reached out when he saw the foreigner pick at his wooden bowl.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My lord, if you’re not going to have it, please give it to me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Uh. I think I’ve seen this scene somewhere…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok blurted out, feeling déjà vu.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hansen ate your leftovers yesterday. And the day before. And you responded the exact same way yesterday.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok’s expression darkened at Julian’s sullen words, but Hansen and Jonasson laughed. However, the laughter soon died down, and all that remained in the campground were the sounds of burning firewood and Hansen wolfing down the leftover stew.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The distinction between days blurred during the repetitive journey. Just as Julian said, the scene at the campsite was exactly the same as it was the previous day. Everything repeated itself during the tedious journey, and so Seon-Hyeok anticipated what Julian would say next.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My lord…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Get ready.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok had already gotten up in advance. Julian put down her bowl and picked up two sticks as she stood up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you in advance.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok accepted one of the sticks and assumed his stance. It was the basic starting position for Standard Kingdom Swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Land a hit today, Julian!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Kick his ass!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After removing their military uniforms and entering a contract as Rheinperle soldiers, Hansen and Jonasson started calling Seon-Hyeok “lord” even in private settings. However, their crude manner of speaking didn’t change, and this especially came out during the evening’s entertainment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Such foul language in front of a child.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok clicked his tongue and shook his head before turning his gaze to Julian. Holding the stick with both hands like a sword, Julian waited for him to announce the start of their duel.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Come.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as he spoke, Julian approached and forcefully slashed down with her stick. It was an impeccable strike towards the head, and Seon-Hyeok lifted his stick horizontally to defend.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thwack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the moment of impact, he used his wrist to try a horizontal cut. The young squire swiftly pulled back like a squirrel before rushing in again with a stab.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Keok.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, Julian’s attack was nullified before she could even try to hit him. Seon-Hyeok had kicked her in the stomach.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Boo. Kicking is unfair.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Is there anything you&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">won’t</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;do against a child?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The men booed, but Seon-Hyeok and Julian didn’t pay attention.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You know that there are no rules in battle, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, I understand.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After rubbing her stomach with a grimace, Julian rushed towards him. She was kicked, hit, and repeatedly ended up rolling on the ground, but each time, she jumped back up and attacked once more.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wow. Our lord can be really cruel. Isn’t he being too harsh to a kid?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok smiled bitterly at Jonasson’s comment. This was how he himself had learned, so he had no choice but to use this ignorant method to train his squire. He felt sorry for Julian, as she had become a squire to someone who wasn’t even practiced with the sword.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This training is more than enough. Thank you very much.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>However, Julian looked&nbsp;</span><span>livelier</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;than ever. Since her goal was to become a knight, she was thrilled to gain experience by any means necessary.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then I’d like to ask you for a fight as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Once his training battle with Julian had concluded, Jackson took her place.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Jackson Hamilton. He may be a bastard, but he was raised like a noble because his family didn’t have a proper heir. If anyone in your territory is to become a knight, it’s most likely going to be Jackson. You might face problems down the line if he decides to claim that right of succession, but you should use him well until then.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Clark had told him about Jackson’s background and how Jackson was talented enough to become a knight. He had advised him to guide the young rider well.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In fact, Jackson’s abilities exceeded his expectations. His talent had gone unnoticed until now because he was more skilled with a sword than a spear, and on foot than on horseback. In other words, his talents were unrelated to those of a rider.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then I’ll attack.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Julian and Jackson both used the same textbook swordsmanship. The only difference was that Jackson was more physically mature, and thus, his attacks were sharper and more threatening.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Keok!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even so, he was nothing compared to Seon-Hyeok. The teacher hit Jackson in the side with his unarmed fist, and the student rolled on the ground, screaming in agony. The young man, lacking the swordsmanship of even an apprentice knight, was no match for the man who had defeated the Judge of House Laylark.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>-</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Your leadership has increased by 1.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As a side benefit, training battles also seemed to improve his leadership, and his stat occasionally increased.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Good. Good.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok smiled in satisfaction as he concluded the night’s training. With that, another day passed on their journey to Rugenburg.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">An unexpected event occurred during their tedious travels.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Drop your bags and horses and leave.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We’ll spare your lives if you do as you’re told.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok celebrated as he heard the stereotypical phrases used by bandits.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you! If it weren’t for you, I might’ve gone crazy with boredom!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>He was thrilled that&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">something</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;happened during the boring journey. However, this little incident was resolved far too quickly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“W, we’re sorry. Please spare our lives.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The bandits were overpowered by Hansen and Jonasson before Seon-Hyeok could even fight them himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why! Come on! Why can’t you fight more?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok was hoping for a tense situation and grew angry with disappointment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What should we do? They must be complete idiots to jump at armed riders with those numbers. The village we’re planning to spend the night in is pretty large, so perhaps we can turn them in there. If we’re lucky, we might even get a reward.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The band of bandits begged for mercy at Jonasson’s words, but nobody showed them any sympathy. They all believed that bandits were stuck in their ways.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The security here in the south isn’t particularly good.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even after their encounter with the twenty or so bandits, the party intermittently found themselves face to face with other groups of thugs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s strange. I heard that the southern territories are affluent as a result of the maritime trade.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It looked as though the poor had become bandits in order to make ends meet.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“From what I’ve heard, the merchants contributing to the wealth of these territories are quite harsh towards the common people. It’s said that half of the wealthy port cities are slums, so we should be careful from here on.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Julian’s words proved to be true. They reached Rugenburg after nearly two weeks on the road, only to find a city where light and darkness coexisted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">People dressed in fancy clothes were followed by those wearing rags. There were no signs of life in the eyes of the peasants.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You bastard! You dare stand in my way?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ack! Sir! Please show mercy! I am a worthless human with poor eyesight and couldn’t see my way!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh? What useless eyes. Since they’re so useless, I don’t think you need them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Before Seon-Hyeok could realize what was going on, the poor old man’s eyes were gouged out in the middle of the road. Surprisingly, none of the people walking around paid attention to the commotion. In fact, even the soldiers leaning against the walls turned their heads and pretended not to notice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What the hell…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He stood there gaping at the scene. He felt nauseous at the sight of a noble incapacitating a man for no good reason.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Those aren’t nobles. No matter how crude the southern nobles may be, they aren’t that violent. He’s most likely one of those merchants I mentioned before.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The territory’s soldiers stood and watched as a common man, not even a lord, harmed another. Seon-Hyeok’s first impression of Rugenburg was that it was a violent city lacking law and order.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I think we should inform the lord here of your visit and ask for assistance.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok nodded at Julian’s words. He already noticed people staring maliciously towards their party.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s wash up and change first before we get unwanted attention.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their clothes were dirty after having traveled for two weeks, and it was likely that misunderstandings would occur. Though people were generally unaware that he was a noble, and, in fact, though he never flaunted his position, Seon-Hyeok felt it was necessary to demonstrate his authority here.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll go straight to the sailor’s guild and find out about the sea serpent.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Jonasson left and the number of people in his party decreased, people stared at them even more.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My lord. I’m afraid we’ll have to deal with some nuisances.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I know.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They had asked a passerby for directions to accommodations, but it turned out that he had bad intentions. While they pondered what to do after reaching a dead end, dozens of people appeared to block the only path.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What a mess.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is why I was against you traveling alone.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Julian reprimanded him as he sighed, wondering how it was possible for people to openly aim bows at others within city limits.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You bastards! Do you even know who he is?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Who cares? You’re all going to die anyway.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">An arrow flew towards them before they could say another word.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Atiya.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Yap!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With a shout, Atiya appeared and altered the trajectory of the arrow flying towards Stella. At the same time, more than a dozen men carrying scimitars rushed towards them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh. I really just wanted to rest today.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok stopped Hansen and the others from stepping forward.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, guess I have to do what I have to do.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The displeasure he felt after his arrival in this lawless city was expressed in his fury.</span></p>
