 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Village! It’s a village!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok cheered, seeing the smoke from rice cooking rising from far away. He was genuinely delighted, giving a bright smile that didn’t match his dust-covered face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It had been a week since they left the fortress, and the ideal trip he had expected was nothing more than a fantasy. The trip was horribly uncomfortable, tedious, and repetitive.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All he had seen up to this point were barren plains and unidentifiable wild grass. The villages they had occasionally passed by were so desolate it was hard to find a place to rest. When they did manage to spend a night under a roof, they ended up leaving before dawn because of ravenous fleas and lice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After that experience, Seon-Hyeok had opted to bypass subsequent villages. However, the one in front of them now was different. There seemed to be far more houses, and they seemed spacious enough to spend the night in.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s hurry! What are you waiting for?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok urged Hansen on, as he had been lagging behind. Hansen grinned, showing his missing front teeth, and replied.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t make such a fuss. The people will get scared.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hearing Hansen’s words, Seon-Hyeok grabbed Stella’s reins and slowed down.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Unlike in the border villages, where there’s at least one soldier from every household, the people here only see military personnel when they come to take away their hard-earned money. If you’re dressed like that and charge into the village, don’t you think you’ll scare everyone?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His words made sense. Beyond that, Hansen’s words were uncharacteristically considerate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What, you jerk.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Never mind. You just seem different.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen frowned as Seon-Hyeok answered with a smirk.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s dismount before we go in. There’s no need to scare them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok knew better than anyone how intimidating it was to look up at a rider on a horse. At his suggestion, Hansen also got off without complaint.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Welcome, knights. What brings you here to our poor village…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The village elder and other villagers ran out to the entrance to bow towards them. It seemed as though their plan to avoid intimidating the locals was in vain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If, by any chance, you’re here about the matter from last time, we’re not ready yet. We’re all working hard, so please give us another month…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh. We haven’t been sent here by the lord of this area…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen stepped up to introduce himself as a traveler, worried what the villagers would say if he let them continue. Upon realizing that they weren’t the lord’s knights, the villagers collectively let out a sigh of relief. Even so, fear and vigilance lingered on their faces.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok and Hansen couldn’t do anything about that, so they gave up and allowed themselves to be guided into the village.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The village, despite seeming fairly nice from afar, looked quite different once they actually entered. The houses were worn down, and the villagers’ clothes were in tatters, with holes that hadn’t been patched.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Seon-Hyeok couldn’t get a proper look, since the villagers immediately averted their gaze when their eyes met, but their faces likewise&nbsp;</span><span>seemed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;lifeless.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I want you to see for yourself. The world outside the camp is worse than you think. If you insist on being discharged, there’s a good chance you’ll soon be in a similar situation as them. You should make your decision after you get back.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok recalled what the commander had said before he left on his vacation and was convinced. The commoners’ lives were so pitiful, and their environment so poor. The thought of living in such an environment was suffocating.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is there something you don’t like…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The village elder rubbed his hands together in fright as he saw Seon-Hyeok’s expression harden. Seon-Hyeok hurriedly shook his hands, saying it wasn’t the case, but it was too late. The terrified elder, whose movements were already slow and feeble, tripped over his own feet.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thinking he had done something wrong, Seon-Hyeok tried to help, but the elder jumped up to his feet and limped on, continuing to act as their guide.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The elder did not want to inconvenience the valued guest. Seon-Hyeok misunderstood, thinking the elder was trying to avoid getting dirtied.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Such was life in this world.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Once he left the confines of the military, where ability and rank were valued more highly than status at birth, he was able to see what this world was truly like. Seon-Hyeok could feel the gap between classes more than ever before.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>He unknowingly&nbsp;</span><span>sighed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, realizing that the clear contrast between his vibrant blue uniform and the villagers’ worn, faded clothes was telling him he needed to remain in the military.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A well-cooked whole chicken and some bread were placed on the table. The food didn’t match the village’s poor appearance, and Seon-Hyeok couldn’t taste anything once he realized the villagers had gone beyond their means in preparing this meal.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Isn’t it terrible? This is why soldiers never think about leaving, no matter how awful and dangerous military conditions can be. In trying to save themselves, the soldiers would be putting this fate on their families.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen commented as they finished their meal. The relative affluence of the border areas was compensation for soldiers offering their lives to the kingdom. For anyone who wasn’t born an aristocrat, such a fate - a life of poverty or of constant danger - was inevitable.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok further lost his appetite as he listened to Hansen’s dark words, and he stopped eating.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m done.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Okay. Go and rest. We’ll be leaving before dawn.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen grabbed him as he was about to head to his room.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Seon-Hyeok.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I hope you don’t insist on getting discharged.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok felt Hansen kept emphasizing the poor conditions the commoners lived in, and it seemed Hansen had done so with the hopes that he would stay in the military. It was a clever plan Seon-Hyeok hadn’t been expecting from the rider, but he wasn’t upset.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok might have felt differently if Hansen had done so under the commander or the royal family’s orders, but his trickery was out of an honest desire to remain with his comrade for a little longer. He had no reason to get upset.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But if I don’t, you’ll be a lower rank than me. I’ve even been offered a title.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Seon-Hyeok responded with a heavy heart, Hansen’s eyes grew wide.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is that how it is? You’ll be the captain then? No, if you have a title, you’ll be company commander at the very least.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen tried to piece together the situation, then gave up and continued on.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You can be the commander, for all I care. What’s important is that we can ride together on the battlefield.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen said that he had never experienced as thrilling of a charge as he did when Seon-Hyeok was at the vanguard. He simply wanted to relive that experience.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll be going then.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh. Right.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok sighed as he turned around. His decision seemed to be made.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It looked like he was stuck.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>He grumbled inwardly, but at the same time, he felt at ease. It was the first time in a while that he slept soundly. The following day, he jumped on his horse with a face absent&nbsp;</span><span>of the</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;fatigue from the previous day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s just stay on the roads and avoid any villages. Let’s get there as fast as possible.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen smiled and nodded. He could sense the change in Seon-Hyeok from his tone and attitude.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok had reached level 6 after the previous two battles, and he had far surpassed the strength of low-tier classes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Perhaps because his attribute control had reached 90, he no longer suffered from any lapses in concentration. As a result, he was able to maintain the Wind Body and Wind Spirit abilities to avoid any troubles on the road.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The two did not encounter a single bandit or monster that Hansen had previously warned about.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In fact, Seon-Hyeok even grew bored of the uneventful journey and called on Atiya.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Thank you for summoning me, master.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Atiya was lively as always, and Seon-Hyeok nervously glanced towards Hansen. However, Hansen couldn’t see her, given that he had no affinity for spirits.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Realizing that Hansen was completely oblivious, Seon-Hyeok was able to relax.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Hehe.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Atiya took the lead with a clear laugh. The wind blowing from the front died down, and it became easier for him to keep his eyes open. The only problem now was that Atiya was constantly moving around in front of him, making him dizzy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>-</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Attribute control has increased by 1.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His attribute control, which had stagnated after reaching 90, began to rapidly increase after summoning Atiya and continuing on their journey.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As his control improved, Atiya’s figure became clearer. Her ghost-like figure became livelier.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>-</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Attribute control reached the maximum value of 99.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>-</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Special conditions must be fulfilled in order to exceed current limits.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Atiya, who became even clearer when the message appeared, cheered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Master, something’s strange. Something’s happening to me!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Atiya generally didn’t speak unless necessary, but now, she exclaimed in an urgent voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Something’s changing inside of me!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok stared at Atiya for a while, wondering if the spirit advancement Ahn Yoo-Jung had previously mentioned was happening, but no such change occurred.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It seemed as though his attribute control needed to increase a bit more for it to happen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nonetheless, he wasn’t disappointed. He now realized that Atiya could grow as his attribute control improved, and he knew that she would advance eventually.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">And anyways, it’s not bad as is.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok smiled in satisfaction as he looked at Atiya’s unusually clear appearance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They eventually reached Hansen’s hometown.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you think? Isn’t it completely different from the villages we passed along the way?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For the first time, Seon-Hyeok saw well-maintained roads, tidy houses, and, off in the distance, a large residence for the lord. Hansen’s hometown was the only respectable village he had seen on their journey.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wow, Hansen. You really were a rich kid.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My family’s pretty well off.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen seemed flattered by the words of admiration. For Seon-Hyeok, it was endearing that the child of an affluent nobleman ended up a crude rider like Hansen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Y, young master?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A man, bent over the well-kept field and rice paddies, poked his head out. His eyes grew wide when he saw Hansen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Zalman. Have you been well?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Young master!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh? Where? Where?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The faces of the villagers were full of surprise, as it had been a while since they had seen Hansen. Given that they were welcoming and not on-edge, it was evident Hansen’s family acted as kind lords to these people.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Young master, why has it been so long? We’ve all been worried after hearing about the war…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok got goosebumps as he heard the ugly and rough-looking Hansen be referred to as ‘young master’.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, wait. What about the lord?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Zalman ran off to find him, so he should be out soon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just then, they noticed a group of people quickly approaching them from afar. There was an older man, a woman about the same age, and a woman and men who were much younger. Seon-Hyeok could immediately tell who they were.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hansen!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Father!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen, the lord, and the others, who fiercely hugged one another, looked so alike.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard the news. They said a foreigner made great contributions in the war. I’m guessing that was you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Following their brief reunion, Hansen introduced Seon-Hyeok to his family.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Welcome to&nbsp;</span><span>Frostbegmund</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Frostbegmund</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok had finally reached the base of the Frost Peak where the drake resided.</span></p>
