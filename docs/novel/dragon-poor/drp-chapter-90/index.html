 <p style="text-align: left"><span>A summons was issued to the cavalry commanders of the Central Army. However, they had consistently ignored their commands up to this point, and there was no way they would start&nbsp;</span><span>heeding</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Seon-Hyeok’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;orders now. The only ones who reluctantly answered the call were low-level officers of the cavalry units.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Those present looked embarrassed. It was true they were on the side of their cavalry companies, but they were wary of repeatedly being in these situations as they awaited a potential promotion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is this it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Earl Drachen expressed neither anger nor disappointment. He simply spoke matter-of-factly. However, the atmosphere was unusual, and the people present found themselves shrinking back before they knew it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Our company commander had an urgent matter…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Our company commander as well…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They instinctively felt that something terrifying might happen if they did not step forward and provide an excuse, and as such, they rushed forward to defend their commanders.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Of course. I’m sure there’s nothing that could have been done. I’m sure it must have been&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">so</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;urgent that they repeatedly ignored the summons from their commanding officer.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a simple response, but the low-level officers were slowly becoming convinced. They knew that this was the last opportunity being given by Earl Drachen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But it’d be nice if they showed up.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok completed his sentence before passing on a few more instructions to his men.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tell them to immediately stop what they’re doing and respond to my summons. I will not tolerate any further excuses.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The soldiers saluted and scattered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sit. Sit down and relax. I’m sure this will take a while.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No matter how often the earl suggested this, none of the officers followed his instructions. Before they knew it, they were showing the same military discipline as those who had just been dispatched. They stood straight up and unmoving, nervously looking towards their regimental commander.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Time passed, and the earl’s subordinates returned one by one.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Forward!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The company commanders and their aides slowly appeared, unable to continue with their prideful insubordination. They likewise must have realized this final summons was an ultimatum.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Good. I’ve been told you were busy, but thank you for stopping what you were doing to come over.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They would have rather preferred it if Seon-Hyeok had complained and reprimanded them for what they had done. Hearing his sarcastic thanks, they could not do anything but stand there with their mouths shut.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So. Fifteen didn’t show their faces until the end.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When they looked towards the earl once again, he showed not a sign of irritation or displeasure. However, the company commanders could not help but straighten up at his voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The earl’s calm tone sounded like that of a butcher counting the number of pigs to be slaughtered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Now that I’ve seen your faces, let’s call it a day. Dismissed.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Before they could grasp his intentions, they were allowed to leave. It would not have been strange to show displeasure at being summoned to immediately be told to return, but none of them dared to open their mouths.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It seems like they’re much busier than I am, so I have no choice but to go see them myself.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While the commanders hesitated, the earl took his retinue and headed off.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is it really okay for us not to go?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the man’s words, the faces of the foreigners gathered around him turned grim.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard even all the company commanders gave in. Don’t you think something bad will happen if we’re the only ones holding out?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He’s right. They told us that no further excuses would be tolerated – the atmosphere’s pretty unsettling.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The foreigners exchanged uneasy glances, recalling the attitude of the messenger they had just turned back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard you could be put to death for insubordination during a time of war…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The atmosphere cooled immediately.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s the case for ordinary soldiers. Are we ordinary soldiers? Earl or not, he doesn’t dare do anything to us. And also, don’t you remember who we answer to?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One of the foreigners reassured the rest, saying that they all served the royal family.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard even the nobles in the capital can’t treat us poorly, so what’s there to be afraid of from that country fool from the west?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was as though the man became more and more self-assured as he spoke, and he soon did not hesitate to speak ill of his new regimental commander. The foreigners did not like that Earl Drachen, after starting as a low-tier class, was now their superior and could condescend to them just because he made a few insignificant contributions in war.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When it came down to it, wasn’t his claim to fame that he just slaughtered some ordinary riders? They were confident they could achieve more than that in battle, and thought that they would soon be granted titles as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And if anything happens, Woo-Young hyung will protect us. He’s a high-tier class and a viscount, so he has some authority even in the capital. We just have to do as he says.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The other foreigners looked relieved at the mention of Kim Woo-Young, the leader of their faction and the well-established, high-tier foreigner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So don’t worry about it, and let’s focus on figuring out how we can get recognized for our own achievements. We all have to be recognized and promoted so we won’t be pushed around by the likes of Ahn Yoo-Jung and Lee Eun-Seo.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh, that damned Ahn Yoo-Jung. Woo-Young hyung seemed pretty displeased that she was able to make so much progress with that one insignificant contribution of hers. He’s even more frustrated now after hearing about this unremarkable dragon rider bastard.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was pathetic to see them only focused on coming out on top of their factional strife before a war of life and death. However, they seemed to have no concerns about the upcoming war, and spoke about how they would become better established at the capital and crush those with competing interests.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Anyways, none of you better sneak out and betray us for that Drake Knight. You know that we’ll all suffer if Woo-Young hyung becomes upset, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah, we know better than anyone what he’s like. Don’t worry about that. None of us will step out of line, even if it’s out of fear of him…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Bang!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At that moment, the door suddenly flew open, and a group of men stormed into the room. Bewildered, the foreigners stopped talking and hurriedly drew their weapons.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Who is it!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tsk. Tsk. I was wondering what was keeping you so busy that you couldn’t answer my summons. Enjoying your tea time?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man entering the room looked at the five men who drew their weapons as they shouted. He thought they looked pathetic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I came to see you personally since you refused to show up.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hearing the man's words, the foreigners finally realized who the person before them was and looked on in bewilderment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’re not going to lower your swords? Should I add ‘attempt on your commander’s life’ to your existing offense of insubordination?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Y, you…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Kim Seon-Hyeok…?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok’s eyebrows quickly rose. These foreigners were so slow to grasp the situation, even addressing their superior in an informal, rude manner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You? Kim Seon-Hyeok?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The foreigners looked taken aback, belatedly realizing their mistake, but none stepped forward to offer an apology.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even if you’re an earl, you can’t just enter other people’s rooms like this…"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">One even dared to protest.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah. These bastards really are out of their minds.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Instead of becoming angry, Seon-Hyeok smiled. However, his smile was neither&nbsp;</span><span>gentle</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;nor soft, and it looked several times more threatening than his anger.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gulp.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Overwhelmed by the pressure the Drake Knight exerted, the foreigners gulped. Seon-Hyeok watched them and smiled until the end as he approached.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Captain Clark. What is the standard response to wartime insubordination?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok was now right in front of them, and he asked without even turning back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It depends on the commander’s decision. However, in cases like this, where their actions have a significant effect on troop discipline and break down organizational authority, it’s not unreasonable to dispose of them without going through standard procedures.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So you’re telling me I can punish them harshly.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Only then did the foreigners realize this had been Seon-Hyeok’s objective from the beginning. They gathered together and protested.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We answer to the royal family! If you have any complaints, deliver them to the royal family through official channels… ugh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man stepping forward ended up on the ground before he could finish his words. The other foreigners, eyes wide at the situation’s sudden escalation, belatedly shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What the hell are you…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Once again, Seon-Hyeok did not wait for him to finish. His&nbsp;</span><span>fist</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;flew, and the protesting foreigner fell to the floor. The fallen man was a mess, with blood streaming down his broken nose.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What am I doing? I’m handing down punishment.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was no more conversation. All that could be heard were shouts and screams.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Faced with this kind of violence for the first time in their lives, the foreigners could not even think about responding with their own skills and abilities. They just received their beating without lifting a finger.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘If that Kim Seon-Hyeok bastard isn’t able to keep his cool and goes on a rampage, just let yourselves be beaten up. It’ll make for a good excuse later.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of those being beaten up by Seon-Hyeok, there were a few who managed to rationally think through the situation. However, instead of fiercely resisting, they chose to recall Kim Woo-Young’s instructions and suffer at the foreigner’s hands. They judged that permitting this beating would let them dispose of this tyrant later.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If they responded in anger, it really would be treason. At first, they received the beating in their confusion. But afterwards, they endured, looking forward to exacting revenge down the line.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They thought that today’s disgrace and pain would lead to sweet, sweet vengeance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But something was amiss. By now, the Drake Knight should have restrained himself out of fear for what might happen afterwards, but the punishment showed no signs of ending.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“W, wait… ugh!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sensing that something was unusual, one of the foreigners reached forward to try and dissuade Seon-Hyeok. He was kicked in the mouth, and his teeth shattered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You aren’t afraid of the royal fam… ack!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“You think you’ll be&nbsp;</span><span>saf</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The protesters fell down one after another. An even harsher beating followed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh. S, stop…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“P, please…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At first, they endured the beating out of fear. Then, they endured out of revenge. Now, they could not rebel out of pain and terror.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please stop…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The foreigners belatedly realized that their foe had no intention of ending their punishment and paled in horror.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, Seon-Hyeok still refused to stop. After all, he had no intention of just beating them into submission.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He did plan for that at first, thinking he would drag them out by force, but everything changed upon hearing their conversation from outside the door.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">These foreigners were trash who believed that war was a playground for soldiers and only concerned themselves about rising in status. Going to war with these bastards would be like jumping into a fire while strapped to a ticking time-bomb.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And so, he decided.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If they’re on the verge of death, they wouldn’t be able to take part in this operation even if they wanted to.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok planned to clean up the trash before heading into the battlefield unburdened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">News of Seon-Hyeok’s actions quickly spread throughout the fortress. Five foreigners from the Central Army went to defend their comrades and were caught up in the same predicament. Hearing this, the remaining foreigners went into a panic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The princess is still here at the fortress. Hurry up and inform her of the situation.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Kim Woo-Young, the leader of the foreigner faction at the fortress, frowned and sent one of his subordinates to the princess.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He’s more reckless than I thought. I didn’t expect this much.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Despite saying this, Kim Woo-Young was not nervous. He thought that his enemy would soon pay the price for daring to lay a finger on foreigners directly answering to the royal family.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ve been told the royal princess has been sleeping since this morning. She might be feeling unwell because of the cold. Hyung. I did leave a message with the knights guarding her, but they said they didn’t know when she’d wake up…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The messenger he sent returned without even seeing the princess.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How about Marquis Reinhardt?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“He’s been in a classified meeting with Commander&nbsp;</span><span>Mangsk</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;since last evening…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">How could things go so wrong? They were sick and in secret meetings at&nbsp;</span><span>this</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">&nbsp;time?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Woo-Young was at a loss.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t you think they planned this? Something feels wrong…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s not possible. Don’t you know how meticulously the royal family treats us foreigners?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But he’s a foreigner as well…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The situation would not be resolved immediately, but he had secured enough witnesses to prove that his opponent was at fault. Kim Woo-Young let out a sinister laugh.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, his complacency did not last. The crazy bastard came to find him personally.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I came to hand down punishment for insubordination.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The crazy son of a bitch strode towards him, raising his bloody fists.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If you have an excuse, hurry up and say it. You won’t get another chance.”</span></p>
