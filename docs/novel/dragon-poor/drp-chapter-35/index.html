 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The&nbsp;</span><span>Frostbegmund</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;territory contained the perpetually frost-covered mountain, but unlike its name, the weather there was only relatively cool. Contrary to what Seon-Hyeok had imagined, it was neither a bleak mountain valley with frigid northern winds, nor a barren land covered in snow year-round.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>However, what was even more surprising were the&nbsp;</span><span>Frostbegmund</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;nobles. Unlike other aristocrats who ruled their land for generations, the nobles here seemed surprisingly plain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why even bother playing at being a noble in this tiny territory? We’re just regular people, despite being nobles in name.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen casually responded to his questions. Seon-Hyeok found himself looking around uneasily, wondering whether it was an appropriate topic to bring up in front of Hansen’s father.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s true. Put simply, we’re closer to village chiefs. Let’s just say it’s a hereditary position as village chief recognized by the royal family.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Baron Wulfmeyer, Hansen’s father and the head of the&nbsp;</span><span>Frostbegmund</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;territory, introduced himself as little more than a common village leader. He repeated this several times, as if pleased by his wittiness, and food flew out of his mouth every time he spoke. It was far from the appearance of an aristocrat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So undignified, and in front of a guest at that!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The baroness rebuked her husband as her hand moved to cover her plate from any incoming food projectiles. Even so, their interaction felt so friendly and natural.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But don’t you like the food? I took special care with it, but you don’t seem to be eating much.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The only problem for&nbsp;</span><span>Seon-Hyeok</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was that he felt pressured by Hansen’s family, as they all had tremendous appetites and devoured mountains of food. Thankfully, Hansen stepped up to defend him, saying that he normally didn’t eat much. In reality, it was Hansen’s family that was abnormal when it came to eating, but Seon-Hyeok didn’t point this out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tsk. You should eat more. It’s why you look so frail.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Baron Wulfmeyer, treating his family as the norm, seemed to have a different idea.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That said, you act more like a noble than me. People would probably say your dining manners are pretty refined, though I don’t know what that even means.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Baron Wulfmeyer treated Seon-Hyeok with interest. Then again, Seon-Hyeok had been taught tableside manners since he was young, so he wouldn’t be considered rude no matter where he went.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok wasn’t taken aback, considering that even a noble’s meal here didn’t meet the colorful and high quality food of the other world. His lack of a reaction was conspicuous.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you from a noble family by any chance?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Some of my ancestors served the country in the past.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To be fair, there wasn’t a single Korean family that didn’t fit that description.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“As I expected! I recognized your noble status in an instant!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, I heard you’ll soon be getting a title here too. You’d be a great match for our Anne.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok had been slowly working through his meal, but he immediately froze at those words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Hansen has an older sister?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘He does. She looks exactly like him.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Come on, Hansen. You don’t want to take him and have your sister see him! You know what could happen!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Hey, have a safe trip. Be careful of Hansen’s sister!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok shuddered, recalling the advice of his fellow riders. But Hansen, clueless as usual, jumped in.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Did she go somewhere? We have a guest here, but she’s nowhere to be seen.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wow, it took you that long to notice? She left a while ago, so it’s about time she returned…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At that moment, Hansen’s sister appeared, seemingly having finished with her business.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, Anne’s appearance was different from what Seon-Hyeok had imagined. He thought she’d be ugly, considering how she was compared to Hansen. To the contrary, she was an attractive woman with a slim figure and loose brown hair.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard Hansen’s back?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sister!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen jumped up and spread his arms, and Anne gave him a warm embrace. The two seemed close, but Seon-Hyeok shuddered as he watched. His comrades’ words made sense now as he saw them side by side.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Anne was definitely attractive, but her features were surprisingly similar to Hansen’s. Seon-Hyeok groaned unconsciously, uncomfortable with that realization.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“See. She looks like me, doesn’t she? She’s my sister.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Ah, nice to meet you. So you’re the one who came with Hansen. My name’s&nbsp;</span><span>Arianne</span><span>&nbsp;von&nbsp;</span><span>Frostbegmund</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Belatedly realizing she was being rude to the guest, she stepped back and introduced herself. Seon-Hyeok was once again amazed by her appearance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arianne von Frostbegmund, or Anne, clearly was a member of the family. If Baron Wulfmeyer and Hansen showed their superior physique through their height and broad shoulders, she did so in a more feminine manner. Even compared to the women of this world, who were naturally gifted, she had particularly large breasts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nevertheless, Seon-Hyeok couldn’t enjoy her beauty, because the more he looked, the more her face resembled Hansen’s.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Anne was essentially a pretty, female version of Hansen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So. You have business at the Frost Peak?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After a while, Baron Wulfmeyer questioned Kim Seon-Hyeok.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Now’s not a good time. Do you really need to go?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The baron expressed his concerns, saying that monsters, which typically only occupied the peak, had recently come down to the base of the mountain as well. However, the journey was essential for&nbsp;</span><span>Seon-Hyeok</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Seeing he was willing to face any potential dangers to reach his goal, the baron eventually agreed to help.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But you’ll have to be careful. According to the hunters, the current situation seems as though there’s a new apex predator occupying the peak and pushing out the remaining monsters. The monsters we’ve encountered at the base haven’t been particularly dangerous, but there’s no saying what could be at the peak.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok was pleased to hear this. He strongly felt that the apex predator would be the drake he was searching for.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll assign you a hunter who can be your guide, as well as several soldiers. They’re all skilled hunters, so they should be able to help.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you for your kindness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hansen told me that if it weren’t for you, he’d have died at the hands of those Sastein bastards. In other words, we owe you for saving his life. This is nothing.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok lowered his gaze when he heard the words ‘life debt’. He did save Hansen’s life, but he couldn’t say the same for Hansen’s future offspring. Seon-Hyeok couldn’t raise his head because of his remorse.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So don’t feel too burdened!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The baron apparently hadn’t heard of the accident(?) to Hansen’s lower body, and he continued to heap praise on the foreigner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That evening, Seon-Hyeok once again heard the voice of the dragon. The dragon praised him for taking the correct path and confirmed that there would be a subspecies of dragon at the highest point of the mountain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There’s no time.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok hurriedly finished preparing for the search mission. His vacation was for a month, and the journey here had taken ten days. Considering the time required for the return trip, he didn’t have much time to look for the drake. Fortunately, the men offered by the baron were soon ready to leave as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>An old hunter claiming to be the guide, two younger hunters, and six experienced soldiers were waiting for Seon-Hyeok at the entrance to&nbsp;</span><span>Frostbegmund</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you coming as well, Arianne?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was an uninvited guest. Anne, dressed as a hunter, was playing around with her bow.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My sister’s good with a bow. She’s probably the best in our territory.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Anne’s archery skills are the best around. Nobody else here can use that monster of a bow.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Come to think of it, the bow Anne was tightly holding onto was unusual. It was at least 1.5 meters long, with arrows much longer than an average man’s arms. (TN: 1.5m = 5ft)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, it shouldn’t be a big deal.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok coolly nodded. Their praise suggested she would be more than capable of handling herself, and even if it weren’t the case, he had no intention of stopping her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The men were rather perplexed when he gave his permission so readily. Anne also awkwardly mumbled several times, wondering to herself whether she had packed everything she needed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just a day into their climb, they realized why Seon-Hyeok hadn’t objected.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Stop. There’s something up front. Is there another path?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There is, but it’s a bit out of the way.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then let’s go that way.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hansen nodded to the group, who blinked in confusion. After similar events repeated themselves, one of the hunters, unable to hold back his curiosity, asked aloud.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Isn’t it strange? Even before the changes here, we should’ve run into one or two monsters by now.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s true…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s all thanks to him.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They weren’t fully convinced, but as a second day passed without a single monster encounter, their expressions grew more and more bewildered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were no delays caused by monster encounters, but that did not mean their journey was entirely effortless. The mountain paths grew increasingly treacherous as they ascended, and eventually, they had to crawl alongside a dangerous cliff.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And during this time, a monster finally appeared.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There’s no other path. We’d have to climb up the cliff otherwise.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The hunter expressed his disapproval when Seon-Hyeok brought up the steep and narrow path, and the presence of the monster waiting just beyond it. The current environment was just too unfavorable to deal with any additional problems.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then let’s just keep going.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok didn’t hesitate. The others had worried expressions, but they followed, wondering what new ability this mysterious guest would show.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And with that, they encountered the monster.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Damn it. It’s a group of yeti!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The hunter shouted upon seeing monsters with tough fur covering their bodies. They resembled orangutans.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are they dangerous?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Seon-Hyeok, unfamiliar with the monsters of the world, asked, the hunter replied with a pale complexion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They’re not exceptionally strong, but they’re dangerous on this type of terrain. Instead of fighting us, they’ll try to push us off the edge and then eat our corpses at the bottom.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing the yeti moving freely along the cliffside with their long arms, Seon-Hyeok realized that his party would be at a disadvantage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We have to head down immediately. We’ll have a better chance on the open ground below!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No. We’re not going down.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh! We’re all going to die! It’s okay if we do, but not you and Anne!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“None of us will die here.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok remained calm even as he watched the hunter scream. The hunter, seemingly angered by his nonchalant attitude, urged the party to turn around, but Seon-Hyeok took action first.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Atiya.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Did you call, master?’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Atiya suddenly appeared in the air as he whispered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Push them all off.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Atiya was a wind spirit. Even if she was low-tier, she had more than enough power to push the yeti off the edge.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">This wasn’t the ideal hunting grounds for just the yeti.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hehe! Roll! Roll them off!’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A cheerful shout unfitting of the current situation rang out, and soon, the yeti charged towards them with a loud scream. The yeti in front was grabbed by Atiya and immediately thrown off the cliff.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Argh!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A gruesome scream was heard, but it soon faded away, only to be replaced by another.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What the hell…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The hunters and soldiers, on the verge of turning back and retreating, stopped in their tracks.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The herd of yeti was handled so easily that it made the hunter’s earlier fears seem ridiculous. One by one, the yeti were tossed off the cliff and became bloodstains on the ground far below, and soon, they had all fallen to their deaths.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok spoke matter-of-factly, and the gazes of those looking at him were completely different from before.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Isn’t he even more amazing than what father said?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah, Seon-Hyeok’s pretty great.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yeah. You’re right, he’s amazing. I changed my mind.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Hansen and Anne were quietly having a conversation behind him. They thought that their voices would be drowned out in the wind, but for&nbsp;</span><span>Seon-Hyeok</span><span>, the wind&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">was</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;his eyes and ears.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll have to break him down.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok stumbled as he heard Anne talking to herself.</span></p>
