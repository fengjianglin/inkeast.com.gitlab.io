 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Shield!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hearing his enraged shout, Julian hurriedly threw Seon-Hyeok a buckler secured to the horse’s saddle. He snatched the small shield out of the air, grabbed the handle, and immediately smashed downwards.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Keok!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man running in front had his face smashed in by the shield and fell down screaming.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Die!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The second thug trampled on his fallen comrade and brandished a knife. For&nbsp;</span><span>Seon-Hyeok</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, the attack felt incredibly sloppy and slow. He almost yawned as he kicked at the man, not even bothering to block the clumsy attack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Kicked in the stomach by a hard leather boot, the man collapsed while letting out a grotesque noise. The man running right behind him stared wide-eyed, shocked that two of his fellow thugs had been taken out in an instant. Seon-Hyeok smashed the blank face with the buckler.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thud.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A piece of a tooth and crimson blood spewed into the air as the third man collapsed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The unidentified assailants hesitated, belatedly realizing that they had picked the wrong target. However, Seon-Hyeok was furious and had no intention of letting them run away.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He secured the handle of the shield. Although it was a cute little buckler barely large enough to cover one’s head, in his hands, it was a terrifying chunk of iron and an efficient weapon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ack!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Kuack!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok approached, swinging the buckler in a wide arc, and the men in front fell, faces slashed by the edge of the shield. He pushed forward without hesitation, recklessly swinging both fist and shield as he tore through the assailants.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hiik!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh? Closing your eyes? You don’t even have the basics of fighting down.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man shut his eyes in fear even before Seon-Hyeok could reach him. His face, sporting knife scars, was truly pathetic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“I, I’m&nbsp;</span><span>sorr</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">… keok!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He prostrated before the foreigner, head down as if begging for forgiveness. He was promptly kneed in the face and began foaming at the mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We lost two of them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok turned to see Hansen and Jackson standing on top of two archers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What. That was it?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Still angry, he looked for another opponent. However, anyone able to stand on their own two feet had already disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ugh.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sob.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The unidentified attackers had tears and snot running down their faces. It was a completely different sight from just a moment ago.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok grew even more enraged. These men would’ve been beaten up by the lowliest of soldiers on the western front, but here, they were brandishing their blades like they owned the settlement. He searched out the ones who still seemed to have their wits and kicked them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My Lord. There are people watching.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He came to his senses after hearing Jackson. He looked around before stopping.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But nobody’s paying attention?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They had left the alley as they beat up the assailants. However, despite the commotion, none of the people passing by looked at them. They hurried about, afraid of making eye contact. It was as though midday stabbings were commonplace in these parts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wow. What kind of shitty neighborhood is this? People actually live here?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Seon-Hyeok exclaimed in bewilderment, he heard a whistle from afar. With that, the guards approached.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Wow.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">So</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;early. Way to get here after they’re all taken care of.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He clicked his tongue at the horribly slow guards as Julian came to take the bloodied buckler.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Halt!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s been a while since things stopped.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The mass of guards glanced at the alley and awkwardly stuck out their spears.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We received a report that you ambushed innocent citizens. Drop your weapons…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Just stop. I’m actually going to get angry.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing the guards about to call the victims the attackers, Seon-Hyeok warned them in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If you surrender, you will be brought to justice…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This place is a mess.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The guard’s demand for surrender wasn’t even worth listening to, so he called Julian. She had been wiping the blood and flesh from the buckler using a man’s coat lying on the ground, but quickly came to his side when he called.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Take care of this.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Would you like to go to your accommodations first?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No. Let’s go together in a bit. This place really is a shithole. We shouldn’t split up and invite any more trouble.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then I’ll take care of this as quickly as possible.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The noisy guard gave them a fierce look as they spoke.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you doing…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Smack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Julian walked up to the guard and smacked him across the face before he could even finish.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you doing…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Identity and affiliation, guard.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Overwhelmed by the commanding attitude, the guard stroked his swollen cheek and answered reflexively.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Rugenburg guard forces, Carls…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Smack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Julian once again smacked the guard.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How can a commoner speak that way in front of a noble?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“A, are you a noble?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Smack.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Julian was ruthless. The guard captain was in a daze after being slapped repeatedly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Apologize before you even think about asking who you’re talking to. Your complacent attitude and carelessness almost resulted in the noble coming to harm.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Smack. Smack. Smack!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Julian continued to smack the guard even as she demanded an apology. He didn’t have the chance to open his mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You don’t deserve to know the name of this noble man. Take those trash and get out of here. If I hear that they didn’t get properly punished, I won’t let you get off so easily.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The guard captain, slapped dozens of times by the small but sharp hand of the young girl, was almost delirious. The remaining guards stepped up to gather the unidentified assailants and disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is it okay to treat them so harshly? They’re still guards of this territory.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Considering how the guards stood by the thugs, it was evident what kind of relationship they normally had. Even so, Seon-Hyeok couldn’t help but be worried that they were mistreating the guards of a different territory.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My Lord, you should be more aware of your position as a noble. No noble asks forgiveness from those beneath him. He was the one who tried to accuse you of being a criminal.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the end, he was scolded for voicing his concerns.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s go. I was already tired before having to waste my energy on those bastards.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Aware that he’d continue getting reprimanded, he gave an excuse to leave. Julian gave a disapproving look, but shut her mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Fortunately, they didn’t have to worry about being attacked once they reached their accommodations. As befitting a large port city, Rugenburg’s accommodations and service were excellent. There was only a single wall between him and the outdoors, but the atmosphere inside was completely different from what he just experienced.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I feel so much better now.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The group looked like they had forgotten their recent troubles as they gathered at the restaurant after washing themselves. Considering they had been unable to wash properly during their journey, they felt refreshed after finally getting rid of the dirt and mud caked on their bodies.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even Julian, the squire responsible for delivering such feisty slaps earlier in the afternoon, wasn’t above the afterglow of the hot bath, as she dozed off like a young child.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m back.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At that moment, Jonasson returned from the sailor’s guild.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You actually managed to find this place okay?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You caused such a scene outside, so it’d have been strange if I couldn’t.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jonasson casually responded to Hansen’s verbal jab and immediately began to talk about what he had heard.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Around 4 years ago, three merchant ships heading southwest encountered a giant sea monster. Of those, the flagship and one of the accompanying ships sank, while the remaining ship was half-wrecked before the people were rescued by a passing merchant fleet.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Was it the sea serpent’s doing?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They say it’s probably a sea serpent. However, nobody’s actually seen the monster, so we’ll have to ask the survivors tomorrow to find out the truth.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Jonasson claimed that asking around too openly from the beginning left one open to pranks or false information. He seemed quite familiar with the task at hand.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s get something to eat first. It’ll be our first time having a proper meal in a while.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Seon-Hyeok didn’t expect much considering it was their first day at&nbsp;</span><span>Rugenburg</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. He was about to order their meal when the door of the inn opened and guards rushed in.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah. This place really doesn’t suit me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The party was just about to get over their earlier situation, and thus, they didn’t welcome the guards. Julian rose from her seat and glared at them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Affiliation…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am Squire Harold Tyrone of the Rugenburg guard forces.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Contrary to their expectations, however, the man was polite as he introduced himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard that my men had a misunderstanding earlier and treated you rudely. I came to apologize in person. Please be understanding.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Julian sighed as she saw the squire in traditional knight attire politely apologize.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I am Squire Julian Vanquish.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Considering it was not a common soldier, but a squire, showing them this respect, Julian couldn’t blatantly ignore his apology. She reluctantly returned the courtesy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Carls. Beg for forgiveness.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Harold Tyrone’s command, Guard Captain Carls knelt down. The group of soldiers behind him likewise bowed down and asked for forgiveness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We were wrong. Please show us mercy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok wanted to mention the deplorable behavior of the guards and their close affiliation with the street thugs, but it was ambiguous whether he, as a guest, should meddle in other territories’ affairs. He waved his hands as a sign of understanding, unable to reject Harold Tyrone’s politeness, and the squire discreetly asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“May I know your name? A nobleman has come all the way to our territory, and I don’t know how I am supposed to address you. I worry that you will be inconvenienced again.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was obvious that this was the true purpose of his visit. However, he had no justification to refuse the question of the polite man.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is Viscount Seon-Hyeok Rheinperle Kim Drachen. The royal princess has given him the name Drake Knight, and His Majesty has personally appointed him as a knight.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh! You’re the famous Drake Knight. It’s an honor to meet you. If the lord knew of this, he would run here immediately to greet you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“He is just stopping by for personal business, so he doesn’t want to cause a disturbance. We don’t doubt that the Lord of Rugenburg would want to welcome us personally, but we’ll unfortunately have to push that off until next time.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Up to this point, Seon-Hyeok had not spoken a word. Julian was asking him not to speak with her eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s unfortunate. If only the lord could meet a knight with Gradus. He wouldn’t spare any expense.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Gradus?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This time, even Julian was confused with what Harold was saying. She stared.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t you know what Gradus is? These days, it’s common for the capital to rank everyone, whether they’re mages, knights, or summoners.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Harold Tyrone looked at her like she was acting strangely.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“The border territories are too remote, and we’ve been focused on the movements of the&nbsp;</span><span>Noctein</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">s. I apologize for our lack of familiarity with the happenings at the capital. Would you care to explain, Squire Tyrone?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Harold Tyrone spoke excitedly at Julian’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ever since the medium called newspapers became popular in the capital, there has been an interesting development called magazines. It’s a separate publication containing articles and conversations with the renowned knights and mages of the capital, and it is becoming hugely popular there. Among them, the most famous is known as Gradus, which ranks people by their power.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Upon hearing the explanation, Seon-Hyeok felt as though this bizarre ranking system known as Gradus must be the work of a foreigner. Likewise, he could tell that Gradus would be no different than rankings used in the other world.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The proud knights of the capital are allowing people to make such a big deal about this?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“For a while, the capital was in a state of chaos because the knights unhappy with their Gradus kept fighting to prove their skills. But now that almost half a year has passed, there are fewer of such duels, and people are mostly satisfied with their Gradus.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Harold Tyrone went on to say that Gradus was given only to 100 proven talents, including knights and mages, and that having it was a great honor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And what is my master’s Gradus?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As if guessing Seon-Hyeok’s innermost thoughts, Julian asked about his rank.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The Drake Knight is…”</span></p>
