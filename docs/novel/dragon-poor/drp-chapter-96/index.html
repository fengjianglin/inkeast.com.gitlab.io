 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok stayed in his accommodations all day long, looking at the list of Gradus and selecting from these talented individuals.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If they’re ranked too high, it’d be a burden for me to take them – and for me to order them around.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He immediately excluded those he deemed too strong. Even if the royal princess offered her support, Seon-Hyeok believed such individuals would not follow him unconditionally. After bringing them back to Rheinperle, there was no guarantee that they would obey his commands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What he needed were competent individuals he could comfortably order around, not superiors to house in his territory.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll exclude the foreigners as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And then, he removed all of the foreigners with Gradus.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So this is what’s left…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After repeatedly cutting down his list, Seon-Hyeok was left with just three.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Royal Mage, Senior Mage, Jake Proudmoore, Gradus 73.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Royal Mage, Senior Mage, Aria Eisen, Gradus 98.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Royal Mage, Senior Mage, Kesil Arcane, Gradus 100.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All three were promising talents recognized for their abilities, despite only being in their 20s. Likewise, they were all mages and not knights. Julian spoke up from his side, asking whether he would be making a list of knight candidates as well, but Seon-Hyeok responded in a tone that said he had nothing to think about.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ve already chosen the knight.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Already?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was true Seon-Hyeok had been looking at the list of Gradus all day, but it was surprising that he had so quickly decided on a person that he may have to spend a long time with in the future.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, for him, it had not been a hasty decision. On the contrary, he had planned this even when he told the royal princess his wish. In essence, his choice for the knight had already been decided before he arrived at the capital.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And who might that be?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As expected of a squire aspiring to become a knight, Julian showed great interest in the individual who would become Rheinperle’s first knight. Seon-Hyeok looked at Julian with an inscrutable expression before pointing towards the middle of the Gradus rankings.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Talented and proven. Isn’t this perfect?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Julian looked at her lord blankly as he waited, expecting her to compliment his choice. After a moment, she sighed and responded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The knight’s skilled and of good character, of course. But how do you expect to steal away one of the Royal Knights?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The name Seon-Hyeok pointed to was that of a female knight Julian knew well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Royal Knight, Royal Guard, Senior Knight, Asha Trail, Gradus 46.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you mean, how?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok looked at his squire shaking her head before boldly explaining.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll have to tell the princess that I want Sir Trail.” &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Whereas knights determined their Gradus through relatively simple and clear duels, mages were ranked according to more complicated criteria.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As they spent most of their time studying and experimenting with magic in laboratories, there was no way they would suddenly challenge each other to a duel. As such, their ranks were determined by identifying the types and levels of magic each mage had learned, then by projecting how much effect they would have on enemies if thrown into battle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In essence, knights were used to charge in and crush enemy forces in battle, while mages remained stationary to cast magic that would either restrict or annihilate their enemies.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ve heard that the lowest ranked knights and mages can handle at least one infantry company by themselves.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was truly a strange world with magic, spirits, and all sorts of unnatural abilities, where an individual’s strength could overwhelm that of a hundred well-trained soldiers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But they won’t be able to go to war anyways.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“That’s why they’re even more reliant on Gradus. Without the existence of such a system, there would be no way for them to prove themselves unless there&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">was</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;an all-out war.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Julian had a point. These individuals had struggled throughout their lives to gain this superhuman strength, but they were now held back from using their abilities. Seon-Hyeok imagined it must feel incredibly frustrating and unfair.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From that perspective, he somewhat understood the mindset of the ordinary knights who had been humiliated after recklessly challenging him to a duel in the past.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Since we can’t bring them into battle anyways, let’s pick a versatile mage. It’d be a problem if all our mage could do is create fireballs and fire off some lightning.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok handed Julian his pre-prepared list of candidates for the Rheinperle mage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Please find out if any of these three have outstanding talent in non-offensive spells, or if they are experimenting in other fields of magic.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Unlike the knights, the royal mages rarely move about. It’ll take some time to gather information on them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s not a problem. After all, I’ll only receive my rewards after negotiations are finished, and we’ll depart after that. It’s fine as long as you can gather the necessary information before then.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At his words, Julian bowed and exited the room, acting diligent as always.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Phew. Then should I stop by the inner castle?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It just so happened to be the time when the princess would be enjoying her tea. Seon-Hyeok called on a maid to lead the way and slowly made his way to the inner palace.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You really treat the castle like it’s your own home.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, Seon-Hyeok came across someone he was not particularly excited to meet. After beating the foreigners of the Central Army half to death, he felt uncomfortable being around Marquis Reinhardt.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The princess has given me permission.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m aware. I’m the one responsible for keeping track of who enters the inner castle, so there’s no way I wouldn’t know that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After his curt comment, the marquis gave the servant a look.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I have something to discuss with the earl. Please leave us.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The girl looked at Seon-Hyeok’s face for a moment, then disappeared when he nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you have to tell me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How do you like the capital? Doesn’t the world look different now that you’re in a higher position?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was an irrefutable fact. He was enjoying a luxurious lifestyle incomparable to when he was a mere cavalry rider.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s just how the capital is. It’s a comfortable and pleasant place for those with power, but those without are torn apart by all sorts of external forces.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I think so too.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok was not sure what the marquis was trying to get at, so he just continued to listen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“However, you now have the requisite power and reputation to remain unbothered by most, and you even have the trust of the royal family. You might not be aware of this, but there are none in the capital who can treat you carelessly.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok straightened up as Marquis Reinhardt looked at him and got to the point.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So. Do you have any thoughts about remaining in the capital?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">What’s he saying now?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Seon-Hyeok gave a confused look, the marquis continued with a gentle expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m asking you if you would like to join the Royal Knights.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok was left speechless at the sudden offer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your duties would be to protect the Adenstein royal family, the most important figures within this kingdom. The glory and honor you would receive is beyond description, and none, save for members of the royal family, will be able to give you commands. Isn’t that tempting?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The marquis did not push him for an immediate response.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There’s no need for you to answer right now. If I did, the old man from Mangsk would come here himself to make my life hell. I just want you to keep this option in mind and to take your time in considering it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The marquis’ attitude was unusually gentle, as though he noticed that Seon-Hyeok did not seem too keen on the suggestion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll consider it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The marquis laughed, considering it a relief that he was not rejected to his face, then remembered something as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, don’t think about suggesting that you’re meant for the battlefield as your excuse. You’ll find out soon enough, but you won’t have many opportunities to fight in such battles going forward.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’re a point of contention in the current negotiations with the Nocteins.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Why would an individual be a huge point of concern in a settlement between two kingdoms?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Seon-Hyeok frowned and demanded an explanation, the marquis slowly replied.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m sure you’re aware that neither we nor the Noctein Kingdom deploy mages or knights to the front lines in an effort to avoid unnecessary escalation.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok was well aware of this.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This time, the Noctein Kingdom has requested that the Drake Knight be classified alongside senior knights and excluded from future disputes. That’s the one concession they insisted on in return for accepting most of our demands.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok gave a bewildered look once he belatedly grasped the situation. The Noctein Kingdom’s demand felt like children setting rules before a fistfight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And the Adenburg Kingdom will accept that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It hasn’t been decided yet, but most likely. There shouldn’t be any instances of Noctein forces crossing into our territory for the time being, and anyways, their request isn’t too difficult to accept.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>From what the marquis said, it seemed as though the Adenburg officials were viewing the&nbsp;</span><span>Nocteins’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;proposal in a positive light.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Since you’re a high-ranking noble now, you’ll soon come to understand why knights have their hands tied and mages are kept restrained. And by the time you do, you’ll be in a similar position as those other knights.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A shadow fell on the marquis’ face. On the other hand, however, Seon-Hyeok’s expression remained unchanged. He had simply been confused about the situation, but he did not feel anxious about the prospect of no longer being able to fight in battle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Belatedly realizing this, the marquis asked with a sour expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Aren’t you upset? You’ll become a caged bird or a leopard that’s unable to run.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok casually responded to Marquis Reinhardt’s question.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What the big deal if I can’t fly or run? I can always live like a chicken or a house cat.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>After all, he had no burning desire to fight in wars in the first place. He had happened to fight under orders, and in this process, he had made significant contributions in the&nbsp;</span><span>Adenburg-Noctein</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;wars. He had no reason to be disappointed over being excluded from the battlefield now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No, if anything, he felt it was fortunate that he would no longer be ordered onto the terrible battlefields and exposed to such horrible sights.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok’s expression betrayed his inner thoughts, and seeing this, the marquis sighed before continuing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Anyways, that’s the way things are now. If you ever become bored of the borderlands, feel free to come to the capital. The Royal Knights will welcome you with open arms anytime.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Feeling as though he lost control of the conversation, the marquis hurriedly left after his final comment. When he disappeared, the maid returned to once again lead the way.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What a coincidence. I was just about to have my last cup of tea, and to think Earl Drachen would come to find me here.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Previously, the royal princess had almost begged him to come to visit, but she now acted like she had no memories of doing so. By now, Seon-Hyeok was fully accustomed to these slight inconsistencies in the princess’ behavior, and he simply greeted her with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I was in a tough position after my previous lance broke in battle, but thanks to your consideration, I was able to get new arms and armor. Thank you very much.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The kingdom’s finest craftsmen worked hard for months to create those. The enthusiasm and sincerity with which they refined and forged the iron felt like they would be creating a once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece, so it’s natural that you’re satisfied with the result.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The princess spoke grandly, but in the end, she was simply boasting about how she had given him such a great gift. Seon-Hyeok did as she hoped, thanking her and showing that he was moved by her thoughtfulness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>He felt as though he was the uncle of a young niece. Of course, he had to be careful around her because her father was the king of&nbsp;</span><span>Adenburg</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, but even so, he enjoyed being around the simultaneously elegant and innocent princess.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, and about the mage and knight who will come with me to Rheinperle.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh, have you decided already?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll have to think about the mage a bit more, but I’ve decided on the knight.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The princess’ eyes sparkled and grew wide in anticipation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Good. I’m truly curious which knight caught the attention of the renowned Drake Knight.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had already made up his mind before coming to see the princess, but he could not help but hesitate, knowing that he would be taking away one of the princess’ personal escorts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even so, he set aside his reservations and shared his decision.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Please give me Sir Asha Trail.”</span></p>
