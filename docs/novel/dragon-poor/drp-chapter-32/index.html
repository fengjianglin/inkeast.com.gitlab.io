 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok had already heard from the commander that he would be receiving a medal and given some authority for his accomplishments. As a result, he had remained calm while speaking with Frederick.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This attitude did not last long, however, as the royal family had unexpectedly decided to confer him a much higher title.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You have been given the title of viscount.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unlike knights, whose titles were impressive in name but had no practical benefits, his new title of viscount truly cemented his position as a member of the nobility.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Viscounts often lacked their own territory and functioned as supportive figures next to higher-ranking nobles, but in some cases, they could exert influence greater than that of an average lord.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Once assigned, his title could not be taken away, and his name would be known alongside the other nobles within the Adenburg Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your exact position hasn’t been determined yet, but it’s likely that you’ll be given responsibilities at the capital like the other higher-tier foreigners.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At this point, it could be said that Seon-Hyeok’s original plans of cutting ties with the royal family had gone completely astray.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do my own desires have no influence in this?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When asked this with a frowning face, Frederick replied that though an individual’s wishes were not taken into consideration in general, the situation could be different given his unique status as a foreigner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After this, Frederick continued on, saying that his class was temporarily assigned as mid-tier, but that a ranking official would soon visit to properly assess his abilities. However, Seon-Hyeok was no longer paying attention.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t forget that you’re a member of the heavy cavalry until you’re formally given your new title, and pay special attention to your actions until then.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Frederick realized there was no use in saying more, and sent Seon-Hyeok away with these final words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That snake-like old man!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As he left the barracks, Seon-Hyeok swore and kicked at the ground. Because the commander had properly reported on his accomplishments, it seemed that he would be unnecessarily receiving a noble title and become inextricably linked to the kingdom.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He could not help but feel resentment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Perhaps the commander had been expecting this reaction? He soon visited the camp, accompanied by a single cavalry rider.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t be so resentful. It’s much easier to live with a nobleman’s title than without one.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">These were the first words the commander offered, seeing Seon-Hyeok’s angered expression.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How can I feel good about this? I’ve been shackled to the kingdom against my will.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commander remained calm despite the brazen response.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why are you so angry?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s obviously the fact that the more favors I get from the royal family, the more debt…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You have the wrong idea.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commander cut him off as he responded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The support you’ve received from the royal family so far is undeniably debt to be repaid. It’s difficult for a foreigner to get by alone in this world. In that situation, the royal family helps develop their abilities and finds them a position they can settle down in.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s why I don’t want to be further indebted…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing his unhappy expression, the commander smiled as though trying to soothe an upset child.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Haven’t you already settled your debts?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commander’s voice was firm.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The rewards and titles that will be given to you are simply reasonable compensation for your accomplishments.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His knowing eyes gazed straight at Seon-Hyeok.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Maybe you’ll understand it better this way.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commander continued, staring at him with his clear, smiling eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’ve paid off all your debts. It’s now time for the royal family to pay their own.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commander left soon after. He said he had simply wanted to meet the soldiers and tour their camps since the military situation had settled down for the time being. Ahn Yoo-Jung and her companions left at the same time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll see you at the fort.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yoo-Jung said her goodbyes with an expression somewhere between relief and disappointment, and Seon-Hyeok thanked her for her kindness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Once everyone had left, he fell deep in thought.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Since when had he only thought about running away and escaping his situation? When he first left the training facilities, he had been determined to make the most of this situation and live well in this new world.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After some thought, he realized why his feelings had changed. He was terrified by war and pressured by the desire to survive. In addition, as he had not finished his service in the other world, part of him was influenced by the aspiration to be discharged and no longer be tied to his military obligations.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘I hope you stay in the military, but I won’t keep you here against your will. And even if you do remain, I won’t force you to remain loyal to the royal family. All I want is for you to do your best in your current position. In the end, it’s people like that who collectively make the kingdom stronger.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok frowned as he recalled what the commander said before he left.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That damn old man. He seems honest, but he’s got quite the way with words.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then again, Seon-Hyeok did have to admit. After being dropped off into this world, he had consistently been a bit too impatient.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘You kept your promise with me. Now it’s my turn.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old commander wasn’t just good at talking. He was good at managing people as well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>‘I, Wittenfeld Royen Mangsk, commander-in-chief of the western army of the Adenburg Kingdom, permanently&nbsp;</span><span>grant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;the foreigner, Kim Seon-Hyeok, part of my territory. This transfer of territory is guaranteed by the Mangsk and royal families, and none may dispute this in the future.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commander, Wittenfeld Royen Mangsk, surprisingly awarded him some of his own land. In addition, he said that as a result, Seon-Hyeok now had the right to refuse the royal call and concentrate on managing his own territory.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘If you want, I can arrange for you to remain with your current comrades as well.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok couldn’t help but seriously consider his options, given all the perks offered to him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">‘Of course, all of this is only possible once you are conferred your title.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commander promised not to ask for anything in return for the land, and Seon-Hyeok couldn’t help but be swayed. He had begun his new life in the Adenburg Kingdom, and the opportunities offered him were too tempting to continue insisting on being discharged and cutting ties with the kingdom.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The 24th Regiment infantry, which had been dispatched to the front lines to provide support, returned as Seon-Hyeok considered his future.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There did not seem to be any significant losses, indicating that no major battle had occurred, but the faces of the infantrymen were still full of fatigue. Among those who returned safely were Park Soo-Hong and Kang Jeong-Tae.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Welcome back.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No matter their previous relationship, Seon-Hyeok was happy to see them return alive and well. When he hugged the two dusty and dirtied men, they responded in a weary voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I heard you had some major accomplishments in battle. Congratulations.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Congratulations.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Their dull gazes and exhausted voices showed no signs of the jealousy they held before.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’ve worked hard. It’s good that you’re back.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seon-Hyeok consoled them, able to sympathize with their harrowing experience.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">***</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A few days after the infantry returned, Seon-Hyeok and the heavy cavalry once again left for Fort Mangsk. This time, the atmosphere was completely different from their previous march to the fortress. They rode hard without worrying about any external threats, and they reached their destination in just two days.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hm. That didn’t take long.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In fact, the distance travelled wasn’t particularly great. His previous experience with the journey now felt so strange.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Fort Mangsk welcomes the return of the heroes.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A crowd several times larger than from their previous visit welcomed them. This was the courtesy given to the victors who destroyed the Sastein cavalry, the force that had plagued the Adenburg Kingdom for so long. The commander stood in front of the cheering soldiers and welcomed them, and his words were so flowery that all who listened felt embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The enthusiastic welcoming ceremony soon concluded, and Seon-Hyeok was escorted to his quarters.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A day passed, and he and the cavalry were called in by the commander.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I didn’t summon you to say anything distasteful, so please eat and listen comfortably.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the commander’s easygoing words, the riders began to devour the meat and soup offered to them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There will be an official notice soon, but you’ll all be rewarded greatly for your achievements in battle. I’m sure there will be significant money and promotions involved. In the case of the company commander, he’ll probably be promoted to senior knight without much issue.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The men, who had been focused on eating, quieted down to pay attention to the commander as he spoke about their rewards.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“However, all of that is a natural price for the royal family to pay to their loyal and brave soldiers. As such, I’m planning to give you all one additional reward using my authority as commander.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The cavalry had hopeful looks on their faces as they listened to the commander.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’ve spent so much time in battle. Don’t you think about your hometowns at all?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ahhh! Long live the commander!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A cheer hastily erupted even before the commander finished his words. He smiled softly and continued.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’ll be for a month, so please go see your families during that time. Things will get busy again once you get back. The royal envoy should be here by then, and anyone who returns late should be prepared to lose his special promotions and rewards.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hooray! You’re the best, commander!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Long live the commander!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the riders shouted in excitement, Seon-Hyeok stood there with an awkward expression, unable to join in on the celebrations.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He couldn’t return to his hometown, no matter how much he wanted to.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As he poked at his plate with a gloomy expression, the riders all rushed at him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Come with me!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you talking about? You should come with me. I already told everyone I’d bring you along the next time I visit!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tsk tsk. Why would you bring a guest to the remote countryside? It’s better for him to come to a busy place like my hometown.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The longing for his hometown and his feeling of exclusion soon dissipated. Seon-Hyeok smiled, seeing his fellow cavalry invite him along.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“All of you, fuck off. I’m taking him.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Come on, Hansen. You don’t want to take him, just to have your sister see him! You know what could happen!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were some dangerous suggestions mixed in, but Seon-Hyeok was able to shake off his gloomy feelings thanks to his comrades.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He didn’t answer immediately, since a decision did not have to be made then and there, and the riders all tried to introduce and talk up their hometowns as if they were travel agents.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In a way, this in itself was also a difficult situation. He didn’t know much about any of their hometowns, so he would have to make a decision based on his personal relationships with the riders. But at the same time, he also didn’t want to disappoint anyone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, his ultimate destination had already been decided. That night, the dragon spoke to him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Head north.]</span></p>
