 <p><strong>Chapter 323 - Dispute</strong></p>
 <p>These days, Nie Li had been using spiritual stones to tempt Jindan and he’d finally been able to thoroughly establish a firm connection with it. Basically, he didn’t have to worry about Jindan getting out of his control anymore.</p>
 <p>After Jindan entered the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting, it immediately awoke to the rich Heavenly Energy. It appeared extremely excited as it opened it’s mouth and started to frantically suck the energy in. Instantly, Jindan turned into a huge round ball twice its former size. Even the face shrank back until it almost disappeared.</p>
 <p>That little guy became round and plump and was no longer able to move. It landed on the flat ground between the hills. It’d probably take a long time to digest the Heavenly Energy within its body.</p>
 <p>This little guy’s ability to absorb Heavenly Energy was simply too powerful. Originally, Nie Li was a little worried that Jindan’s terrifying appetite might suck the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting dry. However, he realised that Jindan only absorbed a small portion of the Heavenly Energy within the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting and that the painting was still producing Heavenly Energy.</p>
 <p>Although Jindan still looked like a little guy, according to in Nie Li’s estimations, its strength shouldn’t be below a 3-fate expert. Its physical body was nearly invincible; right now, even a Martial Ancestor Realm expert would have an extremely hard time killing it.</p>
 <p>As of now, Jindan’s body wasn’t fully developed yet, and was still unable to enter combat. But if Jindan continued to absorb Heavenly Energy at this rate, then who knows?</p>
 <p>Yu Yan also looked extremely excited upon entering the painting. Her body was ignited with golden flames that burned several times stronger than when she was outside.</p>
 <p>Her cultivation had been increasing extremely fast and she’d already reached the 3-fate realm, at least. As to her actual level, Nie Li still couldn’t be sure. Furthermore, the might of those golden flames that Yu Yan unleashed were so frightening that even Nie Li couldn’t figure out their origins.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister Yu Yan, you can stay here to cultivate!” Nie Li lightly smiled.</p>
 <p>Yu Yan opened her eyes, pursed her lips into a smile, and nodded. “Okay.”</p>
 <p>Nie Li looked at the distant Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains. This place was equivalent to a realm of his own, where he could do quite a few stuff!</p>
 <p>A few thoughts flashed through Nie Li’s brain and he smiled. He’d already formulated his plans.</p>
 <p>Nie Li exited the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Paint and walked out of his room.</p>
 <p>Xiao Ning’er hadn’t moved a step as she guarded the door. When Nie Li came out, she finally loosened herself up and asked, “Nie Li, how did it go?”</p>
 <p>“It’s done. It’s already merged with my soul realm.” Nie Li nodded.</p>
 <p>Xiao Ning’er was a little astonished. She never imagined that Nie Li could actually break the seal on the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting. She started to admire him even more because of that fact. That was something that even that higher-up couldn’t accomplish. Nie Li had always been their leader, whether it was in the Tiny World or in the Draconic Ruins Realm. Therefore, her heart was filled with adoration towards him.</p>
 <p>Nie Li was together with Xiao Ning’er and he also tactfully declined a few gathering invitations. Xiao Ning’er also wanted to cherish the time she had with him.</p>
 <p>Nie Li and Xiao Ning’er stopped by Gu Bei’s courtyard to pass the counterfeit Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting to Gu Bei and remind him that this Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting was to quietly “disappear”.</p>
 <p>Nie Li had forged this Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting after he’d noticed the trance of intent left behind by that Martial Ancestor Realm expert. Gu Bei was shocked; at the same time, he couldn’t help admiring Nie Li a little. He never thought that Nie Li could actually come up with such an ingenious idea.</p>
 <p>“I understand! You can leave this to me! By the way, here are the newly acquired Dragon Bloodline Ordinary Level growth rate demon spirits!” Gu Bei passed an interspatial ring to Nie Li before getting busy with other matters.</p>
 <p>After receiving all those demon spirits from Gu Bei, Nie Li found a secluded place and started refining them inside the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting.</p>
 <p>Twilight slowly descended.</p>
 <p>Unlike the usual night, today’s night in Skysoul Institute was especially bustling. Almost all the institute’s students were moving along the paths that wound through the forest.</p>
 <p>The geniuses of the Skyblaze and Divine Feathers Sects were organising a grand gathering. Rumors claimed that there’d be sparring matches between the geniuses. The higher-ups of the three major sects had apparently arranged a generous award for the winner.</p>
 <p>However, Nie Li wasn’t interested that kind of sparring.</p>
 <p>Nie Li and Xiao Ning’er returned to their courtyard just as Xiao Yu walked in with his head lowered. When Xiao Yu raised his head, he saw them.</p>
 <p>“Ning’er, you’re here too?” Xiao Yu was rather surprised and showed an embarrassed and unnatural expression on his face.</p>
 <p>“Yep! Xiao Yu, we meet again.” Xiao Ning’er said with her lips pursed.</p>
 <p>“Xiao Yu, where have you been for past two days? Why haven’t I seen you at all?” Nie Li suddenly felt that there was something wrong with Xiao Yu‘s aura and he couldn’t help frowning. “Wait, you already reached 4-fate a while back. So, why have you dropped back to 3-fate? You’ve gone to the outside world?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah.” Xiao Yu replied as he bitterly smiled. He’d wanted to conceal that fact, but he’d been instantly exposed by Nie Li.</p>
 <p>“Who was it?” Nie Li’s face suddenly darkened as he emitted killing intent. With a flash of his thoughts, he understood that there was only one person who might go after Xiao Yu. Nie Li sought confirmation, “Was it Hua Ling?”</p>
 <p>Nie Li had experienced too many stuff in his previous life. Because of those experiences, the one thing he couldn’t tolerate was people hurting his friends!</p>
 <p>“Yeah.” Xiao Yu knew that he couldn’t hide it any longer and smiled bitterly. “I made a trip to the outside world. Originally, I wanted to send some stuff to an uncle of mine, but I never thought that Hua Ling would track me. After several twists and turns, I got killed by one of his underlings.”</p>
 <p>Luckily, before Xiao Yu headed for the outside world, he’d placed his fate soul in the soul hall.</p>
 <p>“How many forces does Hua Ling control in the outside world? What’s their location?” Nie Li asked while furrowing his brows.</p>
 <p>“Hua Ling’s forces in the outside world are pretty much concentrated in the norther region, near the Ling Jade Deity’s Lake. He has about sixty people, all of whom are Heavenly Fate Realm experts. Ninety percent of them are from the Little Heaven Realm,” said Xiao Yu. His heart trembled when he saw how enraged Nie Li was acting. Nie Li looked to be truly enraged; Xiao Yu was worried that he’d take rash actions. “Forget about it. They have too many people. With our strength, it’s impossible for us to confront them!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Ning’er also jumped to try and calm down Nie Li. “Nie Li, you haven’t reached 2-fate yet. Heading to the outside world is still too dangerous; furthermore, the other party has so many people!”</p>
 <p>Nie Li was well aware of the Ling Jade Deity’s Lake. It was a low-grade Deity’s Lake that was on the verge of drying up. Originally, it’d be impossible for people like Hua Ling to gain control of an entire Deity’s Lake. The only reason why Hua Ling could occupy it was because it produced too few spiritual stones!</p>
 <p>In the outside world, all kinds of forces were fighting for Deity’s Lakes. The more Deity’s Lakes a force could occupy, the more underlings they’d be able to recruit and expand their power. A small force like Hua Ling’s group was basically the pit bottom in the outside world.</p>
 <p>Hmph!</p>
 <p>“They killed someone from my side! How could I possibly not make them pay the price?” A chilling light flashed from Nie Li’s eyes as he patted Xiao Yu’s shoulders. “Don’t worry, I’ll help you get revenge!”</p>
 <p>When Nie Li patted his shoulders, Xiao Yu’s face turned slightly red as he winced a little, appearing embarrassed.</p>
 <p>Nie Li and Xiao Ning’er did not notice his expression.</p>
 <p>“Nie Li, what are you planning to do?” Xiao Ning’er asked as she looked at him. She’s worried that Nie Li might be acting rashly. After all, Nie Li is just a 1-fate.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, I know my limits. I won’t be the one to take actions!” Nie Li pondered for a brief moment, then continued, “Follow me, we’re going to meet someone!”</p>
 <p>With Xiao Yu and Xiao Ning’er in tow, Nie Li headed to Li Xingyun’s courtyard.</p>
 <p>Li Xingyun’s courtyard.</p>
 <p>One of Li Xingyun’s underlings, Li Hu, led the party inside. When they entered, they heard a dispute echoing from the hall.</p>
 <p>“Young Master Li has a guest?” Nie Li asked, looking at Li Hu with a puzzled expression.</p>
 <p>“Yes.” Li Hu nodded. His mood didn’t seem too good. “Please wait outside.”</p>
 <p>Nie Li looked in the direction of the hall and concentrated his attention on the dispute.</p>
 <p>Inside the hall were two well-dressed elders. One of them was having a dispute with Li Xingyun.</p>
 <p>The elder said in a solemn voice, “Xingyun, even we have to admit that your talent is indeed pretty good. But compared to Li Yufeng’s, it’s still inferior. Among the ten elders of our Ashen Flames Family, six of them have already decided that Li Yufeng should be the next Patriarch. As for the remaining four elders, two of them support Li Liushui, one supports you, and the other one gave up his vote. Li Liushui has already decided to step down from the Patriarch’s competition and is fully assisting Li Yufeng. We all wish for you to take the big picture into consideration.”</p>
 <p>Li Xingyun’s face was dull, but he looked unresigned, “Third elder, since Li Liushui has withdrawn from the competition, I’ll withdraw as well. However, I cannot agree to what you’ve requested. On what basis should I, Li Xingyun pass all my forces and business to Li Yufeng? How is he qualified to command my brothers and my businesses?”</p>
 <p>The third elder’s voice went cold, “In the Ashen Flames Family, only one Patriarch is enough!”</p>
 <p>“I never said that the Ashen Flames Family requires two Patriarchs. For all the previous patriarchs, none of them have ever taken over the forces of successor candidates. Why should I?” Li Xingyun said proudly.</p>
 <p>“Li Xingyun, are you pretending not to know?”</p>
 <p>“Pretending not to know? I don’t understand. He, Li Yufeng, is indeed stronger than me in terms of strength. But his underlings are pitiful! He wants to have all my brothers follow him? Sure! If he can gain the consent of all my brothers. No matter what terms you offer, as long as they are willing to leave, I will not prevent them!” Li Xingyun said in a solemn voice as he looked at the third elder.</p>
 <p>The third elder frowned. Even he couldn’t help admiting that Li Xingyun was indeed capable, since all of his underlings were unswerving in loyalty. They’d all tried several methods to threaten and bribe them, but no one was willing to submit to Li Yufeng.</p>
