 <p><strong>Chapter 249 - Probe</strong></p>
 <p>Nie Li could sense a terrifying aura emanating from the other party.</p>
 <p>A violent wave of energy surged towards him, even stronger than before. The other party’s cultivation has probably advanced even faster after he reached the fifth floor of the Black Infernal Tower.</p>
 <p>Just as Nie Li was about to sit down and cultivate, the white clothed youth suddenly stood up and shot numerous black chains towards Nie Li from all directions.</p>
 <p>Acting already without a word?</p>
 <p>Sensing the chains bearing down at him, Nie Li quickly leapt away.</p>
 <p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p>
 <p>The entire fifth floor was engulfed in a berserk amount of energy.</p>
 <p>“I never imagined that we would meet here.” The white clothed youth coldly smiled, but didn’t slow the attacks from his hand.</p>
 <p>“This is also rather unexpected for me, Demon Lord.” Nie Li coldly snorted as he glared at the Demon Lord.</p>
 <p>“So, you’ve already guessed who I am!” The Demon Lord said as his hands quickly formed a seal. His body rapidly transformed into a gigantic demon that was about five to six meters tall with eight arms. He waved his huge fists, containing the Law of Hell, towards Nie Li.</p>
 <p>“If I couldn’t even guess that much, then I’d be really stupid!” Nie Li was secretly astonished as he looked at the Demon Lord who had merged with his demon spirit. Nie Li never thought that the demon beast that the Demon Lord integrated with would actually be the extremely rare Eight-Armed Darkhell Fiend. That kind of creature only appears in the Hell Realm. It has extremely powerful strength and is also tended to have a multitude of frightening combat abilities. Overall, it was a rather mysterious and unknown creature.</p>
 <p>Even Nie Li himself only knew of a few of its abilities.</p>
 <p>Nie Li could sense that the Demon Lord’s insight on the Law of Hell has already reached an extremely frightening level, he’s only a step away from a Spiritual God!</p>
 <p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p>
 <p>The Law of Hell exploded all around. One of the attacks suddenly landed too close to Nie Li and the huge impact mercilessly struck his back and sent him flying.</p>
 <p>A trace of blood leaked from the corner of Nie Li’s mouth and he felt as though his internal organs were going to explode. He leapt up, landed on the wall, and issued a furious roar towards the sky. The Laws of Light and Darkness rapidly gathered and formed into black and white light spheres.</p>
 <p>Yin-Yang Blast x10!</p>
 <p>*Woosh!* *Woosh!*</p>
 <p>The black and white spheres of light revolved around each other as they flew toward the Eight-Armed Darkhell Fiend.</p>
 <p>When the two spheres of light collided, a massive explosion resounded as the Demon Lord became engulfed in the powerful blast. Even Nie Li himself was swept away by the Yin-Yang Blast’s formidable power.</p>
 <p>A Yin-Yang Blast x10 like that could even kill a Demigod rank expert!</p>
 <p>“Is he dead?” Nie Li crossed his forearms to block the shockwave that was rippling towards him. He raised his head, unsure if the Demon Lord had died. After all, he was still unclear of the Demon Lord’s true strength.</p>
 <p>Before the power of the Yin-Yang Blast had settled, the large Eight-Armed Darkhell Fiend suddenly materialised next to Nie Li. His movements were so fast that even Nie Li couldn’t react in time. The Eight-Armed Darkhell Fiend grabbed his right leg with two of its arms and ruthlessly smash him against the ground.</p>
 <p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p>
 <p>The strength of that Eight-Armed Darkhell Fiend were inexhaustible as he constantly lifted Nie Li up and smashing onto the ground.</p>
 <p>It’s simply impossible to withstand this terrifying energy and Nie Li felt as though his internal organs were about to explode as his body rapidly shrank and turned back into his human appearance.</p>
 <p>*Plop* *Plop*</p>
 <p>Black and white wings grew from his back as huge white bones arm guard were formed with Law of Death on his arms, withstanding the attacks of that Eight-Armed Darkhell Fiend.</p>
 <p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p>
 <p>The two figures left afterimages as they exchanged moves in the fifth floor of the Black Infernal Tower.</p>
 <p>The frightening shockwaves wreaked havoc to their surroundings.</p>
 <p>If the Black Infernal Tower wasn’t so sturdy, or if it was some other ordinary tower instead, it would’ve definitely been torn apart by the rampant energy.</p>
 <p>“I have to admit that your talent is very frightening. To think that you’ve actually gained insights on three types of Law Energy! However, compared to my Supreme Body, you’re still lacking too much. Destiny has decided that you’re not on par with me!” The Demon Lord furiously roared as the Eight-Armed Darkhell Fiend’s body turned scarlet red as its strength rose by another level.</p>
 <p>Nie Li could sense the frightening pressure bearing down on him. The Demon Lord was definitely the most powerful opponent he has faced so far in this life. With only his current strength, he was still no match for him.</p>
 <p>Prison of Ten Thousand Souls!</p>
 <p>The Demon Lord roared in rage, raised his fist, and attacked Nie Li. His fist seemed to be holding countless souls that wailed in grief. The horrendous pressure bore down, layer by layer, as if it would crush everything to dust.</p>
 <p>In his heart, Nie Li was shocked. This energy was simply too powerful! He immediately used the Law of Death and formed layers of bone walls between them.</p>
 <p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p>
 <p>The bone walls were destroyed one layer after another.</p>
 <p>Nie Li tried to search for a weakness in the Demon Lord’s technique; however, the Demon Lord was simply too powerful. His control over his energy has already reached a level of perfection that not even Nie Li could rival.</p>
 <p>Sensing that Nie Li was being overpowered, Yu Yan, who has been hiding and watching this whole exchange, couldn’t endure anymore. She waved her hand and a wall of flame gathered in front of Nie Li. In addition, countless chains of flame materialised that snaked and slithered towards the Demon Lord.</p>
 <p>The Demon Lord’s Prison of Ten Thousand Souls broke through Nie Li’s bone walls and slowed a little when it came in contact with Yu Yan’s fire wall. Upon sensing the fire snakes slithering towards him, the Demon Lord waved all eight arms and grabbed them.</p>
 <p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p>
 <p>The fire snakes exploded.</p>
 <p>“So your helper is finally willing to show herself!” The Demon Lord took several steps back and the corner of his mouth curled into a cold smile.</p>
 <p>Nie Li wiped a trace of blood from the corner of his mouth. Although he still has a few methods to preserve his own life from the Demon Lord, if the battle dragged on, there wouldn’t be any chances of winning. The Demon Lord was simply too powerful! Furthermore, Nie Li could sense that the Demon Lord was still hiding powerful demonic energy within his body. If that energy was released, the end result would definitely be frightening, to say the least.</p>
 <p>Yu Yan flew into the sky as she coldly glared at the Demon Lord before her. She was prepared to go all out at any moment. However, within Yu Yan’s heart, even she understood that it might not be a sure fight against the Demon Lord.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the Demon Lord’s body shrank and reverted to his original appearance. He looked at Nie Li and said, “From this battle, I can at least confirm that you’re not a Spiritual Constellation expert. I wonder, what methods you used to acquire your current cultivation and knowledge? You’ve piqued my interest. Today, I’m not in a rush to kill you. Instead, I’ll wait to see what level you’ll reach in the future!”</p>
 <p>From the very start, the Demon Lord had no intention to kill Nie Li; he was only trying to probe his strength.</p>
 <p>“Whether or not you can kill me at all is still the problem, isn’t it?” Nie Li’s brows twitched as he bluffed, trying not to appear as the weaker one. Although his current strength was only at Legend rank, he has countless other secret techniques that could push his potential to the limit. He was still capable of dealing with the Demon Lord. It’s just that he was unsure of how many cards the Demon Lord still has up his sleeve; therefore, Nie Li himself didn’t need to risk all of his own cards either, for the moment.</p>
 <p>“Oh? You’re pretty confident!” The Demon Lord narrowed his eyes and gave Nie Li a once-over. Although Nie Li’s raw strength was weaker than his, he could sense that Nie Li still has many cards hidden up his sleeve.</p>
 <p>This was also why he gave up on trying to kill Nie Li. His cultivation was teetering at the most crucial point; therefore, there was no need to waste even more effort on unnecessary people.</p>
 <p>The Demon Lord eyed Yu Yan, who was floating in the sky. If he guessed correctly, the tiny woman should be a Spiritual God who had reconstructed her body. Her strength was also unmeasurable.</p>
 <p>The Demon Lord thought inwardly to himself, ‘I should head to the Draconic Ruins Realm first before worrying about anything else.’</p>
 <p>On the fifth floor of the Black Infernal Tower, the situation was in deadlock. Both Nie Li and the Demon Lord resumed their cultivations separately. Although there were still traces of enmity between them, neither of them took any action.</p>
 <p>This kind of situation must make the anatta mental state even more difficult to reach!</p>
 <p>The ninth layer of the Nine-Layered Deathlands</p>
 <p>The Nether Master and the rest were discussing quietly among themselves.</p>
 <p>“The talent of these two are extraordinary! Even the demon spirits they’ve integrated with are extremely powerful! It seems almost impossible to divide the two in terms of superiority!” Tian Hun laughed.</p>
 <p>“I’m afraid not. The white clothed youth should be slightly stronger. However, the other one’s strength isn’t weak either!”</p>
 <p>Ling Yun slightly furrowed her brows. She could see that both Nie Li and the Demon Lord had reserved some of their strength.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yu was listening from the sidelines. From the beginning he felt that Nie Li was not an ordinary person. He believed that if Nie Li and the Demon Lord had continued their fight, it would be nearly impossible for anyone to predict who would win or lose. From a young age, Xiao Yu had followed his father to the Divine Feathers Sect to cultivate. Now, for the first time, someone from the Tiny Word had piqued his interest.</p>
 <p>“I never thought that Yu Yan would also appear.” Ling Yun smiled.</p>
 <p>Tian Hun took a sip of the tea as he lightly said, “Yu Yan is just a lower Spiritual God who should still be unaware of the Draconic Ruins Realm.”</p>
 <p>Among the seven of them, aside from the Nether Master, none had ever cared to show themselves, even for the great war that occurred between the Spiritual Gods. Therefore, Spiritual Gods like Yu Yan and the rest shouldn’t know of their existences!</p>
 <p>The Nether Master pondered for a brief moment before saying, “Although Yu Yan is only a lower Spiritual God, when she was attacked by so many experts during the great war between Spiritual Gods, none of them could extinguish her soul. In the end, she was forced to hide herself in the Black Spring. She’s also the only Spiritual God that the demon clan can’t rest easy with. In my opinion, why don’t we let her follow her companion into the Divine Feathers Sect and see what happens?”</p>
 <p>“You can make the decision on that matter.” The remaining experts replied with a light smile.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the Nether Master sensed something as his a radiant light suddenly flashed across his eyes.</p>
 <p>“A guest has come to our Nether Realm. Let us meet him!” said the Nether Master as he turned into a black fog and rapidly disappeared.</p>
 <p>“A guest?” Xiao Yu glanced towards the direction his father disappeared from with a puzzled expression. Just who was the guest that his father spoke of? He glanced at the faces of the remaining six experts. Everyone had a chilly expression. Perhaps, could it be…?</p>
