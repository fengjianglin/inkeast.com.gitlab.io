 <p><strong>Chapter 454 - Exchange</strong></p>
 <p>Since the Sect Master of the Divine Feathers Sect was Nie Li, if Xiu Ming wanted to do anything to Nie Li, that would mean starting a war with the entire Divine Feathers Sect. Add the change in Nangong Xianyin’s tone of voice, Xiu Ming temporarily suppressed the rage within his heart while gauging the situation.</p>
 <p>Nie Li appeared to be very casual at this moment as he took a sip of tea before speaking, “The Myriad Ancestor Sword!”</p>
 <p>Hearing Nie Li’s words, whether it was Nangong Xianyin or Xiu Ming, both of their eyes were wide as they stared at Nie Li.</p>
 <p>Nie Li was joking, right?</p>
 <p>He actually wanted the fragment of the Myriad Ancestor Sword?!</p>
 <p>The Myriad Ancestor Sword had a total of seven fragments, which were divided between the seven Major Sects, and kept by their various Sect Masters.</p>
 <p>That item was the Sacred Artifact of the various sects! And, right now, Nie Li actually spoke of it so casually and even wanted one of its fragments from Nangong Xianyin!</p>
 <p>Xiu Ming was completely speechless. That fellow, Nie Li, didn’t have his head sandwiched by a door, right?!</p>
 <p>“The fragments of the Myriad Ancestor Sword?” Nangong Xianyin’s brows were slightly furrowed. If it was someone else that wanted the fragments of the Myriad Ancestor Sword, she would have straightforwardly ordered them to leave. But when it came to Nie Li, she didn’t dare to offend him.</p>
 <p>There wasn’t any other reason but the fact that Nie Li possessed the elixirs that she would yearn for even in her dreams.</p>
 <p>Although it was impossible for her to give her fragment of the Myriad Ancestor Sword over to Nie Li, she didn’t have any intentions of chasing Nie Li away.</p>
 <p>“May I know the reason why Sect Master Nie wants the fragment of the Myriad Ancestor Sword?” Nangong Xianyin couldn’t help enquiring his motive.</p>
 <p>“No reason, it’s just interesting. Speaking of which, the name of the Myriad Ancestor Sword’s fragments is extremely huge and frightening. However, it is just a toy and Sect Master Nangong should be very clear in this matter. Aside from being extremely sharp, there isn’t any other usage to this, is there?” Nie Li said as he lightly smiled.</p>
 <p>The Godslayer Artifact - Myriad Ancestor Sword was indeed extremely powerful. However, what was in the hands of Nangong Xianyin wasn’t a complete Godslayer Artifact. It was just a mere fragment of it.</p>
 <p>Although it was extremely precious, there wasn’t any significance to it.</p>
 <p>“Although it is not significant, it is still an item of continued tradition of the Heavenly Note Sect.” Nangong Xianyin shook her head as she continued, “This item is something that can’t be easily given to others.”</p>
 <p>“In the vast Heavenly Note Sect, even if there isn’t ten thousand, there should be at least eight thousand items with such traditions. My trip here, naturally, didn’t wish for Sect Master Nangong to gift the fragment of the Myriad Ancestor Sword to me, since I, naturally, don’t have that much of a reputation.” Nie Li laughed.</p>
 <p>“I hope Sect Master Nie can be forgiving.” As Nangong Xianyin spoke, her voice was floating like a fairy.</p>
 <p>“Speaking of which, the fragment of the Myriad Ancestor Sword is just an useless item in the hands of Sect Master Nangong. Why don’t we make an exchange, which is more practical for the Heavenly Note Sect.” Nie Li carried on, “The Demon God Sect is restless now, along with a few other Demonic Sects glaring like tigers. Shouldn’t Sect Master Nangong think more about the entire Heavenly Note Sect?”</p>
 <p>“Speak no longer, Sect Master Nie. Our Heavenly Note Sect would definitely not exchange the Myriad Ancestor Sword’s fragment for anything.” Nangong Xianyin firmly rejected.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be in a rush to reject, Sect Master Nangong. Those elixirs that were given to you by Ning’er and Ziyun were just the more primary ones. In my possession, I have a sacred elixir that’s a hundredfold more effective…” Nie Li said with a little casual.</p>
 <p>Hearing Nie Li’s words, Nangong Xianyin’s heart violently thumped. The elixirs that were previously given to her by Ning’er and Ziyun already had such frightening effects to the point that she and a few elders could make a direct breakthrough in their cultivation. Just how powerful would the elixir that possessed a hundredfold effect be?</p>
 <p>Just where did Nie Li get those elixirs from?</p>
 <p>As the Sect Master of the Heavenly Note Sect, it wasn’t proper for her to question such a private matter. Furthermore, even if she did enquire, Nie Li might not even answer her.</p>
 <p>She had to admit, the value and meaning of such an elixir to the Heavenly Note Sect was too huge.</p>
 <p>With those elixirs, there could be another Martial Ancestor Realm expert of the 5-Stage or even the 6-Stage!</p>
 <p>Just like what Nie Li had said, the Demonic Sects were eyeing them. If a war were to break out, even the Heavenly Note Sect would not be at peace. If the Sect were to lose, what’s the use of having a fragment of the Myriad Ancestor Sword?</p>
 <p>Nangong Xianyin pondered for a brief moment before clenching her teeth, “We will definitely not exchange the fragment of the Myriad Ancestor Sword. I’m afraid that I will have to disappoint Sect Master Nie.”</p>
 <p>Xiu Ming was a little curious about the elixir that Nie Li had spoken about. Just what is it? Even if the fragment of the Myriad Ancestor Sword was precious, Nangong Xianyin actually had traces of being moved by it. Could the elixir that he spoke of be something formidable?</p>
 <p>“Two elixirs.” Nie Li lightly said as he added on, “I’m willing to give you two elixirs for the exchange. I wonder if Sect Master Nangong is willing?”</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry…” Nangong Xianyin hesitated for brief moment before rejecting firmly.</p>
 <p>“Five elixirs…” Nie Li continued without batting an eyelid.</p>
 <p>Hearing Nie Li’s words, Nangong Xianyin could no longer withstand the shock within her heart. That was five elixirs! Even as the Sect Master of the Heavenly Note Sect, even she was deeply shocked by Nie Li’s wealth. She gradually understood why Nie Li was able to become the Sect Master of the Divine Feathers Sect and also why Nie Li brought along three new Martial Ancestor Realms when he came here.</p>
 <p>God knows how many Martial Ancestor Realm experts were in the Divine Feathers Sect right now.</p>
 <p>The amount should be extremely frightening!</p>
 <p>“Not possible…” Nangong Xianyin calmly shook her head.</p>
 <p>“Since Sect Master Nangong is unwilling to part with it, then I can only give it up.” Nie Li sighed. “I’ll leave after I meet Ziyun and Ning’er.”</p>
 <p>‘It seems like those elixirs were still insufficient to move Sect Master Nangong’s heart.’ Xiu Ming pondered in his heart. It seems like that so-called ‘elixir’ wasn’t that much of a big deal after all.</p>
 <p>When Nie Li finished speaking, he heard Nangong Xianyin’s voice, “Sect Master Nie, please hold your steps.”</p>
 <p>“Sect Master Nangong, is there still anything to say?” Nie Li pretended to be at a loss as he asked as light flickered across his eyes.</p>
 <p>“I’ve thought about it. Since Sect Master Nie is so interested in the fragment of the Myriad Ancestor Sword, then I can only part with it.” Although Nangong Xianyin’s voice was calm, her bright face flashed across with a smear of redness.</p>
 <p>As the Sect Master of the Heavenly Note Sect, she was actually so philistine. It was, indeed, a huge loss to her face!</p>
 <p>Truth be told, when Nie Li was willing to fork out five elixirs, Nangong Xianyin’s heart was wildly thumping. She clearly understood the meaning behind those five elixirs. However, in order to swindle Nie Li, she could only suppress the raging waves within her heart and reject him. Hence, when Nie Li called off the deal, she immediately went back on her words.</p>
 <p>If she were to miss those five elixirs, she would definitely regret it for the rest of her life!</p>
 <p>Even if she had to make the exchange with the Myriad Ancestor Sword, she would not hesitate!</p>
 <p>Five elixirs was sufficient to protect the Heavenly Note Sect from the disturbance of those Demonic Sects for a few hundred years. They might even be able to defeat the Demon God Sect to wipe away their past shame!</p>
 <p>Although the fragment of the Myriad Ancestor Sword was precious and was an item of continued tradition of being passed down, it was still something useless. If the Heavenly Note Sect could not be protected, what’s the use of having a fragment? Nangong Xianyin had, naturally, weighed the differences!</p>
