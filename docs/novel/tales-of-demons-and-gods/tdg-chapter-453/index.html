 <p><strong>Chapter 453 - A Request</strong></p>
 <p>Nie Li lightly smiled, “I have several motives in coming to the Heavenly Note Sect. First, naturally, is to pay a visit to Sect Master Nangong. Second would be to meet some of my friends and the last is to request an item from Sect Master Nangong!”</p>
 <p>“The people that Sect Master Nie wants to meet should be Xiao Ning’er and Ye Ziyun of our Heavenly Note Sect, right?” Nangong Xianyin looked at Nie Li as she added, “Just like you, she came from the Tiny World.”</p>
 <p>“Sect Master Nangong has guessed correctly. The two friends of mine are, indeed, Xiao Ning’er and Ye Ziyun.” Nie Li said as he lightly smiled.</p>
 <p>“I’ll send some people to inform the two of them and to get them to come.” Nangong Xianyin lightly smiled.</p>
 <p>Hearing Nie Li’s words, a flash of bizarre flashed across Xiu Ming’s eyes. Those two talented girls of the Heavenly Note Sect possessed outstanding talent and was paid with great attention from the various major sects, which made many youths wish to get close to them. But, who could have expected that those two were from the Tiny World and had some relationship with Nie Li?</p>
 <p>“I’ll have to inconvenience Sect Master Nangong.” Nie Li said with his hands cupped.</p>
 <p>“I wonder what’s Ye Ziyun and Xiao Ning’er’s relationship with Sect Master Nie?” Xiu Ming couldn’t help smiling as he enquired.</p>
 <p>“Truth be told, the two of them are my childhood sweethearts. Especially Ziyun, she’s my fiancée.” Nie Li calmly smiled.</p>
 <p>Hearing Nie Li’s words, everyone in the hall was startled.</p>
 <p>Ye Ziyun and Xiao Ning’er are both his childhood sweethearts?</p>
 <p>Not to mention that the two of them are from the Heavenly Note Sect. The girls from the Heavenly Note Sect were not allowed to marry, not to mention that the two of them possessed outstanding talents and cold attitudes. How could those two talented girls fall for the same guy?</p>
 <p>Hearing Nie Li’s words, Xiu Ming laughed, “Brother Nie does know how to joke around.”</p>
 <p>“I’m not!” Nie Li extended out his hands. He was, indeed, speaking of the truth, so why didn’t anyone believe him?</p>
 <p>A servant-dressed person that stood beside Xiu Ming laughed, “Sect Master Nie, aren’t you thinking too much? To say that Xiao Ning’er and Ye Ziyun are both your childhood sweethearts. You’re simply having a pipe dream!”</p>
 <p>Nie Li shrugged and said with an indifferent attitude, “It’s up to you guys to believe me or not.”</p>
 <p>Seeing Nie Li’s expression, Xiu Ming’s face gradually turned dark. He vaguely had a feeling that Nie Li was speaking the truth. This made an uncontrollable rage rise within his heart. The two talented girls of the Heavenly Note Sect, Ye Ziyun and Xiao Ning’er, whom he did not dare to have any presumptuous thoughts about, not to mention that Ye Ziyun was being nurtured as the next Sect Master. Previously, when he met with Xiao Ning’er, he fell in love at first sight for her and swore to take her as his wife. He used various methods to get those around Xiao Ning’er to convey his intentions, but was rejected by her.</p>
 <p>If Xiao Ning’er was, indeed, Nie Li’s childhood sweetheart, then Nie Li would have to die!</p>
 <p>Xiu Ming’s eyes flashed with a smear of cold.</p>
 <p>Naturally, this was noticed by Nie Li. Nie Li’s expression was cold. He didn’t have much understanding towards this person in his previous life and, therefore, he didn’t know if Xiu Ming was good or bad. If Xiu Ming had any thoughts for Ye Ziyun and Xiao Ning’er, then Nie Li would naturally let him know who's women he should not lay his hands on.</p>
 <p>Nangong Xianyin coldly sneered, “I wonder if Sect Master Nie knows of Heavenly Note Sect’s rules?”</p>
 <p>“The rules of the Heavenly Note Sect?” Nie Li’s brows slightly twitched, “Which doesn’t allow any disciples to marry?”</p>
 <p>“Correct, since Sect Master Nie knows about it, then I believe I don’t have to add anything about it.” Nangong Xianyin coldly snorted as a cold pressure started to spread throughout the hall.</p>
 <p>Nie Li had publicly announced that Ye Ziyun was his fiancée, which violated the great rule of the Heavenly Note Sect. Naturally, Nangong Xianyin would not sit around and do nothing.</p>
 <p>Hearing Nangong Xianyin’s words, Xiu Ming tugged his chest as he sat upright in his seat, revealing a faintly discernable sneer. Since the Sect Master of the Heavenly Note Sect had spoken, then he would, naturally, not have to take any actions.</p>
 <p>“Rules are dead, whereas humans are alive. However, my trip here today is not to fight with Sect Master Nangong.” Nie Li smiled as he looked at Nangong Xianyin, “Previously, I’d entrust Ziyun and Ning’er to send some pills for Sect Master Nangong, I wonder how are the effects of those pills?”</p>
 <p>Hearing Nie Li’s earlier, Nangong Xianyin’s face turned extremely ugly. But when she heard the latter sentence, she was dumbfounded.</p>
 <p>Those pills were from Nie Li?</p>
 <p>The anger on Nangong Xianyin’s face was gradually concealed as she revealed a thoughtful expression. Sometime back, Xiao Ning’er and Ye Ziyun both gave her some pills and the effects of those pills were extremely powerful, causing the cultivation of her and several elders of the Heavenly Note Sect to have some astonishing advancements. So much so that she managed to breakthrough from 6-Stage Martial Ancestor Realm to 7-Stage Martial Ancestor Realm, which had a significant meaning to the Heavenly Note Sect.</p>
 <p>If those pills were from Nie Li, then Nie Li had made a huge contribution to the entire Heavenly Note Sect.</p>
 <p>As for the rage that rose up earlier on, Nangong Xianyin had quickly suppressed it.</p>
 <p>“Pills?” Xiu Ming’s eyes flashed with a trace of doubt as he looked at Nangong Xianyin and Nie Li. He clearly had no idea what pills Nie Li was talking about, but he could judge from Nangong Xianyin’s expression. The rage that she had earlier on had already been suppressed.</p>
 <p>Although he had no idea what happened, Xiu Ming could vaguely sense that this matter wasn’t simple.</p>
 <p>“Since Sect Master Nie has paid a visit to our Heavenly Note Sect, I wonder if you can stay long enough for me to treat you to some tea?” Nangong Xianyin wanted to ask Nie Li where he get those pills and she did not neglect this opportunity. However, there were too many people in the hall and, henceforth, this discussion had to be done secretly.</p>
 <p>“No rush. Ziyun and Ning’er have yet to arrive. Furthermore, I have a request in coming to the Heavenly Note Sect.” Nie Li lightly smiled as he said.</p>
 <p>“Earlier, Sect Master Nie had said that you’re requesting an item from our Heavenly Note Sect, I wonder what this is about?” Nangong Xianyin just recalled that matter and enquired, “Sect Master Nie can just tell me. My Heavenly Note Sect will definitely do our utmost best.”</p>
 <p>Nangong Xianyin’s tone was extremely polite, which caused everyone in the hall to be puzzled, this included Xiu Ming. Just what made Sect Master Nangong’s attitude change so fast?</p>
 <p>As the Sect Master of Heavenly Note Sect, Nangong Xianyin was also an Martial Ancestor Realm expert. Her status was extraordinary, but she was so polite to Nie Li. Just what does that mean? It’s, indeed, something worth pondering about.</p>
 <p>Xiu Ming’s deep gaze fell onto Nie Li as he sized the latter up. At such a young age, Nie Li was already the Sect Master of the Divine Feathers Sect and, hence, there was definitely more to this youth before him than meets the eyes!</p>
