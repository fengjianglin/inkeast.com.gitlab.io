 <p><strong>Chapter 377 - Thousand Illusionary Array</strong></p>
 <p>Nie Li smiled, looked at Wu Yazi and said, “If you wanted to kill us, we’d already be dead.”</p>
 <p>It was true. Nie Li and Xiao Yu were only Heavenly Fate Realm experts. An even match against Wu Yazi was impossible.</p>
 <p>“Thank your lucky stars that I’m the one you encountered,” Wu Yazi shrugged.</p>
 <p>Nie Li calmly looked ahead at Wu Yazi. “Since we came to the outside world, we’re prepared to die. Luck has no part in this.”</p>
 <p>Nie Li had no idea about the origins of this demon clan youth.</p>
 <p>Wu Yazi swept his eyes over the pair. “The two of you have some traces of space-time aura on you!”</p>
 <p>A peculiar light flashed through his eyes.</p>
 <p>Nie Li heart trembled; he never thought that Wu Yazi would have such sharp senses. He paid close attention to the changes in expression on Wu Yazi’s face.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yu silently stood beside Nie Li. She understood that Wu Yazi’s strength far surpassed their own. If she said too much, they could be killed; therefore, she remained silent.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. I don’t have any grudges with either of you, and I wouldn’t do anything to you without a reason,” Wu Yazi shrugged. He looked back at them and continued, “So the two of you are also here for the Void Illusionary Divine Palace?”</p>
 <p>Void Illusionary Divine Palace?</p>
 <p>Nie Li knitted his brows slightly as he thought over those words.</p>
 <p>Wu Yazi was confused for a moment when he saw Nie Li and Xiao Yu’s blank faces. “So you aren’t here for the Void Illusionary Divine Palace? Then, what are you doing here? Don’t you know that this area is really dangerous?”</p>
 <p>Nie Li recalled his information on the Void Illusionary Divine Palace. It was a grand palace left behind by a supreme expert from ancient times. The doors to the palace only opened once every six years. Countless experts flocked to it whenever that happened, because there were many treasures concealed within.</p>
 <p>In his previous life, Nie Li had heard many legends about the Void Illusionary Divine Palace. There were many treasures hidden there, as well as many dangers.</p>
 <p>In roughly sixty years, the Demon God’s Sect would invade the Void Illusionary Divine Palace and open that ancient almighty’s treasury.</p>
 <p>Wu Yazi considered something for a moment, then said, “I’m asking you too many unnecessary questions. You’re only Heavenly Fate Realm experts, after all; entering the Void Illusionary Divine Palace is simply walking to your deaths.” He then waved his hand and said, “You two should leave this place. Quickly!”</p>
 <p>It’d be extremely difficult for Nie Li and Xiao Yu to enter the Void Illusionary Divine Palace with their current strength. If they ran into another demon clan expert, they’d definitely die.</p>
 <p>Nie Li pretended to be casual as he asked, “Why were those two demon clan experts chasing you?”</p>
 <p>“Pshhh! How could those two morons be my opponents? There are a total of six spiritual halls in the Demon God’s Sect. Those guys are from the Fire Spiritual Hall, while I’m from the Water Spiritual Hall. A while ago, I found an unknown item close to the Void Illusionary Divine Palace. Some guys tried to snatch it from me, so I killed a few of them. After that, they started chasing me! I could easily kill them just by playing around, but I can’t afford to reveal myself. That’s why I can’t be bothered to swat them out!” Wu Yazi said with a prideful attitude.</p>
 <p>“An unknown item? What was it?” Nie Li asked after some pondering.</p>
 <p>“Since you two are just Heavenly Fate Realm experts, there’s no harm in showing you.” Wu Yazi obviously didn’t think very highly of either of them; he wasn’t even on guard against them. With a smile, he brought a round and sparkling red stone, roughly the size of a fist. Although there weren’t any energy ripples coming from it, the surface of the stone looked like it was boiling.</p>
 <p>“This is the item! I don’t know what it is, but I can tell that it’s something good!” Wu Yazi said in an excited tone. He’d decided that there wouldn’t be a problem in chatting with Nie Li and Xiao Yu, especially since he didn’t have anything else to do while he was hiding. He’d hide here for just a little while longer. As for Nie Li and Xiao Yu, he’d probably forget that they even existed.</p>
 <p>Nie Li looked at the rock in Wu Yazi’s hand and involuntarily let out a laugh. “Scarlet Mist Rock?”</p>
 <p>“You know what this is?” Wu Yazi’s mood instantly brightened as he looked at Nie Li with expectation.</p>
 <p>Nie Li shrugged and said, “Yeah, I know what it is. It’s a Scarlet Mist Rock. It’s rather uncommon, but it’s no treasure. At the very best, you can use it to forge a Grade 5 artifact.”</p>
 <p>“That’s impossible! Are you lying to me?” Wu Yazi instantly glared at Nie Li on alert. “I don’t believe it! There’s no way that something uncommon or rare isn’t a treasure!”</p>
 <p>“Just because it’s hard to find doesn’t mean it’s a treasure. If you don’t believe me, feel free to flip through the Craftgods Book at the Gods Craft Pavilion, page seven hundred sixty-one,” Nie Li replied with an indifferent shrug.</p>
 <p>“Craftgods Book? I think I have a copy with me!” Wu Yazi immediately started searching in his interspatial ring. A while later, he pulled out a tattered book. “I ripped out a few pages for toilet paper, but it’s still readable. I wonder if page seven hundred sixty-one is still here?”</p>
 <p>Wu Yazi flipped to the right page, and there it was — an introduction on the Scarlet Mist Rock, which accurately described the stone he was holding.</p>
 <p>His expression instantly turned ugly, as though accidently he’d swallowed a fly.</p>
 <p>“I wasted so much effort on this crap? I killed a dozen guys over this?” Wu Yazi said, indignantly. He felt dejected as he recalled the earlier pursuit.</p>
 <p>Nie Li laughed and said, “Next time, you should read a few more books before you fight![1. This is a straight-up insult in Chinese. If someone tells you to “go read more books”, they’re literally calling you an idiot.]</p>
 <p>Wu Yazi made a dismissive motion with his hand and said, “Get lost! I hate reading. The old man at home makes me read stuff every single day. I’m almost annoyed to death!” He stopped to ponder something for a brief moment, then looked their way, and said, “Well, it’s in my possession, anyways. Even if it’s not a treasure, it’s still rare. I’ll probably make quite a profit if I sell it to my friends. They definitely won’t recognise it!”</p>
 <p>Nie Li and XiaoYu were speechless at Wu Yazi’s words. You probably had to sin in eight lifetimes for fate to arrange Wu Yazi as your friend.</p>
 <p>Wu Yazi re-examined Nie Li and said, “You might be only a Heavenly Fate Realm, but who would’ve thought that you’d be so knowledgeable?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yu also couldn’t help glancing at Nie Li. She, too, extremely admired Nie Li for his knowledge.</p>
 <p>Nie Li looked at Wu Yazi, smiled, and said, “If you go into the Void Illusionary Divine Palace like that, you definitely won’t be able to find anything.”</p>
 <p>“Do you know about the Void Illusionary Divine Palace too?” Wu Yazi couldn’t help looking at Nie Li with eagerness.</p>
 <p>Nie Li thought things over, then said, “I do know a few things.”</p>
 <p>Wu Yazi didn’t seem to be a reliable person. Even if they entered the Void Illusionary Divine Palace and obtained a few treasures, Wu Yazi would definitely steal them for himself!</p>
 <p>Wu Yazi’s brows twitched, “In hundreds of thousands of years, countless Martial Ancestor Realm experts couldn’t even break the Thousand Illusionary Array outside the Void Illusionary Divine Palace. They weren’t able to enter it. However, there have been a few who’ve managed to get in by accident and returned with quite a few good items.” Wu Yazi’s eyes rolled and continued, “Do you guys want to go in with me?”</p>
 <p>Nie Li shook his head and firmly replied, “The Ten Thousand Illusionary Array isn’t that hard to break. However, the two of us are only Heavenly Fate Realm experts. We’d be walking to our deaths. I’d rather not go.”</p>
