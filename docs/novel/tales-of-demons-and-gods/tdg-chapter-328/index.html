 <p><strong>Chapter 328 - Second Fate Soul</strong></p>
 <p>Gu Heng thought it was a secret that he’d poisoned Gu Lan and clogged her meridians. However, Gu Tianlong and his men had already investigated the truth to its end. However, they faced a problem. Now that Gu Lan was out of the picture, Gu Heng was left as the only one amongst the younger generation who possessed a Dragon Bloodline God Level growth rate demon spirit; he was the only qualifying successor. If the matter was revealed, then Gu Heng’s prestige within the clan would be completely lost. If the Gu Clan couldn’t find someone to replace Gu Heng, then the clan’s decline would be unavoidable.</p>
 <p>After all, a God Level growth rate demon spirit wasn’t easy to find.</p>
 <p>Gu Tianlong and the others were gratified. When Gu Bei finally revealed himself, he’d already cultivated sword intent and possessed a God Level growth rate demon spirit. Their previous worries were solved. First, they’d remove Gu Heng from his position of first-in-line successor to beat him down a little. Otherwise Gu Heng might really start taking matters into his own hands!</p>
 <p>The meeting ended. Few hours later, the elders’ decision was made known throughout the Gu Clan.</p>
 <p>All of the Gu Clan’s clansmen were stunned. They originally thought that Gu Bei would only be promoted to the position of second-in-line successor. They never imagined that Gu Bei would be moved to the first-in-line successor’s seat. Many of the clansmen were unable to digest this news for some time.</p>
 <p>They all vaguely sensed that something was up, but no one dared to say anything out loud. After all, this matter could be considered a family scandal.</p>
 <p>Who would’ve thought that the Patriarch would’ve made the decision so quickly. The news made its way back to the martial field.</p>
 <p>Gu Heng felt gloomy when Gu Ya and the other elders had left some time ago. However, he wasn’t terribly hung up on it; he thought that the Patriarch would only arrange Gu Bei as the second-in-line successor. He believed his position as first-in-line would still be very stable. However, when he received the news, he was no longer able to remain calm.</p>
 <p>He never thought that the Gu Clan would remove him from first-in-line successor. After all, Gu Bei still hadn’t established any forces in the outside world!</p>
 <p>How could Gu Bei be qualified?</p>
 <p>Gu Heng was so angry that his lungs nearly exploded. His blood surged. He wanted to find the Patriarch and demand a reason. However, his rationality returned after a while. It seemed that the Patriarch knew something, so he was trying to give Gu Heng some setbacks! Gu Heng felt even more dejected and looked at the distant Gu Bei. That kid must be feeling very proud right now.</p>
 <p>Gu Heng became the second-in-line successor. So what?</p>
 <p>Gu Heng narrowed his eyes. Back then, that person had helped him pull Gu Lan down from her position. He would most likely help him again. It’s simply impossible for Gu Bei to rise!</p>
 <p>Nie Li and his group were chatting amongst themselves.</p>
 <p>“I never imagined that the Patriarch would actually make me the first-in-line successor!” Gu Bei was astonished in his heart. He showed a smile and said with narcissism, “Could it be that the Patriarch has noticed that I’m a one-in-ten-thousand genius? That I’m the only man who can save the Gu Clan?”</p>
 <p>Nie Li couldn’t help rolling his eyes at Gu Bei’s words. “You’re thinking too much. It's secondary that the Patriarch did something to support you, no matter how talented you are, there’s no need to make you first-in-line in one go. He probably did it to give Gu Heng a setback. The Patriarch probably knew about matter between Gu Heng and your sister. However, he couldn’t do anything, since that left Gu Heng as the only one with a God Level Dragon Bloodline demon spirit. But now that you’ve made yourself a second one, they’re worried that Gu Heng might try to repeat things. That’s why they gave Gu Heng a setback, so they can restrain him!”</p>
 <p>Gu Bei smiled, “Gu Heng deserved it! Now that the first-in-line successor seat is no longer his, he’ll probably be depressed for some time!”</p>
 <p>Gu Lan looked at Gu Bei and said, “Although Gu Heng couldn’t maintain his first-in-line successor position, he’s established a powerful force in the outside world. You have none. When the time comes for the final selection of the Patriarch, Gu Heng will still take first because the Patriarch’s seat definitely won’t be passed to someone who has no foundation!”</p>
 <p>Gu Lan’s words were meant to warn Gu Bei not to be complacent after becoming the first-in-line successor.</p>
 <p>Gu Bei nodded. “I understand, Elder Sister.” Although they’d already got some capital to fight against Gu Heng, it was still too shallow. The only way to gain a solid foothold was by building their own forces in the outside world.</p>
 <p>Right now, Gu Bei was a little excited in his heart.</p>
 <p>Nie Li, Xiao Ning’er, Xiao Yu, along with Gu Bei and Gu Lan, went to watch the other matches.</p>
 <p>Gu Heng eyed Nie Li and his group as they left. When he saw Nie Li’s figure, his expression turned sullen. That kid “refused a toast and has to be forced”. Then so be it. He’s been together with Gu Bei and Gu Lan for a while now. Although it was impossible for him to do anything to Gu Bei and Gu Lan for the time being, dealing with Nie Li would be easy.</p>
 <p>Gu Heng coldly snorted, “Let’s go!”</p>
 <p>He lead a group of people and left.</p>
 <p>“Nie Li, the sun will rise soon and I’ll have to return to the Heavenly Note Sect with my Junior and Senior Sisters.” Xiao Ning’er raised her head and looked at Nie Li as tears flickered in her eyes. She couldn’t bear the thought of leaving him.</p>
 <p>“Alright. Remember to take good care of yourself in the Heavenly Note Sect!” Nie Li patted her on the shoulder and gave her a small smile. Although he felt the sorrow of parting in his heart, after experiencing that endlessly long life, he’d learned to see things more mildly.</p>
 <p>Xiao Ning’er looked at Nie Li, turned on tiptoe, and kissed him on the cheek. Her face boiled hot. Just as she was about to turn and run, Nie Li pulled her back he passed her an interspatial ring. “Inside are some spiritual stones and things like Dragon Bloodline Extraordinary growth rate demon spirits. Take them with you and split them up!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Ning’er kissed Nie Li and felt embarrassed to death. However, she was pulled back by Nie Li.</p>
 <p>“Oh right, I’ve also written some words and placed them inside. If there’s anything you lack, let me know right now.” Nie Li held onto Xiao Ning’er’s hands. He had to admit that her hands were very smooth and soft. He couldn’t help smiling when he saw how embarrassed she was.</p>
 <p>Xiao Ning’er’s face was boiling and she couldn’t help stomping her feet.</p>
 <p>“If there’s nothing else, then I’ll be going now!” Xiao Ning’er felt embarrassed to death. She didn’t dare to raise her head to look at his eyes.</p>
 <p>Nie Li couldn’t help smiling as he watched her leaving. A girl’s heart is like a piece uncarved jade: pure and extremely beautiful. Both Ziyun and Ning’er were people who he’d give up his life to protect!</p>
 <p>The Heavenly Note and Skyblaze Sect’s disciples all gathered together. Xiao Ning’er waved to Nie Li from far away.</p>
 <p>Mingyue Wushuang couldn’t help glancing at Nie Li before shifting her eyes to Xiao Ning’er with a tranquil smile. It seemed like Nie Li and Xiao Ning’er had a pretty good relationship.</p>
 <p>Yan Yang walked over to Nie Li and lightly smiled. “Junior Brother Nie Li, it’s a pity that time was limited and I couldn’t have a good chat with you. I’ll bid you farewell today. If we meet again in the future, or you come to the Skyblaze Sect, please find me anytime. We can have a pleasant chat to our heart’s content.”</p>
 <p>“Many thanks to Senior Brother Yan Yang. When such an opportunity presents itself, I’ll definitely pay you a visit!” Nie Li said with his hands cupped. Regardless of anything, building a good relationship with the future Sect Master of the Skyblaze Sect would be the right move!</p>
 <p>Yan Yang wasn’t as hard to approach as the rumours said!</p>
 <p>What Nie Li didn’t know was that Yan Yang couldn’t be bothered about ordinary people, or even people like Long Tianming. However, Yan Yang had looked at Nie Li in a new light.</p>
 <p>The disciples of the Skyblaze Sect all saw how courteous Yan Yang was acting towards Nie Li. They took note and engraved Nie Li’s profile into their minds. If any of them encountered Nie Li in the future, they definitely won’t cause a conflict with him. It’d be in their best interest to make things more convenient for Nie Li as well; after all, he was someone who the Holy Son regarded as important!</p>
 <p>Even the Holy Son have acknowledged Nie Li. If ordinary people were to provoke Nie Li, they’d definitely receive a miserable lesson from the Holy Son.</p>
 <p>In the Skyblaze Sect, Yan Yang possessed an extraordinary position!</p>
 <p>“Then I’ll go ahead and take my leave!” Yan Yang nodded before he lead the disciples of the Skyblaze Sect and left.</p>
 <p>As Ye Xuan left with Yan Yang, he afforded Nie Li one last cold glare. The fact that Xiao Ning’er and Nie Li had spent a night together left a tight knot in his heart. Ye Xuan was even more pissed by the fact that he himself couldn’t do anything to Nie Li; he could only secretly hope that Murong Yu would take care of it for him.</p>
 <p>Lu Piao and Xiao Xue also bid each other farewell.</p>
 <p>The disciples of the two major sects. Nie Li watched Xiao Ning’er wave her little hand as she faded away into the distance.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yu couldn’t help sighing as he watched Nie Li and Xiao Ning’er bid each other farewell. Indeed, the two of them made a good pair. He turned his gaze into the distance. No one knew what he was thinking about.</p>
 <p>After sending Xiao Ning’er off, Nie Li retracted his gaze.</p>
 <p>For the sakes of Ziyun, Ning’er, his clansmen, and his friends and brothers, Nie Li knew that he had to raise his strength as quickly as possible. He had to reach the 2-fate realm so that he could head to the outside world, establish his own forces, and compete for power and position within the Divine Feathers Sect.</p>
 <p>Together with Xiao Yu and Lu Piao, they returned to the courtyard.</p>
 <p>Nie Li immediately entered the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting to cultivate. A few hours later, his aura abruptly burst as the second fate soul slowly formed in his soul realm.</p>
 <p>Outside of his expectations, this second fate soul was actually blue in colour. One red and one blue. He was stunned as he had no idea what was going on.</p>
 <p>An ordinary person’s fate soul should be colourless!</p>
 <p>Nie Li opened his eyes from his cultivation state. Everything else was to his expectations. By using the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting as a catalyst, he only needed a few hours to complete his rank-up. However, he was bewildered by the state of things afterwards. Since he couldn’t figure it out, Nie Li decided that there was no use thinking about it.</p>
 <p>Nie Li finished consolidating his cultivation, then turned to Yu Yan and Jindan who were cultivating. Both their cultivations had risen a lot compared to before entering the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting.</p>
 <p>After Nie Li finished cultivating, he made a trip to the soul hall and placed his fate soul inside.</p>
 <p>Now that he’d finally reached the 2-fate realm, he could finally to the outside world. The best part of the show was about to begin!</p>
