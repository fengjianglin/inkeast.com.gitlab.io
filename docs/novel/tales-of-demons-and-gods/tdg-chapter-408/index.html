 <p><strong>Chapter 408 - Passed?</strong></p>
 <p>Exit of the Void Illusionary Divine Palace</p>
 <p>A group of people were being questioned by the Demon God Sect’s experts. Once in a while, a human clan would conflict with a member of the Demon God Sect and get themselves killed.</p>
 <p>Hierarch Blacknether had just suffered a setback from the Void Illusionary Divine Palace and was all the more furious. His subordinates were also running unrestrained. The slightest unwillingness to cooperate meant someone was going to be killed. Since they had Hierarch Blacknether backing them, what was there to fear?</p>
 <p>Nie Li glanced into the distance, towards Hierarch Blacknether. With the presence of a Martial Ancestor Realm expert, escaping wasn’t going to be easy, even with Yan Yang’s help.</p>
 <p>What should he do?</p>
 <p>Nie Li’s brain started turning for ideas.</p>
 <p>Yan Yang transmitted his voice to Nie Li, “This Hierarch Blacknether is an extremely difficult person! However, he still has some fears that restrain him. I am the Holy Son of the Skyblaze Sect. He definitely won’t take actions against me without thinking them through. However, that won’t be the same for anyone else, especially for a Heavenly Fate Realm genius like you. It’ll get dangerous if you stay next to me. He won’t touch me carelessly, but he might kill anyone around me, just to assert dominance.”</p>
 <p>The Skyblaze and Demon God’s Sects had been in conflict for years. But that was just between sects. The Martial Ancestor Realm experts of either sect weren’t going to start their own private wars for nothing. After all, the goal after reaching the Martial Ancestor Realm was only the reach the one above that. It would be unwise to exhaust their spirits for no reason! Unless it was for a direct conflict of interests for their sects, under normal circumstances, they would fear one another.</p>
 <p>Killing the Holy Son of the Skyblaze Sect might cause the Martial Ancestor Realm experts of the Skyblaze Sect to take action against Hierarch Blacknether. Hierarch Blacknether definitely didn’t want that to happen. However, if it was only someone at Yan Yang’s side, then Hierarch Blacknether had nothing to fear.</p>
 <p>Nie Li said, “Brother Yan Yang, rather than waiting here, why don’t we take a risk? If I were to go by myself, it’d definitely be much more dangerous. Those people from the Demon God’s Sect would definitely kill me. But if I go in behind you, then I might have a chance!”</p>
 <p>He was betting that Hierarch Blacknether wouldn’t pay any attention to them.</p>
 <p>Yan Yang nodded his head after some pondering. It sounded plausible.</p>
 <p>There was no way that Nie Li could leave, just by himself!</p>
 <p>“We have to be quick about it. If the Holy Son Li Huo comes out, it’ll get troublesome!” Yan Yang reminded. The Holy Son Li Huo was Hierarch Blacknether’s direct disciple!</p>
 <p>The two of them flew towards the exit of the palace.</p>
 <p>A 9-stage Heavenly Axis Realm expert from the Demon God Sect reached out and grabbed Yan Yang. “You two! Stop where you are!”</p>
 <p>Yan Yang coldly snorted as a powerful energy shrouded his body. That 9-stage Heavenly Axis Realm expert bounced off with a *Bang!*, and he looked at Yan Yang in astonishment. After all, Yan Yang was only in the Heavenly Axis Realm, but the strength he possessed was already far above that guard’s!</p>
 <p>“Here’s my stuff!” Yan Yang tossed his items to the Demon God’s Sect expert with a flick of his hand.</p>
 <p>The Demon God Sect expert furrowed his brows. If they were to go at it again, he knew he wouldn’t be Yan Yang’s opponent. That’d be extremely humiliating! He coldly snorted and looked over Yan Yang and Nie Li with a blank face. Neither of them had anything hidden on their person.</p>
 <p>Then, he glanced inside Yan Yang’s interspatial ring and his eyes lit up.</p>
 <p>The Demon God’s Sect expert waved his hand. “At least you’re tactful. Now, get lost!”</p>
 <p>Yan Yang and Nie Li lowered their heads and hurriedly walked off.</p>
 <p>They felt a powerful intent sweeping over them and Nie Li felt suffocating pressure.</p>
 <p>Hierarch Blacknether was examining them!</p>
 <p>That powerful intent pulled away after a moment. Yan Yang had nothing with him and Hierarch Blacknether definitely couldn’t sense the Myriad Miles Rivers and Mountains Painting within Nie Li’s soul realm. Aside from that, Nie Li had nothing else with him. Hierarch Blacknether probably couldn’t be bothered to take action against a mere Heavenly Fate Realm like Nie Li!</p>
 <p>After sweeping an eye at Nie Li and Yan Yang, Hierarch Blacknether looked away.</p>
 <p>Since he didn’t want to kill Yan Yang, he simply pretend that he hadn’t seen them.</p>
 <p>Wu Yazi furrowed his brows as he watched Yan Yang and Nie Li safely leave. He was confused. Did they really hand their things over so obediently?</p>
 <p>That didn’t make any sense!</p>
 <p>Nie Li definitely wouldn’t be that obedient! There had to be something fishy!</p>
 <p>Wu Yazi remained silent for a brief moment. After a bit, he decided not to think about it. It didn’t matter what kinds of treasures Nie Li had left with; there was nothing that Wu Yazi could do. If Hierarch Blacknether or the Holy Son Li Huo found out about the Demon Blood Sacrifice, he’d definitely be buried in an unmarked grave!</p>
 <p>After Nie Li and Yan Yang had left the Void Illusionary Divine Palace, they flew away.</p>
 <p>Half an hour later, the Holy Son Li Huo flew out of the Void Illusionary Divine Palace.</p>
 <p>“Master!” Holy Son Li Huo slightly bowed towards Hierarch Blacknether, who was hovering in the sky.</p>
 <p>The Hierarch Blacknether slightly nodded and inquired, “Disciple, have you harvested anything in the palace?”</p>
 <p>“Reporting to Master! The mechanisms within the palace are extremely complicated with secret paths. Your disciple currently has no harvest!” The Holy Son Li Huo responded rather gloomily. He didn’t dare inform his Master that he’d been tricked by Nie Li. He would definitely lose face if that was known to others!</p>
 <p>Hierarch Blacknether’s face was extremely ugly as he continued, “I’ve already broken the barrier of the palace, but I’ve discovered nothing?”</p>
 <p>“Master, did you see a few people earlier?” The Holy Son Li Huo enquired.</p>
 <p>“A few people? Who?” Hierarch Blacknether’s knitted his brows.</p>
 <p>“Wu Yazi, Yan Yang, and two strangers!” said Holy Son Li Huo.</p>
 <p>“Wu Yazi is inside the palace. As for Yan Yang, he left just now!” Hierarch Blacknether said. “He’s the Holy Son of the Skyblaze Sect, disciple to that old fart. For the time being, I don’t want any trouble with that old fart!”</p>
 <p>Before, Hierarch Blacknether’s strength was already a hair lower than Yan Yang’s master’s. And now, he’d lost so much of his intent to those black flames. That’s why he let Yan Yang leave.</p>
 <p>Holy Son Li Huo immediately followed, “Lord Master, they might’ve taken the treasures of the Void Illusionary Divine Palace with them!”</p>
 <p>Hierarch Blacknether shook his head and said, “That’s impossible. There’s no way the two of them could’ve hidden anything from my eyes!”</p>
 <p>He’d already used his intent to search Nie Li and Yan Yang. He hadn’t found anything on either of them.</p>
 <p>The Holy Son Li Huo said, “I don’t know what’s going on, but I’m fairly certain that there’s something fishy going on with Yan Yang!”</p>
 <p>Hierarch Blacknether knitted his brows and waved his right hand. An interspatial ring sailed towards Li Huo. “Here’s Yan Yang’s interspatial ring. Take a look.”</p>
 <p>The Holy Son Li Huo swept an eye over its contents and said, “It’s true that there’s quite a few decent pieces in here, but Yan Yang has definitely hidden another portion of it. Master, please stop him! Don’t let him get away!”</p>
 <p>A chilling ray of light flashed through Hierarch Blacknether’s eyes as he frowned. So in this world, there still existed a method to hide things from his eyes! If that’s true, then he’d definitely hunt those two down. Hierarch Blacknether coldly snorted as he turned into a streak of light, and disappeared into the horizon.</p>
