 <p><strong>Chapter 383 - Sneak Attack</strong></p>
 <p>Wu Yazi frowned for a brief moment before he said, “There’s a swarm of flies trailing behind us. Should we exterminate them?”</p>
 <p>He’d already let Long Tianming’s party go once; who would’ve thought that they still weren’t done with them?</p>
 <p>Nie Li lightly smiled and shook his head. “There’s no need for that. Just let them follow. We’ll deal with them once we get inside the Thousand Illusionary Array. Follow me!”</p>
 <p>Nie Li was the first to enter the Thousand Illusionary Array, followed by Xiao Yu.</p>
 <p>Wu Yazi turned around, glared at Long Tianming one more time, and snorted. Then, he plunged into the Thousand Illusionary Array after Nie Li and Xiao Yu.</p>
 <p>The three of them disappeared.</p>
 <p>Long Liu saw that and urgently reported to Long Tianming, “Young Master, they really did know how to enter the Thousand Illusionary Array!”</p>
 <p>“I saw!” Excitement flashed through Long Tianming’s eyes. “Everyone, follow them!”</p>
 <p>*Woosh!* *Woosh!* *Woosh!*</p>
 <p>Their group quickly entered the Thousand Illusionary Array.</p>
 <p>Nie Li’s group of three was already inside, and surrounded by a sea of constantly shifting illusions. One moment, they were walking through a forest. The next, it was grassland. Then, a deep canyon.</p>
 <p>Wu Yazi couldn’t help sighing with appreciation. “It’s truly worthy of being called the Thousand Illusionary Array!”</p>
 <p>He’d already lost any sense of direction in here. If it wasn’t for Nie Li’s lead, he would’ve already gotten lost.</p>
 <p>As the Thousand Illusionary Array shifted thousands of times, Nie Li carefully monitored the array’s fluctuating energy. He glanced back at Wu Yazi and Xiao Yu, and the corner of his mouth rose into a small smile. “Follow closely. We’re going to deal with the flies that are following us!”</p>
 <p>Long Tianming and his group entered the Thousand Illusionary Array. The countless changes around them forced them to lose their sense of direction.</p>
 <p>“Where are those three?” Long Tianming knitted his brows.</p>
 <p>There wasn’t a trace of Nie Li’s group of three.</p>
 <p>Damn it! They’d actually lost them!</p>
 <p>Long Tianming and his men were extremely disoriented as they stood inside the Thousand Illusionary Array. They were completely lost and had no idea where to go.</p>
 <p>Over twenty people wandered around inside the Thousand Illusionary Array.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a shadow flashed past the group and fresh blood splattered. Before that Heavenly Axis Realm expert had a chance to react, his corpse fell to the ground.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on?” Long Tianming turned around with his brows locked tightly. He sensed Wu Yazi’s aura, but by the time he reacted to it, there was only a corpse left on the ground.</p>
 <p>Wu Yazi himself had already disappeared without a trace!</p>
 <p>That Wu Yazi was making use of the Thousand Illusionary Array to deal with them!</p>
 <p>Long Tianming was extremely depressed. Upon entering the Thousand Illusionary Array, they’d been blinded with their eyes open. They didn’t even know where Wu Yazi and his group were at!</p>
 <p>*Fwooosh!*</p>
 <p>Another Heavenly Axis Realm expert was killed, this one standing right behind Long Tianming. By the time Long Tianming had turned around, Wu Yazi had disappeared again.</p>
 <p>“Bastard!” Long Tianming couldn’t help cursing. He was nearly crazy as he angrily commanded, “Men, form a defensive position! Watch out for their guerilla attacks!”</p>
 <p>Nie Li’s party was standing only two hundred meters away from Long Tianming and his group.</p>
 <p>By now, Wu Yazi was quite convinced of Nie Li’s abilities. He looked out towards Long Tianming’s group, who were on high alert and scanning their surroundings, and he couldn’t help turning back to Nie Li and asking, “How did you do it? We’re so close to them, but they’re acting like they’re blind. How can they not see us?”</p>
 <p>Nie Li lightly smiled and replied, “The profound uses of the Thousand Illusionary Array include more than just that.”</p>
 <p>“Are you saying that you know this Thousand Illusionary Array like the back of your hand?” Wu Yazi was in disbelief. After all, this array had been set by a supreme expert from ancient times!</p>
 <p>Nie Li smiled and looked into the distance, at the Void Illusionary Divine Palace. “The Thousand Illusionary Array isn’t that difficult. If I had the right materials, I could lay one out myself! The Thousand Illusionary Array is just the outermost barrier, and the simplest one, at that. Once you break past it, there are far more high-leveled arrays inside. Only by breaking all the arrays can we enter the Void Illusionary Divine Palace. However, once the array is broken, everyone outside can rush in as well!”</p>
 <p>At that, Wu Yazi couldn’t help asking, “If that’s true, then doesn’t that mean we’ll have to share the Void Illusionary Divine Palace’s treasures?”</p>
 <p>It was true that Wu Yazi was strong, but there were also many other powerful experts from various sects, standing outside the Void Illusionary Divine Palace!</p>
 <p>“That’s true. Therefore, we’ll have to grab the good stuff before we break the array!” Nie Li glanced back at Long Tianming and his eyes slightly narrowed. “And, we’ll have to get rid of all the threats!”</p>
 <p>Wu Yazi turned in the direction that Nei Li was looking, patted his own chest, and said, “I understand! Leave it to me!”</p>
 <p>Wu Yazi possessed the Raccoon Clan’s secret technique. With Nie Li’s guidance and this Thousand Illusionary Array, he was like a tiger that’d grown wings[1. Double the power.]. He turned into a streak of light with a *woosh* and pounced towards Long Tianming and his group.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yu watched Wu Yazi launch his attacks, then glanced at Nie Li and asked, “Nie Li, we’ve told Wu Yazi so many things. Won’t that be a problem? If Wu Yazi attacks us, we won’t be able to counterattack at all!”</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. He won’t do anything before we exit the Void Illusionary Divine Palace. Anyways, with our strength, we’d definitely die inside the Void Illusionary Divine Palace. We still need him,” Nie Li replied. He knew that they were dancing on a tightrope, but this was a bet he was willing to take to enhance his own strength quickly!</p>
 <p>*Boom!* *Boom!* *Boom!*</p>
 <p>Wu Yazi killed six more of Long Tianming’s Heavenly Axis Realm experts, all in a row.</p>
 <p>“Bastard!” Long Tianming furiously roared as he mobilised the energy within him for an attack on Wu Yazi.</p>
 <p>*Boom!*</p>
 <p>A burst of wild energy created a huge crater in the ground and sent several Heavenly Axis Realm experts flying out.</p>
 <p>Wu Yazi snorted again and disappeared into the Thousand Illusionary Array. A brief moment later, he reappeared next to Nie Li. A line of blood trickled out of the corner of his mouth. “That person’s strength is truly outstanding. He’s surpassed my expectations!”</p>
 <p>Nie Li briefly frowned. He never expected Long Tianming to be capable of wounding Wu Yazi. It seemed that he’d underestimated Long Tianming’s strength.</p>
 <p>After he’d exchanged a few blows with Wu Yazi, Long Tianming took several steps backwards and released a powerful aura. He looked around him and furiously snorted, “So, a member of the Raccoon Clan is only that strong? Come and fight me to the death, if you dare! What kind of strength is this, just hiding around like a mouse?”</p>
 <p>Nie Li glanced at Wu Yazi and asked, “How strong is Long Tianming?”</p>
 <p>Wu Yazi shook his head and replied, “I’m not too sure. He feels like a 9-stage Heavenly Axis Realm, but he’s certainly much stronger than that. He’s obviously human, but I sense a familiar demon blood energy on him. Could he have also completed the Demon Blood Sacrifice with the help from someone of the demon clan? Not only that, but his demon blood definitely isn’t ordinary!”</p>
