<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Shen Wei completely quieted down, now looking at Cheng Xi dazedly. Cheng Xi smiled in response, and then said to Shen Wei’s equally dazed brother, “Shen Wei’s thirsty. Get her some water to drink.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When the water was brought over, Cheng Xi personally helped Shen Wei drink it. As Cheng Xi held the glass up, she said, “Don’t be afraid, and don’t worry. Drink this and go to sleep. After you wake up, everything will be fine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Don’t worry. If anything happens, I’ll shoulder the blame with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Perhaps it was because Fu Mingyi’s ‘death’ had shocked her too much, or perhaps it was because Cheng Xi’s words had warmed her heart, but for whatever reason, Shen Wei actually cooperated and drank that glass of water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Not long later, amidst the sobs of the Fu family, she closed her eyes and fell into a peaceful sleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Only then did Cheng Xi lightly exhale, put down Shen Wei, and turn to address the distraught Fu family. They were all clustered around Fu Mingyi, hugging him, crying, and calling for help. “Don’t worry, he’s not dead. He just ingested a few sleeping pills.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Even though she had been ‘whispering’ into Shen Wei’s ears, she hadn’t done it very softly, so most people in the room had heard at least a little of that exchange. In this sort of situation, it was honestly already quite level-headed for them to only embrace Fu Mingyi instead of rushing up to Cheng Xi to beat her up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Nevertheless, when Cheng Xi spoke, despite her gentle tone, a cold indifference permeated her words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Fu Mingyi’s mother and aunt both choked at her callousness, and then his aunt criticized her. “As a doctor, how can you frighten someone like that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Then, should I wake Shen Wei up and let her stab him?” Her tone was practical and realistic as she continued, “I do have to say, she’s currently in a bad mental state. Even if she does stab him, it would be a waste.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Fu Mingyi’s mother and aunt, who were familiar with Shen Wei’s crazy behavior, were rendered speechless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Luckily, Fu Mingyi’s father was reasonable, and he went up to talk to the two of them. In the end, the three of them lifted Fu Mingyi up and brought him out.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Only then did Cheng Xi look at the Shen family. Right now, they were still a bit dazed, mainly because Cheng Xi’s behavior today was very different from normal. Before this, they had all thought that she was a pure and soft-hearted woman. Someone pretty with a good character, good temperament, and a kind, generous, and understanding heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">And only now did they even realize that the familiar woman they thought they knew had such a daring side to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The intrepid but soft-hearted Cheng Xi then said, “The way this place looks will negatively impact Shen Wei’s mood. I’d like to take her back to my place.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“The hospital?” Upon hearing Cheng Xi’s request, Shen Wei’s mother’s voice started trembling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi didn’t respond, and instead asked a few questions. “When did she start having these abnormal feelings?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Two days ago, when she found out that Fu Mingyi cheated before they got married. At that time, she was very angry, but just angry. She wasn’t throwing things around or hitting people—she was just saying that she wanted to divorce Fu Mingyi. We all thought that she might have been acting a bit rash, so we advised her not to be so impetuous, to think it through carefully. However, this merely made her feel that none of us understood her and that we wanted to see her die.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Aside from this, did she display any other unusual behavior?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Yes. She said that Fu Mingyi wanted to kill her, and she said that he married her all to do that. But we thought that she was just spouting nonsense after being excessively angered. So we didn’t place much importance on it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi nodded. “Then what happened today?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Today, the two families got together to see if we could persuade the two of them to reconcile……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi interrupted her. “Is it true that Fu Mingyi had an affair?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Actually, she was hoping that it was false, and that it was all in Shen Wei’s imagination. But after a mild silence, Shen Wei’s brother said, “It’s true. When she made a fake account to test Fu Mingyi’s loyalty, he mistook it for another woman’s account and immediately warned her to stop harassing him, saying that they were over…… After Shen Wei led him on some more, she found out that, before they got married, Fu Mingyi had had multiple girlfriends besides her. One of them had gotten pregnant and threatened him, so Fu Mingyi had found someone to forcibly cause her to have an abortion before breaking off all connection with her……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“……and you still want them to reconcile after this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“What else can we do?” Shen Wei’s mother interrupted through her tears. “Shen Wei’s also pregnant now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When Shen Wei’s mother said this, everyone’s expressions revealed various levels of annoyance and exasperation. It wasn’t just Cheng Xi’s; even Shen Wei’s father looked ashen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi was similarly at a loss for what to say. She remained silent for quite a while before asking, “How long have you known?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“We only found out after it was all revealed. Shen Wei was so mad that she fainted, and we were afraid that something more serious had occurred, so we sent her to the hospital for an inspection. It was then that we found out that she was pregnant.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">A happy occasion that couldn’t be considered joyful was preceded by tremendous anger and sorrow… No wonder the normally strong-willed Shen Wei would collapse like this. Cheng XI sighed and then asked, “Then what’s all this today?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“We’re still not sure about the overall picture. Originally, the atmosphere was still manageable, and Shen Wei was willing to listen to reason for the sake of the baby. But then, out of nowhere, she received a phone call and suddenly went crazy. She started scratching and clawing at Fu Mingyi, and even grabbed up a knife while saying that she would kill him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Luckily, there were plenty of other people around today. Otherwise, something truly horrific might have actually happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Shen Wei’s brothers were a bit scared as they recounted this, and one of her sisters-in-law quickly asked, “Is Shen Wei… truly insane now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Everyone in the Shen family looked towards her indignantly, and Shen Wei’s father frowned. “What nonsense are you spouting? Shen Wei’s just lost control of her rage! Are you going to believe that nonsense too?” Shen Wei’s father had a severe demeanor, and he rarely talked, so everyone went silent at his sudden tirade.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After a while, Cheng Xi asked, “Do you know who called her?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Everyone shook their heads. “We asked Fu Mingyi, but he said that he didn’t know. Shen Wei also smashed her phone, so we can’t find out even if we wanted to.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi stopped her questioning, and after thinking for a while, started muttering to herself. Finally, she stated, “I feel like it’s in Shen Wei’s best interests to go to the hospital. She seemed to have a strong inclination towards death, and I’m worried that something drastic might happen when she wakes up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When Cheng Xi saw Shen Wei’s family hesitate, she continued pushing them. “We have to make a decision quickly. The medicine I gave her was a mental suppressant, and the only reason she fell asleep was because she was fatigued from all that struggling. It’s better to have everything planned and ready to go before she wakes up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Shen Wei’s mother looked at Cheng Xi, tears still brimming in her eyes. “Is Shen Wei doing that badly right now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“At the moment, it’s not clear. We have to wait for her to wake up before we can ascertain her situation. However, staying here is evidently not suitable for her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Then we’ll move her!” Shen Wei’s father made a decisive statement. “But not to the hospital. We’ll first go to our house. We’ll watch over her there, and she should be fine, right?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This last question was directed at Cheng Xi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Shen Wei’s mother anxiously added, “Shen Wei cares a lot for her appearance, and sending her to a place like that…… I’m afraid that she’d really ruin herself.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Regular people were always somewhat fearful and held huge misconceptions towards mental asylums and mental illness…… Cheng Xi sighed, finally relenting. “Alright, but she should come to my apartment. My home is closer to the hospital, so if anything happens, we can always resort to that. Additionally, I feel like it’s better for her to be as isolated from her past as she can right now. Perhaps it’ll aid in her recovery.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This suggestion was approved by everyone from Shen Wei’s family; as for the Fu family—at this time, who would listen to their opinions?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">They were pests that had to be chased away!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Finally, Shen Wei was sent to Cheng Xi’s apartment. Her parents accompanied her; they stayed in the guest room, Shen Wei the master bedroom, and Cheng Xi the living room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Everything was settled on the way there, but once they entered the house, Cheng Xi saw that her house was still full of flowers. She instantly remembered that she still hadn’t dealt with these things, and felt a small impulse to make a “囧” face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Even though they were concerned with Shen Wei’s situation, the Shen family was still slightly shocked by this house full of flowers. Shen Wei’s elder sister-in-law even joked, “Cheng Xi, are you… switching jobs to become a florist?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi muddled through the question before instructing Shen Wei’s elder brother to carry her to Cheng Xi’s room. The reason why the flowers in the living room were shocking was because of their quantity, and also because of their artistic presentation. All the pink roses were grouped up by the balcony, and from them was a little road interlaced with ivy and orchids that extended to the living room. From afar, it seemed as if fresh flowers had overtaken the room.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The fragrance of the flowers permeated everyone’s nose, and their pink color saturated their eyes, but otherwise, they didn’t inhibit anybody’s activities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Before Shen Wei woke up, the Shen family had already divided up the tasks that they had to accomplish. Her elder brother would go and fix Shen Wei’s phone to see if he could find out why she had gone crazy earlier. Her second brother and sister-in-law would go back and fetch some of her casual clothes. Finally, Shen Wei’s parents and elder sister-in-law would stay here so that they would have enough people to deal with Shen Wei if she went berserk again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Shen Wei didn’t end up sleeping for very long, and she woke up almost right after they finished planning. Cheng Xi walked inside upon hearing her stir, and saw that she was already sitting upright.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Shen Wei opened her eyes wide and looked right at Cheng Xi. “Is Fu Mingyi dead?”</span></p>
