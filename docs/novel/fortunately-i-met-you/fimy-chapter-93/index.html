 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As soon as Cheng Xi finished speaking, she pulled the door open and left without giving Lu Chenzhou any time to respond.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">A whole throng of people were crowded outside the door, including the two nurses who had just left, Lu Chenzhou’s lawyer, and Lu Chenzhou’s grandfather, who had left earlier to chase after his primary doctor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The reason why everyone had crowded here was probably to eavesdrop on their conversation. However, none of them had expected Cheng Xi to leave right when they had gotten into position. Cheng Xi looked at them all while maintaining her dominating presence. Finally, she called out Lu Chenzhou’s grandfather by saying, “May I have a few words with you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Oh, sure! Sure!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi went to one side with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">He immediately said, “Dr. Cheng, what’s the matter? Tell me!” He patted his chest, his expression indicating that he would take care of everything, as if he hated the fact that he couldn’t immediately have Lu Chenzhou marry her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The corners of Cheng Xi’s mouth wiggled in amusement. She paused and said, “First, I’d like to apologize. My emotions today have been a mess, and I irrationally got angry at Mr. Lu just now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lu Chenzhou’s grandfather replied in a somewhat embarrassed manner, “It’s alright. He deserves a scolding, and you were still too kind. He probably doesn’t mind at all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“......Anyways, if he’s not feeling well or anything, please let me know.” Afraid that Lu Chenzhou’s grandfather would say another shocking statement, she quickly continued, “May I ask, what’s Mr. Lu’s view on Donglai Pharmaceuticals?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lu Chenzhou’s grandfather turned pale with fright. “You’re not really going to try to destroy it, are you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So they were indeed eavesdropping, weren’t they?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Looking at her face, Lu Chenzhou’s grandfather rubbed his head awkwardly but then resolutely said, “But if destroying it will help you achieve your goals, then it’s alright with us.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi couldn’t help but massage her forehead. Given Lu Chenzhou’s grandfather’s personality, it wasn’t surprising that Lu Chenzhou had turned out the way he had.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">In a somewhat powerless manner, she said, “Thank you, but I’m not that desperate yet. There’s no need for such trouble. Mr. Lu’s attitude towards Donglai Pharmaceuticals is very important, and it would be very helpful if you could explain it to me. Or, if you could help me find someone who understands his viewpoints, whom I can talk to, that would be even better. It’s very possible that this could be a breakthrough point in Mr. Lu’s illness.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Ah, is he still ill?” Lu Chenzhou’s grandfather sounded disappointed. “I thought that he’d recovered. Look, he already knows how to be in a relationship now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lu Chenzhou’s grandfather started smiling again toward the end of his sentence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi looked at him severely. “Grandfather Lu, that’s not romance.” Following instructions like a robot was completely unrelated to love, joy, or anger. But in his attitude towards Donglai Pharmaceuticals, Cheng Xi could feel something hidden beneath the surface.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Actually, it would have been fine if Lu Chenzhou had repressed his urges and emotions this way for his entire life. As long as he could control himself, he wouldn’t do any harm to society. But on the other hand, given his intelligence and capabilities, if he focused solely on his career, then he could probably achieve miraculous results.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">But clearly, for the Lu family, rather than Lu Chenzhou having an exceptional career, they would much prefer him to marry and have children like a regular person, for him to experience happiness and anger, sorrow and joy. Lu Chenzhou himself likely felt this way as well, or else he wouldn’t have become interested in her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi thought about a lot, but in reality, only a little bit of time had passed. When she saw Lu Chenzhou’s grandfather forcefully calming himself down to think about her words, she relaxed. “There’s something else that I need to do, so I’ll leave first. Due to Mr. Lu’s attitude towards me, I’ll have the department assign another doctor to him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lu Chenzhou’s grandfather, who had been secretly happy that his grandson’s relationship seemed to have noticeably improved, anxiously asked, “……Would you please reconsider? Zhou’s very picky.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Don’t worry. His new doctor will surely be excellent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lu Chenzhou’s grandfather looked at her desperately, as if his teeth were sore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This was why he had said that being too direct would scare people away. Why didn’t his grandson listen? And now she’d found an excuse to run!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">He quickly tried to think of excuses to bring the two closer again. “Then, as for what you need Lawyer Du’s help with……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Yes, I’ll think of a method on my own. Please, don’t worry. I won’t make things difficult for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">In his heart, Lu Chenzhou’s grandfather regretfully thought that he was very willing to be worried and overthinking things, and that he very much wanted things to be made difficult for himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">But Cheng Xi had already made up her mind, and she submitted her request as soon as she returned to her office. Then, at the end of the day when the other doctors were getting off work, Lu Chenzhou’s family met the new psychiatrist who had replaced Cheng Xi for a medical consultation—he was the director of some psychiatry department, as well as a famous old psychiatry professor with a face full of wrinkles.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Although he was gray-haired, his features were very balanced with a square face and big ears. Perhaps Cheng Xi was trying to appeal to Lu Chenzhou’s unique sense of beauty as, while this replacement might have been a little old, his face was perfectly symmetrical, and even the eyebags and wrinkles by his cheeks on either side of his face were equally sized.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The first thought that went through Lu Chenzhou’s grandparents mind was that it must have been hard for Cheng Xi to find and invite such a renowned professor like him. They were happy because, given how much effort Cheng Xi must have spent, she must have been serious about telling Lu Chenzhou to woo her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Because of Lu Chenzhou’s willful behavior, he had ended up being saddled with a few more tests and inspections in the afternoon, two of which they’d been told could be skipped upon entering the hospital. From this, Lu Chenzhou’s family all guessed that this was actually a covert reminder from the primary doctor who had been angered earlier.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Don’t you have money? Don’t you like messing around? Then mess around a bit more, why don’t you?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lu Chenzhou didn’t care either way, as that was just his personality. Before he went to the hospital, he hated it and would avoid it by any means possible. But once he was there, he would adapt to his situation—as long as everything was as he requested.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">He wasn’t very responsive when Cheng Xi was scolding him, nor when Cheng Xi had asked him to chase after her. After Cheng Xi left, he had simply continued his previous activity: discussing an acquisition contract with Lawyer Du. His grandparents were sitting by his side, so anxious for him that they were scratching themselves raw.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When the new doctor arrived, the first thing he did was make Lu Chenzhou fill out a questionnaire. He looked at the responses and started smiling right away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi had never made Lu Chenzhou fill out any questionnaires, but he was very familiar with the questions on this one. She had slightly disguised each of them and asked him about them over the course of their regular conversations.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">He quickly answered the questionnaire. After the doctor read through Lu Chenzhou’s answers, he looked curiously at him before he stretched out his hand out and, in a somewhat kind tone, asked, “Shall we shake hands? In the future, I’ll be working with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This doctor even had a nice voice—particularly mellow and rich, and imbued with charm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lu Chenzhou stared at the proferred hand, indifferent. “I’m sorry, I have mysophobia.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Oh, I’m sorry.” The doctor smiled as he retrieved his hand, a fingertip resting on an answer from the questionnaire. “You answered that you didn’t mind on here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“……”</span></p>
