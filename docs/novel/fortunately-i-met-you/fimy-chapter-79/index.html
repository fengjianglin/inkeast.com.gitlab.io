 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lin Fan was very serious, his tone and expression earnest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi was suddenly reminded of a time when they were still in school. One day, he had abruptly said, “Let’s skip school.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Without any premonition, a usually industrious and model student had suddenly proposed to skip school, and he had even dragged another good student along with him. As two of the top students in the best class, Cheng Xi didn’t even need to think to know what the consequences would be.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">At that time, however, she was calm and cool-headed, and had first asked him, “To where? For how long?” Afraid that he would start seriously planning, she even added, “If we’re gone for too long, I have to get some more money.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lin Fan hadn’t thought about any of that; he just wanted to skip school, to run far, far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Then let’s think about it first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">And so they thought about where they would go, how much money they would have to bring, what might happen on the way, what they would do if an emergency happened—but after making all their plans, though they had skipped school in their minds, nothing ever came of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Why? Because it was too troublesome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">And to extend that to now, getting married wasn’t like skipping school. It was a far more troublesome event with even larger aftershocks—presently, they were only aftershocks because, having not met each other’s parents yet, they hadn’t really settled their relationship. Thus, they were still, in many ways, unprepared for marriage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">All of these thoughts raced through Cheng Xi’s head, but her expression remained unchanged. She even smiled and naturally asked, “Why are you suddenly talking about this now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lin Fan stubbornly asked, “Are you unwilling?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Of course, because the conditions weren’t ripe yet! Cheng Xi smiled, pulled him into a seat, and then poured him a glass of water as she said, “It’s not that I’m unwilling, but rather it’s that there are too many things that we haven’t yet considered, like are we going to have a banquet afterwards? Oh, we probably have to—my mother only has me and my brother, so she’s been thinking about our marriages for a long time. But where would we host it, and how many people would we invite? Who would help us? We’re both new to all of this, so we definitely have to get someone else to help, but before that, we still have to meet each other’s parents, don’t we? And then we’ll have to think about where to stay after we get married, how to set up our bridal chamber, who’s going to take care of the baby if we have one soon—my mother and your mother are both too busy to help, you know—so we’ll have to hire a nanny. But since we’re both busy with our work, our baby would then be with a stranger for the entire day, so we definitely have to choose a good nanny well in advance, or it’ll be easy for all sorts of incidents to crop up……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">In one breath, she listed out a whole pile of incidents that could happen and lead to all sorts of developmental and educational issues with their child. Then, she continued talking about the problems that came about from all sorts of parents getting married, expected or otherwise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lin Fan just looked at her dumbstruck. It was because marriage was just a thought that had popped into his head, and the rest—he hadn’t thought about it at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">He couldn’t even tell her to not overthink it, because Cheng Xi was very seriously planning their future. After she finished speaking her thoughts, she even looked at him seriously, waiting for his response.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">But he couldn’t even answer her first question about the banquet. It wasn’t that he was unwilling, or that he couldn’t, but just that he wasn’t sure if his mother would prevent it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">All he wanted to do was get married, just the two of them, and after properly (in truth, secretly) getting their marriage certificate, they would move in together; his plans didn’t account for anyone else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi was still looking at him, waiting for his answer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">He smiled. “Cheng Xi, do you really want to get married?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“I wouldn’t object to it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Yes, no objections, but not a commitment either.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;Lin Fan thought she would have been shy and pleasantly surprised about it, or even astonished and unpleasantly surprised. However, Cheng Xi displayed neither of these two sets of emotions. Instead, she theorized coolly about the future, her words like a cold basin of water that had splashed him awake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Only then did he realize his own hurry and carelessness—he didn’t even have a ring with which to propose to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After being silent for a moment, he asked, “Then when are you free? I’d like to bring you to meet my mother.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This time, it wasn’t like skipping school, because he wouldn’t give up on his plans so easily.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi agreed. “Alright.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lin Fan left with a heavy heart, but only when he reached the lobby did he remember that it was time to leave work; hadn’t he come here to fetch her?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">But how was he to return now? Ha, all it would do was clearly show Cheng Xi how careless he was towards marriage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">In truth, Cheng Xi really hadn’t noticed his carelessness, because she had been focused on herself—Lin Fan’s proposal made her realize a very surprising thing, which was that, even after they had become a couple, she didn’t really want to get married.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">She had never planned on being single for the rest of her life like her professor, but in her current plan for the future, she hadn’t really thought about marriage, and she wasn’t looking forward to it at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This really made her quite vexed. Cheng Xi caressed her forehead and sighed, only breaking out of her reverie when the nurse came in, looking for her. After Cheng Xi dealt with the nurse’s request, she contacted a few of her friends, specifically, the ones who were still single at Shen Wei’s marriage, and asked them to go out. One responded, “I’m at my boyfriend’s house.” Another, “I’m not free today. I’m going on a blind date.” Only Tian Rou laughed loudly upon picking up. “Wahaha, I’m finally not single anymore. Did you call because you found out and are planning on celebrating with me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Why don’t you secure your own affairs first?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Unable to help herself, she even tried calling Shen Wei, who had just gotten married, but she was also busy, with a business trip as her excuse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Everyone was preoccupied with their own affairs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">With no other option, Cheng Xi could only make herself busy as well. Coincidentally, Lu Chenzhou’s grandfather called her just then. “Could we trouble you to come over? My wife’s gone home to rest because she was exhausted, and our grandson’s unwilling to eat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So Cheng Xi went over, bumping into Lu Chenzhou’s father on the way there. When they met, he stopped and asked, “Are you really Lu Chenzhou’s friend?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi blinked, and Lu Chenzhou’s father’s expression warmed up several degrees from its previously frosty state as he nodded appreciatively at her. “Given his temper, it must have been hard on you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Only upon seeing Lu Chenzhou’s grandfather did she realize the whole story. The old man was yelling at his son in front of a few young men. “Don’t you have any patience? All you do is keep flaring up. Zhou’s body is weak, so isn’t it normal for him to be unable to eat?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After she walked closer, she found that most of these people were actually already familiar: Baldy, Xu Po, and someone she didn’t seem to know. When Baldy saw her, he introduced the third person to her. “This is Xie Ziming.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi thought back long and hard until she finally remembered something. During the first time she had played mahjong with Baldy, it seemed as though a man had had to cancel on them, which was why she had to stand in for him in the first place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Xie Ziming looked pretty average, but his smile was cordial. “In the few months while I was out, yours was the name that I heard the most. It’s nice to finally meet you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi was somewhat embarrassed, and she didn’t bother asking what he had heard about her, instead exchanging a few pleasantries before quickly saying, “I’m going to go inside to look at him first.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This was her way of hiding.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">She much preferred working with her patients over social interactions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Baldy and the rest exchanged a knowing glance with each other behind her back. Xie Ziming said, “This doctor seems so gentle. Can she really do anything?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lu Chenzhou’s grandfather trusted her completely, and nodded confidently. “Of course she can. I’ve never seen Zhou so obedient before.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Everyone grew even more curious, but unfortunately, the door to Lu Chenzhou’s ward was tightly closed. In general, visitors weren’t allowed in; Lu Chenzhou’s father had only been allowed in because Lu Chenzhou had refused to speak or talk to anyone. However, he had gotten so angry that he had been forced to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi again put on her mask and isolation suit before entering. Lu Chenzhou was sleeping peacefully, a sumptuous and nourishing meal by his bedside. The nurse was watching him from the side of the room. Upon seeing Cheng Xi, she quietly said, “He refuses to eat anything. This isn’t good for his recovery.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi smiled understandingly and walked over. Lu Chenzhou was only pretending to sleep; when he heard her footsteps, he opened his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Do you want to eat something?” She pretended to not know anything, and asked this question naturally as she sat down in front of his bed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lu Chenzhou didn’t respond, only looking at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Why don’t you have something. Won’t it be nice to get out of here earlier? How terrible it must feel to be cooped up in here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">She took a bowl of porridge and held a spoonful up to his mouth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The two stayed still until Lu Chenzhou finally relented, opening his mouth—it truly was quite uncomfortable to stay here. He felt trapped in this pure white room, which was too small and hard to bear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">But after seeing her, it didn’t feel as hard to bear anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">He finished the bowl of porridge and ate some of the other dishes as well. Throughout the whole process, Cheng Xi kept talking about random things, like how much his grandmother was worried about him, how often his grandfather thought of him, and how she had met Baldy and the rest, including a man called Xie Ziming.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Her voice was very pleasant to the ear, neither hurried nor slow, and neither anxious nor impatient. It was soft and gentle, like a relaxed spring breeze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">But Lu Chenzhou could still detect something off in her voice. He looked at her, suddenly asking, “Are you unhappy?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“……”</span></p>
