 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi immediately blurted out, “Don’t speak such nonsense……” But she was silenced with one hand from her mom.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi’s mother stared at Lu Chenzhou in horror, as if she were about to collapse. “Have you two gotten married yet?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lu Chenzhou didn’t understand why Cheng Xi’s mother was asking this, but he insipidly replied, “No.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Then just what do those words of yours mean?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">A faint hint of shyness appeared on Lu Chenzhou’s face⁠—so faint that the three of them wouldn’t have noticed it if they weren’t attentively staring at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">A very bad premonition surfaced in Cheng Xi’s heart. She was about to open her mouth to stop him, but she was too late. “I meant that she’s willing to get into bed with me now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi thought, ……</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Did you have to be so direct?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">While Cheng Xi’s parents couldn’t even think of a reply.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">They seemed to have lost all of their HP—both of them were sitting there stunned with indignant red faces, wanting to roar out in defiance.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Who on earth would say something that directly?!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">And someone like you, whose relationship with our daughter is still undetermined</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">For you to say something like that in front of us, her parents, are you really trying to be beaten to death?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lu Chenzhou blinked, and was surprised to see the three people in front of him show signs of extreme agitation. He raised his eyebrows in confusion.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Should I not have said those words?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">His experience in interacting with a ‘girlfriend’s’ family was really just too limited. In his own family, his mother had died early while his father had never cared about these kinds of things. Although his grandparents did ask a lot of questions, Lu Chenzhou always answered them simply and roughly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Case in point, his grandmother loved asking him, “How’s your relationship with Dr. Cheng going?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">He would mechanically answer, “chasing after her,” “kissed her,” and “can try to get into bed with her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After trying to ask him a few times, his grandmother didn’t dare ask again, because the answers were growing more and more provocative. Instead, she decided to just happily wait for the outcome.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lu Chenzhou innocently thought that Cheng Xi’s parents would behave the same as his grandmother, so he described the situation truthfully. No matter what, honesty was a virtue. Even when he conducted business, he particularly disliked roundabout discussions where each party gave evasive answers. Instead, he preferred to straightforwardly delineate his bottom line. If the business deal worked out for both of them, great; if not, that was also fine. He hated it people who just kept blabbering on the most.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">And since he was accustomed to everyone indulging in his preferences, Mr. Lu really didn’t understand how to be indirect, and him spending this much effort to chase after Cheng Xi was already an abnormal venture for him. Of course, it could also be interpreted that he immensely enjoyed doing so; otherwise, he would have just done what he did before: sign a contract and save himself all that trouble!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">And so, Cheng Xi’s pitiful parents received a tremendous shock—it was so bad that they were unable to regain their senses for quite a while: they simply didn’t know how to respond to Lu Chenzhou’s brazen words!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">They were angry, but their words remained choked up in their chests.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Finally, Cheng Xi stood up. She was exasperated, but she was at least mentally prepared for a situation like this, so she quickly recovered from her shock and regained her calmness⁠—what else could she do? All he had done was say his inner thoughts out loud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">But she also didn’t have any way to soften the impact of Lu Chenzhou’s words, so she could only attempt to nicely placate her parents. “We haven’t done anything inappropriate so far, have we? Mom, please stop worrying.” She placed her hand on top of her mother’s hand, her tone earnest. “We know what we’re doing, so please trust me, mom.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Her face was still flushed red, which somewhat lowered her credibility. However, she had at least found an excuse for her parents to extricate themselves from this conversation. They gladly accepted as they didn’t dare prod at this topic anymore, not even at the big red blanket—who knew what shocking thing would come from Lu Chenzhou’s mouth next time? Her mother glared at Cheng Xi, hissed, “I’ll deal with you later,” from the side of her mouth, and then looked toward Lu Chenzhou as she asked, “What are your future plans?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lu Chenzhou calmly responded that he planned on marrying Cheng Xi. Perhaps his earlier shocking remarks had conditioned Cheng Xi’s parents, but they actually both released a deep breath after hearing his relatively normal response.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After this, the meeting between Lu Chenzhou and Cheng Xi’s parents finally returned to normal, and next, her parents asked if his family knew about the relationship between the two of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lu Chenzhou replied, “Yes, they know.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“And they’re supportive of it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Even Cheng Xi’s father, who normally spoke very little, solemnly stated, “I won’t dance around the topic. There’s a very wide gap between the statuses of our two families, both in terms of social and financial positions. Our Cheng Xi has worked very hard for herself, and all we’ve ever wanted is for her to be happy, not to clamber around for wealth or position. Even if this means her not marrying, we won’t let her suffer even a bit of grievance.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi’s father was very earnest and mindful of the differences between them, and Cheng Xi noticed that after Lu Chenzhou heard her father’s words, he stilled a little. This was the first true emotional response that he had given tonight, and she noted it down in her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lu Chenzhou had already lowered his gaze, and after a while, he coolly replied, “I won’t let her suffer any grievances. I want to marry her, and I definitely won’t let her suffer if we do so.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">His words were spoken calmly, and his expression was also calm; however, it was this calmness that made his words feel heartfelt. This, along with the dash of pride and arrogance that was unique to him, gave his words a reliable feeling⁠—wouldn’t he be able to protect his own woman?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">And with that, they were essentially done talking. The food was served, and they began to eat and drink. Cheng Xi’s father normally only drank once or twice throughout the course of the year, but today, he actually tried to compete against Lu Chenzhou in drinking! It was all to get a sense for Lu Chenzhou’s actual personality⁠—after all, one’s moral character was invariably revealed under the influence of alcohol!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">But before he could see what Lu Chenzhou was like drunk, he fell drunk himself. And as he continued drinking and drinking, he eventually rolled underneath the table and fell asleep.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi’s mother was very angry. Didn’t he know what his alcohol tolerance was after all these years?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lu Chenzhou, on the other hand, glanced at Cheng Xi, finally understanding whom she had inherited her pitiful alcohol tolerance from.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Just like Cheng Xi, her father was a good drunk. He didn’t make a mess or fuss about; he just wanted to sleep peacefully.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">He was tall and heavy, and generally, even two or three people wouldn’t be enough to support him. Luckily, the location of the restaurant they were eating at was pretty convenient, as there was a hotel right upstairs. Lu Chenzhou helped them book a room, and afterwards, Cheng Xi’s parents went there to rest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Once Cheng Xi’s parents settled into the hotel room, Cheng Xi went out to send Lu Chenzhou off. The new year’s celebrations in the city were hardly festive; despite the particularly glamorous lights and shiny ornaments decorating the storefronts, there were very few pedestrians wandering about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As the two of them stood by the roadside, Cheng Xi finally found a chance to privately speak to Lu Chenzhou. “Sorry. My mother insisted on meeting you, so please excuse her actions.”</span></p>

While she was indeed a doctor, she was also a woman, and it made her uncomfortable when he kept throwing around phrases like “getting into bed together.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">But she didn’t shift her gaze away. She met his glance straight on and smiled as she replied, “Today, when my father said that he’d rather have me not marry than allow me suffer, you seemed very surprised, no?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lu Chenzhou pursed his lips.</span></p>

I don’t know what your precise stance on this issue is, but I feel like people needing to do certain things when they reach a certain age is a preposterous notion. We only have one life, so why do we&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">have&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">to get in a relationship or&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">have&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">to get married? The world is so large, and our choices are so numerous. Neither love nor marriage are necessities in our modern world.”</span></p>

I can answer you now: yes. But marrying you and falling in love with you are two completely different things, because I can choose whether or not I want to marry you, but I can’t choose whether or not I love you. What about you, Lu Chenzhou? Are you chasing after me because you want to get married, or because you truly love me?”</span></p>
