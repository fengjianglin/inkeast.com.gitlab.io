 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Perhaps it was because she was too tired, but Cheng Xi didn’t sleep well that day. She dreamed throughout the whole night, but her dreams were filled with scenes of neither rhyme nor reason, a large number of people and random things flitting through them. When a loud knocking sound came from her door, she was dreaming of walking barefoot along a cliff as loose stones cut at her like sharp knives.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">On some level, dreams reflected the inner self. As a psychiatrist, Cheng Xi clearly understood that this dream represented the danger that she felt from Lu Chenzhou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The intense knocking on her door shattered her dreams of danger. When she raised her head, she saw Lin Fan’s face through the screen door. She was very surprised because he exuded an aura of absolute dejection; his clothes were a mess and his hair disheveled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Once the door open, he immediately leapt over, hugged her, and started kissing her passionately. Cheng Xi was very unsettled; unlike Lu Chenzhou’s dazed actions that one night, Lin Fan’s passion seemed to be fueled by anger and suppressed emotions. His body’s stench was hard to bear, as it was the smell of stale beer mixed together with bitter tobacco and a cloyingly sweet perfume.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">She tried to block his advances. “Lin Fan, what’s wrong with you? Don’t be like this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">He ignored her and grabbed her hands. This never before seen impatient behavior felt like he was urgently trying to obtain something from her. Cheng Xi had never liked this sort of out-of-control intimacy. When he started pinning her hands down, she leaned back to build up some momentum before headbutting him with her skull when he kissed her behind the ear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The headbutt hurt Lin Fan enough to make him suck in a deep breath, forcing him to release her and grab his nose. Not long after, fresh blood seeped through his fingers.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Unfortunately, Cheng Xi hadn’t been very accurate and had accidentally smashed his nose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Even though her own face also hurt, Cheng Xi was still concerned for him first. “Are you alright?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lin Fan shook his head, clearly having sobered up from the shock. Faced with Cheng Xi’s clear-headed and somewhat cool expression, he was so embarrassed that he couldn’t even look her in the eye. Cheng Xi pretended not to have noticed his embarrassment and poured some cold water into a basin to serve as a compress to stop the bleeding. Then she even grabbed a wad of cotton for him to stuff up his nose.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Once she had prepared everything, Cheng Xi stooped to a side and watched him wash his nose. Her expression was filled with concentration, her expression oozing gentleness, and her clear eyes carrying a faint hint of a smile; her entire mien made one calm down quickly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lin Fan couldn’t help but splash her with a bit of water. Cheng Xi was unable to dodge it, and the water droplets dripped down her face like pearls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After a mess of a night, he could only marvel at how wonderful it was to see her again. Unable to resist the temptation in his heart, Lin Fan leaned in closer, trying to lick her lips.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi dodged, wiping her face while simultaneously laughing at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“What’re you laughing at?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“If I were you, I wouldn’t have chosen to hit on someone at this time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">She stretched out her hand, pointing at his nose. Only then did Lin Fan remember that two wads of cotton were still stuffed inside his nostrils. He quickly lowered his head and mumbled, “You’re quite fierce.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Sorry. I only wanted to hit you lightly.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As she said this, she couldn’t help but think of Lu Chenzhou and the two punches that she had given him; that was truly fierce. She could still see a bit of bruising by his jaw last night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">And for some reason, men always seemed to like trying to be intimate while they were out-of-control. Just what did they think they could achieve in that state?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lin Fan had completely sobered up by now, saying, “It’s fine. I’ll treat it as the price I have to pay for being frivolous.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Upon hearing this, Cheng Xi patted his head. “Keep reflecting. I’ll go wash up. If the bleeding doesn’t stop after a few minutes, then I’ll look at your face again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Her expression was so natural, it was almost as if his losing control wasn’t surprising at all. Although Lin Fan had felt somewhat guilty at first, not wanting her to ask about what happened that night, he actually felt somewhat depressed when she didn’t bring it up at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">He nodded as he responded somewhat stuffily, “Alright.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi was actually somewhat curious about what had happened. The reason why she didn’t ask was because she was trying to be conscientious; he would definitely tell her if he wanted to talk about it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">She didn’t think too much of it, so she went to wash her face with a relaxed heart. When she returned, Lin Fan was still kneeling in front of the wash basin. She walked over and his expression was one of extreme shock as he looked at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“What’s the matter?” His expression was too obvious, so much so that Cheng Xi couldn’t help but ask him about it. She asked, “Did something happen?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“No.” Lin Fan clutched at his nose, forcing himself to laugh. “I’m afraid that you’ll dislike me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Dislike you for what?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“For running over to your place and doing all that after I became really drunk… Don’t you blame me?” He glanced at her, his tone sincere. “I’m sorry. I originally wanted to wait for you to return, but my colleagues asked me to go drink, and I couldn’t blow them off. So, I had to head over… Oh, right. Is Mr Lu alright?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“It’s a bit serious. He scratched the hives that were caused by his allergic reaction and that broke the skin, which then led to a serious infection. In the end, he has to stay in a germ-free environment for a few days.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Oh,” Lin Fan responded, before asking a while later, “Did he actually not know that he can’t scratch himself after an allergic reaction?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This was said somewhat maliciously, but Cheng Xi knew what he was feeling and could sympathize with his reaction, so she pretended to not hear it. “He probably knows that, but he wasn’t paying attention. Actually, not only did he break through his skin, but he also immersed it in water, making it even more serious. Alright, let’s not talk about him anymore.” She stood up and rolled up her sleeves. “I’m planning on making up for last night’s dinner. Do you want to help?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“No.” Lin Fan had also realized that he was being petty, so he jokingly said, “I made all the food yesterday, so you have to make all of it today if you want to make it up to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi smiled. “Alright. Then just go wait outside for a big meal.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After saying this, she went into the kitchen. Lin Fan looked at her back, his smile slowly vanishing until his face was completely expressionless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The steak from yesterday was already cold, and it wouldn’t taste good even if she heated it back up. Cheng Xi felt that it would be a waste to throw it away, so she called her mom and asked her for advice on how to best revise it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As a chef with many years of experience, her mother quickly responded with a method. After she taught it to her daughter, she casually asked, “What’s Lu Chenzhou’s phone number? Give it to me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Admittedly, Lu Chenzhou had clearly been more excessive on that day than her. In her mother’s eyes, he had already gone from ‘that dolt’ to Lu Chenzhou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Black streaks marred Cheng Xi’s forehead. “Why do you want his number?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“You refused to let us parents meet up, so I want to talk to him about his aspirations and goals. Can’t I do even that?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi chuckled. “No, mom. Don’t cause any more trouble for me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">And then she hung up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When she turned around to grab some starch, she saw Lin Fan standing by the door. Her heart jumped a little, but she didn’t let it show. Instead, she put on a smile and said, “What’s the matter? Did you decide that you couldn’t bear have me work alone and came to offer me help?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">And Lin Fan indeed did wash his hands and start to help her. As Cheng Xi covered the steak in starch, he washed the vegetables by her side. As he washed them, he asked, “What do you like about me, Cheng Xi?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi looked at him, still smiling. “I’m not quite sure. Perhaps it’s because you stood out from the crowd?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Upon hearing this, Lin Fan also laughed, responding, “Then how long will you like me for?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“If you don’t change, then I probably won’t change either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Really?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Yup.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lin Fan just looked at her as his laugh started to turn somewhat forlorn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi wasn’t as skilled as her mother at cooking, so she had messed up the modified steak dish. In the end, it was Lin Fan who saved the day by making two ham sandwiches.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When breakfast was finally served, Cheng Xi’s phone rang. Lin Fan had come to her house very early, at almost six in the morning. So, they were also having an early breakfast, at around seven.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The call was from Lu Chenzhou’s grandmother, who was almost crying while on the phone. “The results are out. He has septicemia. What do we do?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Even though she could predict that Lu Chenzhou’s condition was quite serious from Dr. Xie’s expression last night, it was still hard for Cheng Xi to accept that the worst had actually happened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">After the phone call ended, she put down her utensils. Upon seeing her expression, Lin Fan quickly asked, “What’s the problem?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Lu Chenzhou’s examination results are out. He has septicemia.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lin Fan didn’t like her serious expression, and after a while, asked, “......Is it hard to cure?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Yes, somewhat.” She stood up and said, “I have to go to the hospital.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lin Fan pulled her down. “Can’t you eat something first?” He tried to restrain his anger as he looked at her. “It’s not your specialty, so being late isn’t a big deal. Please eat something before heading over, alright?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“I’m sorry. I really can’t eat anything right now.” She broke free and was about to walk away, truly very worried.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Peng! In his anger, Lin Fan threw his utensils onto the plate. He suddenly stood up. “Do you really care that much about him?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi stopped in her tracks, slowly turning around to look at him.</span></p>
