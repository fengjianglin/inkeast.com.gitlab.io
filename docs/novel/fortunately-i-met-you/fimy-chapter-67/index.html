 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">At the very least, Lu Chenzhou had enough shame to cover himself up with the quilt when he realized that Cheng Xi’s mother was in the room. He was even obedient enough to apologize to her. “Sorry, I didn’t expect you to be here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This time, he really wasn’t wearing anything. Luckily for Cheng Xi’s mother, all she saw was his naked backside---but just that was shocking enough already.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi’s mother glanced at him, summarily ignored him, took a deep breath, and glared at Cheng Xi. “Come out here right now!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi looked at Lu Chenzhou, causing the latter to say in a particularly serious tone, “I really do have rashes on my body.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When Cheng Xi and her mother stepped out to the corridor outside, her mother immediately started questioning her. Cheng Xi responded, “He has rashes on his body, so he took off his clothes to see how serious it was.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Her mother stared at her in annoyance. “Do you think that I’m an idiot? Even if he has rashes, would he have to strip naked for you to look at him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi blinked innocently. “We had to conduct a thorough inspection.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Her mother was so angry she began to yell incoherently. “Thorough… are the two of you thoroughly crazy?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Somehow, she had hit the nail on its head. Cheng Xi nodded seriously. “Actually, he is, so please don’t mind what he does too much. He’s somewhat abnormal in the head.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi was truly speaking her true thoughts, even if her mother didn’t believe her. But her mother pointed at her head and said, “I think that your head’s also abnormal! Make him leave! Make him leave quickly!” As her mother said this, she clutched her chest; whenever she thought about that scene just now, she felt like her eyes were really going to go blind from shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi also wanted Lu Chenzhou to leave as quickly as possible, but the key problem was… “Erm, he doesn’t have any clothes to wear… Brother’s clothes are too short for him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">In their family, both her father and her brother were shorter than Lu Chenzhou, so naturally, they didn’t have any clothes that would fit him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">At this point, Cheng Xi’s mother was so angry that she was about to burst out into laughter. “So there’s nothing you can do, is there?” She ran inside the living room angrily, preparing to roll up her sleeves and chase Lu Chenzhou out of the house herself; dolts could only be dealt with by force! But when she entered the room, she heard Lu Chenzhou making a call: “...Send me a set of clothes. Yes, right now. I’ll send you the address.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Once Lu Chenzhou finished making the call and saw that Cheng Xi’s mother had entered the room, he lowered his body and said, “I’m sorry. I might need to bother you for a little while more."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">He was quite handsome, so when he said these courteous words with his eyes lowered, it could almost make one forget all the unreasonable things that he had done.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi’s mother’s anger was immediately halved, and her voice softened. “It’s not that I want to chase you out, but… do you realize that your actions have been highly inappropriate?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The feeling he gave to others was still very cold, but now, it was a charming coldness, like a white lotus blooming on a snowy mountaintop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Last time, Cheng Xi’s mother had been so angry and shocked that she hadn’t looked at him that carefully. This time, however, when she looked closely, she noticed that the fellow actually looked quite handsome; no wonder her normally obedient daughter would secretly defy her for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">She gradually relaxed and then asked, “How long have you been dating my daughter for?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lu Chenzhou raised his head and vigorously shook it. “Sorry, we’re not dating.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">At this moment, Cheng Xi quickly interjected, “Mom, I already told you this. He’s not my boyfriend.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“Yes,” Lu Chenzhou added on, still in a cool tone, but with an additional tinge of grievance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi’s mother twisted her head around to glare at her daughter, the meaning in her eyes particularly obvious: Step to the side and stop talking nonsense! She turned back around and kept talking to Lu Chenzhou. “If you’re not my daughter’s boyfriend, then what’s your relationship with her?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When she entered the house, she had definitely heard him say that the two of them had even been in bed together. That wasn’t a hallucination, was it? Definitely not!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lu Chenzhou remained silent, like he was reluctant to say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi, who had been forbidden from ‘speaking nonsense,’ couldn’t bear it any further. She stepped in and said, “Mom, we’re just friends. Regular friends.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This time, Lu Chenzhou responded, glancing at Cheng Xu as he did so. “Oh.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">My goodness. Is he really trying to paint himself as a white lotus on a tall mountain and me as the evil boss of a crime syndicate?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;Cheng Xi huffed in anger—she didn’t know that Lu Chenzhou was this skilled at acting. She glowered at him as she threatened, “Hey, Mr. Lu, can you speak properly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Her mother stared at her. “You’re the one who should speak properly! Go to the side. I didn’t ask you anything!” Looking back at Lu Chenzhou, she then straightforwardly said, “Do you like my daughter?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“I don’t dislike her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Without a doubt, he was speaking the truth—he indeed did not dislike Cheng Xi. As for like, well, he really just ‘liked’ her. Unfortunately, her mother thought that Lu Chenzhou was trying to be tactful as there were some things that he didn’t dare to say. She sighed, and comfortingly said, “Don’t worry. I’ll have Cheng Xi make it up to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi made an ‘orz’ expression on her face [TL: ‘orz’ looks like a person kneeling down with his head on the ground], and finally felt that this misunderstanding couldn’t be allowed to deepen any further. She stretched out her hand and pulled her mother towards her. “Mom, come here. I’ll explain everything to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">But Lu Chenzhou reacted quickly and smiled coolly as he said, “Mrs. Cheng, actually, nothing much happened. We’re truly not in a relationship, and she owed me nothing. The first time we met, something happened that shouldn’t have, but that was my fault.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi was about to explode. “What do you mean something happened that shouldn’t have?! Nothing happened, alright?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lu Chenzhou glanced at her casually, nodding. “Oh.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi’s mouth was open, but she had no response to give. “……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">She really couldn’t clear things up anymore! Even if she dragged her mother into a room and told her the truth, that Lu Chenzhou was only her patient with an abnormal mental condition, her mother most likely wouldn’t believe her, would she?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Evidently, her mother couldn’t hold it in anymore, and started scolding her loudly. “I told you not to talk. Don’t you understand?!” She looked at Lu Chenzhou again, her tone as amiable as could be. “Don’t worry. I said that she would make it up to you, and she will. As for last night, why did you come looking for Cheng Xi so late at night?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lu Chenzhou was silent, and only after a little while did he say, “Actually, I have nothing. I also don’t know how I ended up here.” Looking towards her mother, he said, “And again, I’m sorry. I didn’t intentionally strip in front of you. I really am having an allergic reaction. Look.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As he said this, he stretched out his hand. The wrist he revealed did have a large lump of red rashes; because his skin was white and he’d been scratched himself, it was particularly striking.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi’s mother believed him with absolute certainty now. She stood up and said, “It really does look quite serious. Sit down, and I’ll get some medicine for you. It’ll get better in no time. You come too, help Mom take a look if this medicine is fine.” The last sentence was directed at Cheng Xi. Disregarding her willingness, Cheng Xi’s mother pulled her into another room and closed the door. The first words out of her mouth were, “I don’t know when you became like this. How can you be so wild with intimate relationships?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">And then she asked, “Do you really have another boyfriend?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi was still trying to process the situation, speechless. “……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">She couldn’t laugh or cry. “Mom, can you not cause more trouble? The relationship I have with him isn’t what you think it is. I promise.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“You promise? Last time, you even promised to break up with him. But, what was the result? Through the video call, your father and I clearly saw that he pounced on you as soon as he entered! And, last night, old grandfather Li even told us that, in the middle of the night, you ran downstairs to be intimate with him! Cheng Xi, if you’re unwilling to admit what your relationship with him is because of our objection, that’s nothing. Last time, your dad also convinced me that you younger generation will do fine even without my supervision. Given your age, it’s also normal for you to get a boyfriend. I just think that he’s a bit dazed. But after looking at him again today, I guess he’s alright, a bit empty headed, but he does truly like you. If the two of you want to get together, then that’s fine too. As long as his family’s background is alright and he truly treats you well, then as your parents, we won’t object. So don’t pretend to have another boyfriend to dodge our questions. Really, I’ve seen those two-timing people, and they make my heart worry for them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi’s mother waved her hand, and in a clearly exhausted voice, she said, “Go out. Go look at his rashes. Tell him that if he’s serious, then we should make plans for our two families to meet and get food together sometime.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“...Mom, haven’t you changed your mind a bit too quickly?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Her mother became incensed again. “If we didn’t change our mind, then would we have to wait for you to become pregnant before acknowledging the two of you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“……”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">A doorbell rang outside. Cheng Xi’s mother glared at her one last time before walking out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Cheng Xi followed her out, and somewhat felt exhausted when she saw Lu Chenzhou curled up on the sofa like a mealworm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Her mother had gone to open the door when she heard her somewhat forced laughter. “Ah, it’s Lin Fan? What’re you doing here so early?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Lin Fan’s warm voice responded, “Good morning, Auntie. I’m here to bring Cheng Xi to work.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Upon hearing this, Lu Chenzhou tilted his head at her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">As for Cheng Xi, well, she really didn’t know what to do now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">At this time, she really wanted to make an anonymous forum post: my real boyfriend’s at the door, and he’s about to see my purported boyfriend sleeping in my home. But really, nothing happened. How can I explain the situation to everyone involved? Waiting online, quite urgent!</span></p>
