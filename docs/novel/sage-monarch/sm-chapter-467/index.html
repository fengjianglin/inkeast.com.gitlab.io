<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>“That's the Hall of Beheadings and Executions just up ahead, Junior Brother. It’s the largest organization in the Titan Emperor Collegium, with too many disciples to count. They’re in charge of enforcing all of the countless laws, and they even have freshman students working for them out in the mining planets.”</p>
 <p>An enormous structure became visible ahead of them, visibly imposing and pulsing with a killing aura that could cause one's blood to run cold.</p>
 <p>As Yang Qi landed in front of the place, he eyed the warding magics that protected it. Immediately, the guards stepped forward.</p>
 <p>“Who are you?” one of them shouted. “Which society are you from? How dare you try to enter the Hall of Beheadings and Executions without permission? Tired of living? Or are you here to lodge a petition? If it’s the latter, then step to the side, get on your knees, and pray for three days and three nights. Afterward, you can strike the Drum of Petition to request a hearing.”</p>
 <p>The Hall of Beheadings and Executions was a place where students could come to resolve differences or report murders or thefts. If one had the proper connections, one could go right in. If not, the requirement was to pray for three days and nights, then strike the Drum of Petition. Any who tried to skirt the rules would be accused of committing a crime, and then, not only would their petition not be heard, but they would also be arrested and sent to the mines.</p>
 <p>Yang Qi and Sword Seventeen didn’t even respond to the guard. They simply stood there calmly until Unmerciful Beheader and his fellows caught up.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“These are two dangerous criminals,” Unmerciful Beheader shouted, “Sword Seventeen and Yang Qi from the Invincible Society! Hurry up and activate the grand formation to lock them down. Call on the warding magics! Quick, before they attack us!”</p>
 <p>The other disciples from the Hall of Beheadings and Executions all began clamoring in shock and surprise.</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>“The Invincible Society!?”</p>
 <p>“So this is the Yang Qi that somehow got out of the Myriad Worlds Monarch Chart with a bunch of treasure? When he joined the collegium, he went crazy during the entrance ceremony and killed a bunch of people!”</p>
 <p>“Incredible, I can’t believe we captured someone as arrogant as this. Great, now we can make his life so full of pain that he’ll wish he could die. In fact, he’ll beg for death!”</p>
 <p>“There’s no need for your warding magics,” Yang Qi said. “I’m not going anywhere. I don’t care if your Hall of Beheadings and Executions is as dangerous as a dragon’s pool or a tiger’s den, I'm going inside. Besides, I thought you wanted to interrogate me. Let’s see what tricks your elders try to pull, and just how strong you people really are.”</p>
 <p>Without any further fanfare, Yang Qi walked into the main entrance, completely ignoring the effects of any of the warding magics.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on here? Our spell formations are deadly and impenetrable! How could he just walk right in? Are the formations just ignoring him?”</p>
 <p>“Amazing,” Unmerciful Beheader said. “So the stories are true. He really does have a primeval godworm! And he fused with it! He has enlightenment of the godly laws of space. Otherwise, how could he possibly just waltz into the Hall of Beheadings and Executions? Quick,” he shouted, “tell the grand elders, they’ll definitely want to lead the interrogation.”</p>
 <p>Earlier, Unmerciful Beheader had felt a bit embarrassed at being steamrolled by Yang Qi, but now things were different. Yang Qi had seemingly thrown himself into an inescapable trap and was definitely heading toward an early grave.</p>
 <p>Bugle cries rang out everywhere, and countless streams of killing intent erupted from the depths of the Hall of Beheadings and Executions. Within moments, everyone knew that an important case was about to be tried.</p>
 <p>“This is where they perform interrogations and hear cases,” Sword Seventeen said as they emerged from a corridor into a spacious hall, at the end of which was a handful of royal thrones. In front of the thrones was a massive table adorned with writing implements and command medallions. There was even an incense burner that was apparently used to offer sacrifices to heaven. It looked very much like the kind of court that would be seen in the mortal world. <span id="footnote-ref-a951"><a href="#footnote-a951">[1]</a></span></p>
 <p>As Yang Qi and Sword Seventeen walked in, bugle calls echoed about. At the same time, a host of figures blurred through the air and took their places on the thrones. These were the top experts of the Hall of Beheadings and Executions, including the elders, grand elders, prime elders, and prime paragon elders. Numerous elite disciples also rushed in, bearing vicious instruments of torture as they glared menacingly at Yang Qi and Sword Seventeen.</p>
 <p>Of course, Unmerciful Beheader was there in the crowd.</p>
 <p>It took only a few short moments for the entire courtroom hall to be roused, and as they assembled their gazes flickered with animosity, jealousy, and greed. In short, there wasn't a single good and honest person among them.</p>
 <p>Sword Seventeen looked around at the forces arrayed against them, his heart pounding. “Well, Junior Brother, it seems the Hall of Beheadings and Executions is going all out to try to deal with us. Word really spread quickly that we got those godworm eggs, and who could avoid getting jealous of the level of wealth they represent? That’s not to mention how important godworms can be when it comes to immortal ascension. Although, you can’t help but wonder how the rumors started.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, I’ll handle it,” Yang Qi said through gritted teeth. “If we don’t give these people a good thrashing, how can we maintain the reputation of the Invincible Society? But first, let’s see if we can get a better idea of what they want.”</p>
 <p>Unmerciful Beheader walked out from the crowd, kneeled to the three prime paragon elders, and loudly said, “Prime Paragon Elders, these are the rebel students Yang Qi and Sword Seventeen. First they resisted arrest, then they forced their way into our headquarters. For that alone, they should die ten thousand deaths! There’s no need to hold any trial. Just execute them right here in the courtroom hall, then slaughter their clans down to the last living person.”</p>
 <p>“Calm down,” said one of the prime paragon elders as he and his compatriots studied Yang Qi and Sword Seventeen.</p>
 <p>Transmitting his voice via divine will, Sword Seventeen said, ‘Junior Brother, these are the three top overlords of the Hall of Beheadings and Executions. Heavenly Beheader. Earthly Beheader. Mortal Beheader. Collectively, they’re known as the “Heavenly, Earthly, and Mortal Patriarchs Three”. All of them are seventh order Revered Demi-Immortals. You definitely can’t take them lightly. They have a joint technique that they can employ called the <em>Hell-Beheading Triple-Treasure Immortal-Punishing Grand Formation</em>.’</p>
 <p>Yang Qi didn't respond to Sword Seventeen. He simply nodded, then raised his voice and said, “Why did your Hall of Beheadings and Executions send people to the Invincible Society to arrest us? What crime did we commit? I came here today to get some answers. If you're just randomly tossing around trumped up charges then things aren’t going to end well for you today.”</p>
 <p>Immediately, the crowd erupted.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Things won’t end well for us? HAHAHAHAHAHA!”</p>
 <p>“How arrogant! How conceited! Sadly, your Invincible Society’s Eldest Brother is trapped in the Myriad Worlds Monarch Chart and the Invincible Dugu is in seclusion. In fact, he might have ascended already.”</p>
 <p>“You two brats are the only ones left in the Invincible Society, and you dare to say that things won’t go well for us? Execute them! Skin them alive, sever their tendons, and leave them to rot!”</p>
 <p>“No! Cut their tongues out first.”</p>
 <p>“Inflict the worst torture possible on them, but don’t let them die!”</p>
 <p>“How impudent!”</p>
 <p><em>BAM!</em></p>
 <p>Mortal Beheader slammed his palm down onto the table and glared around at the disciples in the courtroom hall, who instantly went quiet. Then he looked back at Yang Qi and Sword Seventeen and said, “You want to know what crime you committed? A whole group of students from the Hegemon’s Society was set to emerge from seclusion and become elysian children. The entire area was locked down! That’s what our rules of etiquette demand! But you two caused a big scene, even murdering a noble student! That’s your crime! It’s punishable by death, and that includes your whole clan!”</p>
 <p>Yang Qi snorted. “Unlawfully barring entrance to the Invincible Society is a bigger crime. We never got any orders from Master saying that the entrance could be blocked! We're the top society in the Titan Emperor Collegium! Sealing our entrance without advance notification is an outright plot against us, and is punishable by death. &nbsp;Furthermore, if you want to arrest us, you had better well notify our Master about it first.”</p>
 <p>“What outrageous gall you have!” Earthly Beheader said with a cold chuckle. “Even at this point, you’re still carrying on with your ravings? The Invincible Society is done for. Henceforth, the Titan Emperor Collegium will no longer tolerate you people. Understand? Your society is a malignant tumor! Not only do you not contribute resources to the Titan Emperor Collegium, but you go around breaking the rules and acting with complete arrogance. Without excising you, our collegium can never cast its glory onto the surrounding world. Men, bind these two and force them to their knees. The time has come to announce their punishment.”</p>
 <p>“Slow down!” someone said, their voice instantly cutting through the building killing aura. It was none other than Heavenly Beheader. The slightest wave of his hand caused everyone in the hall to stop moving. Looking at Yang Qi and Sword Seventeen, he said, “According to the heaven above, <em>there is virtue in sparing life</em>. You two committed a heinous crime, and normally speaking you would be executed and your entire clan wiped out. There’s really no reason whatsoever to pardon you. However, I have the authority to do just that, as long as you provide a significant contribution to the collegium. I heard that you acquired a stash of treasure in the Myriad Worlds Monarch Chart, including some primeval godworm eggs. Those things are quite valuable. As immoral criminals, it’s definitely inappropriate for you to have such a collection. Hand them over to us, the proper authorities, and you’ll be forgiven.”</p>
 <p>Yang Qi’s eyes flickered as he looked around at the forces arrayed against them. Obviously, the three patriarchs were playing good cop, bad cop, all in an attempt to get his godworm eggs. <span id="footnote-ref-c19f"><a href="#footnote-c19f">[2]</a></span></p>
 <p>‘So,’ he thought, ‘it’s true that rumors have spread about me having some godworm eggs. But who started the rumors? I never told anyone, and neither did Sword Seventeen.’ Laughing, he raised his voice and said, “You went to all this trouble just to get my godworm eggs? Well, let me tell you the truth. Although I do have a big collection, I don't have any extra to hand out. Not even one.”</p>
 <p>“Oh really?” Heavenly Beheader said, his smile turning sinister. “Don’t be impulsive, boy. I’ll lock you up in the worst prison we have here in the Hall of Beheadings and Executions and only let you out when your head is clear. In the meantime, we’ll round up all of your family, including the Holy Mother from the Hanging Mountain. Perhaps they can convince you to hand over your treasures. Hopefully you’ll do the right thing when the time comes. Your mother might be famous in the Hanging Mountain, but compared to the Titan Emperor Collegium that place is like a speck of dust. Men, take him away and start using the Ten Brutal Torture Methods until he talks. Unmerciful Beheader, you go to the Yore-Wilds Continent to round up his family. If anyone resists, kill them on the spot.”</p>
 <p>“Yes sir!” Unmerciful Beheader said, chuckling coldly.</p>
 <p>At this point, Yang Qi sighed. “I would never have guessed that you people from the Hall of Beheadings and Executions would be so faceless. I don’t even think you know the meaning of the term face. Well, I suppose I’ll just kill you all.”</p>

 <div id="footnote-a951">
  <p>1. I searched a bit to try to find a picture to show you what an ancient Chinese-style court would look like. The best I could find is this scene from the classic wuxia flick Iron Monkey. <a href="https://youtu.be/Aa3oo7MLmqE?t=1266" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Check out the scene here</a>. Obviously, the scene from the novel is supposed to have more than one chair behind the table, but the general idea is the same (based on the comments, this clip is apparently unavailable in some regions on YouTube). If you haven’t watched Iron Monkey before, <a href="https://amzn.to/2Zhi4Zf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">do it now</a>! <a href="#footnote-ref-a951"><i class="far fa-hand-point-left"></i></a></p>

 <div id="footnote-c19f">
  <p>2. In Chinese “good cop, bad cop” is a reference to Chinese opera that literally means “to sing the role of the (red-faced) hero, to sing the role of the (black-faced) villain”. <a href="#footnote-ref-c19f"><i class="far fa-hand-point-left"></i></a></p>
