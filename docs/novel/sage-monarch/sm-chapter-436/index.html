<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Who could have guessed that scum from the Demi-Immortal Institute would be in the Myriad Worlds Monarch Chart?</p> 
 <p>Considering that Yang Qi had done away with the core teachings and doctrines of that institute, he considered any surviving loyalists to be enemies. He hadn’t even spared the chancellor’s daughter, much less others.</p> 
 <p>Even still, he was determined to&nbsp;<em>cut the weeds and eliminate the roots</em>, and eliminate all traces of the institute and its influence.</p> 
 <p>‘I wonder if any of my Elder Brothers and Sisters are around as well,’ he thought. &nbsp;‘They’re definitely strong enough to win any fights over spatial nexuses. If they’re here, I need to help them get out. That said, it's probably not urgent. They’ll need time to go searching for treasure anyway, otherwise the trip here would end up being a big waste. The best thing of all would be to find one of those immortal corpses….’</p> 
 <p>With his primeval godworm larva, it should be relatively easy to leave the Myriad Worlds Monarch Chart through a world junction. That wasn’t necessarily a priority right now, though. Although he couldn’t achieve cultivation base advancement here, he could still contemplate the magical laws and achieve rapid advancement in his enlightenment.</p> 
 <p>In fact, he was fairly certain that he could quickly achieve soul enlightenment of the Demi-Immortal level, and perhaps even advance a few orders within it.</p> 
 <p>And he could still sense his immortal clone back in the Sage Monarch Continent. With enlightenment of the Demi-Immortal level, the clone would achieve breakthroughs. And maybe he could even help open a passageway to the Hell of Mahānata.</p> 
 <p>“Fine, let’s go find a world junction,” Yang Qi said, sealing the infernal and tossing him into the God Legion Paradise. “Once I'm out of this place, you’ll be working as a guard for me back home….”</p> 
 <p>This infernal was a second order Demi-Immortal and had a much purer bloodline than Ghost Emperor Yama. He was also vastly stronger. To have a Greater Demi-Immortal guarding the Sage Monarch Continent would make it much safer, especially against people from the Hanging Mountain.</p> 
 <p>“How do we find the world junctions?” Yang Qi asked.</p> 
 <p>“They have particularly strong magical laws, so you can find them by following the fluctuations. Nobody even knows how many world junctions there are here. If you searched for a million years, you would probably never find all of them. However, a few of the most powerful factions are camped around some world junctions that were discovered recently. From what I heard, the godworm patriarchs are in trances absorbing spatial power, which makes it safe to get close and even try to go inside.”</p> 
 <p>“Fine, let’s go to one of those,” Yang Qi said. “You know the way, right?”</p> 
 <p>“Of course,” the infernal said, then began leading the way along a winding path.</p> 
 <p>As Yang Qi proceeded along, his various energy arts, including the Strength of the Hell-Crushing Godmammoth, all grew stronger, little by little. After all, the godworm continued to chew away at the spatial power and impart its power to Yang Qi, which filled him with more and more Blood of the One God.</p> 
 <p>Although he could not achieve breakthroughs, godworms definitely could.</p> 
 <p>And because he controlled this godworm, when its cultivation base improved it was almost the same as his own improving.</p> 
 <p>‘I need to get some immortal pills made with spatial godpower,’ Yang Qi thought. ‘Things like that would be a big help to my godworm’s cultivation base.’</p> 
 <p>“There’s a world junction just up ahead, Milord,” the infernal said. “See, there are entire cities built up around it. You need to be very careful going forward. If anybody gets even slightly suspicious that you have a godworm, you’ll get mobbed instantly. You have to keep it a secret….”</p> 
 <p>“You think I don't know that?” Yang Qi replied. Up ahead, he saw an area where space seemed to sink in on itself. It was a spatial sea of power so intense that it was like a flow of lava. And every movement sent out shocking fluctuations that shook even the soul.</p> 
 <p>Within that spatial sea were cities of cultivators. Obviously, this place was like a holy land of cultivation. As for the cities, they were on such a different level than the village from earlier that they couldn’t even be compared.</p> 
 <p>“Milord, the people in that little village from before were all nobodies. Because their lifespans are reaching an end and their battle prowess is waning, none of them would ever dare to get close to a world junction. If they did, they would probably get killed for whatever scraps of longevity they have left. The fighting that goes on near world junctions can be fierce and bitter.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>“After all, every ten thousand years or so the world junctions will form spatial nexuses and eject immortal items, medicinal pills, daoist texts, and the like. Although, I guess you probably know that already. By the way, here in the Myriad Worlds Monarch Chart, we don’t use immortal stones for currency. We use a type of immortal pill called Heavenseizing Pills. Even immortals who consume them will gain a hundred years of longevity, and they never expire. As you can imagine, they’re a lot more valuable than immortal items or daoist texts.”</p> 
 <p>Apparently, the infernal was worried about Yang Qi not being aware of important matters, thus he chattered on endlessly to make sure Yang Qi was informed.</p> 
 <p>As for Yang Qi, he was actually pleased, as it confirmed that he had the creature under his complete control.</p> 
 <p>That said, there was no way he would simply trust what the infernal said. He would definitely ask around to get his own information. Once he was certain he knew what was really going on in the Myriad Worlds Monarch Chart, he would decide exactly what to do.</p> 
 <p>As soon as he entered the nearest city he was bombarded by divine will, causing his sea of consciousness to virtually tremble. There were cultivators everywhere selling all sorts of items for all sorts of prices.</p> 
 <p>“Immortal items! Get your immortal items! I have defective immortal items for only ten Heavenseizing Pills!”</p> 
 <p>“I have a heavenly-class energy art here, direct from inside a world junction. Grand-Sorrow True-Dragon Thousand-Leaves True-Zodiac! It’s a secret incantation cultivated by the ancient true dragons. With it, you can form a dragon-shaped true zodiac. I’ll part with it for twenty Heavenseizing Pills!”</p> 
 <p>“I have information for sale. I know a world junction that has a godworm larva in it!”</p> 
 <p>There was a dazzling array of incomplete immortal items, defective immortal items, quasi-immortal items, counterfeit immortal items, heavenly-class energy arts, and immortal stones.</p> 
 <p>Yang Qi was also surprised to notice other Great Sages present whose soul enlightenment was in the Demi-Immortal level.</p> 
 <p>All of a sudden, he felt some divine will fluctuations that he recognized.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Some distance away was a street as wide as a plain, lined with numerous mansion grottos.</p> 
 <p>At the end of the street was a sword-wielding individual in green clothing and a bamboo hat, surrounded by a host of foes.</p> 
 <p>“You want to murder and rob me?!” he shouted.</p> 
 <p>Yang Qi recognized him immediately as his Elder Seventeenth Brother from the Invincible Society, Sword Seventeen. It was Sword Seventeen who had brought him into the Invincible Society, and the two of them were rather close. As it turned out, he had found his way into the Myriad Worlds Monarch Chart.</p> 
 <p>At a single glance, Yang Qi could see that, in the time they had been apart, Sword Seventeen’s cultivation base had reached the terrifying level of the eighth step, making him a Without Limit Sage. That said, his soul enlightenment was apparently one with the dao of heaven, placing him just ahead of Yang Qi as a full Demi-Immortal.</p> 
 <p>If it weren’t for the fact that he was stuck in the Myriad Worlds Monarch Chart, Sword Seventeen would definitely be a Demi-Immortal already.</p> 
 <p>Right now he was surrounded by six Lesser Demi-Immortals, who had him pinned in a corner with a powerful energy field. From the way they carried themselves, it seemed they were used to doing things like this.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t you know the rules here, punk? How dare you just try to buy things randomly! You obviously just arrived in the Myriad Worlds Monarch Chart, and I bet you have plenty of medicinal pills that increase lifespan, don’t you? Well hand them over! And give us half of your longevity while you’re at it.”</p> 
 <p>This particular man’s eyes glittered with vicious, violet light. Although his energy arts were only in the Lesser Demi-Immortal level, his soul enlightenment was already in the Profound Demi-Immortal level.</p> 
 <p>Sword Seventeen had apparently been pushed to his limit. Brandishing his sword, he shouted, “Die!”</p> 
 <p>The foes who surrounded him smiled coldly. Apparently, they had been waiting for him to make the first move so they could have the excuse of defending themselves.</p> 
 <p>Even as Sword Seventeen began to stab his sword through the air, a hand reached out and stopped him.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>“Hold on a moment, Elder Seventeenth Brother,” Yang Qi said. “What a surprise to see you here. There’s no need for you to lower yourself to the level of dealing with nobodies like this. Let me take care of them for you.”</p> 
 <p>Sword Seventeen looked over in surprise and delight. “Junior Eighteenth Brother! So, you got in here too! It's too bad this place is a trap. I got here a month ago, and already stumbled across quite a bit of good fortune. I made some progress with my energy arts, but unfortunately we can’t achieve breakthroughs. I got a message from Elder Second Brother. He’s around as well, although I'm not sure where exactly. This Myriad Worlds Monarch Chart is huge. Come on, let’s join forces and break free of these Demi-Immortals.”</p> 
 <p>“Break free? Why?” Yang Qi suddenly turned.</p> 
 <p>Before the Lesser Demi-Immortals could even react to the turn of events they were all slapped in the chest with a palm strike, causing blood to spray from their mouths.</p> 
 <p>Cracking sounds erupted as they exploded like ceramic vessels, then they were burned into nothing by sagefire.</p> 
 <p>Scarcely able to believe his eyes, Sword Seventeen looked at Yang Qi. “This….”</p>
