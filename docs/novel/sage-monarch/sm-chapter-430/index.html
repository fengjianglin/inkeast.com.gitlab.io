<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>In the depths of the violet wormhole, the energy flows and the powerful manifestations of space and time were strong enough to end the lives of powerful Demi-Immortals.</p>
 <p>For Yang Qi, though, it was an incredible experience that had already pushed his soul to the point where it hovered on the verge of Demi-Immortal-level enlightenment. Furthermore, his primeval godworm had reached the second step of its life cycle.</p>
 <p>Fueled by the Blood of the One God, it gobbled up the streams of time-light, which caused the magical laws of time to resonate within the God Legion Paradise.</p>
 <p>In fact, it was almost as if music were echoing within Yang Qi’s domain, a chorus of sonorous voices belonging to the legion of gods.</p>
 <p>It was the Eternal Heavenly Aria, which was the next progression of the Strength of the Hell-Crushing Godmammoth after the Hand of the One God.</p>
 <p>The first major energy art that had come with the Strength of the Hell-Crushing Godmammoth was the Infernal Deity Spear. After that came the Fiend-Devil Wings, Infernal Deity Plate Armor, Hellfire Crucible, Hell Portal, Devil-God Seal, Physique of the Sovereign Lord, Lord's Eye, God Legion Paradise, Fist of the Halls of Heaven, and Hand of the One God.</p>
 <p>Next in line was the Eternal Heavenly Aria, which was intended for the Demi-Immortal level. It was a heavenly song of true energy that would fill those who heard it with the most holy of auras. Allies of Yang Qi would find their battle prowess increased as a result, whereas enemies would be greatly weakened. In fact, the song could eat away at longevity and reduce the level of an enemy’s true energy. In some ways, it was actually more powerful than the time-light in this violet wormhole.</p>
 <p>Of course, the Eternal Heavenly Aria was only in the beginning stages of its development. He wouldn’t be able to use the full song until he was thoroughly and utterly in the Demi-Immortal level. At that point, the song could be used to bless or damn countless living things.</p>
 <p>Just getting his soul to the Demi-Immortal level wouldn’t give him the full song; it had to be all of him.</p>
 <p>As soon as the beginning stages of the Eternal Heavenly Aria echoed out, the time-light in the area was suppressed.</p>
 <p>Yang Qi began dropping down faster than before, heading directly toward the immortal items and magical treasures.</p>
 <p><em>WHIZZZ!</em></p>
 <p>The first thing he encountered was a curved saber fully fifty kilometers from end to end that pulsed with a powerful energy flow. It was in the shape of the moon and could clearly slice anything in half.</p>
 <p>The name of the saber was inscribed on the blade in the script of the immortal world above: Moon-Carver. Even a planet that tried to get in the way of this blade would end up carved in half. It was fairly bursting with immortal motes and completely surpassed any of the immortal items he had left in the Sage Monarch Continent, such as the Heaven-Burying Bow and Heaven-Wasting Arrows.</p>
 <p>Immortal items were classified by how many immortal motes they had, as well as how big those motes were.</p>
 <p>The items he had left behind were fairly low on immortal motes, and those motes were not very large. But as for this Moon-Carver, it had fully a thousand motes, all of which were very large.</p>
 <p>‘This thing is incredible! It's going to make a great addition to the defenses of the Sage Monarch Continent!’ He reached out with the Hand of the One God to grab it, yet as soon as he touched it, the thing unleashed an unprecedentedly sharp beam of light, giving the Hand of the One God a grievous slash.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, Moon-Carver removed a significant portion of his longevity, which in turn caused the blade to radiate even more dazzling light.</p>
 <p>“<em>Undying!</em>” he said with a cold smile, unleashing one of the deadly stances from the Hand of the One God. It took some effort, but he managed to grab the blade and slap numerous Devil-God Seals onto it, then toss it into the God Legion Paradise.</p>
 <p>The primeval godworm let out a sudden howl as it sensed the immortal motes on the blade, which it apparently found to be extremely enticing.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, it lunged forward and consumed the blade, digesting the immortal motes and causing the item itself to melt into nothing. &nbsp;As it did, even more complex designs appeared on the godworm’s skin.</p>
 <p>‘What a pity,’ Yang Qi thought, sighing. ‘That Moon-Carver was incredibly powerful, and it would have been a great precious treasure to leave as a reserve item in the Sage Monarch Continent. But the godworm just ate it!’</p>
 <p><em>Swish!</em></p>
 <p>Another immortal item flew in his direction—a long sickle covered with blood, inscribed with the name Soul-Taker. It was even more powerful than Moon-Carver.</p>
 <p>Yang Qi had learned from his previous experience. After grabbing and sealing the sickle, he tossed it into the God Legion Paradise, but this time he kept the godworm in check so that it didn’t eat it.</p>
 <p>The godworm was essentially a part of Yang Qi now, fused with his soul. He even shared its memories. Therefore, keeping it under control was a simple thing, as long as he exercised control.</p>
 <p><em>RUMBLE!</em></p>
 <p>There were more immortal items flying up. However, Yang Qi could sense the powerful auras above him growing closer and closer.</p>
 <p>‘Forget these immortal items,’ he thought. ‘I need to get down there and fuse with the spatial nexus. Let the other people fight for the immortal items, the most important thing for me now is to get into the Myriad Worlds Monarch Chart. That’s where the real treasure lies, and it’s also my ticket to the Hell of Mahānata.’</p>
 <p>His decision made, he ignored the immortal items and accelerated.</p>
 <p>Soon, other incredible treasures appeared, such as godly-grade spirit stones, immortal stones, rare crafting materials, immortal grasses, and spirit pills.</p>
 <p>He saw a golden streak of light that turned out to be an immortal pill that he had read about in certain ancient records. It was called a Barrier-Bashing Immortal Pill, the idea being that it helped to break through cultivation bottlenecks.</p>
 <p>They were so rare that they could easily cause wars to spring up between sects. In fact, they weren’t even common in the Titan Emperor Collegium.</p>
 <p>However, he didn’t need things like that. His current obstacle could not be broken by any immortal pill; he was facing a limitation of heaven and earth, not a personal limitation.</p>
 <p>He had friends and family members who could definitely benefit from such a pill, but he ignored it just the same. Time was of the essence and he didn’t want to waste it by collecting treasure.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, he caught the sound of shouting and fighting behind him as the experts began to struggle over the immortal items, pills, stones and the like. Of course, there were a few of the experts who, like Yang Qi, ignored the treasures at hand in the hopes of reaching the spatial nexus.</p>
 <p>Moments later, Yang Qi saw that, deep within the violet wormhole, there was a conglomeration of Proterozoic Violet Energy that was a minor world. Not only was it raging with incredible power, but it was shooting out the immortal items, pills, and stones.</p>
 <p>There even seemed to be immortal-spirits lurking in the area.</p>
 <p>‘That’s the place!’ Yang Qi thought. He knew that this minor world housed the spatial nexuses leading into the Myriad Worlds Monarch Chart. That was what he needed to fuse with to gain entrance.</p>
 <p><em>“The Origin of the Dao of Heaven, the Light of the Legion of Gods. How Large the Cosmos, the Heart of Heaven and Earth!”</em> Without hesitating, Yang Qi sent out a stream of true energy, throwing in the power of the godworm to cause the minor world to begin to twist and distort.</p>
 <p>Now that the godworm was in the second step of its life cycle, it was equivalent to a second order Greater Demi-Immortal and it had profound control over space. Considering that Yang Qi had the Strength of the Hell-Crushing Godmammoth, it meant that he could unleash force similar to a Profound Demi-Immortal.</p>
 <p>His true energy quickly gave way to the embryonic form of the Eternal Heavenly Aria. Surrounded by his God Legion Paradise, he flew toward the minor world ahead of him.</p>
 <p><em>RUMBLE!</em></p>
 <p>Before he could even enter the minor world, a figure appeared behind Yang Qi and unleashed a palm strike.</p>
 <p>“Are you looking to die, brat! You're only a Great Sage, but you think you can take that nexus? How did you even get in here!?”</p>
 <p>Light streamed out, causing everything it touched to wither. At the same time, an ancient aura filled the depths of the wormhole, destroying Yang Qi’s stream of true energy.</p>
 <p>Everything else seemed to vanish to Yang Qi, with the exception of that mighty, god-like figure who had just appeared like an entity out of an epic saga of the past.</p>
 <p>“It will be glorious for you to die by my Timeless Age Profound Technique, a consummate art of the Coiling Arc Collegium. Normally, you wouldn’t even be able to see something like this.”</p>
