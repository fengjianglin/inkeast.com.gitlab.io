 <p>Sighing, the Holy Mother looked at her son and said, “Qi’er, godly-class energy arts are techniques left in the mortal world by the ancient legion of gods. Whenever they appear, they lead to storms of blood and death. Who could have ever guessed that the two of us would both end up with one? Unfortunately, it’s also a very dangerous situation.</p>
 <p>“When I was in the Hell of Gloom and Darkness, I found a crumbled jade wall, upon which was inscribed a fragment of a godly-class energy art. The information also revealed many secrets to me. In the ancient world, energy arts were ranked royal-, imperial-, saintly-, and heavenly-class. Anything beyond heavenly-class was considered an immortal skill, although most of them were actually combinations or augmentations of heavenly-class arts. Technically speaking, none of the immortal skills actually surpassed the heavenly-class arts. But godly-class energy arts are different; they completely surpass anything else that exists. Even in the countless heavenly worlds, it’s a rare thing to encounter a godly-class energy art.”</p>
 <p>“I'm aware of that, Mother, and that’s why I’ve tried to be careful about revealing the truth of my energy arts. Unfortunately, I think word has begun to spread. In any case, I'm a member of the Invincible Society now, and my Elder Brothers and Sisters all seem very interested in protecting me. I'm not sure about my Master, though. Have you ever heard of the Invincible Dugu? Do you think he might try to get his hands on my godly-class energy art? Of course, anyone who tries to force the art out of me will run into the God Legion Seal in my forehead and end up dead. It seems to me that the God Legion Seal is only getting stronger and stronger as time goes on.”</p>
 <p>The Holy Mother considered the matter for a moment, then said, “The Invincible Dugu is an eccentric, and although he would definitely be interested in a godly-class energy art, I don’t think he would do anything to one of his own disciples. He has an Invincible Heart that makes him about as arrogant as the legion of gods itself. Furthermore, back in the day….” she trailed off for a moment, then hesitated. “Never mind. Let’s not talk about the past. Let’s just say that as long as he doesn’t ascend to the immortal world, there won’t be anyone stronger that you can rely on. After all, my art is a lesser godly energy art.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Godly-class energy arts are ranked as follows: lesser, common, greater, consummate, perfect, paramount, and lordly. The latter is named after the Lord of All Gods, who is omniscient, omnipotent, and created countless universes. He is an eternally deathless entity. Qi’er, if the blood you create is called Blood of the One God and your body type is the Physique of the Sovereign Lord, then I would say it’s highly likely you cultivate an energy art from the Lord of All Gods. As for your God Legion Seal, the legends in the immortal world say that it was a talisman of blessing created by numerous gods, which was given as a gift to the supreme Lord. The godmammoths were Paramount Gods that the Lord created to suppress hell.”</p>
 <p>“So that’s how it is.” His mother’s explanation had resolved quite a few issues for him. And by this point, a bit of color had returned to his face.</p>
 <p>“Now let me help you refine all of these resources and restore your vital energy. My son, you and I need to rely on each other in this vicious and treacherous world. That's the only way we’ll survive.” She sighed. “Thanks to your Blood of the One God, my godly-class energy art has grown more refined, and, given enough time, I should be able to piece together more of its mysteries. Perhaps it will even enable me to achieve another breakthrough.”</p>
 <p>“I see,” Yang Qi replied. “Well, Strength of the Hell-Crushing Godmammoth is definitely a complete version. I would love to share it with you, Mother, but without the God Legion Seal, it’s impossible to cultivate. For example, I gave Ghost Emperor Yama the technique to the Infernal Deity Spear, but he can’t unlock its true essence.”</p>
 <p>“I understand,” the Holy Mother said with a nod. “The technique is yours, and yours alone, Qi’er. Only with the God Legion Seal can its truths be revealed and the enlightenment of the One God acquired. However, I could probably benefit from information about the primeval infernal deities. My Jade-Emperor Profound-Welkin Exalted-Celestial God-Dao came from hell, and was supposedly created by a god who went there to wage war in the name of the Lord. It consists of six sections, but I only acquired one of them.”</p>
 <p>“I’ll do everything I can to help you collect the others, Mother,” Yang Qi said.</p>
 <p>“I believe you, Qi’er. I don’t think there’s anything in the world that my son can't do.” With that, she waved her hand, causing a whole host of corpses to fly over. Crushing them into ash, she sent them into the depths of the lands around them.</p>
 <p>It instantly caused a host of enormous dragons to spring into being, which were none other than manifestations of magical laws.</p>
 <p>The Holy Mother was a sixth order Demi-Immortal, thus her ability to make use of all the resources vastly surpassed Yang Qi’s. Yang Qi remained in place in Sage Monarch City, furthering his enlightenment by merely watching. Meanwhile, power built up in the depths of the lands, which rose up into him and nourished his fleshly body. Thanks to the magical laws from the Demi-Immortals, the quintessence-blood he had wasted earlier was now building back up.</p>
 <p>“Qi’er, this is the corpse of Lord Quake-Dawn. Not only did he have a high cultivation base, but he was actually a blood dragon from the Hell of Fresh Blood. Absorb his internal pellet and you’ll get his life force quintessence, which will definitely benefit your cultivation base.” The Holy Mother waved her hand and Lord Quake-Dawn’s internal pellet flew out of him, dropping right into Yang Qi’s Hellfire Crucible.</p>
 <p>With that, the Holy Mother moved over and placed her hands onto her son's back, sending power raging into him.</p>
 <p>As she did, he called on the Fist of the Halls of Heaven and the Hand of the One God, making it seem as though he could actually sense the halls of heaven. Sagelight raged inside him, burning the Demi-Immortal magical laws and transforming them into the power of the halls of heaven.</p>
 <p>A drop of Blood of the One God formed, then another, to be absorbed by the God Legion Seal, which began converting it into the purer version.</p>
 <p>By the time he had fully absorbed Lord Quake-Dawn’s internal pellet, he had eighteen full drops of the blood in his forehead, which was double what he had lost.</p>
 <p>By now, he was fully and completely recovered, and in fact, the megamammoths within him were turning back into dracomammoths.</p>
 <p>As he sat there in Sage Monarch City, bursting with energy, his Hellfire Crucible appeared and began to gather vital energy.</p>
 <p>“<em>The hidden dragon moves, it flaps its wings, secluded in the yellow springs, a lord of the netherworld</em>….” As he continued to draw on his energy arts, he sensed the subterranean vital energy of the continent flowing into the shape of a Wheel of Magical Law. The Sage Monarch Continent was absorbing the Quake-Dawn Continent and transforming as a result.</p>
 <p>A very serious expression could be seen on the Holy Mother’s face. As the Quake-Dawn Continent was absorbed along with the Yore-Wilds’ Heart fragments, jade dragons danced behind her. Clearly, the vital energy being released was very beneficial to her as well.</p>
 <p>Seven days and nights passed in which Yang Qi imparted extensive knowledge to his mother about the primeval infernal deities. As he did, she gained deeper and deeper enlightenment of the Jade-Emperor Profound-Welkin Exalted-Celestial God-Dao.</p>
 <p>Over the course of that week, the Holy Mother was hit with numerous tribulations, but none of them did anything to her and her cultivation progressed rapidly. At the same time, the corpses of more than one hundred Demi-Immortals were absorbed into the Sage Monarch Continent, which eventually reached a size ten times as large as the former Quake-Dawn Continent. And its vital energy surged even more than that former continent.</p>
 <p>As of now, the Sage Monarch Continent was a true land of sages.</p>
 <p>Yang Qi’s cultivation base experienced dramatic transformations. He had one hundred million dracomammoths, and although he was only a second step Great Sage his soul was approaching the limit of the Epic Saga Step.</p>
 <p>Given enough time, his impending breakthrough would occur with little difficulty.</p>
 <p>The depths of the Sage Monarch Continent now had nineteen Yore-Wilds’ Heart fragments, giving the place a partial heart. As the heart fluttered, it connected the continent to the Yore-Wilds planetary system as a whole. More power flowed toward the continent and it began to work its way toward becoming the center of the entire planetary system.</p>
 <p>“Qi’er, you’re still only a second step Great Sage, but you’re already strong enough to kill Lesser Demi-Immortals. Right now, you can't absorb the immortal items, so why not just leave them buried in the Sage Monarch Continent? They’ll be very beneficial to the continent, and especially your immortal clone, who can probably use them to become a Demi-Immortal.”</p>
 <p>“Great suggestion,” he replied.</p>
 <p>When the Holy Mother looked at her son, she was completely and utterly satisfied. How could she not be, with a son like this?</p>
 <p>Yang Qi was now fully convinced that the Sage Monarch Continent had the strongest and best foundation possible. He was no longer satisfied with the idea of it becoming a planet. He wanted it to be a planetary system, like a second Yore-Wilds.</p>
 <p>Once his soul reached the enlightenment level of a Demi-Immortal, then all the latent power in the continent could be used by his immortal clone to reach the Demi-Immortal level. At that point, Yang Qi would be strong enough to hold his own in the Titan Emperor Collegium and wouldn’t lose any face for the Invincible Society.</p>
 <p>“I think the time has come to go looking for the Myriad Worlds Monarch Chart. Mother, your cultivation base has improved and the Sage Monarch Continent is no longer in danger. And right now, my own cultivation base has reached its limit.” He rose to his feet. “Time is of the essence. I can’t afford to delay any longer in my search for the Myriad Worlds Monarch Chart.”</p>
 <p>“Go, Qi’er. The Sage Monarch Continent is stable, and with your clone here to keep an eye on things, everything should be fine; I’ll also be here to watch over the continent. I’ll request information from the heaven above regarding why people from the Megaplexus Heaven dared to invade us.”</p>
 <p>The Holy Mother looked on fondly as her son kowtowed three times then unfurled his Angel Wings and vanished in a blur.</p>
