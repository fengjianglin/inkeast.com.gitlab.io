<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Yang Qi’s ferocity and unbridled mercilessness were shocking to everyone. Initiators and society chiefs alike now realized that he was even more ferocious than the Invincible Dugu. More ferocious by a hundred times, perhaps even a thousand.</p>
 <p>Not even the Invincible Dugu would ever have massacred an entire society. In one short action, Yang Qi wiped out all of the members of the Hall of Beheadings and Executions who were present in the Titan Emperor Collegium.</p>
 <p>Other than certain freshman students, who were off on mining planets in other parts of the Central Planetary River, the Hall of Beheadings and Executions was no more. Yang Qi didn’t want any loose ends lying about that could eventually turn around and bite him.</p>
 <p>The supreme rector felt that Yang Qi had gone too far. Never could the man have guessed that he would be so cruel and ruthless. Obviously, if the disciples from the other two main enemy societies even talked back to Yang Qi, they would likely be wiped out.</p>
 <p>Yang Qi had crossed the line, as far as the initiators and the supreme rector were concerned.</p>
 <p>After all, he had robbed and enslaved the other two societies, an act of personal profit that was a clear detriment to the collegium as a whole. Forcing students to work as slaves for the Yang Clan was a blow to the foundation of the collegium.</p>
 <p>It was obvious that Yang Qi didn’t care about anyone else, and that he was fine with undermining the entire organization.</p>
 <p>Of course, it was a blow in terms of reputation as well.</p>
 <p>Henceforth, most students and elders would care more about Yang Qi’s words and actions than those of the supreme rector or the initiators.</p>
 <p>“Supreme rector, we have to report this matter to the heaven above. If we don't, we’ll all end up dead eventually. Yang Qi obviously realized we’ve been plotting against him, and he’s just waiting for the right moment to make his move. When he does, he’ll strike like lightning.”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. If things go along as they are, we’ll end up like the people from the Hegemon’s Society and the Everlasting Society. Slaves. Miners. Magical treasure forgers and pill concocters. I'd rather die than end up a whipped and bullied slave.”</p>
 <p>“I agree. We initiators are grand and majestic individuals. We’re half-Demolishers! If we sink to that level, we might as well just die.”</p>
 <p>The initiators knew that it was a grim situation and they needed to take immediate action.</p>
 <p>“Fine. Let’s join forces to submit a petition to the heaven on high. Tell them what’s happened, and ask them to deliver us from this tribulation.” The supreme rector sliced open his finger and waved it through the air, using the blood to create a handful of paper talismans.</p>
 <p>“Let us pray together,” he said. “Read with me.”</p>
 <p>“Yes sir!”</p>
 <p>With that, they joined their voices and said, “We, the initiators and supreme rector of the Titan Emperor Collegium, servants of the heaven on high, have carried out our responsibilities dutifully for a million years. When the Hell of Euphoria invaded, we led the collegium to make heroic contributions to the war effort. Now, a wretch-devil named Yang Qi is threatening to topple the foundation of the collegium. Oh immortal world, we beseech you to banish an immortal here to slay the wretch-devil and restore justice. Our enemy has a boundless godly-class technique that surpasses us all, and can even summon wretch-devils from hell. As a mere Greater Demi-Immortal, he can summon Universal Demi-Immortal fiend-devils….”</p>
 <p>They went on to elaborate on Yang Qi’s deeds in the hopes of getting a reaction from the immortal world.</p>
 <p><em>Whizz!</em></p>
 <p>As the words of the prayer were uttered, they became a dragon which swirled high into the sky and then vanished without a trace.</p>
 <p>Some time passed, then immortal light suddenly shone from above.</p>
 <p>“The immortal world accepted our prayer!” the supreme rector murmured, his face glowing with delight.</p>
 <p>A long moment passed, then a voice spoke into their minds. “Your report has been received. The heaven on high understands the gravity of the situation. In a few days, we will provide a formal response. In the meantime, wait patiently and don't do anything rash.”</p>
 <p>“Many thanks, oh immortal world!” the supreme rector said, dropping to his knees along with all of the initiators. Turning his attention to the initiators, the supreme rector said, “The heaven on high knows of the situation, and has provided an initial response. The situation is tense now, so we have to keep a low profile. Absolutely, positively don't do anything to provoke Yang Qi. Incidentally, what happened the society chief of the Beastmaster Society?”</p>
 <p>“He went into the Immortal Army Battlefield and even fought with Yang Qi,” one of the initiators said, “but his current whereabouts are unknown.” He sighed. “Truth be told, the day I initially contacted Yang Qi, he told me a bit of useful information. His greatest arch-nemesis is actually a new member of the Titan Emperor Collegium.”</p>
 <p>“What?” the supreme rector said. “Why didn’t you mention this before? Tell us the details!”</p>
 <p>The initiator went on to explain about the yellow-garbed young man with the buzz cut. “I would say it's highly likely that young man in yellow was working with the Beastmaster Society. If he really has the power to freely enter and exit the Myriad Worlds Monarch Chart, and we could gain access to that power, then we would easily be able to deal with Yang Qi. In fact, we could probably rule the universe!”</p>
 <p>“If this is all true, we need to contact Chief Beastmaster immediately!”</p>
 <p>“We have to talk to this young man in yellow. That’s our only chance to come out on top.”</p>
 <p>“This is our best hope of turning things around!”</p>
 <p>Thus, it was with great fanfare that they went to the Beastmaster Society.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p>“What do we do now, Junior Brother?” Sword Seventeen asked. “There’s no way the supreme rector and the initiators are going to just let us do whatever we want. Although they can’t stop you themselves, they can reach out to the immortal world and slander your name.”</p>
 <p>“I would guess that they’ve already done it,” Yang Qi replied coolly. “If they banish some immortals down here to deal with me, I guess I’ll be slaughtering some banished immortals. Absorbing power from people like that will do a lot to push me into the Demolishing level. Right now, I'm only a second order Demi-Immortal, and further breakthroughs are going to require a huge amount of power. In fact, I don’t think such power exists in the mortal world.”</p>
 <p>“You’re sure about that?” Sword Seventeen asked.</p>
 <p>“Of course. It will only take me a few more days to completely absorb Lei Jiuzhou’s nascent divinity and assimilate the śarīra of the Preheaven Magnetic King. Once I do, I’ll likely jump up by two levels. Once I'm a fourth order Potent Demi-Immortal, I won’t have anything to fear from any banished immortals.”</p>
 <p>“In that case, congratulations, Junior Brother! Alright, shouldn't we head back to the Sage Monarch planetary system?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, let's go.” A moment later, the two of them were at their destination.</p>
 <p>The Sage Monarch planetary system was a very bustling place now. In fact, it was already close to rivaling the Central Planetary River, with new planets constantly being born thanks to the power of the Tusita Heaven. And the glory of the planetary system was currently rising even more rapidly thanks to the wealth from the Hegemon’s Society, Everlasting Society, and Hall of Beheadings and Executions.</p>
 <p>The Holy Mother sat in a spell formation in the depths of the planetary system, cultivating her consummate godly-class energy art, which transformed countless surrounding planets into pure jade.</p>
 <p>“You’re back, Qi’er,” she said as her son approached. Rising to her feet, she continued, “I was looking over at the Central Planetary River and noticed that the entire Titan Emperor Collegium seemed bathed in killing energy.”</p>
 <p>“Well, Mother, let me explain….”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He went on to do just that. When he was finished, he said, “In any case, you don't need to worry. Before long, I’ll take out the entire Titan Emperor Collegium and replace it with the Sage Monarch planetary system. When I killed Ascendant Beheader from the Hall of Beheadings and Executions, I acquired a jade flute that is definitely a powerful immortal item. It can actually boost you to a higher level. Considering it's from some sort of jade immortal, I imagine it’s perfect for your Jade-Emperor Profound-Welkin Exalted-Celestial God-Dao.”</p>
 <p>With that, Yang Qi produced the very jade flute he had just mentioned.</p>
 <p>It was very small, to the point where it almost looked like a whistle. However, it had numerous finger holes which could be used to produce music like that from nature itself.</p>
 <p>“This….” The Holy Mother took it and looked at it carefully, then put it to her lips and exhaled some of the true energy of the Jade-Emperor Profound-Welkin Exalted-Celestial God-Dao.</p>
 <p>Instantly, the flute began glowing with bright light and emanating music that could pierce the very soul. Anyone who listened to that music would experience a genetic transformation and become more perfect as a result.</p>
 <p>In fact, ordinary people who transformed like that would easily become a thousand, ten thousand, hundred thousand, million, or even ten million times as strong as an ordinary person.</p>
 <p>As the music continued, it was almost possible to see an imperial entity within it.</p>
 <p>The Holy Mother’s face lit up. “Don’t tell me this is the legendary Jade Sovereign’s Flute?”</p>
 <p>“Jade Sovereign's Flute? What’s that?” Yang Qi asked.</p>
 <p>“According to the legends, The Jade-Emperor Profound-Welkin Exalted-Celestial God-Dao was created by a member of the legion of gods in ancient times. Whichever god created it was known as the Jade Emperor, or sometimes the Jade Sovereign. This flute isn’t an immortal item. It’s most likely a god item! You see, the Jade Emperor had plenty of musical instruments in his palace, all of which were god items. My Jade-Emperor Profound-Welkin Exalted-Celestial God-Dao can definitely unlock the godly majesty of this item. Its music is a baptism that makes genes more perfect and can impart the true blood of gods. In combination with the godrelic I have, I can definitely get to the Paragon Demi-Immortal level. In fact, even the Demolishing level might be within my grasp. Qi’er, you’re truly a blessing!”</p>
 <p>“I'm not a blessing,” Yang Qi said coolly. “I'm a Fateless One.”</p>
 <p>“Fateless One?” the Holy Mother replied in shock.</p>
 <p>“Yes. I was told that by someone who I'm fairly certain came from the future.” With that, he went on to explain about the yellow-garbed young man with the buzz cut. “Apparently, I don’t exist in the future. However, the fact that I exist here means that I'm a Fateless One. And that means I have a lot of enemies.”</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, the Holy Mother’s eyes flashed, as if with understanding. “Qi’er, your father mentioned something like this! After you were born, he was furious, and told me he wanted to kill you. He said that you didn’t exist in his future, and that your birth would lead to a heavenly catastrophe.”</p>
