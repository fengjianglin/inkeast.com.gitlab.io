<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Yang Qi had many tools at his disposal. By sacrificing some of the asuras, he could easily gain control of the Heaven-Dominating Golden Swordbreaker, and by using the heaven-demon seed, it was a simple task to draw out the powerful will of the Great Sage that existed within the weapon.</p>
 <p>Because of that, he could freely wield the swordbreaker in any way he wanted.</p>
 <p>Upon branding the thing with his soul, he could sense the immense power within it, as well as the sage motes inside. Sage motes came from the quintessence-blood of a Great Sage, and were forged with vital energy. With those sage motes, the golden, metallic power of the swordbreaker would never dissipate.</p>
 <p>The slightest wave of the swordbreaker sent out a screaming golden sea, filled with reflections of golden sage motes. The saintly might on display could crush anything from the most ancient times to the most modern.</p>
 <p>No person in existence could take command of the golden power in the swordbreaker as casually as Yang Qi, not considering he had a heaven-demon seed.</p>
 <p>That seed had been created by Great Sage Shroud-Heaven, and thus contained some of his will, which was the perfect bane of the will of the sage in the swordbreaker. In fact, later on, Yang Qi would be able to borrow the power of that golden will to oppose the heaven-demon seed, and hopefully force Young Master Shroud-Heaven to reap what he himself had sown.</p>
 <p>In the end, he was killing three birds with one stone.</p>
 <p>Without any hesitation, Yang Qi smashed the Heaven-Dominating Golden Swordbreaker into the Half Sage’s domain.</p>
 <p>As a result, the domain shivered, and then broke open! Before the Half Sage could do anything, the golden light slammed into him, causing rips and tears to spread out over his skin.</p>
 <p>Screaming, he fell back.</p>
 <p>And without hesitation, Yang Qi advanced and attacked him again!</p>
 <p><em>BOOM!</em></p>
 <p>Massive amounts of golden light shone forth, causing everything in the area to turn golden in color. Golden waves became a golden sea, and Yang Qi was a golden war god within that sea.</p>
 <p>Then he raised the swordbreaker up, causing the golden sea beneath it to form into numerous golden mountains.</p>
 <p><em>BOOOOM!</em></p>
 <p>Every attack sent a golden mountain flying forth to smash into the Warfare Domain.</p>
 <p>The Half Sage coughed up a mouthful of blood, unable to stand up to the battering of the swordbreaker, and the massive golden mountains it sent against him.</p>
 <p>“I can’t believe you can actually summon the golden mountains of the Heaven-Dominating Golden Swordbreaker!” the Half Sage shouted. “Who exactly are you? How can you have such strong universal power?! And are you really going to make an enemy of the Spirit Origin Association?”</p>
 <p>“I'm teaching you a lesson because, first: you can’t tell the difference between right and wrong!” Yang Qi smashed the swordbreaker into the personal domain again, causing the Half Sage to shake down to his bones.</p>
 <p>“Second: you’re ruining the reputation of your sect!” The next blow onto the domain knocked the Half Sage to the ground, where he coughed up several mouthfuls of blood.</p>
 <p>“Disciples of the Spirit Origin Association, heed my command! Activate your emergency talismans and summon the top experts to deal with this interloper! The Great Sage prime elders need to come out of seclusion and teach him a lesson!”</p>
 <p>Even as the words left his mouth, he waved his hand, sending a stream of smoke up into the sky, which then exploded, creating a blood-drenched image of an individual being attacked viciously.</p>
 <p>Yang Qi snorted coldly. “You don’t know what's good for you! I thought people from the Spirit Origin Association were reasonable, which is why I didn’t kill you. And now you want to summon a bunch of experts to gang up on me? You’re delusional!”</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, Yang Qi’s Angel Wings unfurled again.</p>
 <p>At this point, a host of voices could be heard from off in the distance.</p>
 <p>“You think you can just run off!?”</p>
 <p>“Freakish hellion!”</p>
 <p>“Get back here, monster!”</p>
 <p>“If we let you go, our Spirit Origin Association would become a laughingstock!”</p>
 <p>There was even a fist attack which ripped through the air toward Yang Qi.</p>
 <p>However, that was when Yang Qi vanished without a trace. Of the people present, none were completely sure which direction he had taken. He left no spatial fluctuations, almost as if he had teleported away. That was something that could only be achieved after reaching certain enlightenment regarding the magical laws of space.</p>
 <p>“Not even my Super-Luminous Godfist could hit him? Just how fast is he?” Almost in the same instant that Yang Qi vanished, a young man appeared, clad in snow-white garments. He seemed profoundly graceful and at ease, perhaps even lazy. However, he was obviously much stronger than a Half Sage.</p>
 <p>Even as he hovered there, seemingly examining the surrounding natural law of space, other powerful individuals arrived, including Never-Dying Legendaries and Half Sages.</p>
 <p>After seeing the young man in white, the Half Sage who had just been beaten in battle flew up and said, “Elder Brother Nie! That guy beat me, but he was only in the third Legendary transformation.”</p>
 <p>“I could sense as he fled that his cultivation level wasn't very high,” replied the young man in white. “However, he thrums with universal power. It seems to me that his true energy is at an unimaginably high level. He must be from a higher plane. According to the most up-to-date information we have here on the Quake-Dawn Continent, the universe is broken up into nine ranks. Our Quake-Dawn Continent is only second-rank, so I’d venture that this expert was from a third-rank plane, perhaps fourth or fifth at the most. However, I'm still confident that I could kill him.”</p>
 <p>“Elder Brother Nie, did you just get a lock onto his aura?”</p>
 <p>Everyone in the area clearly respected this Elder Brother Nie, all the way down to their bones. In some respects, it was similar to the way the people in the Demi-Immortal Institute treated the Crown Prince.</p>
 <p>“That’s right. My Super-Luminous Godfist managed to acquire some of the vital energy he left behind as he fled. I can definitely track him down, and I won’t return without the Heaven-Dominating Golden Swordbreaker.” Waving his hand, he pulled Jin Zhenyun up to him from down below. “You piece of trash. Giving you the Heaven-Dominating Golden Swordbreaker was obviously casting pearls before swine. If your father weren’t a prime elder, I’d definitely execute you right here and now.”</p>
 <p>Jin Zhenyun didn’t even dare to say anything in response.</p>
 <p>“Screw off!” the white-garbed young man said, hurling Jin Zhenyun down to smash into the ground below. After that, he took a step forward and opened a spatial rift.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Be careful, Elder Brother Nie!”</p>
 <p>“I’ll be fine. As long as he’s not a Great Sage, I can capture him. And we all know he's only in the third Legendary transformation. If word got out about what just happened here, we would become a laughingstock. Besides, I’ve been wanting to fight someone from a higher plane. Maybe I’ll turn him into a second nascent divinity for myself. An out of body incarnation.”</p>
 <p>Yawning lazily, the young man vanished.</p>
 <p>**</p>
 <p>‘This really feels great….’</p>
 <p>With his Angel Wings, Yang Qi could move so quickly that not even a Great Sage could easily catch him.</p>
 <p>And now that he had the combination of the Grand Emperor's Pagoda and the Heaven-Dominating Golden Swordbreaker, he was strong enough to actually force a Half Sage to cough up blood in a fight. The offensive powers of the Grand Emperor's Pagoda were beyond question; even Great Sages would thirst to have such a weapon at their disposal. Back in the four institutes in the Rich-Lush Continent, it was something that could be the signature weapon of a chancellor.</p>
 <p>However, what delighted Yang Qi the most was that he could now use the Grand Emperor's Pagoda to sense the general direction of the Rich-Lush Continent. In fact, with the correct spatial coordinates, it would be possible for him to just head there himself directly.</p>
 <p>“Crown Prince! You just wait. I'm coming to kill you!” Yang Qi was feeling very pleased. With the Heaven-Dominating Golden Swordbreaker, he had actually surpassed his expectations upon reaching the Space-Void Transformation. Now, he was fairly certain that if he fought the Crown Prince as a Half Sage, he wouldn’t be defeated with a single glance.</p>
 <p>Most shocking of all, only a year had passed. After only a year, he was powerful enough to contend with the Crown Prince. Although he might not be able to kill him, he was at least strong enough to fight him. And considering that the Crown Prince was still dealing with an injury, perhaps it would be possible to end him once and for all.</p>
 <p>Besides, now that he was in the Space-Void Transformation, reaching the Five-Phases Transformation and Yin-Yang Transformation shouldn’t be very difficult at all. The Five-Phases Transformation was about absorbing the quintessence energy of the five phases from within the void itself, and using it to fill one’s sea of energy.</p>
 <p>Thankfully, Yang Qi had benefited from Young Master Shroud-Heaven’s five phases treasures, the Skyspirit Lamp, Razorgold Dagger-Axe, Yellowdragon Sand, Singularity Water and Mulberry Shoot. Those treasures had spatial nexuses built into them that he could use to absorb five phases energy much more easily than before.</p>
 <p>Now, all he needed were enough spirit stones, preferably, the sagely-grade variety.</p>
 <p>After the Five-Phases Transformation was the Yin-Yang Transformation, and if he passed that, he would be in the Personal-Domain Transformation, at which time he would finally be able to utilize the God Legion Paradise.</p>
 <p>At that point, as long as the Crown Prince wasn’t a Great Sage, he would definitely be able to kill him. In fact, maybe it would still be possible to take him out as a Great Sage.</p>
 <p>After having gained some experience with different domains, Yang Qi now realized how terrifying the God Legion Paradise must be. It was a pure land belonging to the legion of gods, and therefore, once it came into being, it would be almost impossible to destroy. It would be able to absorb almost any attack, and convert it into power that he could use.</p>
 <p>Eventually, he came to settle down onto a mountain peak far from the Spirit Origin Association, in a completely different part of the Quake-Dawn Continent.</p>
 <p>‘With the Grand Emperor's Pagoda, and the spatial coordinates to the Rich-Lush Continent, I can head home any time I want. However, I’ll need plenty of power and spirit stones first.’</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, he wasn’t familiar with the Quake-Dawn Continent, and had no idea where to go to trade demon cores for spirit stones. Perhaps the best thing would be to look around first….</p>
