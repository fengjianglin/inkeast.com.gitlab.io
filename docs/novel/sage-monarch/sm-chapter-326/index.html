<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Still hidden somewhere in space-time, Ghost Emperor Yama shivered and looked at Yang Qi in utter shock. ‘What’s that? Sinking land? Primal-chaos paleo-energy? Immortal spell formations? He’s really been hiding things! I can’t believe he secretly linked to the primal-chaos paleo-energy in the deepest parts of the Rich-Lush Continent. He's using those immortal formations in concert with his personal domain? In a single breath of time, he’s completely changed everything.’</p>
 <p>Primal-chaos paleo-energy was an ancient type of energy originally created by a primal-chaos elder-immortal during the era of the Yore-Wilds Continent. It was profound and mysterious to say the least, and was one of the main reasons the Rich-Lush Continent didn’t end up being tossed about by spatial tempests.</p>
 <p>Throughout the years, many individuals had attempted to tap into this energy, as well as the immortal formations.</p>
 <p>Even the original top expert of the lands, Grand Emperor Rich-Lush, had done so, using his Grand Emperor's Pagoda in the process. In the end, he failed. He couldn’t gain the approval of the sage spirits of the continent, nor could he acquire the Yore-Wilds’ Heart fragment.</p>
 <p>Only Yang Qi, who bore the glory of the legion of gods, and had the approval of those ancient heroic spirits of the Great Sages, could access this most boundless secret magic. It all happened when he finally succeeded with the God Legion Paradise, and could absorb empyrean-baleful energy. And of the various types of empyrean-baleful energy that existed in the Rich-Lush Continent, primal-chaos paleo-energy was the most powerful.</p>
 <p>After completing the God Legion Paradise, Yang Qi had worked day and night to connect to that energy, using the Yore-Wilds’ Heart fragment. He had also probed certain immortal formations, ones that could slaughter Great Sages.</p>
 <p>Not even Great Sages in ancient times would have dared to go near those formations.</p>
 <p>The truth was that, after reaching the sixth Legendary transformation, and acquiring the God Legion Paradise, Yang Qi was already strong enough to kill Great Sages with the Yore-Wilds’ Heart fragment, the Grand Emperor's Pagoda, and the Heaven-Dominating Golden Swordbreaker. But now, he had primal-chaos paleo-energy and immortal formations; it was now hard to say exactly how strong he was.</p>
 <p>After gaining enlightenment, he sent his mind out to become one with that energy, which had led to even greater advancement. Then, using the power of five million megamammoths, he drew upon the power of the spell formations, whose power was like that of an army of Great Sages all working together. In fact, that power could spread out to cover thousands upon thousands of kilometers, and combined to become one massive primal-chaos spell formation.</p>
 <p>The Crown Prince, Yun Hailan, the clan leaders, the people from the Sage Ancestor Dynasty, Sea God Institute, True Dragon Institute, as well as the nine Great Sages from the Quake-Dawn Cathedral and the six Great Sages from the Western Continent were all now trapped within that massive formation.</p>
 <p>“What's going on here? How come there’s suddenly so much primal-chaos paleo-energy here? And how come I can’t tell its source?”</p>
 <p>“This is the primal-chaos paleo-energy that holds the Rich-Lush Continent in place. It was left behind by an immortal in ancient times! It's nothing to take lightly. Don’t absorb it! If you do, you’ll explode. Even a scrap of it is as heavy as a mountain!”</p>
 <p>“How? How can Yang Qi use energy like this? Not even the Great Sages from past generations could do this! Not even Grand Emperor Rich-Lush! And Yang Qi is only a Legendary! How is this possible?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t forget, he actually saved the entire plane. No wonder he can do things like this. He definitely has what it takes to fight the Crown Prince.”</p>
 <p>Countless lesser beings were already lost within the energy, unable to figure out how to escape it, or how to move about. Yang Qi had locked down everything for hundreds of kilometers, making it an immortal formation that could seal space and the void. Not even the Great Sages could do anything about it. This already surpassed anything that could be considered his power; this was the power of the Rich-Lush Continent as a whole.</p>
 <p><em>RUUUUMBLE!</em></p>
 <p>A pillar of sagelight rose up, illuminating all of the primal-chaos paleo-energy, and making Yang Qi stand out to everyone present. He looked holy to the extreme, surrounded by his paradisiac pure land. Meanwhile, the land within the spell formation began to rotate, and turn porcelain in color, as though it were untainted by even a speck of dust, and pure to the extreme.</p>
 <p>Both Sage Monarch City and Yanhaven were within the bounds of that pure land.</p>
 <p>And so were the elite cultivators from all of the lands.</p>
 <p>Countless holy trees began to sprout and rise up, shining with radiance and light. Yang Qi had prepared well to meet the Crown Prince. This was his personal domain, his God Legion Paradise, fused with the primal-chaos paleo-energy, and one with the Rich-Lush Continent’s immortal formations.</p>
 <p>It was a power that vastly surpassed that of a Great Sage, and as a result, the Great Sages present were trembling in fear.</p>
 <p>“This is my personal domain, the God Legion Paradise,” Yang Qi said, looking at all the elite experts, including Yun Hailan and the Crown Prince. “It's been combined with primal-chaos paleo-energy. And behind me is Sage Monarch City, where my sworn brothers and sisters are, safe and sound. If you kill me, then you can get to them. But if you can’t, then I’ll kill you. Anyone who tries to harm a brother or sister of mine, will be killed. Chancellor Sea God. Chancellor True Dragon. Gentlemen from the Quake-Dawn Cathedral. Crown Prince. Yun Hailan. Observe my godly might. I am the legion of gods, and the legion of gods is me. I will rise to heaven, and spread the glory of the gods….”</p>
 <p><em>BOOM!</em></p>
 <p>Stepping forward within the fusion of the immortal formations and the God Legion Paradise, Yang Qi clenched his fists, and then attacked the entire group of enemies arrayed against him.</p>
 <p>He was going up against them alone, in what seemed an act of complete madness, like a moth attacking a raging fire.</p>
 <p>It was an awesome sight as he flew forth, his God Legion Battle Robe whipping about him like white clouds. His eyes flashed as if with lightning, and his hands were like raging thunder, ready to tear mountains asunder.</p>
 <p>It was a sight which would leave most people at a loss for words. Yang Qi was single-handedly attacking an entire group of Great Sages, including the deva-like Crown Prince.</p>
 <p>His grandeur and majesty were almost palpable, and his power seemed like the epitome of that which was virtuous and moral.</p>
 <p>Those present who were not Great Sages immediately scattered in flight.</p>
 <p>‘So fierce!’ Ghost Emperor Yama thought.</p>
 <p>“Evil creature!” Chancellor Sea God shouted. He and Chancellor True Dragon were among the most powerful figures in the world, and thus, they led the charge to meet Yang Qi’s attack. Much of their clothing was ripped to shreds from the power of their fist strikes, and they even called upon their sage motes.</p>
 <p>But!</p>
 <p>When their fists struck the God Legion Paradise, the primal-chaos paleo-energy sent them flying backward.</p>
 <p>At the same time, a mass of sage motes appeared behind Yang Qi.</p>
 <p>“Sage motes!” Chancellor Sea God blurted. “Look, he has sage motes! He absorbed a Great Sage!”</p>
 <p>His face went ashen from the shock, and his mind began to reel, as though he had seen something that couldn’t possibly exist.</p>
 <p>Yang Qi had long since absorbed Great Sage Quake-Cloud’s sage motes and made them part of his own true energy. As of now, his true energy was no different from that of a Great Sage's. That was another reason why it had been so easy for him to harness the power of primal-chaos paleo-energy.</p>
 <p>“Attack!” cried the Great Sages from the Quake-Dawn Cathedral as they attacked with a killing move. An immense net appeared, filled with dragon-like, tiger-like lightning, the type of thing that could destroy the stars.</p>
 <p><em>“Dragon-Tiger Lightning God Grand Empyrean Energy!”</em></p>
 <p>The dragon-tiger lightning web swept out like an ocean, something that could destroy countless devillings. In fact, anything that fell into that net would likely be destroyed.</p>
 <p>Yang Qi clenched his fist, and sagelight converged upon it. In the blink of an eye, a host of holy halls appeared within the pure land around him, glowing with radiance and light. It was impossible to say what plane these halls originally came from, billions upon billions of years in the past. However, with the sage motes, and the sagelight they cast, it was now possible for these halls of heaven to appear in the human world.</p>
 <p>The Fist of the Halls of Heaven.</p>
 <p>Only a Great Sage who commanded the Strength of the Hell-Crushing Godmammoth should be able to use it. However, Yang Qi had absorbed sage motes, and had a basic understanding of the boundless halls of heaven. Therefore, he could use this godly fist technique, which was originally designed to slaughter immortals and devils.</p>
 <p><em>BOOM!</em></p>
 <p>Sagelight roiled out to fill all creation, ripping the net of lightning to pieces. At the same time, the Great Sages from the Quake-Dawn Cathedral staggered backward, their faces turning as pale as death. To them, that fist strike from moments ago caused chills to run down their spines.</p>
 <p>Yang Qi wasn’t willing to back down an inch. Within his pure land, countless godly trees of radiance and light sent eternal brilliance out, driving away all darkness, and causing even devil-gods in the depths of hell to sense the glory.</p>
 <p>His eyes were like freezing stars, and his eyebrows were like sharp swords. And yet, he still seemed merciful and awe-inspiring, someone who others would naturally offer allegiance to. In fact, the countless experts present all realized that they admired him in their hearts.</p>
 <p>He took another step forward, stepping through the remnants of the net to appear in front of the nine Great Sages. He glowed with the brilliance of the halls of heaven, to the point where everyone could only stare in open shock.</p>
 <p>Yet again, he unleashed the Fist of the Halls of Heaven. And this time, a Great Sage fell.</p>
 <p>The man threw his lightning-wreathed arms up to block, except, his bones creaked ominously, and then began to shatter. His flesh began to peel off of him like that of a rotten fruit, and even his sage motes began to explode. Then, he collapsed into a mass of blood and gore.</p>
 <p>A Great Sage had been killed.</p>
 <p>The other eight Great Sages from the Quake-Dawn Cathedral were enraged, and immediately began to ask for help.</p>
 <p>“Kill him! Surround him! Crown Prince, you take the lead! Find an opening and kill him.”</p>
 <p>Maybe Yang Qi did have shocking godly might, but there was no way he could stand up to so many people at one time.</p>
 <p>As for Yun Hailan, she looked deathly pale, and her eyes shone with indescribable disbelief. Yang Qi had only been in action for a few breaths of time, and had defeated Chancellor Sea God and Chancellor True Dragon, and then killed one of the Great Sages from the Quake-Dawn Cathedral.</p>
 <p>The idea of one person defeating three Great Sages so easily was almost impossible to reconcile. Who was this guy? Was he really a Legendary? From ancient times until now, throughout the history of countless planes, had there ever been a person as ferocious as this?</p>

 <p>Hey everyone, I don't often make announcements like this, but I think this one is relevant for everyone. I did a video about the phrase "courting death" which I'm sure all of you are familiar with. Even I use it on occasion.
