 <p><em>RIP!</em></p> 
 <p>Right in front of a host of students and elders of the Titan Emperor Collegium, Yang Qi decapitated an elder king. It was a profoundly blood-soaked and provocative scene.</p> 
 <p>A moment later, Kingly Beheader’s dying curses faded away. Silence prevailed as the crowd looked on, completely stunned. Never in the history of the collegium had an elder king been killed, much less by a student. The sight of his severed head dripping with blood was something that no one present would ever be able to forget.</p> 
 <p>With their elder king having met this fate, the Hall of Beheadings and Executions would never again be able to command the respect and authority they once had. They had lost more face than anyone thought was possible, and, to many of the onlookers, it was a beautiful thing.</p> 
 <p>Howls of grief and rage rose up from the students and elders of the Hall of Beheadings and Executions, as well as from Imperial Beheader, Sovereign Beheader, and Godly Beheader. None of them had been able to stop Yang Qi from killing Kingly Beheader, and now they had to watch as he nailed the head to the entrance of the Invincible Society with a spike.</p> 
 <p>From the spike, Kingly Beheader stared out with empty eyes that reflected the defiance and rancor he had experienced in the moment of his death. It was really a terrifying sight.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, I killed him. Are you people going to do anything about it? Anyone who offends the Invincible Society is going to end up dead!” Of course, Yang Qi took Kingly Beheader’s corpse and vital energy for himself. There was no way he was going to let a Universal Demi-Immortal’s corpse go to waste. It would be a big help in reaching the second order.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll give your Hall of Beheadings and Executions one choice. Round up Kingly Beheader’s friends, family, and allies, and bring them to me. Understand? I’ll execute them to pay for his crimes. If you don't comply, I'm going to apply to the rectors and the heaven above to have your organization dissolved and all of your members sent to the mines to serve as slaves. If that doesn’t happen, then going forward, every time I see someone from the Hall of Beheadings and Executions I’ll kill them on sight, without the slightest mercy!”</p> 
 <p>These were bald-faced threats of the most unbridled, domineering nature.</p> 
 <p>There were representatives of tens upon tens of thousands of societies present. The Hegemon’s Society. The Everlasting Society. The Sun Moon Society. The Medicine Paragon Society. And more. Yet all of their members were trembling like cicadas in winter.</p> 
 <p>Of course, the Hegemon’s Society and the Everlasting Society both had bad relationships with Yang Qi. The Everlasting Society hated him for what happened in the entrance ceremony, and the Hegemon’s Society wouldn’t let go of the fact that he and Sword Seventeen had killed one of their noble students in an argument. Both societies wanted to crush Yang Qi into the dust, and hopefully, get his primeval godworm eggs.</p> 
 <p>However, not a single person from those societies dared to say a word. They were actually subconsciously edging backward.</p> 
 <p>According to the ancient saying,&nbsp;<em>when the emperor wanted silence, not even the horses would neigh</em>. And that was exactly what was happening now. Even the host of experts from the Hegemon’s Society and the Everlasting Society were too scared to attract attention. As of this moment, Yang Qi had definitely earned his reputation as the fiercest student in the Titan Emperor Collegium.</p> 
 <p>Of course, that didn’t mean that things were over.</p> 
 <p>Elder kings were top leaders in the institute, and the death of one was equivalent to the death of a royal prince in an imperial court. There was no way the matter would just be dropped.</p> 
 <p>“Kill them! The Invincible Society must be exterminated!”</p> 
 <p>“Did you really just murder Kingly Beheader!? Dammit! He was as close as a blood brother to me! For tens of thousands of years we rid the world of devils and demons and loved each other like family! I can’t believe you killed him!”</p> 
 <p>“You could never possibly atone for this. The only thing to do now is to carry out a blood purge. The freakish hellion that is Yang Qi shall be purged, as will everyone else connected to him. That's the only way to regain face. That’s the only way to erase this humiliation. With blood!”</p> 
 <p>Everyone in the Hall of Beheadings and Executions was going completely crazy, including the elysian child Ascendant Beheader.</p> 
 <p>Sword Seventeen could see that the situation was escalating, so he quickly said, “Junior Brother, let’s retreat into the warding magics of the Invincible Society. They won’t be able to break inside. And even if they did, our Master would be notified and would definitely hurry back.”</p> 
 <p>“There’s no need,” Yang Qi said coldly, and the God Legion Paradise began brightly shining. “Elder Brother, you can go hide inside if you want. But I won’t. These people can’t do anything to me. If they want a blood purge, I’ll be happy to oblige! I’ve been too kindhearted up to this point. I never did anything to provoke them, yet they try to kick me when I'm down? Well, since we have a whole bunch of witnesses, I'm going to show everyone that Yang Qi is not the type of person who tolerates being bullied. Time to purge the Hall of Beheadings and Executions with blood! I'm going to kill them all, down to the dogs and chickens!”</p> 
 <p><em>RUMBLE!</em></p> 
 <p>Yang Qi’s true energy began surging, as if it were a mighty river filled with the ultimate truths of the martial path. It even contained traces of the dao of gods. The Infernal Deity Spear appeared in his hands as he lunged forward into the forces of the Hall of Beheadings and Executions. In the blink of an eye, a forest of spear projections appeared.</p> 
 <p>The weakest of the disciples present were first, second, and third order Demi-Immortals, and all of them exploded into death the moment the spear projections touched them. Then the Concluding Elegy of the Nightfall Symphony began.</p> 
 <p>As the sound resonated out, Yang Qi swept the spear back and forth, reaping life, a blur that no one could see clearly. All they could tell was that something like an infernal deity from hell was out taking the souls of the living. And with every kill, the Infernal Deity Spear grew a bit stronger.</p> 
 <p>Now that Yang Qi was a Demi-Immortal, the spear’s true appearance and function could be used, and it was vastly superior to before. The stabs of that spear brought the fall of night and could cause even a host of immortals to perish in feebleness.</p> 
 <p>The Hall of Beheadings and Executions had expected him to retreat, but instead, he had lunged into their midst and begun cutting them down with ultimate ferocity. In fact, it was such a terrifying offensive that everyone stumbled backward in fear.</p> 
 <p>“This little bastard is too fierce! He’s a complete savage!”</p> 
 <p>The elders from the Hegemon’s Society were in full retreat, wiping the sweat from their brow as they did. They were normally an overbearing lot, but in the face of Yang Qi’s savage performance they were terrified to the point where their knees knocked together.</p> 
 <p>The Everlasting Society was equally in fear, and had no desire whatsoever to join the fight against Yang Qi. They were more than happy to let the Hall of Beheadings and Executions deal with him.</p> 
 <p>“Die!”</p> 
 <p>This single advance of Yang Qi’s resulted in over a hundred students being hit by the Infernal Deity Spear and exploding. And of course, the fact that they lost their souls meant that they could never be born again.</p> 
 <p>In the blink of an eye, Yang Qi was bearing down on Imperial Beheader, Sovereign Beheader, and Godly Beheader.</p> 
 <p>Ascendant Beheader bore the appearance of a ninth order Demi-Immortal, but the truth was that he was only able to do that with the help of a magical treasure. Yang Qi wasn’t afraid of him at all, and was actually confident in being able to kill him. Therefore, he pushed the fight to them. He wanted everyone to understand the horrific consequences of provoking him.</p> 
 <p>“How vile!” Ascendant Beheader growled, summoning his sword to meet the Infernal Deity Spear. Imperial Beheader, Sovereign Beheader, and Godly Beheader also rushed forward to engage Yang Qi. At the same time, the thirty-six prime paragon elders and seventy-two prime elders used their Empyrean Baleful Grand Spell Formation to do the same.</p> 
 <p>Unfazed, Yang Qi began singing the Eternal Heavenly Aria, causing halos of blessing to surround him and halos of damnification to surround his enemies, halos that they were incapable of dispelling. The Light of Nightmares. The Light of Torpidity. The Light of Weakness…. The lights threw them into a state of mental sluggishness and made their bodies instantly heavier.</p> 
 <p><em>Thump! Plop!</em></p> 
 <p>Some of the Demi-Immortals flopped to the ground, unable to sustain flight.</p> 
 <p>Now that Yang Qi was a Demi-Immortal, his Eternal Heavenly Aria was different from before. The ancient halos which appeared reflected the true glory of the legion of gods and were unable to be expelled.</p> 
 <p>Back when he faced the yellow-garbed young man with the buzz cut, two legacy medallions of King Immortal-Slayer had successfully vanquished the halos of light. But at Yang Qi’s current level, not even three of those legacy medallions could do the trick.</p> 
 <p>Hidden deep in the shadows of the Titan Emperor Collegium were a group of powerful entities who immediately recognized what they were seeing.</p> 
 <p>“Primeval god skills! He’s using primeval god skills!”</p> 
 <p>“How does he have so many? Is he even human? Primeval god skills are taboo in the heavenly worlds. Only heaven-immortals of the highest rank can use them. But even then, it should only be one or two. How can he have so many? They’re authentic! You can’t drive them out! You can’t dispel them!”</p> 
 <p>“What’s going on here? He’s not a fiend-devil! If he was, there’s no way he would be using real and authentic god skills!”</p> 
 <p>“Primeval god skills are handed down by the legion of gods! They’re usually part of a godly-class energy art! Look at that one, it’s as clear as fresh water! It’s the Light of Life Force. Even someone who was mortally wounded, but was touched by that light, would have their life force restored.”</p> 
 <p>“That one is the Light of Weakness. Anyone who gets hit by it will find their energy arts reduced by at least thirty percent.”</p> 
 <p>“They're so strong. This is unbelievable!”</p> 
 <p>“If the other students could learn primeval god skills, then waged war on another collegium, how much stronger would they be? Just about any opponent they faced would surrender for sure….”</p> 
 <p>“This is unimaginable. Inconceivable. Unfathomable….”</p> 
 <p>“This turns everything around. Those primeval god skills prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that Yang Qi isn't a fiend-devil. He’s too important for our Titan Emperor Collegium to lose!”</p> 
 <p>Whether it was the Light of Life Force, the Light of Weakness, or any of the others, they were primeval god skills, techniques that someone could cultivate to completely dominate the enemy. Yet Yang Qi’s Eternal Heavenly Aria caused hundreds of them to appear at once. Even immortals would be shocked by the sight.</p>
