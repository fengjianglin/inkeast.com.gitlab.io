 <p>Today, I want to write about people who compare their lives with the lives of the people they have on facebook/instagram/twitter/other social media. It’s actually quite common, I think.</p>
 <p>The reason this issue bothers me is because people actually take it too seriously. I know for a fact, some people are envious or jealous of certain lifestyles people portray online. Sometimes, it seems like everyone has a better life than us. There are people who look so hot, who look so rich, who look so successful, who look so happy, and etc. However, <strong>you must understand that people only show you what they want you to see.</strong></p>
 <p>For example, someone can post up a picture of a house they newly bought. You, the viewer, is probably like, “Wow. Blah blah blah bought a house! He/she must be doing so well”. (or something along those lines). BUT GUESS WHAT? It’s not always true!! You don’t see them struggling to pay the bills. For all you know, they probably can’t even afford it. A lot of the times, people buy things they cannot afford.</p>
 <p>In addition, girls can be super manipulative. I’m not saying only girls are, and guys aren’t, but it is more common for girls to do this. Girls like to take pictures of things and write a quote or a line that can imply a lot of things. For example, a girl might take a picture of a drink and write something like, “You always know the right things to say.” But then, there won’t be a picture of the person. And now, for people who care, they might assume or wonder:</p>
 <p>1. Who is _____ referring to? Is she dating someone?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>2. _______ is seeing someone.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>3. _______ is very happy.</p>
 <p>Can you believe it? We make all these assumptions based on a picture of a drink and a sentence someone can just make up. I’m not saying everyone is like that, but <strong>facebook/instagram/twitter/social media is full of shit (please excuse my language).</strong></p>
 <p>However, I still love using social media because I like feeling connected to people, and I really do enjoy looking at the nice pictures on instagram. I truly respect and admire those who take the time to post up such nice pictures/motivational things for viewers. HOWEVER, it is very easy for one to get caught up and become obsessive over what they see online. For example, some people might hate themselves because they do not feel like they are “pretty” or “beautiful” enough. Some people might just want to look like the girls/guys they see online.<strong>&nbsp;It is important to remember though, a lot of the times, what you are seeing online is nothing like what their life is like in real life.</strong></p>
 <p>For example, a morning selfie. There are those who take morning selfies and they look gorgeous as hell. But you know what? That is<em>&nbsp;NOT</em> a morning selfie (at least, not to me). If I want to look that good, that will be a 30 minute selfie. First, I have to pick a nice outfit. Then, I have to put make up on. After that, I have to find good lighting/angle and then take about 30 selfies (because I have to pick the best one, you know?). After that, I will have to go through all the filters to find the one that enhances my beauty the most. It is not until I finish all that before I can actually post the “morning selfie”. But because I spent so much time and work on this selfie, now I want people to praise me. I want people to “like” my picture and follow me. If I do not get the follows and likes, I’ll be sad. You see the problem?!?! That is why I don’t post many pictures of myself on instagram. It is not because I don’t want to look pretty and get likes/follows, but it makes me so superficial and I know I would constantly be craving for attention. Again, I’m not saying this applies to everyone. However, there is definitely some type of influence.</p>
 <p>In conclusion,<strong>&nbsp;I just want you all to become more aware and not compare yourself or your life too much to those you see online.</strong> People can hide all the bad stuff they don’t want you to see. Most of the time, people are not as happy and glamorous as you think they are. <strong>Everyone has problems, they just don’t want to show you.</strong></p>
 <p>P.S. You can follow me on instagram @grace7127 lol!!!</p>
