<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Jian Jie stood up to leave.</p>
 <p>Ming Jinhua reached out in an attempt to make her stay, but Jian Jie flatly refused the older lady.</p>
 <p>Ye Wentian said, “Let us walk you out!”</p>
 <p>Without answering, Jian Jie continued walking towards the door. Her car was parked right outside the house.</p>
 <p>None of them spoke as they walked.</p>
 <p>Ming Jinhua and Ye Wentian felt bad for Jian Jie, which was why they let Jian Jie be even when she was being rather rude.</p>
 <p>The more Jian Jie thought about it, the more upset she got. <em>Even Ye Wentian and Ming Jinhua could accept that woman. Is it because of the baby?</em></p>
 <p><em>Fine! I’ll not allow Mo Suqing to have her baby. I’ll see if they’re still willing to accept her that way.</em></p>
 <p>After a short walk, the three of them finally reached the parked car.</p>
 <p>Jian Jie lowered the car windows after getting into the vehicle.</p>
 <p>She forced herself to smile at the old couple.</p>
 <p>“Uncle and Auntie, thanks for walking me out. I’m leaving now!”</p>
 <p>Ye Wentian looked at her with a fatherly gaze.</p>
 <p>“Jian dear, don’t be too upset over this. I’ll talk to Jue when he comes home. My child, it’s better to let go of certain things, you’ll gain a sense of freedom...”</p>
 <p>Jian Jie answered, “Mm, Uncle, I know!”</p>
 <p>She then left right after.</p>
 <p>Shaking his head, Ye Wentian walked back into the house with Ming Jinhua.</p>
 <p>Not far from the Ye family home, Luo Qiqi and Xia Zi were sitting in a car and observing everything.</p>
 <p>Confusion appeared on Luo Qiqi’s face.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Xia Zi’s clear voice rang out.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi shook her head. “Nothing, I just find this place… I don’t know why but I find it quite familiar. I’m probably just thinking too much!”</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi’s brows creased, feeling rather confused.</p>
 <p>“Oh! Right!” Luo Qiqi grabbed Xia Zi’s arm. “A’zi, did you see what they said earlier?”</p>
 <p>Xia Zi frowned. “Jian Jie was in the car, so I couldn’t see it clearly. As for the old couple, I think they said something along the lines of - Jian dear, it’s better to let go of certain things!”</p>
 <p>“Pft!” Luo Qiqi laughed when she heard this.</p>
 <p>“Jian dear, slut dear! Which do you think it is?”&nbsp;<a href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
 <p>Xia Zi gave a tiny smirk. “It should be Jian dear, since Jian Jie’s surname is Jian.”</p>
 <p>“I think it’s slut dear! That Jian Jie looks pretty slutty to me...” said Luo Qiqi as she chuckled to herself.</p>
 <p>“Okay, let’s head back. We’ll see what Jian Jie does next!”</p>
 <p>Xia Zi made a u-turn and headed for the Shallow Sea Area.</p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing woke up early the next day.</p>
 <p>She was moving around in bed, feeling uncomfortable because of her pregnancy.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue opened his eyes slightly and asked in a daze, “What’s wrong, dear?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing looked at him with pitiful eyes.</p>
 <p>“I’m a little nervous. What do I do?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue sighed and gently caressed her head.</p>
 <p>“Silly girl, you’re overthinking! My parents aren’t monsters!”</p>
 <p>“But it’s the first time I’m formally meeting them. Is it okay if I go just like this?”</p>
 <p>“It’s fine!” Ye Zhongjue stroked her hair. “There’s no need to worry. The baby is the greatest present we can give to them!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing frowned. “Is it only because of the baby that they’re accepting me now?”</p>
 <p>It hurt Ye Zhongjue to see Mo Suqing upset like this. He did not want to tell her the truth, because it was exactly that. His parents asked them to go over for a meal only because they learnt of the fact that they were expecting a baby.</p>
 <p>She would be even more troubled if he told her that.</p>
 <p>However, he did not want to lie to her either.</p>
 <p>Seeing Ye Zhongjue looking like he was in a dilemma, Mo Suqing pouted. “It’s fine, there’s no need to come up with any excuses. I’m glad that your parents can accept me. It hasn’t been easy for us either.”</p>
 <p>“Mm!” Ye Zhongjue held her hand tightly. “We’ll be together from now on.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was wide awake now, so he went to prepare breakfast.</p>
 <p>They were planning to leave after having their breakfast, but Mo Suqing heard the doorbell ringing.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was collecting his jacket and car keys in another room, so it was Mo Suqing who answered the door.</p>
 <p>A deliveryman was at the door. “This is Mo Suqing’s place right? This parcel is for her.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing answered quickly, “Yes, that’s me!”</p>
 <p>“Sign here please!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing signed off on the delivery without much thought.</p>
 <p>She turned and saw Ye Zhongjue walking over.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go!” Ye Zhongjue took her hand in his as he passed her.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing then absent-mindedly placed the parcel on the shoe rack, and smiled sweetly at him.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go!”</p>
 <p>The both of them left and the document lay abandoned on their shoe rack.</p>
 <p>Jian Jie frowned as she saw Ye Zhongjue’s car leave. <em>Did Mo Suqing not receive the parcel?</em></p>
 <p>Her brows furrowed deeply. <em>There had to be a problem somewhere. Why did Mo Suqing not have any reaction to it? The delivery should have already been made, so the only possibility is that Mo Suqing hadn’t opened it yet.</em></p>
 <p>Jian Jie gripped the steering wheel hard.<em>&nbsp;Ye Zhongjue can’t open it, or else he would have his guard up after seeing it.</em></p>
 <p><em>Damn it!</em></p>
 <p>In fact, Jian Jie need not have stressed over this. Ye Zhongjue was absolutely unaware that the document even existed. Mo Suqing simply did not open the document immediately.</p>
 <p>Standing at the balcony, Xia Zi saw Ye Zhongjue’s car leaving. The woman in the car seemed to look exactly like her.</p>
 <p>Before she could take a second look however, the car was already too far away.</p>
 <p>She saw Jian Jie follow right after Ye Zhongjue left, and tugged at Luo Qiqi, leading her down the stairs.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi looked at Xia Zi in confusion when they were in the car.</p>
 <p>“A’zi, why the rush?”</p>
 <p>Xia Zi was usually cool and composed, but Luo Qiqi saw a trace of panic on her face earlier.</p>
 <p>Xia Zi’s brows creased and she began to tail Jian Jie.</p>
 <p>“I might have seen wrong, but I think that the person Jian Jie is following might be related to me in some way!”</p>
 <p>“Related to you!” Luo Qiqi cried out in surprise. “A’zi, did you remember something from your childhood?”</p>
 <p>Xia Zi glanced at her impatiently. “No way, I hadn’t even turned two at the time. It’d be a miracle if I could remember anything. I just saw… someone who looked quite familiar. Let’s just follow them first!”</p>
 <p>She did not tell Luo Qiqi that the person she saw basically looked like her twin.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi nodded and fell silent, keeping her eyes on the car in front.</p>
 <p><em>What great effort from Jian Jie, using a different car everyday to personally camp outside the Shallow Sea Area. It’s probably just to follow those in the car in front of her.</em></p>
 <p><em>Who knows, we might just stumble upon some clues that can lead us to The Dark Night. It’s already been two months so it’s time we show some results.</em></p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing started getting nervous when Ye Zhongjue turned into the Ye family home. She held onto his sleeve, looking rather pitiful.</p>
 <p>Those eyes of hers seemed to be telling him, <em>Dear, I’m so afraid. I’m really scared...</em></p>
 <p>After the car stopped outside the villa, Ye Zhongjue stroked her hair to comfort her.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be scared, silly. This is my home, so it’s yours too. There’s no need to worry. If my parents have decided that they’ll accept you, they’ll treat you just like I do.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing remained silent.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue alighted before helping her out of the car.</p>
 <p>Right after Mo Suqing alighted, she saw Ye Wentian and Ming Jinhua walking out.</p>
 <p>She was so nervous that her heart could leap out of her chest. But she naturally relaxed upon seeing Ming Jinhua’s kind and friendly visage.</p>
 <p>Ming Jinhua went forward to lead Mo Suqing in by the hand. She spoke with an air of gentle kindness. “You’re finally back. Come on in, be careful!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s heart was warmed by her affectionate tone.</p>
 <p>She had not felt familial love for a long time after her mother’s death, and she could tell that Ming Jinhua was sincere towards her, without any trace of bias.</p>
 <p><em>This is Ye Zhongjue’s family. He was right, they are really willing to accept me.</em></p>
 <p>“Hello, Auntie and Uncle!”</p>
 <p>Ye Wentian nodded to acknowledge her greeting.</p>
 <p>Ming Jinhua laughed. “Mm, silly. Your baby’s due soon so don’t call us Auntie and Uncle! Shouldn’t you be calling us Mum and Dad instead?”</p>
 <p>Feeling slightly awkward, Mo Suqing looked towards Ye Zhongjue. He nodded to reassure her.</p>
 <p>Seeing Ye Zhongjue’s reassurance gave Mo Suqing a sudden boost of confidence.</p>
 <p>It was as if she was just waiting for Ye Zhongjue to give her the green light on this.</p>
 <p>She then said loudly, “Mum and Dad! Jue and I are back to visit!”</p>
 <p>“Aye...” Ming Jinhua was grinning from ear to ear as she held onto Mo Suqing’s hand.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was enjoying the bliss. Everything seemed perfect.</p>
 <p>A slight smile was even hanging on the lips of the usually stern Ye Wentian.</p>
 <p>He nodded and said, “Come on in, stop standing around outside!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue had been holding onto Mo Suqing’s hand throughout this entire time, while Ming Jinhua held onto the other.</p>
 <p>Ming Jinhua smiled and teased her son.</p>
 <p>“Jue, afraid that we’ll eat your wife up? Look, they’re not even letting go of their hands!”</p>
 <p>Embarrassed, Mo Suqing lowered her head and slowly pulled her hand out of Ye Zhongjue’s grip.</p>
 <p>He saw her blush and shook his head in resignation. <em>This girl gets embarrassed too easily!</em></p>
 <p>“Mum, don’t tease her. She’s really shy!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing gave Ye Zhongjue a look, as if she was saying, <em>Why say that in front of your parents!</em></p>
 <p>He smiled and tried to comfort her through his gentle gaze.</p>
 <p>Ming Jinhua was over the moon when she saw how happy her son was.</p>
