<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Guan Mingchang arrived when Mo Suqing and Ye Zhongjue retreated back into the ward.</p>
 <p>Guan Mingchang looked dreadful. Ye Zhongjue told Mo Suqing that he would go out to have a look after placing her back onto the bed.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue could tell from the older man’s thunderous expression that a storm was brewing. What Guan Mingchang said next stunned all of them.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue did not know how to explain to Mo Suqing what he just heard after returning to the ward.</p>
 <p><em>Xia Xinsheng did not abandon Mo Suqing. She had her reasons for doing so, and if Suqing learns that she had misunderstood her mother, she would probably be even more upset.</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was in a dilemma. He didn’t know if he should tell Mo Suqing the truth.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing frowned at him. “What’s wrong with you? You’ve been acting strange since you returned.”</p>
 <p>He contemplated for a while longer before eventually deciding to tell Mo Suqing the truth.</p>
 <p>“Suqing, there’s something I have to tell you. Please stay calm when you hear it. I’m telling you this because I believe that you can accept it, and that you would want to know the truth as well. It’s also something that you will learn about sooner or later.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was puzzled. “Jue, what happened? What are you talking about? I don’t get it!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked at her.</p>
 <p>“It’s about your mother and the accident that happened nine years ago. It was Bai Lian who pulled the strings but have you thought about why your mother left you after that? Do you think that she chose to leave because seeing you reminded her of the past? Do you think that was really why she chose to leave?”</p>
 <p>What he said served to prepare Mo Suqing for what she was about to hear. She knew him well and he was never the kind to say more than what was needed.</p>
 <p>She frowned and asked, “Jue, tell me what happened.”</p>
 <p>“What happened nine years ago left a huge mental scar on your mother and she found it extremely hard to be able to accept anything that was related to the Mo family, even you. She had been to multiple psychiatrists to get treated because of that, and the doctors told her that her condition would improve gradually as long as she put her past behind her by cutting off all contact so that she wouldn’t be reminded of the past.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue paused for a while before he continued. “Of course, her condition did see improvement after that. In the past, it was the doctor who recommended that she forget her past, and then later, it was Guan Mingchang who helped her with it. He was afraid that Xia Xinsheng would have a relapse, which was also why she did not go looking for you in all these years.”</p>
 <p>“But this accident caused her to recall all the memories from the past!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue sighed as Mo Suqing looked at him in confusion. “What do you mean?”</p>
 <p>He then said, “I mean, she’s having a relapse.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing turned pale at this.</p>
 <p>“Where is she now?” Mo Suqing asked with worry.</p>
 <p>“Guan Mingchang took her back home.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing lowered her head in silence.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing and Xia Zi had forgiven Xia Xinsheng, but the older woman’s psychological condition had become very unstable. She seemed to always be stuck in those nightmarish events, unable to extract herself from them.</p>
 <p>Though Xia Zi and Guan Zixuan had planned to get married, they decided to postpone it due to Xia Xinsheng’s condition. They wanted to get married only when Xia Xinsheng recovered fully.</p>
 <p>Xia Xinsheng’s condition only saw improvement after about a year later.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan was busy with the Fengteng Group and when he had the time, he would accompany Xia Xinsheng to go for her treatment, together with Xia Zi. Xia Zi stayed by Xia Xinsheng’s side on her road to recovery.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing had already returned to A City, but she would come over to visit Xia Xinsheng from time to time. She gave birth to a baby boy and named him Ye Yilan. He was now about a month old.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing planned to go to Emperor City to visit Xia Xinsheng and Xia Zi after her confinement. Ye Zhongjue wanted to go with her initially but he called when Mo Suqing was packing her bags for the trip.</p>
 <p>“Hello!” Mo Suqing answered.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue spoke quickly. “Dear, we were planning to go to Emperor City tomorrow right? Let’s go over tonight. I’ll head back later and we’ll leave together. Help me pack two sets of clothing.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing frowned at this. “Didn’t we book the flight for tomorrow?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue said, “Mm! I’ve returned them and gotten my secretary to book the flight at eight in the evening. I’ve left Xiaoyi <a href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> with my mum and we can go pick him up after we come back. We’ll bring A’jiu and Xiaoliu with us so they can meet their grandmother.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing smiled and nodded at this. “Okay!”</p>
 <p>She then continued with the packing.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue changed after getting married. He had always been cold and aloof, making others feel like he was unapproachable. But after marriage, he became much gentler.</p>
 <p>Even A’jiu and Xiaoliu said that their Daddy had changed.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing helped the children pack their clothes and waited for Ye Zhongjue to return.</p>
 <p>A’jiu and Xiaoliu were doing their homework when he returned. They were both very obedient after finding out they were going to Emperor City for a trip.</p>
 <p>Warmth filled Ye Zhongjue as he watched Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>He walked up to her and hugged her gently from behind.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was surprised at this, but smiled to herself.</p>
 <p>“What are you doing! The kids are at home!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue acted like a spoiled child as he said, “I don’t care. Can’t I hug you when they’re at home?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing turned to look at him. <em>This man is so childish. Can’t he be serious with the kids around?</em></p>
 <p>She pried him away and said, “It’s getting late. We have to go to the airport soon. Don’t mess around!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue smiled. “I’m not messing around!”</p>
 <p><em>All I want is to be lovey dovey with my wife. I haven’t touched her since we had Ye Yilan. It’s so hard being a monk!</em></p>
 <p>He looked at his watch and realized that Mo Suqing was right. They were running a little late.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing did a last check on things as Ye Zhongjue rounded up the kids.</p>
 <p>The children were extremely excited about meeting their grandmother in Emperor City as they left the house.</p>
 <p>On the plane, Mo Suqing asked, “Jue, why did you bring the trip forward?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue contemplated for a moment before he answered. “Yi’an called me in the afternoon saying that he will be holding an art exhibition tomorrow. He asked me to go over if I have the time since he knew I’d be in the area.”</p>
 <p>“Oh… I see.” Mo Suqing nodded.</p>
 <p>Gu Yi’an left the hospital a few years ago, and even though he continued helping to diagnose and treat those who were close to him, he decided to leave for London to give Ceng Hanyu a helping hand.</p>
 <p>The Dark Night had been weakened greatly after they were left without a leader since Su Jincheng’s death. Gu Yi’an and Ceng Hanyu then helped to bring Sin Eliminators to the forefront of the criminal world. Their organization was now at the top of the criminal food chain and no other organization could hold a candle to them.</p>
 <p>Now that Sin Eliminators was in a stable position, Ceng Hanyu stayed in London to oversee everything while Gu Yi’an pursued his hobby as an artist.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing realized that Gu Yi’an was a man of many talents. He seemed like an ordinary person on the surface, but such talent could never be seen from just the surface alone.</p>
 <p>It was not only his position in Sin Eliminators that impressed Mo Suqing, she was surprised at how talented he was at being an artist.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing thought Gu Yi’an was only joking when he said he wanted to pursue art, and she never expected him to take it seriously and actually become successful as an artist. All his works were personally painted by him.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue explained that Gu Yi’an had always liked to draw, and he had been drawing even when he was in med school. He would use his free time to sketch as well.</p>
 <p>His place was full of his artworks which would rarely be seen by anyone else. By touring the world through this art exhibition of his, it was a way for him to record his artwork and to show his art pieces to the rest of the world.</p>
 <p>According to Ye Zhongjue, there was another reason that Gu Yi’an wanted to hold such a high-profile exhibition. He wanted to look for someone, someone who was extremely important to him.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing did not know much about that individual, but judging from the scale of Gu Yi’an’s exhibition, he or she was definitely no ordinary person.</p>
