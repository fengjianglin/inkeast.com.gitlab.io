<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun was getting impatient. “Are you going to agree or not? I’ve already told you before our engagement that either party can call it quits at any point in time. Do you want me to say it again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Huilin looked at Leng Haoyun’s impassive face. <em>There really is nothing worse than apathy. But why don’t I want to give up even when he’s this cruel?</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">If she agrees to the cancellation, it is unlikely that she will ever get a second chance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She contemplated for a moment before answering. “I need some time to think this over. It’s not that I don’t agree, but we had already invited so many guests to the banquet. I’ll meet you back here in this study a week later to let you know!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun looked at her pointedly before nodding.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Huilin then turned to leave. Once out of the study, her tears were unstoppable.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">……</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">The car was heading to Ceng Hanyu’s villa.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao suddenly asked, “Guan Zixuan, you seem to be very free these days. Don’t you have any work?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Guan Zixuan looked at her through the rearview mirror as he drove.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“I’m a celebrity, but I’m human too. I’ve been so working hard in order to let the audience enjoy high quality dramas, movies and programmes. You have absolutely no conscience. How can you make such comments.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“So why don’t you have any work recently?” Leng Xiyao pressed on.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Guan Zixuan answered dismissively as he tried to show this lady how hard he had actually been working. “Of course I should take a good rest after the shoot in C City. I’ve also asked my manager to either postpone or cancel any other jobs for the next few days!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“My, oh my. Throwing your weight around huh. A top-tier actor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Sarcasm was evident in Leng Xiyao’s words. This made Guan Zixuan floor the accelerator on purpose, causing Leng Xiyao to be thrown back against the seat by inertia.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She admonished him, “Top actor Mr. Guan, do you have a death wish? Speeding up so suddenly like that. Don’t you know that Suqing is pregnant?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Being reminded of this, Guan Zixuan slowed down.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He said, “I wouldn’t have done that if you weren’t being so sarcastic!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao rolled her eyes before turning to him again, craftiness in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“I’ll ask you something serious, Guan Zixuan. What were you shooting this time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Guan Zixuan thought it was a genuine question and that she was merely asking out of curiosity.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“The title of the drama is - Shall I Compare You to a Spring Day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao started chuckling.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“It should be called - Shall I Sleep With You on a Spring Day!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing was initially enjoying their banter, but Leng Xiyao’s sudden comment made her facepalm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><em>Heavens, I don’t know this person. Why is she so dirty-minded! I can’t take it!</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Losing his grip on the steering wheel, Guan Zixuan lost control of the car a little when he heard the comment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao continued, “What’s wrong? No need to force yourself to drive if you’re not good at it. The journey would be super smooth if I were driving!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Guan Zixuan stared at her with gritted teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“You’re all talk. Do you even have a license?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao answered in mock surprise, “Guan Zixuan, I thought you were extremely knowledgeable! Top actor Mr. Guan should’ve already known that I’m a very experienced driver!”&nbsp;<a href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Guan Zixuan was left speechless.<em>&nbsp;Miss Experienced Driver, please stop torturing me. Also, being knowledgeable has absolutely nothing to do with knowing how experienced you are.</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><em>Anyone can tell that you’re the reckless kind! You score an absolute win!</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“One more word and Suqing and I will walk instead. You can go look for Ceng Hanyu on your own!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao instantly put on an act of being a sweet lady. “Don’t! Guan Zixuan, I won’t joke around anymore, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Guan Zixuan snorted, “You sure you were just joking?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao pursed her lips and kept quiet. <em>This man is so boring. I was just kidding! Everyone knows that I like to joke around!</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing then spoke, “Zixuan, for the show - Shall I Compare You to a Spring Day, is Mo Sulian a part of the crew too?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“She is! But she’s the bad apple. She doesn’t perform well even though she’s been cast as the second female lead. The director was exasperated. They might even have to cut out her scenes when the show airs and edit it to make her look like a passer-by!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Guan Zixuan got pretty worked up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao said, “The passer-by would probably be Mo Sulian!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Guan Zixuan took a deep breath to calm himself before speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Leng Xiyao, even if you don’t talk, no one would think you’re mute. Also, you totally missed my point. Why do you focus on things that people don’t normally focus on?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Maybe it’s because I’m not normal, and I’m very unusual!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“I think you’re unusually insane!” Guan Zixuan retorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Afraid that they would start tearing at each other any moment now, Mo Suqing held onto Leng Xiyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Zixuan, how did Mo Sulian get cast if her acting chops are so bad? I heard there were also quite a few famous actors cast for that drama, and they’re all top-tier!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Guan Zixuan wondered if he should tell her the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“What’s wrong? Zixuan, stop acting all shy and awkward!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Guan Zixuan coughed at this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Suqing, you really want to know?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Yes!” Mo Suqing nodded fervently. She knew deep down that Ye Zhongjue must have had something to do with it, but no matter what he did, she trusted him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Okay!” Guan Zixuan glanced at her before continuing. “She said Ye Zhongjue was her backer. They were photographed together a few times before, but Ye Zhongjue didn’t comment on those. Lin Ran also called up a few entertainment companies to extend his greetings, so everyone naturally believed Mo Sulian.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing nodded and remained silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ever since Ye Zhongjue’s identity was blown, she knew her father and Mo Sulian would pester Ye Zhongjue if she did not lend a helping hand. She could fully understand Ye Zhongjue’s actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu was already waiting outside when they arrived at his villa.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">On the way to the An family home, Leng Xiyao’s nerves got the better of her. She held onto Mo Suqing’s hand anxiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She would ask from time to time, “Ceng Hanyu, are we there yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu answered, “A while more!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She asked again shortly after, “Ceng Hanyu, is it very rude of me that I forgot to bring a present?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu took her hands in his to reassure her. “Don’t worry about that. The fact that you’re able to visit is the greatest present for Grandpa An.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing could see the cold sweat on Leng Xiyao’s forehead as she lowered her head. She spoke gently, “It’ll be okay, Yao. I’m here with you. Also, that’s your grandfather, the closest relative you have. He’ll definitely love you, so you don’t have to worry so much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Just as Mo Suqing finished, Leng Xiyao looked at Ceng Hanyu again. “I played a prank on him and pointed him in the opposite direction. Will he be very angry with me and hate me for it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu looked at her in resignation. “Yao, you’re overthinking it. Grandpa loves you! Why would he hate you?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Seeing Leng Xiyao cowering in fear put Guan Zixuan in such a good mood that he actually started humming. He would have sung loudly if he could.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing did not know what to say.<em>&nbsp;The two of them must be arch-enemies, attacking each other on sight.</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">The current Leng Xiyao was too nervous to pay any attention to Guan Zixuan.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">When they finally arrived at the An family home, Leng Xiyao was so nervous that her palms were sweating.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><em>Actually, why am I this nervous? I’ve been to many events and I’ve seen so much. This is nothing. Isn’t this just visiting my own grandfather?</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">However, she just could not help but feel restless and uneasy.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Zhenguo walked out just as they alighted from the car. His tears instantly fell as he saw Leng Xiyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">His legs trembled as he wanted to go to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing supported Leng Xiyao and they steadily made their way towards An Zhenguo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Guan Zixuan looked at the scene unfolding before him, realizing that Leng Xiyao had all the emotions a normal person would have. She would also feel scared, agitated and worried. If she knew what just went through his mind, she might literally strangle him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu stepped forward to support An Zhenguo as he walked.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Zhenguo finally stopped in front of Leng Xiyao. He was so emotional that he spoke with a slight stutter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“It’s been twenty-odd years, but I’ve finally found you. Anne, my granddaughter!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Old Man An held onto Leng Xiyao’s arm, and hot tears welled up in her eyes. She had imagined this playing out many times, but it was never this emotional.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">A wave of emotion overwhelmed her. She felt conflicted, happy, emotional and uneasy all at the same time. No one else would know exactly how she felt at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao had prepared herself for this reunion, and the first thing Leng Xiyao said made An Zhenguo weep.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Grandpa, I’m sorry!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She sniffed as her tears fell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Zhenguo hugged her. “Anne, silly girl. Why are you saying sorry? You’ve had such a hard time. It’s Grandpa’s fault for not being able to find you sooner!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">The tear-stricken Leng Xiyao pouted as she tried to awkwardly explain herself. “I gave you the wrong direction on purpose, I didn’t know...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Zhenguo patted her on the shoulder to comfort her. “Silly girl, Grandpa knows you didn’t do it on purpose. You wouldn’t do that if you knew I was your grandfather. Is that your friend over there? Let him come in!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao stared at Guan Zixuan. He was pretty sarcastic towards her after they picked Ceng Hanyu up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Thus, she said, “Don’t mind him, Grandpa. He’s just a driver!”</span></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <hr>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><span class="footnote" id="footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup> The literal phrase is ‘old driver’ and can be used to mean someone with a wealth of experience. Leng Xiyao was trying to be punny in her response to the question of whether she has a license.</span></p>
