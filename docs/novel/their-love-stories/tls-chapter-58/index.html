<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Ye Zhongjue forced his breathing to slow down. He gently pushed Mo Suqing away and placed his hands on her shoulders.</p>
 <p>Away from his warm chest, Mo Suqing looked quite unhappy. She pouted her lips and screwed up her face like a child who didn’t get the candy she had asked for. It was a pitiful sight.</p>
 <p>The self-control that had been Ye Zhongjue’s pride instantly collapsed in front of her.</p>
 <p>He was indecisive whether or not to go home right away.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Mo Suqing was watching him piteously with her big, sparkling eyes filled with mist. It seemed she could burst into tears any moment</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue found himself unable to reject her. He extended his arms and tenderly hugged her. In a soft, comforting voice, he said, “Suqing, can you be a good girl for me? Let’s go home first, okay? I can hug you once we are home. Now we are in the car and it’s not very convenient to do that.” He soothed, regardless of whether she could understand.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing&nbsp;appeared to&nbsp;understand. After a brief silence, she nodded into Ye Zhongjue’s chest.</p>
 <p>Relieved, Ye Zhongjue carefully rolled Mo Suqing back to the passenger’s seat. His body pressed against hers the whole time, lest she should become unhappy again as soon as he pulled away.</p>
 <p>Then, he gently helped her put on the seatbelt. In case she would move about, he stuffed a cushion on her lap and placed her hands on it.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing seemed to like the arrangement. She hugged the cushion, her eyes brightened.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue let out a sigh of relief. The car pulled away from the curb and headed toward their home at a high speed.</p>
 <p>After playing with cushion for a while, Mo Suqing was bored again. She pushed the cushion away and waved her arm wildly until it landed on Ye Zhongjue’s.</p>
 <p>Feeling her hand on his arm, Ye Zhongjue brushed it away; it was the best he could do under the circumstances.</p>
 <p>However, as soon as he brushed her hand away, it crept across the gear lever again. This time, it aimed not at Ye Zhongjue’s arm, but his thigh.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue stiffened. A blue vein bulged in his forehead. As if replaying his previous movement in slow-mo, he put her hand back to its place once more.</p>
 <p>When they almost reached the apartment, Mo Suqing somehow freed herself from the seatbelt.</p>
 <p>The seatbelt had been securely attached, but now it was under her. It was a puzzle as to how she had done it.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue glanced at her, but did not do anything about it. They were nearly home.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing, her body rocking back and forth, seemed to be very uncomfortable and kept moving about. Ye Zhongjue put out his arm to steady her.</p>
 <p>However, at that moment, Mo Suqing fell toward him. Ye Zhongjue, caught off guard, helplessly watched her fall down between his thighs.</p>
 <p>For a split second, he went completely rigid.</p>
 <p>Then, he felt the woman lying on his lap facedown started to grope about with her hands.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was about to stop her, but it was too late.</p>
 <p>Her warm breath rushed forward, just when her soft hand grabbed his thing. The car jolted and almost smashed into the curb.</p>
 <p>He righted it in time. He could feel his whole body tighten and his pulse racing.</p>
 <p>He breathed heavily and said in a sexy, husky voice, “Suqing, stop it! Be good. We are almost home.”</p>
 <p>But Mo Suqing did not heed. Her eyes sparkled with curiosity, as if the thing in her hand was fascinated.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was still very rigid and the veins throbbed in his forehead. On one hand, he wanted to stop her from touching him. On the other hand, he did not want to pull her up.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was in high spirits playing with it.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was tingling all over. Mo Suqing’s warm breath was tickling his thing and he was on the edge of losing his control.</p>
 <p>He quickly pulled her up. Then, he drove with one hand and propped her up with the other.</p>
 <p>The car advanced towards their destination at full speed.</p>
 <p>Finally, just when Ye Zhongjue could no longer suppress his desire, the car took them into the underground garage.</p>
 <p>After Ye Zhongjue quickly parked the car, the first thing he was going to do was to get Mo Suqing out of it.</p>
 <p>The girl had been a torture, had been playing with fire, so to speak. He could not let her drink like this anymore.</p>
 <p>He was very restless now, but it was impossible to make a complaint to a drunkard. How could you reason with someone who was hammered?</p>
 <p>The only solution was tit for tat.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue sat Mo Suqing up. His eyes were deep and dark like black holes. He got off the car first and carried Mo Suqing out of the passenger’s seat.</p>
 <p>When they were in the elevator, Mo Suqing’s hand groped about on his chest. Ye Zhongjue could feel his patience draining, but since there were others in the compartment, he needed to force himself not to kiss her.</p>
 <p>The man of the couple in the elevator with them asked good-humoredly, “Drunk?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s brow furrowed. “Yeah,” he nodded and replied.</p>
 <p>The man could see Ye Zhongjue was not in a talkative mood, so he did not say anything more.</p>
 <p>Finally, the elevator opened to his floor. Ye Zhongjue quickly walked out and towards the door to their apartment.</p>
 <p>The moment he entered it, he pressed Mo Suqing up against the door and kissed her on the mouth. He hadn’t even bothered to turn on the light.</p>
 <p>At first, Mo Suqing had stuck out her tongue with a silly smile on her face, as if she had thought she was eating something.</p>
 <p>Then, in the middle of the prolonged kiss, Ye Zhongjue felt something was wrong.</p>
 <p>Amazed, he turned on the light to find that Mo Suqing had fallen asleep.</p>
 <p>She had aroused him and then fallen asleep!</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was exasperated and amused and speechless, all at the same time.</p>
 <p>He had never expected she would be such a torture when drunk. She had almost driven him crazy. He swore he would never let her get drunk ever again.</p>
 <p>With her innocent and peaceful face resting on his shoulder, the girl was soundly asleep and even snorting slightly. Once or twice, she changed her position to get more comfortable.</p>
 <p>Although Ye Zhongjue was very horny right now,&nbsp;he wouldn’t&nbsp;wake her up.</p>
 <p>Sighing, he gently carried her to the bedroom. Then, he fetched some water from the bathroom and wiped her face with the help of a towel.</p>
 <p>After washing her body in this way and changing her into the pajamas, Ye Zhongjue felt like he had stood under the sun for hours – he was drenched in his sweat.</p>
 <p>Fleeing from the scene, he took the basin with the dirty water to the bathroom, then took a cold shower for a long time to cool down.</p>
 <p>When he returned to the bedroom, he brought chilliness with him.</p>
 <p>So, when he got into bed, Mo Suqing&nbsp;subconsciously&nbsp;shrank away from him and the cold.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue knitted his brows together. After lying down for a while and having time to warm up a little, he set the AC at a lower temperature.</p>
 <p>It was late fall, which meant temperature was gradually dropping in A&nbsp;City. Therefore, when he lowered the AC temperature, the room quickly cooled down.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing felt it and curled into a ball. Then, she migrated closer and closer to Ye Zhongjue’s warm body.</p>
 <p>Eventually, she found the origin of the warmth and hugged it casually. After changing into a comfortable position, she stopped moving and fell into a deep sleep.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue felt his heart melt watching the small figure against his body.</p>
 <p>Satisfied, he hugged her in return and turned the AC temperature up.</p>
 <p>The next day when she woke up, Mo Suqing felt extremely unwell. In particular, her head felt like it was going to explode.</p>
 <p>She was rubbing her temple when Ye Zhongjue pushed open the door with a bowl in his hand.</p>
 <p>He walked over and gave the bowl to her. “You drank quite a lot of alcohol yesterday. Finish this and you will get much better.”</p>
 <p>“You made it?” Mo Suqing asked doubtfully</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked away, embarrassed. He would never tell her he had got up early and searched the recipe on the Internet, in case she would wake up in a headache. <em>Humph, this ungrateful girl!</em></p>
 <p>“Yeah,” he replied.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing stretched her neck to observe him more closely and felt she detected a suspicious blush on his face.</p>
 <p>“Just finish it already,” Ye Zhongjue said uneasily.</p>
 <p>Although he sounded calm, Mo Suqing caught something unusual in his tone.</p>
 <p>However, she didn’t have the gut to say no to him when she was sober. She had no idea why – probably because she had fallen deeper for him? – but she found it more and more difficult to reject him anything.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing finished the soup and handed the empty bowl to him. Ye Zhongjue pressed his lips together and walked out of the room without a word.</p>
 <p>Notwithstanding, Mo Suqing felt warmth swell in her. She was still bathed in the morning sunlight that was Ye Zhongjue’s loving care when her phone made a sound. She almost fell from the bed.</p>
 <p>Turning this way and that, she found her phone underneath her. It was a WeChat message from Leng Xiyao.</p>
 <p>LIsForLeng: Suqing, what u doin?</p>
 <p>FarAway: Just&nbsp;got&nbsp;up. Headache from too&nbsp;many&nbsp;drinks yesterday.</p>
 <p>LIsForLeng: *Crying* Me, I was knocked out! Don’t even know how I got home!</p>
 <p>FarAway: Ye Zhongjue said ur uncle took u home. He seems to know him.</p>
 <p>LIsForLeng: ???</p>
 <p>FarAway: While I went to fetch our purses, I asked Ye Zhongjue to look after u. When I went back, u were gone. He said ur uncle took u away.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao’s hands jerked violently. <em>Ye Zhongjue knows Uncle? Did he tell Suqing who she is?</em></p>
 <p>While she was hesitating whether or not to confess to the truth, Mo Suqing sent another message.</p>
 <p>FarAway: Where r u? Dead?</p>
 <p>LIsForLeng: !!! The Force is with me and I don’t know how to control it, so don’t you provoke me!</p>
