 <p>Leng Xiyao grinned at Mo Suqing, who was looking pointedly at something behind her.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao looked over her shoulder and stopped smiling immediately.</p>
 <p>An Huilin was standing five steps away from her!</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao’s smile froze over. She turned her head back in slo-mo and closed her eyes as if in pain. Her face was completely contorted.</p>
 <p><em>I am dead meat!</em></p>
 <p>She had literally spoken evil of her right behind her back! She must have heard everything.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing gave her a sympathetic look, as if to say, <em>Please accept my condolences!</em></p>
 <p><em>I did try to warn you with m</em><em>y</em><em>&nbsp;eyes!&nbsp;</em>Mo Suqing thought. <em>It couldn’t be helped that you didn’t understand my gesture!</em></p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao put her head on the desk, face down, hoping to get away with it.</p>
 <p>An Huilin’s icy voice came from behind, “I’m a sulky old maid who doesn’t have any sex life?”</p>
 <p>Several coworkers burst out laughing. They were all enjoying themselves with the drama.</p>
 <p>Only Mo Suqing couldn’t laugh out loud.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao kept her head on the desk. There was nothing more embarrassing than speaking ill of someone when they were right beside you!</p>
 <p>Fortunately, An Huilin was just going to leave it at that. She gave Leng Xiyao a look with an emotion that Mo Suqing couldn’t quite read and then walked away.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing couldn’t tell if she sensed it wrong or she was on the right track, but it seemed to her that the look An Huilin gave Leng Xiyao was full of jealousy and bitterness.</p>
 <p>She shook her head. She must be&nbsp;overthinking. An Huilin was the editor-in-chief. She had no reason to be jealous of any of them!</p>
 <p>After An Huilin had gone for a long time, Leng Xiyao finally raised her head.</p>
 <p>“Suqing, why didn’t you warn me…” she gave Mo Suqing a forlorn look.</p>
 <p>Although Mo Suqing felt sorry for her, she couldn’t help but laugh a little.</p>
 <p>She protested, “I did try to warn you with my eyes, but you thought there was something wrong with them. I’m innocent!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao pouted her lips, looking like she was going to cry.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing immediately softened. She slid over on her chair and soothed, “Alright, it’s not a big deal. Come on now. Don’t cry.”</p>
 <p>Bai Tingnan sneered, “Someone was so arrogant that she dared to speak ill of the editor-in-chief! She’s gonna be killed without her knowing one of these days…”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao’s face darkened at her words. <em>A filthy mouth will not utter decent language!</em></p>
 <p>Not wanting to lose, she retorted, “I’m sorry, unlike some slut who is double-faced, I am too authentic and outspoken!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao’s voice grew louder and louder. Bai Tingnan’s face alternately burned with anger and paled with embarrassment.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao wasn’t finished yet. <em>You are not going to win me in a verbal fight!</em></p>
 <p>She waved Mo Suqing’s arm and said loudly, “Some slut is just pretentious and hypocritical! I’m telling you, I am not going to swallow any insult from that kind of person!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing could no longer suppress her laughter. Yao was such a fighter!</p>
 <p>“You… You…” Bai Tingnan couldn’t say anything more than a single syllable. Compared to her, Leng Xiyao obviously got the upper hand. People were snickering.</p>
 <p>Bai Tingnan’s face had become the color of a pig’s liver. She snorted and then stormed out of the room.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao looked up at Mo Suqing, as if waiting for her praise.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing pinched her cute little face playfully and said, “You are so naughty!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao winked at her cheerfully. “You bet I am! I won’t let anyone call me names&nbsp;</p>
 <p>like that for no reason! Uncle has never said anything harsh to me in my life.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing found that every time Leng Xiyao mentioned her uncle, there was a sparkle in her eyes.</p>
 <p>“Oh!” Leng Xiyao suddenly struck her own thigh. “Aren’t you going on a date with your hubby tonight?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing thought of Ye Zhongjue, who had indeed told her he would pick her up after work. “How do you know?”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao smiled mischievously. “I can guess it from your&nbsp;expression! Come, I’ll take you out!”</p>
 <p>“What?” Mo Suqing found it hard to follow the elfish girl’s logic.</p>
 <p>“Aren’t you having a date? It won’t do to wear your office lady’s outfit on a date! Today’s work is finished anyway. I can take you out and buy some clothes. You need to dress up and show your best self. What do you say?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing had been smiling at her words, thinking that it was a pretty good idea. However, when she heard the last part, her face darkened. <em>What is that supposed to mean, I need to show my best self?</em></p>
 <p><em>I can’t believe her!</em></p>
 <p>“Let’s go!” Leng Xiyao took her arm and started to head out. “There’s nothing to consider. This is the first time you are going to meet him after you guys made up. You must show him how gorgeous you are, so that he will never want to pick a fight with you!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing found her words quite sensible.</p>
 <p>Thus, the two of them <em>sensibly</em> ditched work.</p>
 <p>In the mall, Leng Xiyao took Mo Suqing to try on one item after another. She seemed to be more enthusiastic about the whole thing than Mo Suqing!</p>
 <p><em>But since she is excited about the date for me,&nbsp;</em>Mo Suqing thought, <em>I’ll just let it go.</em></p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao took Mo Suqing to turn a corner. A white dress caught their eyes.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao estimated that the length of the dress would go all the way down to Mo Suqing’s ankles, which was perfect for the weather when it was neither too cold nor too hot.</p>
 <p>Most importantly, the dress matched Mo Suqing very well. Leng Xiyao had a feeling it would be very suitable for her.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao took Mo Suqing’s arm and ran toward it.</p>
 <p>She pointed at the dress and asked the clerk to take it down for them.</p>
 <p>The clerk hesitated. “What is the matter?” Leng Xiyao demanded. “Customers are supposed to be of utmost importance! We are going to buy that dress, but it seems you don’t want to sell it to us. May I ask you why?”</p>
 <p>The clerk explained patiently, “This is the last one and someone has reserved it.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao waved her hand dismissively. “I don’t care! Quickly take it down. It’s not like I don’t have the money to buy it.”</p>
 <p>After weighing the pros and cons, the clerk took the dress down in the end. Pleasing the customers was always the right way to go.</p>
 <p>While Mo Suqing was still looking on, Leng Xiyao tore the price tag off the dress stealthily. Mo Suqing would never buy it if she saw how expensive it was.</p>
 <p>“Suqing, try it on. I think it will definitely look great on you!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing looked at the dress and nodded in resignation. “Fine. However, this is the last one I’m going to try. If it’s still not suitable, I’m going to give up. I’m tired as a dog!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao chuckled. “Alright, alright! Try it on first. If it’s no good, we’ll leave.”</p>
 <p>Though having said so, Leng Xiyao quickly paid for it with her card when Mo Suqing was changing.</p>
 <p>When a rustling sound came from the dressing room, Leng Xiyao and the other clerks turned their heads at the same time.</p>
 <p>They couldn’t turn away. The dress was so becoming on Mo Squing it seemed to have been made just for her.</p>
 <p>Not only did the dress accentuate her curves, it also brought out her innocence and ethereality.</p>
 <p>In it, she looked like a pure white lotus blossom. She was so beautiful that no one could shift their eyes away from her.</p>
 <p>The clerk,&nbsp;who had hesitated,&nbsp;exclaimed, “My god! The dress seems to have been made for this lady. You look so beautiful!”</p>
 <p>The others nodded in agreement. Mo Suqing blushed. She felt embarrassed&nbsp;by&nbsp;their praise.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao walked over cheerfully and took her arm. “Suqing, you are really beautiful.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>We can go now!”</p>
 <p>“But it must be quite pricey…” Mo Suqing hesitated.</p>
 <p>“Keep it on. And it’s not pricey at all. I have already paid for it. You can think&nbsp;of&nbsp;it as my wedding gift for you! I just hope you like it,” Leng Xiyao reassured.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing felt a lot relieved at her words.</p>
 <p>The two of them were just leaving the store when they heard a familiar voice.</p>
 <p>“Bring me the dress I have reserved.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing and Leng Xiyao immediately saw that it was Bai Tingnan and Mo Sulian. Mo Sulian looked as arrogant as a peacock.</p>
 <p>The clerk looked at the direction where Mo Suqing and Leng Xiyao were standing.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao suddenly understood what had happened. So the clerk didn’t lie. The dress had been reserved all right. And the person who had reserved it was no one but that hateful woman.</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian turned around and saw Mo Suqing and Leng Xiyao.</p>
 <p>On Mo Suqing was the dress she had reserved a few days ago.</p>
 <p>Her face darkened. Initially, she had been pretty interested in Mo Suqing’s husband. But after searching for more information about Ye Zhongjue in vain, she had dropped it temporarily.</p>
 <p>Also, she had been too busy fooling around with a venture capitalist recently to chase after Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>However, Mo Suqing’s presence instantly put her in a foul mood.</p>
 <p>She smiled darkly and said, “Ah, sis, it’s you! If you want that dress, you should have just told me! I can give it to you! Why did you have to buy it yourself?”</p>
 <p>At her pretentious tone, Mo Suqing furrowed her brow. She really didn’t want to get into&nbsp;a&nbsp;fight with her; it was not worth it.</p>
 <p>However, before she could say anything, Leng Xiyao rose to the challenge. She could never look on when Mo Suqing was being bullied.</p>
 <p>“Ah, bitch, it’s you! And not just you alone, but with another bitch! No wonder I can smell something really pungent!”</p>
 <p>She waved her hand in front of her nose, as if she really smelt something bad and was trying to dispel the odor.</p>
 <p>Initially, Bai Tingnan’s face had gone dark when she saw the two women and remembered how she had been humiliated in the office. But now, her expression became even uglier.</p>
 <p>As for Mo Sulian, her face went completely pale.</p>
