<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">When Leng Xiyao and Mo Suqing went downstairs, Leng Haoyun was sitting on the sofa. It looked as if he had not moved an inch after Ceng Hanyu left.</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo&nbsp;Suqing&nbsp;already told Leng&nbsp;Xiyao&nbsp;she wanted to stay over for a few days, making Leng&nbsp;Xiyao’s&nbsp;mood improve slightly.</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She knew that Mo&nbsp;Suqing&nbsp;also needed cheering up. Having to learn about Yue&nbsp;Zhongjue’s&nbsp;identity had shocked Mo&nbsp;Suqing&nbsp;greatly, and having to digest all that information was stressing her out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng&nbsp;Haoyun&nbsp;stood up immediately as he saw Leng&nbsp;Xiyao&nbsp;and Mo&nbsp;Suqing&nbsp;look like they were about to leave the house.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Yao, where are you going?” He had lost the usual chill in his voice, and it was replaced by a careful tone instead.</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng&nbsp;Xiyao&nbsp;looked at him, her face devoid of expression. She then smiled brightly, saying, “Oh, right. I’m planning to go shopping with Mo&nbsp;Suqing. I’ve invited her over to stay for a few days, but we might be going out pretty often. If you’re bored, you can get Auntie to come over, I won’t mind it...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng&nbsp;Xiyao&nbsp;forced herself to continue smiling as she spoke, masking the bitterness in her eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng&nbsp;Haoyun&nbsp;involuntarily staggered backwards when he heard her say ‘auntie’, plopping back onto the sofa. He stared at Leng&nbsp;Xiyao&nbsp;with a dark expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng&nbsp;Xiyao&nbsp;continued mercilessly, “I heard Aunt Zhang saying that Auntie seemed to like my room. I can sleep somewhere else, so the room can be cleared out for her. We’re going now...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng&nbsp;Xiyao&nbsp;pulled Mo&nbsp;Suqing&nbsp;with her as she turned to leave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng&nbsp;Haoyun’s&nbsp;voice could be heard saying, “That will never happen. It will forever be your room!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Oh! Is that so?” Leng Xiyao answered with sarcasm, not bothering to stop in her tracks. Only Mo Suqing could see the tears flowing down Leng Xiyao’s face. </span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><em>Is this really okay? </em></span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing shook her head in resignation as she squeezed Leng Xiyao’s hand.</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">It was obvious from the sound of Leng&nbsp;Xiyao’s&nbsp;voice that she was crying. “Suqing, stop looking at me. I’m just a little useless recently, and there’s an oversupply of tears. I’ll be fine in a while...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Mm...” Mo&nbsp;Suqing&nbsp;acknowledged gently as she looked away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Both of them did not plan to stay out for too long since Mo&nbsp;Suqing&nbsp;was pregnant. They just wanted to take a walk in the vicinity, for Leng&nbsp;Xiyao&nbsp;found it too boring in the villa.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo&nbsp;Suqing&nbsp;understood how she felt, and she was glad to be of company.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">However, they were met with two unwelcome guests as they were leaving.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Jian Jie and An&nbsp;Huilin&nbsp;arrived at the Leng’s villa in a car.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Although Leng Xiyao said she did not mind it, the color drained from her face once she saw An Huilin’s car. Speak of the devil. </span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><em>Was it Uncle who called her? </em></span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao was a little unsteady on her feet, and she might have just crumpled to the ground without Mo Suqing supporting her. She felt disoriented, like the wind could blow her away anytime.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo&nbsp;Suqing&nbsp;initially thought that An&nbsp;Huilin&nbsp;and Jian Jie would just pass by in their car, but the truth could not be farther from what she imagined.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">The car stopped right after it passed them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo&nbsp;Suqing&nbsp;and Leng&nbsp;Xiyao&nbsp;heard the noise behind them, but they continued walking forward, neither of them planning to look back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An&nbsp;Huilin&nbsp;and Jian Jie caught up in their heels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">They blocked the path that Mo&nbsp;Suqing&nbsp;and Leng&nbsp;Xiyao&nbsp;were on. Mo&nbsp;Suqing&nbsp;spoke sternly, “Out of the way!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Jian Jie smiled contemptuously. “What if I don’t want to!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo&nbsp;Suqing&nbsp;looked at her coldly, saying, “I wonder if Ms. Jian has heard of the saying - obedient dogs don’t stand in the way?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Jian Jie’s expression soured instantly as she stared at Mo&nbsp;Suqing, looking at the latter’s stomach before a laugh escaped from her lips.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“I just have some things to say to a certain someone. I heard that you’re pregnant?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Jian Jie continued staring at Mo&nbsp;Suqing’s&nbsp;stomach, her gaze rather terrifying.</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng&nbsp;Xiyao&nbsp;stepped forward to place herself in front of Mo&nbsp;Suqing, her guard up against Jian Jie.</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“What are you planning? Though rabid dogs do go around biting others in their frenzy, you shouldn’t be going insane in public like that!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Jian Jie squinted at Leng&nbsp;Xiyao&nbsp;in disdain, then laughed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“There are some who can’t even handle their own affairs but want to butt into others. What a joke!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Huilin stepped forward and pulled on Jian Jie. “What are you doing, Jian Jie? Don’t scare Yao like that, I’m her Auntie now. In the future, I’ll have to care for her just like Haoyun does. I won’t be happy if you continue like this. I’m actually very protective of the weak!” </span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Jian Jie patted her on the arm and smiled. “Okay, okay, okay! I know you’re about to get married, so I’ll just leave her alone!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">The two of them seemed to be putting on a show, acting as if no one could do anything to them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo&nbsp;Suqing&nbsp;took Leng&nbsp;Xiyao’s&nbsp;arm in hers and said, “Let’s go, Yao. We shall not stoop to the level of rabid dogs!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Jian Jie spoke quickly, “Why are you in such a hurry, Ms. Mo? I haven’t said my piece yet!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo&nbsp;Suqing&nbsp;ignored her as she continued walking forwards with Leng&nbsp;Xiyao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Seeing that she had no intention to stop, Jian Jie continued, “Ms. Mo, don’t you want to know what Jue was doing on the day you were kidnapped?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">That effectively stopped Mo&nbsp;Suqing. Leng&nbsp;Xiyao&nbsp;wanted to urge her along, but Mo&nbsp;Suqing&nbsp;turned back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She stared pointedly at Jian Jie, her eyes slightly narrowing. “Oh… I would definitely love to hear it since you know where my husband went.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao shook her head furiously, but Mo Suqing did not seem to register it at all. She simply stared straight at Jian Jie, waiting for the latter to speak. </span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Pleased, Jian Jie smiled. <em>She’s so predictable.</em> </span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">In a few leisurely steps, she stopped right in front of Mo Suqing. As Jian Jie looked at Mo Suqing with an air of arrogance, there was a trace of wickedness in her flirtatious smile.</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She spoke slowly, “I guess it’s fine to tell you about it, since you want to know so badly. I happened to also be kidnapped at the same time, but Jue chose to come and save me. Do you know what that means?”</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing’s face paled. She was not able to get through to him on the phone that day. <em>Was it because he went to save Jian Jie?</em></span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing grabbed Leng Xiyao’s hand tightly. <em>Was she less important than Jian Jie in his heart? All his words, no matter how sweet, amounted to nothing when it came to what he did. The person he cared about the most was not her.</em> </span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Learning about this was a bolt from the blue for Mo Suqing. It was much harder to swallow compared to learning about Ye Zhongjue’s identity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She always thought that Ye&nbsp;Zhongjue&nbsp;loved her, and that she was the one he cared the most about.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">But she was just jolted awake with a huge reality check. She did not want to doubt him either, but where was he and what was he doing on the day she was kidnapped? </span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><em>Jian Jie would not make something like this up, so… </em>Mo Suqing smiled at Jian Jie, ashen-faced.</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“And? He saved you, and you’re telling me this, for what? Or are you actually worried that he cares more about me? What do you want me to do by telling me all this?”</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Jian Jie did not expect Mo Suqing to respond in such a way. Her expression changed as she spoke, “Think about it. Jue knew about your pregnancy, and if he did care about you, why did he come for me first? Do you think that Jue would have saved you if it weren’t for the baby? I’m here to give you some advice, so that you’ll know what’s best for you!”</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing felt her heart clench in pain, Jian Jie’s words ringing in her mind. <em>Do you think that Jue would have saved you if it weren’t for the baby?</em> </span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She laughed suddenly, but it was a rather desolate laugh. <em>Yes, were it not for the baby?</em> </span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao was alarmed at Mo Suqing’s expression.</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She spat at Jian Jie angrily, “It doesn’t prove that he cares more about you even if Ye&nbsp;Zhongjue&nbsp;went to save you first. Also, are you actually gloating over this? If Ye&nbsp;Zhongjue&nbsp;finds out you used this to boast to Mo&nbsp;Suqing, do you think he’ll still care about you at all?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng&nbsp;Xiyao&nbsp;saw that Jian Jie’s face froze for a split second, and she knew she had dealt an effective blow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">However,&nbsp;Suqing’s&nbsp;pride would never let her tell Ye&nbsp;Zhongjue&nbsp;about this encounter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She and Ye&nbsp;Zhongjue&nbsp;were originally worlds apart, and it was already hard to overcome this big of a difference, much less finding a middle ground overnight. Mo&nbsp;Suqing&nbsp;had no choice but to protect herself carefully.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Jian Jie could tell that Mo Suqing would not reveal what just happened to Ye Zhongjue, and this was also why she dared behave with such arrogance. Leng Xiyao squinted as she thought to herself. Though she could not be sure about what really happened that day, she still felt that Ye Zhongjue cares about Suqing a lot, even more than she could have imagined. </span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><em>This woman here is acting just like a rabid dog, barking in a frenzy. Does she really think we are fools?</em></span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing squeezed Leng Xiyao’s hand. It was obvious she did not wish to continue this exchange.</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng&nbsp;Xiyao&nbsp;pursed her lips at Mo&nbsp;Suqing, and happened to glance at An&nbsp;Huilin.</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Since Auntie likes to stir the pot with your good friend, then I sincerely hope that Uncle will never have to witness this&nbsp;behaviour&nbsp;of yours. I think Uncle wouldn’t really like such uncouth women!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Hmph!” Leng&nbsp;Xiyao&nbsp;grabbed Mo&nbsp;Suqing’s&nbsp;hand and headed back to the villa.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She did not believe that anyone would do anything overboard in the villa.&nbsp;</span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun’s engagement had indeed upset her, but no matter how upset she was, she was no easy target.<em> It’s my territory here, so don’t even think about walking all over me! </em></span></p>
 </div>
 <div>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Jian Jie’s face paled as she looked at their figures.</span></p>
