<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">As Leng Xiyao and Mo Suqing reached the entrance to the villa, An Huilin’s car sped past them, resulting in a gust of wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao tightened her grip on Mo Suqing’s hand as she stared at the car, before walking into the villa.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">In the living room, Mo Suqing saw a stone-faced Leng Haoyun sitting across An Huilin and Jian Jie.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao chuckled as she approached them. “Oh my, isn’t this my future auntie? We just met on the road earlier! If I knew the both of you were visiting, I would have gotten a ride for Suqing and myself. Moreover, Suqing is pregnant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Huilin’s eyes glistened as she looked at the grinning Leng Xiyao, but she remained silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">It was obvious that a pampered princess like Leng Xiyao would take it up with Leng Haoyun whenever things went awry. With Leng Haoyun’s personality, even though he indulged her, he would still abide by some principles. Knowing this, An Huilin had already thought of a countermeasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">However, she did not expect Leng Xiyao to act this cheerful, and such behaviour had caught her unawares.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun furrowed his brows, showing obvious displeasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He could put up with Leng Xiyao’s temper and her ignoring him, but looking at how meek she is in front of An Huilin now, and how she is acting as if she liked An Huilin a lot, he felt a ball of fire in his chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao did not seem to register that he was upset as she continued smiling at An Huilin.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Auntie, you must be thirsty. Let me get some water for you and Ms. Jian!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao kept smiling as she turned to go get the water, only for Leng Haoyun to yell suddenly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Enough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao stood rooted to the ground as she flinched, while an intriguing smile formed on An Huilin’s lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing was standing in the living room, unsure of what to do.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao then shot a stubborn look at Leng Haoyun before heading for the kettle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Looking at Leng Xiyao’s back, Mo Suqing turned to glare at An Huilin.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Although she already had enough on her own plate for now, she was still very worried about Yao.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao was lost in her own thoughts as she stood in front of the kettle. She was holding a cup and did not even realize it when the hot water spilled out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">It was only when the boiling water touched her skin did she yelp. “Ah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">The ceramic cup in her hand shattered as it hit the smooth and shiny floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun was so fast that Mo Suqing did not see him move. Like a gust of wind, he was already at Leng Xiyao’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Concern was written on his face, replacing his usual detached expression with anxiety and worry. He held onto Leng Xiyao’s hand and made for the washroom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Running water could be heard from the washroom, and Mo Suqing caught sight of An Huilin’s sour expression. She suddenly found this entire situation to be ridiculous.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Huilin was probably trying to show Leng Xiyao who had the upper hand here. In her heart, Yao was just like an impulsive lass who had no strategy. But she did not expect for such a lass to use such a method.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">It was after a long time before Leng Xiyao was led out of the washroom by Leng Haoyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun led her towards the sofa, looking at her reddened hands with eyes that were full of concern and reproach for oneself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He asked Aunt Zhang to get some ice before raising his head to look at An Huilin.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">His voice was frigid.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Why are you still here? Are you watching a show?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Huilin’s face turned chalk white at those words. His voice that was laced with disgust and impatience seemed to pierce right through her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Huilin opened her mouth, about to say something.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun’s anger was once again triggered as he saw the blisters forming on Leng Xiyao’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Get out! Do you need me to escort you out? Don’t you have hands to get water for yourself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Huilin clearly felt Leng Haoyun’s rage this time, and she spoke with trepidation, “I didn’t...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She wanted to say that she did not need to drink water, and she merely wanted to put some fear into Leng Xiyao. Moreover, she was supposed to move in eventually, and Leng Xiyao should be showing more respect as someone who is younger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><em>What was wrong in getting water for her?</em> An Huilin looked at Leng Haoyun, feeling aggrieved, but failing to say anything else.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Jian Jie spoke quickly, “You can’t blame Huilin, President Leng. She just wanted to come and see you. The both of you are already engaged, so it’s nothing out of the ordinary if she visits. Yao is younger, so how could Huilin reject her offer to get water for her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Her words were logical, and she felt that her argument was flawless. Not to mention, it could help An Huilin. She then shot a triumphant look at Mo Suqing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Huilin felt that Jian Jie made a lot of sense, and her expression relaxed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">What she did not expect, however, was Leng Haoyun’s reaction. Leng Haoyun barely acted upon any sort of principle when it came to Leng Xiyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He shot Jian Jie a sharp look. “You shouldn’t be bothering yourself with matters of our household, Ms. Jian. Even if An Huilin and I get married, she wouldn’t be living here. This home belongs to Yao and I. I believe I’ve made it extremely clear now. Both of you are not welcome here, please leave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Jian Jie’s expression turned dour. She did not expect Leng Haoyun to say something that extreme, and he even explicitly asked them to leave. She had never been treated like this before.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She stood up angrily, pulling at An Huilin who was still in a daze.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Let’s go, Huilin. It’s no use staying any longer in a place like this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Huilin stayed still, appearing to be glued to the sofa. She stared at Leng Haoyun incredulously, her eyes looked like they were demanding an explanation from him for what just happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Haoyun, did you say that because Yao hurt her hand today? If that’s the case, I promise you that I would never provoke her after we get married. I’ll let her have her way, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She felt that this was unfair. She foolishly believed that she would be moving in after they got married.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Moreover, this was the ancestral home of the Lengs. Although it had been renovated, it still took up a huge amount of land. It could be said that this house was second to none in A City. If she cannot move in even after marrying into the Leng family, this would be comparable to being a mistress instead of a wife!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Huilin trembled with unease as she waited for Leng Haoyun’s answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao remained silent as she sat beside Leng Haoyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Once again, Mo Suqing felt like she was the audience to a play.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun kept a poker face as he raised his head. He took the ice from Aunt Zhang and applied it on Leng Xiyao’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Anyone who saw how tense he looked would have been able to tell how much he cared about Leng Xiyao.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing felt consoled at this. No matter what Leng Haoyun felt for Leng Xiyao, Yao was definitely the most important in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><em>It isn’t so bad then.</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun carefully held Leng Xiyao’s hand with the ice on it as he regarded An Huilin with a frosty gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Please leave. Even if all this didn’t happen, I don’t plan to let you move in either. I’ll purchase a house for you in the city. You can stay there if you wish. It’s up to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Huilin had never been humiliated like this, and she shook with anger as she pointed at Leng Haoyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Leng Haoyun, you’re really cruel. I’ve stayed by your side all these years, wasting all my youth and all my time on you. What do you see me as? Saying these things to me, do you even have a conscience?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun was emotionless, returning to that icy exterior of his.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“An Huilin, I’ll tell you this again. I’ve never asked that you wait for me nor spend time with me. Whatever you’ve done over the years have nothing to do with me at all. I’ve never asked for anything from you. We both agreed to the engagement, and if you’re unhappy, I can always get a replacement. So, please stop making a scene in my house. Escort the guests out, Aunt Zhang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Huilin was hysterical now, her whole body shaking in outrage. She wanted to destroy Leng Xiyao right at this moment. All of this happened because of Leng Xiyao. She originally wanted to instill some fear into Leng Xiyao today.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She had not seen Leng Xiyao ever since the engagement, and she never would have imagined that it was her who would be humiliated so thoroughly today.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Still trembling, An Huilin stood up. Jian Jie moved to support her, brows creasing as she shot another glare at Mo Suqing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing was playing the part of an audience, observing the entire show silently. She would not participate in this as long as Yao was not at the losing end.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Let’s go, Huilin. We don’t have to continue fighting with them here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Huilin looked at Leng Haoyun. “Are you sure? Are you sure that she’s not the reason that you’re treating me like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun nodded slowly. “It’s not because of anyone at all!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Fine!” An Huilin wiped the tears on her face. “Since it’s not because of anyone else, then it doesn’t matter even if I don’t stay here after marriage. Can I still come over in future? We are engaged!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Huilin stared at Leng Haoyun as she awaited his reply.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun furrowed his brows. If possible, he did not want anyone else coming over to bother Leng Xiyao and him. But as An Huilin just mentioned, they are already engaged. He did not want to replace her with someone else out of nowhere. He will let her come over if she wishes to, but he will never let her move in.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“You can come over if you want. But I hope you’ll not do it often!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun left no room for negotiation. From all that he had said and done, Mo Suqing could not tell that An Huilin was actually his fiancee.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">But An Huilin was a vile and hateful woman.<em> She deserves all of this!</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Huilin clenched her fists. She would definitely take revenge for the humiliation she suffered today.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She looked at Leng Xiyao, who was currently scrunched up against Leng Haoyun. The petite girl looked weak and pitiful, as if she needed protection.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">This was the woman she hated the most!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Fine! As you wish, my fiance!” An Huilin forced herself to smile at Leng Haoyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She was bent on marrying him no matter what!</span></p>
