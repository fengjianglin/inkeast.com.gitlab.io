<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Ceng Hanyu kept a smile on his face even though his heart sank at her words.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, I won’t force you into things if you’re unwilling. I’m just worried for your safety. Let’s go!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao looked at him without speaking before making her way downstairs.</p>
 <p>Before this, she had always thought that Ceng Hanyu simply treated her like a good friend. Now that she was aware of the truth, that he was actually treating her like his fiancee, she was unable to accept his gestures like she did before.</p>
 <p>Neither of them spoke on the drive back to the Leng’s villa.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao turned to him when she alighted.</p>
 <p>“I’ll try to accept this fact...”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu nodded at her.</p>
 <p>“Okay, I believe in you. I’ll be going then!”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu drove away only after he saw Leng Xiyao enter the villa.</p>
 <p>Once she walked into the living room, Leng Xiyao was met with the sight of Leng Haoyun on the sofa.</p>
 <p>He was not reading financial news nor in his study like usual. Instead, he was holding a cigarette in his hand, seemingly in deep thought.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao’s footsteps brought him out of his reverie.</p>
 <p>His head snapped up and he looked at her intently.</p>
 <p>“You’re back?”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao nodded as she thought about what happened today. She then walked closer to him.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, I have a question for you.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao bit her lip as she stood in front of him. She was observing him closely, afraid that she would miss any subtle change in his expression.</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun’s cigarette went out. “What?”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao went straight to the point.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, am I not from the Leng family?”</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun was stunned at this.<em>&nbsp;She found out?</em></p>
 <p>“How did you know...” He mumbled, sounding shocked and afraid at the same time.</p>
 <p>“So it’s true!” This killed any suspicion Leng Xiyao had left.</p>
 <p>“How did you find out?” Leng Haoyun stared at her, trying to figure out how she learnt about this.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao looked at that charming face of his. <em>When did I start finding Uncle’s face so unfamiliar?</em></p>
 <p><em>He is supposed to be my relative whom I’ve spent my days with for the past ten or so years!</em></p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao sniffed. She was unsure if she should appear sad, or if she should show some other emotion.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, could you tell me when did you find out that I wasn’t actually from the Leng family?”</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun scratched his head in frustration and leaned back against the sofa.</p>
 <p>“I heard your parents talk about it once.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao laughed bitterly. “So you already knew, but you kept it from me?”</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun got more frustrated at this. A frown formed on his face as he questioned her again. “How exactly did you find out?”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao gave him a self-deprecating look. “It’s simple. My blood type is very rare, and I just had a chat with the nurse today before I learnt… It’s impossible for my parents to have a child with my blood type.”</p>
 <p>Though Leng Xiyao was smiling, there was no warmth in it. “How did you think I found out?”</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun looked at her seriously. “Do you blame me, Yao? Do you blame me for not telling you the truth even when I already knew about it…?”</p>
 <p>His brows furrowed even more deeply.</p>
 <p>“I was just afraid that you’ll be hurt by it. You look so cheerful on the surface, but you’re more sensitive than others...”</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun realized that everything sounded like mere excuses when he tried to explain himself.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao continued staring at him without speaking, as if she had already decided that he was guilty, and that no amount of explanation could absolve him from it.</p>
 <p>“Yao...” Leng Haoyun never would have imagined that he would end up in such a situation, where he could not even begin to explain himself.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao then smiled as if she was happy, but Leng Haoyun could see the sorrow and emptiness reflected in her tears.</p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify">He sighed in resignation. <em>Maybe… my eyes were fooling me. She’s still a child, so how could she have such a pained expression?</em></p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao put on a bigger smile now. She looked at Leng Haoyun as she thought to herself, <em>So he already knew the truth, and he knew about my feelings too.</em></p>
 <p><em>But he did not plan to reveal this to me. Was he afraid that I would not let go of him?</em></p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao felt like a clown, as if she was nothing but a joke.</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun moved closer to her and hugged her tightly.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be like this, Yao!” <em>Why do I feel like she’s going to leave me?</em></p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao looked up to meet his eyes, and gently pushed him away.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong? Shouldn’t Uncle be happy? You’ll be rid of this deadweight!”</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun’s gaze turned frigid.</p>
 <p>“Yao!” His expression was dark and stormy. “I’ve never thought of you like that!”</p>
 <p>“I’ve never known your thoughts, and I don’t want to know from now on. I’ll move out after you marry An Huilin!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao walked upstairs without sparing another glance at him.</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun wanted to yell at her to stop her, but did not manage to make a sound.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao stayed in her room for four whole days.</p>
 <p>She did not step out of her room nor see Leng Haoyun in these four days. Aunt Zhang was the one who sent all her meals to her.</p>
 <p>She felt like she was sapped of all strength. She did not want to speak, and she just wanted to fall asleep, never to wake up from her slumber.</p>
 <p>However, she did not want to die.<em>&nbsp;Look! Why am I so useless!</em></p>
 <p>---</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing called on the fifth day.</p>
 <p>“What’s up, Suqing?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing grew concerned as she heard the feeble voice on the other end.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong, Yao?”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao sat up on the bed and tried to calm herself down.</p>
 <p>“Nothing. Why did you call?”</p>
 <p>“Ye Zhongjue will be discharged today, so let’s meet up for dinner. I heard you’ve been cooped up at home these few days, so it’ll be nice to go out for a bit. I’ll come pick you up soon, so you can go ahead and get ready.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao did not really feel like going out, but she knew that if she continued like this, she would probably go insane.</p>
 <p>She walked over to pull apart the curtains. The sunlight instantly streamed in, making her shield her eyes.</p>
 <p>“Okay, I’ll wait for you!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao started changing after she ended the call.</p>
 <p>On the other end of the line, Ceng Hanyu was looking at Mo Suqing nervously.</p>
 <p>“Sis-in-law, did Anne agree to come out?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing hesitated a little before speaking. “Ceng Hanyu, although Yao’s identity has been confirmed, she had been living as Leng Xiyao all these years. Without her agreement, I think it’s still better for you to address her as Yao first. She might read too much into it otherwise!”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu nodded. “Got it, I’ll take note!”</p>
 <p>“Mm, that’s good. She’s getting ready now, so we can go pick her up later.”</p>
 <p>At that, Ceng Hanyu looked obviously relieved.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing called when she arrived at the Leng’s villa, and Leng Xiyao made her way out slowly.</p>
 <p>She stopped in her tracks when she saw two cars waiting outside. <em>Who else is there?</em></p>
 <p>Only when she was about to get into one of the cars did she realize that Ceng Hanyu was in one of them while Ye Zhongjue was driving the other.</p>
 <p>Selina was in Ceng Hanyu’s car, and Mo Suqing in Ye Zhongjue’s.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao thought about it for a moment before heading towards Ye Zhongjue’s car. She was about to enter the back seat when Mo Suqing alighted.</p>
 <p>She went to join Leng Xiyao in the back seat.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao looked at her, but did not say anything else.</p>
 <p>Throughout the ride, Mo Suqing held onto Leng Xiyao’s hand without letting go. None of them spoke.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing could feel the change in Leng Xiyao. A chilly aura emanated from her now.</p>
 <p>The five of them arrived at Silk Empire International shortly. Ye Zhongjue had already reserved a table for them.</p>
 <p>After entering their booth, Ceng Hanyu excused himself, and Ye Zhongjue followed closely after him.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing did not stop them since she knew they probably had something to discuss. Selina had settled herself down, her head tilted as if she was thinking about something.</p>
 <p>Not wanting to wait any longer, Mo Suqing asked Leng Xiyao, “Yao, you seem somewhat different...”</p>
 <p>She was hesitating, afraid that she might inadvertently trigger Leng Xiyao if she said anything wrong.</p>
 <p>Unexpectedly, Leng Xiyao flashed her a bright smile. Her smile was so dazzling and beautiful that one could compare it to a field of flowers in full bloom.</p>
 <p>She said confidently, “Did you sense that I’ve outdone myself again? I’ve instantly turned into a bright, adorable and moving young lady! ”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was rather stunned by this. She did not expect Leng Xiyao’s mood to change so suddenly when she was, in fact, still mulling over how to console the girl.</p>
 <p>However, Mo Suqing was still worried. She knew that Leng Xiyao was someone who buried her sorrow deep within her heart, and that dazzling smile was nothing but a mask used to hide her feelings.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao did not wish for others to worry, and she did not want anyone to see her weak side either.</p>
 <p>She used to be willing to share her thoughts and feelings with Mo Suqing, but things seemed to be different now. She had put on that mask even when in front of Mo Suqing, the mask that made her look as if she was an unfeeling individual.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was not giving up so easily. “Yao, please tell me if anything happened, don’t just keep it all to yourself. It pains me to see you like this. You may feel better if you tell somebody about it!”</p>
 <p>Selina continued sitting there, not moving an inch. She acted as if she did not hear a single thing, as if she was invisible like the air.</p>
 <p>Even so, Mo Suqing caught the subtle change in Selina’s expression when Leng Xiyao spoke earlier.</p>
 <p>She did not know much about Selina. All she knew was what little information Ye Zhongjue shared with her, that Selina was a friend of Ceng Hanyu’s, and that Selina could be trusted.</p>
 <p>Since Ye Zhongjue said so, she had decided to trust Selina as well.</p>
 <p>The corners of Leng Xiyao’s lips turned up slightly, but she did not say anything else.</p>
