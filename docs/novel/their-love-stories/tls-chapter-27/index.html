<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>The way she saw it, if a person wore a cold face all the time, people around him would subconsciously give him a wide berth and be fearful of him.</p>
 <p>Normally, you would assume that cold-faced people were difficult. However, today she found that Ye Zhongjue was an exception.</p>
 <p>He was icy on the&nbsp;outside, fiery on the&nbsp;inside. At least,&nbsp;this was how he always treated her since they had known each other.</p>
 <p>“Eat your lunch and stop thinking weird stuff!” sighed Ye Zhongjue when he saw that Mo Suqing&nbsp;was&nbsp;once again lost in thought.</p>
 <p>“O-okay!” Mo Suqing stuck out her tongue. But just when she was about to resume her meal, her phone rang from the bedroom.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue frowned.&nbsp;Despite taking the day off, she&nbsp;seemed to be busier than him with all those calls.</p>
 <p>He had heard her talking on the phone while he was preparing lunch.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing laughed hollowly and apologized, “Sorry! I need to answer the phone.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue nodded without saying a word.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing stood up and walked into the room. Seeing that it was Leng Xiyao who was calling, she picked up the phone.</p>
 <p>“Suqing, I have some bad news!” panted Leng Xiyao.</p>
 <p>“What? What happened? Take it easy!” said Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>“Just now, Abbess Miejue announced that Guan Zixuan is going to hold a press conference tomorrow and that he asked only journalists at Trend to attend!” reported an agitated Leng Xiyao. “Is it possible he’s actually trying to locate you, using the conference as a disguise?”</p>
 <p>“No way!” exclaimed Mo Suqing incredulously. It was as plain as the nose on her face that Guan Zixuan was indeed trying to locate and confront her.</p>
 <p>“Well, you take care then!” Although Leng Xiyao was giving her a warning, she sounded amused, as if taking pleasure in her misfortune.</p>
 <p>“I don’t believe it! Is he really such a petty man?” mourned Mo Suqing. “He has a million scandals every day. Why would he want to hunt me down? I’m just someone who accidentally bumped into him and took a picture, which, may I add, I did not publish!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao laughed before saying, “Of course he would! The picture was taken in a public toilet! You have totally ruined his sacred image for his fans. Why wouldn’t he want to hunt you down?”</p>
 <p>“So what&nbsp;should&nbsp;I do?” fretted Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. Just don’t go to the conference! However, Abbess Miejue ordered Bai Tingnan, Song Min, Liu Siran, you and me to be there, so you’ve got to think of some excuse.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing hung up the phone, looking sorry for herself.</p>
 <p>She sat on the edge of the bed and racked her brains but to no avail.</p>
 <p>If she still couldn’t come up with anything, she could call in sick again tomorrow. However, the idea was barely formed before being aborted as soon as she thought of the icy expression on Abbess Miejue’s face.</p>
 <p>She had been taking so many days off recently that she wasn’t sure if she had used up her quota for the year. Abbess Miejue must have been pissed off.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s countenance kept changing.</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, she felt a pair of eyes watching her intently. Snapping her head up, she saw Ye Zhongjue leaning against the doorframe, looking at her expressionlessly.</p>
 <p>Seeing that Mo Suqing was aware of his presence, he spoke in a placid tone without any annoyance detectable, “Do you want to have your meal?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing thought, <em>I still have to figure out what to do, but I’ll do it after eating something first. Otherwise, I won’t have enough energy to deal with Abbess Miejue tomorrow!</em></p>
 <p>“Yes!”&nbsp;she&nbsp;answered emphatically. Ye Zhongjue was a little taken aback.</p>
 <p>In the afternoon…</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was working on some papers in his study. Mo Suqing knew she would probably sleep all afternoon if she stayed in her room, so she went to find Ye Zhongjue instead.</p>
 <p>There were just the two of them in the house; they could use each other’s company.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked up on hearing her footsteps. Mo Suqing stood by the door with a book in her hand, looking somewhat embarrassed.</p>
 <p>“Come in!”&nbsp;he said.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing beamed. “I promise I won’t disturb you. I just don’t want to be alone.”</p>
 <p>“Sure,” replied Ye Zhongjue noncommittally before returning back to the papers.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing silently walked over to the sofa across from the desk.</p>
 <p>For a while, the study was very quiet except for the occasional tapping on the keyboard from Ye Zhongjue, the swishing of his signing some paper, and the rustling of her turning another page.</p>
 <p>It must be what people meant by “quiet but not lonely.”</p>
 <p>What Mo Suqing had not expected was, she would still fall asleep reading on the sofa.</p>
 <p>When Ye Zhongjue looked up again, he found that she had fallen into a peaceful sleep like a child. Her face was very beautiful, and her expression meek.</p>
 <p>He frowned a little. She was susceptible to colds these few days, but it seemed she wasn’t concerned at all by falling asleep there. <em>What if she catches a chill?</em></p>
 <p>He walked out of the study immediately.</p>
 <p>When he came back, there was a thick duvet in his arms. He walked over and cautiously covered her body with the duvet, afraid to wake her.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing slept soundly until well past five in the afternoon. Ye Zhongjue was still working when she opened her eyes.</p>
 <p>“Did you do this?” asked her in a very nasal voice, pointing at the duvet.</p>
 <p>“Yeah,” said Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing shut her mouth, embarrassed. She had a feeling he didn’t want to talk to her.</p>
 <p>After sitting on the sofa for a while, she spoke tentatively, “You seem to have more work than your boss does. Do you really have to handle all those papers?” asked Mo Suqing, pointing at the huge pile on the desk.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue stopped in mid-signing.</p>
 <p><em>Yeah, I am supposed to be an assistant! An assistant is not supposed to read so many papers, let alone sign them</em><em>!</em></p>
 <p>After formulating a quick response, he replied, “Of course not. It’s just my boss has been on a business trip these two days. He asked me to go over these papers and sign them for him, so things can get done without delay.”</p>
 <p>“What a dictatorial and willful boss!” Mo Suqing huffed.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue did not want Mo Suqing to suspect anything, so he quickly explained, “No, I have worked at Mighty Empire for several years, so my boss has a lot of trust in me!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing frowned. She could feel something didn’t quite add up. However, Ye Zhongjue sounded really genuine. Maybe everything was just as he said.</p>
 <p>“Alright then. What do you want to have for dinner? I’ll go and buy it.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue contemplated for a moment before replying, “How about we order takeout? Or, I can take you out for dinner!”</p>
 <p>Remembering the last time when he took her out for a meal that could well have cost him his salary for a month, Mo Suqing shook her head rapidly.</p>
 <p>“No, no! Let’s order takeout.”</p>
 <p>“Okay. I’ll work for a little longer while waiting for the takeout.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing nodded, “Okay, go back to your work.”</p>
 <p>Having nothing left to say, she took the duvet and left the study.</p>
 <p>Watching her slender figure from behind with a deep affection, Ye Zhongjue became lost in thought.</p>
 <p>One day, she would find out the truth. If she discovered he had been lying to her now when she didn’t have any feelings for him, she would definitely leave him.</p>
 <p>But, he couldn’t just lie to her forever.</p>
 <p><em>I’ll hide the truth from her for as long as I can then,&nbsp;</em>he sighed.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The next morning when Mo Suqing woke up, Ye Zhongjue was still sleeping.</p>
 <p>She remembered that he had continued to work into the night the previous day. It must have been pretty late when he went to bed.</p>
 <p>She had never known anyone who was as diligent and careful in work as&nbsp;him. He was second to none when it comes to work ethics.</p>
 <p>Having said that, she believed his thoroughness was not reserved for work.</p>
 <p><em>He seemed to be exhausted. I’ll let him sleep a little more.</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing carefully got out of bed, fearing she would wake him up. When she emerged from the bathroom, Ye Zhongjue was already up.</p>
 <p>He had just&nbsp;finished changing&nbsp;and&nbsp;asked, “Why didn’t you wake me?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing walked over to the wardrobe to pick out some clothes while saying casually, “You went to bed late last night, so I thought you could use a few more minutes&nbsp;of&nbsp;sleep.”</p>
 <p>“Right,” Ye Zhongjue murmured, then stepped into the bathroom.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing quickly changed into her work outfit.</p>
 <p>When Ye Zhongjue came out of the bathroom, she had packed everything and was going to buy some breakfast downstairs.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue stopped her, “Where are you going?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing looked at him and replied matter-of-factly, “I’m going to buy us some breakfast.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue took a look at his watch and observed, “It’s a bit late. We’ll buy some breakfast on the way to work. Don’t forget your purse. Let’s go!”</p>
 <p>“What…” Mo Suqing remained rooted on the spot.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue reminded her, “I said I would drive you to work and pick you up from work from now on.”</p>
 <p>Remembering the conversation from yesterday, Mo Suqing was a little dumbfounded.</p>
 <p>“We can start from tomorrow. It’s too late today; you’ll be late for work.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue shook his head, “No I won’t. Get your stuff and let’s go.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing decided that she was just wasting more time arguing with him, so she quickly took up her purse and followed him downstairs.</p>
 <p>Sitting in the car, Mo Suqing finally understood why a lot of people would want to buy a car. It was so much better than being crammed into a subway carriage.</p>
 <p>When she graduated from school, Mo Zhenfeng had proposed to buy her a car, but due to many reasons, including the discord between Bai Lian and her, her stubbornness, and her decision to leave home, she didn’t accept it.</p>
 <p>However, the real reason was because she didn’t know how to drive.&nbsp;The thought&nbsp;of driving on the road scared her. The fact that her mother had died from a car accident did not help.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue pulled over without warning.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing gave him a puzzled look. He turned to her and instructed, “Wait here. I’ll go buy some breakfast.”</p>
 <p>Then, he got off the car and walked toward a shop nearby.</p>
 <p>He was such a nice-looking man, tall and handsome and elegant.</p>
 <p>People immediately started to eye him. A weird emotion raised up in Mo Suqing’s chest.</p>
 <p>At least nominally, he was her husband. Although he was just an assistant, she had discovered during their short time together that he was not only extraordinarily attractive, but also very abled in many things.</p>
 <p><em>But why</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>would he choose me?</em></p>
 <p><em>And more importantly, why&nbsp;</em><em>did</em><em>&nbsp;I succumb to an impulse and agree to marry him?</em></p>
