<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Leng Xiyao looked at Mo Suqing, guilty. She moved her lips, then said, “Suqing, I’m so sorry!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing stroked her hair and said, “Silly, what are you apologizing to me for? Come on, let’s go.”</p>
 <p>It was well past the time they should have started working when Mo Suqing and Leng Xiyao went back to the office. However, An Huilin didn’t give them a dressing-down.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing asked Liu Siran where&nbsp;An Huilin&nbsp;had gone, and&nbsp;Liu Siran&nbsp;replied in her high-pitched voice, “The editor-in-chief has no time for you! It is said that our boss – the man who bought the magazine company – is coming this afternoon. She is busy preparing for his arrival.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing let out a sigh of relief. <em>As long as she didn’t ask about us.</em></p>
 <p>As for Leng Xiyao, she just stared blankly at her desktop. It was impossible to know what she was thinking.</p>
 <p>About four in the afternoon, An Huilin emerged from her office.</p>
 <p>She cleared her throat and announced, “The president is going to visit our office today. If you work hard and show your best side, he will merge all the magazine companies he owns and rename them Trend Magazine, and we will be the mother company. Do you understand?”</p>
 <p>“Editor-in-chief, we’ll do our best!” Everyone cheered in a confident voice, except for Mo Suqing and Leng Xiyao, who had remained silent.</p>
 <p>“He will be here any minute. Let’s go outside to welcome him,” An Huilin said, leading the way out of the office.</p>
 <p>The others followed her. It was quite a lively crowd.</p>
 <p>Hearing that the magazines were likely to be merged under their company’s name, people became excited. If it came true, Trend Magazine would be one of the magnates in the field.</p>
 <p>Maybe there would be a salary increase, too!</p>
 <p>All editors from the other departments went out of the office, too.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing and Leng Xiyao tagged along at the back. Even though they were not enthusiastic about the whole thing, they couldn’t just stay behind and become the subject of future gossip as “those exceptions.”</p>
 <p>After all, it was the mysterious boss they were talking about!</p>
 <p>The staff stood in two lines in front of the entrance, with the editors in between.</p>
 <p>Presently, a black Rolls-Royce Phantom stopped in front of them.</p>
 <p>The chauffeur got off the car. He was a young man who looked outdoorsy.</p>
 <p>He walked to the backseat and opened the door.</p>
 <p>First, a pair of long legs appeared before their eyes. The shiny, leather shoes were obviously very expensive, handmade with real cow skins.</p>
 <p>Then, the person slowly emerged from the car and slowly raised his head.</p>
 <p>For a second, all Mo Suqing could hear was the gasps from her colleagues.</p>
 <p>She had to admit that she, too, was struck dumb.</p>
 <p><em>Isn’t he the man in the photo in Abbess Miejue’s purse?</em></p>
 <p><em>He is our mysterious boss?</em></p>
 <p>The others were shocked because of a totally different reason.</p>
 <p>No one remembered seeing Leng Haoyun at Silk Empire International. With two-third of the staff being females, no wonder the crowd was shocked – no, they were thrilled – because they just found out their president was a wealthy handsome young man.</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun approached them. Some of the editors greeted him politely, “President Leng, please come in!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing noticed the man seemed to be emanating an unusually powerful air. His ice-cold expression made Ye Zhongjue’s a sunny disposition.</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun responded with a single-syllable word in a low voice, “Sure.”</p>
 <p>His husky voice once again melted the hearts of the young women present.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao, who had hung her head low, snapped it up at the familiar voice.</p>
 <p>Her eyes met with Leng Haoyun’s across the crowd.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao gasped. <em>Uncle is the one who bought Trend Magazine?</em></p>
 <p>Looking at Leng Haoyun, who was only a couple of steps away from her, and listening to the excited whispers from her colleagues, Leng Xiyao suddenly remembered her red, swollen eyes. She quickly lowered her head.</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun was seized with a sudden pang. <em>Did something happen to my girl? Why are her eyes red? It’s obvious she had been crying.</em></p>
 <p><em>Could it be that someone mistreated her?</em></p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun approached and stood in front of her.</p>
 <p>Behind him, An Huilin was glaring at Leng Xiyao with rage. <em>It’s not fair. Why is the first thing he sees always this woman?</em></p>
 <p>She clenched her fists so hard her fingernails almost punctured her palm.</p>
 <p>To be honest, An Huilin didn’t lack for suitors. However, she had long before given her heart to the man in front of her.</p>
 <p>When he bought Trend Magazine and asked her to be the editor-in-chief, she hadn’t known why. She just did what he wanted her to do.</p>
 <p>She had figured he was expanding his business and he had chosen her because he had seen her as someone he trusted most, his right-hand person.</p>
 <p>Then, one day when they had finished dinner together and the waiter came to give them the receipt, she opened his wallet that he had left on the table since she had forgotten to bring her own purse and saw it.</p>
 <p>It was a picture of Leng Xiyao collapsing on Leng Haoyun’s shoulder with a big smile on her face.</p>
 <p>She didn’t know how she had gone home that day. At that moment, she finally realized why Leng Haoyun would buy the magazine company.</p>
 <p>Her love for him was turned into hatred that filled her bosom. She had never expected it to be for a woman that he bought Trend Magazine.</p>
 <p><em>How could I take it?</em></p>
 <p>That was why she kept picking on Leng Xiyao and giving her a hard time at work. However, not long ago, Leng Haoyun had told her to leave Leng Xiyao alone out of the blue.</p>
 <p>She had felt her heart break. She had been waiting for him for so many years! She had rejected every suitor and proposal of marriage, even though she was past thirty.</p>
 <p><em>How can he be so cruel? Does he have any idea how people talk about her?</em></p>
 <p>He had never tried to understand her feelings…</p>
 <p>And now, he had barely arrived before he rushed over to Leng Xiyao’s side. <em>What does she do to deserve his whole heart?</em></p>
 <p>An Huilin glared at the girl in front of Leng Haoyun with envy.</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun fixed his eyes at Leng Xiyao, heedless of the others and their whispers.</p>
 <p>“Have you been crying?”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao, her head still hung low, replied chokingly, “No, it’s not what you think, Mr. President.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing gave her a concerned look. <em>The man is the president! Why didn’t she look up when talking to him?</em></p>
 <p>Everyone thought Leng Haoyun would let it go at Leng Xiyao’s assurance.</p>
 <p>After all, she was just a gossip journalist, a nobody who somehow didn’t know her place and was being really rude to their boss. And a super cute boss at that!</p>
 <p>Yes, he was a bit aloof, but he was so good-looking and rich that all&nbsp;his negative qualities&nbsp;were nothing.</p>
 <p>To their surprise, not only did Leng Haoyun stay where he was, he even reached out and lifted the girl’s chin up.</p>
 <p>All the women looked at Leng Xiyao jealously, thinking, <em>If only&nbsp;</em><em>Leng Haoyun would&nbsp;</em><em>touch my chin instead!</em></p>
 <p>Only Mo Suqing was feeling nervous for Leng Xiyao.</p>
 <p><em>Silly girl! This is THE boss! You can’t afford to offend him!</em></p>
 <p>However, Leng Xiyao just stared at Leng Haoyun with those swollen eyes, stubborn and fearless.</p>
 <p>The mysterious president sighed heavily.</p>
 <p>“Say it if you were wronged; don’t cry so. I hope the company doesn’t abuse their staff!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao didn’t respond. An Huilin, on the other hand, darkened her face at his words.</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun dropped his hand and headed inside.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing once again felt she was under an illusion. She thought she had detected a hint of affection and resignation in the eyes of their boss&nbsp;when he looked at Leng Xiyao.</p>
 <p>She shook her head. <em>Is my sight getting weak? I should probably get a pair of glasses!</em></p>
 <p>After Leng Haoyun disappeared inside, Leng Xiyao was still standing on the spot. The other fangirls had already followed behind Leng Haoyun, as if they had never seen a man before.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing could catch some of the whispers.</p>
 <p>“President Leng is so handsome!”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, and he was really manly and gentlemanlike just now!”</p>
 <p>Someone even said, “I think I’m falling in love with him. What do I do? What do I do?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing almost laughed out loud.</p>
 <p>She admitted that Leng Haoyun was indeed very good-looking, but she preferred Ye Zhongjue’s type.</p>
 <p>He was dictatorial yet tender, had a dark side but also a loving side, and was as elegant as he was aloof. To her, these constituted an irresistible combination.</p>
 <p>When everyone had gone inside, Mo Suqing tugged at Leng Xiyao’s elbow.</p>
 <p>“Yao, come on. Let’s go.”</p>
 <p>“But, I don’t want to go inside.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao was in a tantrum-throwing mood. She pursed her lips and looked at Mo Suqing with sad eyes glinting with tears.</p>
 <p>She was sad. Even sadder now that her uncle showed up. She just wanted to have a good cry.</p>
 <p>Seeing that the waterworks were going to be turned on again, Mo Suqing stole a furtive glance into the office and then began to run, grabbing Leng Xiyao’s hand on the way.</p>
 <p>“Alright then. If you are unhappy, let’s go AWOL! I don’t believe Abbess Miejue can do anything to us just because we skip work once.”</p>
 <p>Turning her tears&nbsp;into laughter,&nbsp;Leng Xiyao&nbsp;reminded Mo Suqing, “Actually, this is the fourth time we have skipped work in a month!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing smiled, embarrassed. “It’s fine. I don’t care how many times we have done it, as long as you are happy!”</p>
 <p>She dragged Leng Xiyao and ran out of the building.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao turned to look at the black Rolls-Royce Phantom.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing tugged at her and said, “Come on now. We can’t possibly afford that!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao smiled thinly without replying. Then, she started to run.</p>
