<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>A rather notorious figure in Emperor City, Longge, was the one Guan Zixuan contacted to give Su Xiaoran a scare, and the man had agreed to the job very quickly.</p>
 <p>Having just learnt about the murder in the suburbs today, Guan Zixuan had a nagging feeling that it might have had some connection with what he asked Longge to help with.</p>
 <p>His instincts were always pretty accurate, but he really hoped he was wrong this time.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan returned to his room after breakfast and gave Longge a call.</p>
 <p>“Hey, A’long, how did the job go?”</p>
 <p>The man on the phone sounded rather hesitant as he said, “Zixuan, it’s my fault. I didn’t expect things to turn out this way!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan’s heart sank at this. Something had gone terribly wrong.</p>
 <p>Longge then continued. “I asked a few men to capture Su Xiaoran and simply give her a scare by taking all her clothes off and snapping some photos so that you can use them as leverage in case she tries to threaten you again. I didn’t do anything overboard, but I didn’t expect two of my men to actually go back and… rape her.”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan’s eyes widened at this. <em>They did what to Su Xiaoran...</em></p>
 <p>He tried to simmer down after hearing the news. <em>I was the one who caused this.</em></p>
 <p>“The murder reported on the morning news today has nothing to do with you right? You’ve been hanging around that area recently, so I was a little worried.”</p>
 <p>“I didn’t kill him. But I have no excuse for what happened yesterday!” Longge answered immediately.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan raised his brows at this. “What happened exactly? Who did it then? Do you know how the old man died?”</p>
 <p>“I saw the news. I didn’t do it on purpose. I’m quite familiar with the old man, and he usually goes out to pick up the trash everyday and comes back only at night. I wanted to keep Su Xiaoran in that house for a while after we took those photos, but my men got drunk and did not release her in time. I didn’t think that those two idiots would actually go back and… And I definitely didn’t expect for Su Xiaoran to kill anybody just to cover it up.”</p>
 <p>“You’re saying Su Xiaoran is the murderer?” Guan Zixuan raised his voice in shock.</p>
 <p>He knew that Su Xiaoran was arrogant, but he would never expect her to kill anyone.</p>
 <p>Longge then said, “It has to be her. None of my men were there at the time, so it can’t be them. I didn’t expect Su Xiaoran to be this vicious. Her methods were so cruel. Zixuan, let me give you a word of advice, you’d better not marry her. You might just be walking straight into a trap! You’d better be careful!”</p>
 <p>“Okay, got it.” Guan Zixuan then ended the call.</p>
 <p>He stood at the balcony and wondered what the old man’s son would feel after learning that his father died in such a manner.</p>
 <p><em>Su Xiaoran turned out to be this crazy.&nbsp;</em>Guan Zixuan knew that he was actually the root cause of everything, but he rationalized very quickly by telling himself that if she did not look for Xia Zi, he would not have wanted to create trouble for her in the first place.</p>
 <p><em>It’s karma!</em></p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan heard that the police were still investigating the case, and he did not pursue the matter further.</p>
 <p>The Guan family had been busy preparing for his wedding with Su Xiaoran, and he knew that Su Xiaoran would be keeping a low profile these few days to prevent any hiccups.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan grew more anxious as his wedding day neared.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan decided to go discuss the matter with his brother when they were left with only one more day to the wedding.</p>
 <p>“Bro, when are you going to do something about the wedding?!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zijue shot him a cold glance. “What’s wrong with you? It's just getting married. You’re the one getting married, not me. Why are you asking me this?”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan looked at him in disbelief. “Are you my real brother or not?”</p>
 <p>“You can go to the hospital and do a check to find out.” Guan Zijue did not deign to look at him when answering.</p>
 <p><em>Bro, why are you doing this to me?</em></p>
 <p>“Stop it. When are you going to do something? You mustn’t push me into the fire like this!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zijue slowly closed the book he was looking at.</p>
 <p>“What? It’s just getting married! How is that pushing you into the fire? Anyway, Su Xiaoran grew up together with us. Even though she might be a bit arrogant, she’s still a good match for you. A bright future lies ahead for the Su and Guan families once we’re connected via this marriage, so tell me, why should I prevent this from happening?”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan could not believe he was hearing this from Guan Zijue.<em>&nbsp;Bro, are you being serious now? I’ll be walking into a trap!</em></p>
 <p><em>I have to convince my brother otherwise.</em></p>
 <p>“Bro, there’s something I have to tell you!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zijue raised his brows, curious to find out what Guan Zixuan had to say. “Go on. What is it?”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan then said, “It’s nothing big actually, but I know who murdered the old man. The one we saw on the morning news the other day.”</p>
 <p>Guan Zijue shot up from his seat and grabbed his brother by the collar, staring daggers at him. His aura was extremely imposing.</p>
 <p>This shocked Guan Zixuan. He didn’t think that his brother would have such a huge reaction to this.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
 <p>“Tell me! Who’s the murderer?” Guan Zijue sounded like he was commanding one of his men in the military, and Guan Zixuan was not used to being spoken to in this manner.</p>
 <p>“Bro, what’s wrong? Why are you being so serious all of a sudden?”</p>
 <p>Guan Zijue then asked, “Do you know who that old man is?”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan shook his head. “No, I don’t!”</p>
 <p>He could not understand why Guan Zijue reacted in such a manner, and even though he knew how cruel the murderer was, his brother was not someone who would sympathize with a stranger like this.</p>
 <p>Guan Zijue said, “I’ll tell you who he was!”</p>
 <p>“That old man is the father of one of my men. I spoke to his son on the very night he was killed. I sent his son on a dangerous mission, and I even told him to be careful. He told me that he had an elderly father waiting for him to go back home, so he’d definitely be careful. But who knew that something like this would actually happen to his father? Do you know how horrible I felt...”</p>
 <p>With this, Guan Zixuan understood immediately. As the commander of Team Langya, his brother cared for his men well. That team was sent on the most dangerous and critical missions.</p>
 <p>His brother treated all of his men like family. Because of his position and how critical it was, his brother was also able to rise up the ranks very quickly.</p>
 <p>Becoming a major at twenty nine was rare, and he was probably the youngest major in the country.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan knew that his brother’s dream was to become a general before he turned thirty five, and he had always supported his brother on this.</p>
 <p>This was the first time his brother told him anything about his team in the military.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan said, “Brother, this is also why I can’t marry Su Xiaoran. Though it’s not the main reason, it’s among the many reasons I can’t do so. Su Xiaoran is the murderer!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zijue’s expression darkened. “What!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan sighed and started explaining everything.</p>
 <p>“I initially wanted to teach her a lesson because I knew she would go to Xia Zi to create more trouble for her in future, so I asked A’long to scare her for a bit. But who knew that A’long’s men would actually rape her? Su Xiaoran thus decided to kill the old man so that she can keep the entire matter under wraps.”</p>
 <p>Guan Zijue listened to his explanation without a trace of emotion.</p>
 <p>“Are you okay, Bro?” Guan Zixuan asked in concern.</p>
 <p>Guan Zijue looked at him for a while before answering.</p>
 <p>“I’m fine. You don’t have to worry either. I planned to give the Su family a fatal blow on the wedding day itself. But now that Su Xiaoran did something like that, I’m definitely not going to have any mercy on the Su family nor on Su Xiaoran!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan sighed and fell silent.</p>
 <p>Before he left, he said, “Bro, it’s fine if you just continue with your initial plan. I don’t mind it if we were to give the Su family a fatal blow only on the wedding day. It’s fine as long as the wedding is prevented. As for your teammate, I’m very sorry about that. It’s partially my fault.”</p>
 <p>Guan Zijue had turned around to make a call, and he tightened his grip on the phone as he heard what Guan Zixuan said.</p>
 <p>Shaking his head, he answered, “It’s hard to predict the future, so it’s not your fault. I know you only asked A’long to scare her and nothing else, so what his men did was out of your control. You didn’t ask Su Xiaoran to murder anyone either. If she could kill someone now, it means she has the propensity to kill somebody else in future. There’s no need for you to feel guilty. I won’t let anyone from the Su family get away with this!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zijue looked terrifying.</p>
 <p>It was the first time Guan Zixuan saw his brother get so angry. He then turned to leave the study.</p>
 <p><em>It’s partially my fault this happened...</em></p>
