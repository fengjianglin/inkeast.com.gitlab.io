<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Mo Suqing began to read the book and found it quite interesting. When she and Leng Xiyao first met each other, they had both been interested in design.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao had taken a particular interest in jewelry design and she enjoyed drawing all kinds of bizarre trinkets. However, although they both liked design, they ended up working in the field of journalism.</p>
 <p>With the same interest and the fate that had brought them together, they naturally became good friends.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing turned page after page. Feeling secure in the familiar environment, she kept reading. Soon, she had read a large portion of the book.</p>
 <p>She was so engrossed in it that she didn’t notice Ye Zhongjue had come back and was standing at the door.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue had rushed all the way back home. On the way, he kept thinking how he should explain everything to her. But when he walked to the bedroom and&nbsp;saw&nbsp;Mo Suqing&nbsp;on the bed, he couldn’t help but stop and watch her.</p>
 <p>She had her head bend down, so her long hair fell forward to her front. She was reading a book in such a concentration that she didn’t blink once.</p>
 <p>The light shone on her face at a slant, making her complexion even fairer and more smooth.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue watched the cozy scene silently. It felt like they had never been separated. It was as if he had but come home late from work to be greeted by the cozy scene.</p>
 <p>His whole heart warmed up.</p>
 <p>He just gazed&nbsp;at&nbsp;her, reluctant to disturb her by taking a step closer and taking her by surprise.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing suddenly felt someone was watching her intently in front of her. She could feel the intensity even though she was preoccupied with the book.</p>
 <p>She looked up and, at that moment, fell into the tender, loving eyes of Ye Zhongjue. It was impossible to fake the affection and heat shown in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s heart was beating fast. Everything felt so cozy that she almost forgot she had just mailed the divorce settlement agreement to him.</p>
 <p>Once he signed it, they would no longer be involved.</p>
 <p>At the thought, Mo Suqing’s eyes darkened. She was too naïve to have expected otherwise just now.</p>
 <p>Watching the light in Mo Suqing’s eyes diminish little by little, Ye Zhongjue himself gradually came back to reality from the dreamlike visual feast.</p>
 <p>To him, Mo Suqing was always a visual feast; she was more appealing to look at than anyone and anything else.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu was right. There was no need for him to be so cautious and uptight. She had mailed him the divorce settlement agreement, for crying out loud! If he didn’t seize the opportunity this time, there would be no opportunities whatsoever.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue strode over. Mo Suqing looked up and eyed him.</p>
 <p>Neither spoke. Time seemed to stop as well.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked at Mo Suqing earnestly and finally said, “Suqing…”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing mumbled some noncommittal reply. Ye Zhongjue’s eyes sparkled with delight, as if Mo Suqing’s unenthusiastic response had given him great encouragement.</p>
 <p>“Honey…” Ye Zhongjue called, then watched her expectantly. Mo Suqing averted her eyes and did not reply.</p>
 <p>The light in Ye Zhongjue’s eyes ebbed a little. He continued in a serious tone, “I want to explain everything that has happened recently. Can you hear me out?”</p>
 <p>They had been having really big fights where neither had attempted to back down, so Mo Suqing didn’t know what to do now that Ye Zhongjue changed his attitude.</p>
 <p>“Keep talking,” she said simply.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue sat down on the edge of the bed and took Mo Suqing’s hand. As a reflex, Mo Suqing tried to withdraw it, but Ye Zhongjue wouldn’t let go.</p>
 <p>“Tell me&nbsp;what&nbsp;you want to know or anything you&nbsp;are doubtful&nbsp;about without reserve, okay? I will definitely give you a satisfactory answer. Let’s stop sulking with each other, okay? My heart has been hurting so much!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue said the last sentence in a grieved tone and put Mo Suqing’s hand over his heart.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s expression softened a little. An imperceptible hint of panic crossed her eyes.</p>
 <p>Her words were a jumble when she managed to say, “Why are you asking me questions? Say what you’d like to say!”</p>
 <p>It was obviously she was being emotional.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue sighed. “Then, can you tell me why you want to end our marriage?”</p>
 <p>“Aren’t you getting married with Jian Jie?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing said in an unhappy voice. She involuntarily lowered her head, not wanting to look at Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue felt defeated. “Why do you always assume things? Why can’t you ask me if things are as you think? You have never asked me what the deal with me and Jian Jie is, so how can you reach a conclusion by yourself?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t have to ask to know what kind of relationship you two have! Ye Zhongjue, don’t you dare deny it. I am willing to step aside and let you get together!”</p>
 <p>Although having said so, Mo Suqing wasn’t really genuine and she despised herself for it. Perhaps, she had done it on purpose because she could see Ye Zhongjue still had feelings for her.</p>
 <p>He had told her at the very beginning that he would give her a home. It had moved her almost immediately.</p>
 <p>She had just been cheated by Gu Jiannan and it felt like the whole world had betrayed her. He was the one who had given her some hope, until he had made another mess in her life.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue felt both exasperated and aching for her. “You are not <em>letting&nbsp;</em>us get together! Because she and I have nothing! You thought you&nbsp;had&nbsp;guessed it all by yourself and then decided you would take your own course by mailing the divorce settlement agreement to me, but have you ever considered my feelings? No matter how big a fight we had, I have never thought about giving up! Even if the world is against us, no one can make me leave you!”</p>
 <p>His words were so touching and full of confidence that Mo Suqing could feel what she had felt before once again – although she didn’t understand why he liked her, she could clearly feel that he cared about her a great deal.</p>
 <p>“Don’t act as if I don’t know anything. You were so protective of Jian Jie at the airport. How can you explain that? How can I believe that nothing ever happened between you? Also, do you remember what you said? You said you met your first love when you were seventeen – Jian Jie told me you two went to the UK that year. And you grew up together! Do you know what I think? I think you want to end things with me because your first love has finally come back! That’s why you have been silent, because you are waiting for our relationship to burn itself out! You are just waiting for me to break up with you first and step aside! Now I have done what you want me to do, what else do you want? What do I have to do so that you will let me go? My heart is made of flesh and it hurts, you know? If I can help it, I don’t want to fall for you ever again. It’s too hard…”</p>
 <p>Crying inconsolably, Mo Suqing had her hand over her own heart now. Her hair fell over her eyes, so she didn’t see Ye Zhongjue’s expression was mixed with astonishment, defeat and joy.</p>
 <p>He was astonished because she had totally misunderstood what had happened at the airport. He felt defeated because she had concluded Jian Jie was his first love.</p>
 <p>However, he was also extremely joyful, because she had just admitted she had fallen in love with him. To him, it was as wonderful as if a pastry had fallen from the sky and hit him on the head during a famine!</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue smiled foolishly.</p>
 <p>This was what Mo Suqing saw when she looked up.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, she became angry. <em>I’m crying so hard here, but he seems to be pleased! What does he want to explain to me, I would like to know?</em></p>
 <p><em>Humph, I’m not listening! I’m not listening to him anymore!</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing, like a kitten whose fur stood up when it was enraged, turned her back toward Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue stopped smiling at her cute behavior and gently pulled her into his arms.</p>
 <p>“Hey, stop sulking already!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing slapped his hand away. “I’m not sulking! I’m getting a divorce!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s face clouded. “Suqing, don’t ever say that again. I can endure anything but the word ‘divorce’ from you. When we got married, I have decided to be with you for the rest of my life.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue took a deep breath before continuing, “As for what happened at the airport, I suppose I should explain it to you. Do you know I went to the UK?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing nodded and replied unhappily, “Yeah, I do.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue peered at her sulky face closely. “You only found out today?”</p>
 <p>“No, I went to look for you in your company and the receptionist told me you had gone abroad, so I left.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was surprised. “You went to look for me?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah. I wanted to hear you out. Before sending you the divorce settlement agreement, I wanted to give us another chance.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue hugged her tightly and said, “Suqing, give us another chance now. I promise I’ll explain everything clearly to you.”</p>
 <p>His voice was earnest. Before Mo Suqing could say no, he began, “I went to the UK to take care of some business affair that involved gangsters. When I was negotiating, I couldn’t seem to get you out of my mind…”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue paused, then continued, “I kept thinking back to how you sobbed into the shoulder of the male colleague of yours the day I left. I was jealous and pained, but I couldn’t help but think about it all the time. That’s why I was distracted.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue took another breath. He wasn’t sure if she could take what he was about to say. However, in order to gain her understanding and trust, he told her anyway.</p>
 <p>“I was so distracted, I almost fell into my opponent’s trap. Just before we were leaving, they had arranged a sniper to shoot me. I should have detected it. After all, it was not the first time I did business with gangsters. You have to be very careful, or you risk getting killed. Your money and your life can be both lost in an instant.”</p>
 <p>“Anyway, at that critical moment, someone saved me by taking the shot for me. When I realized what had happened, the damage was done. She was already bleeding profusely. I immediately retreated from the scene with my people.”</p>
