<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked at Mo Suqing for a long time. He noticed that after her initial stiffness, she had returned to her usual self.</p>
 <p>Therefore, he nodded and said, “No problem! We’ll eat here.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao thought sarcastically, <em>He acts so coolly! And he never says more words than needed! I’m worried that Suqing might be transformed into a frozen stick after spending time with him.</em></p>
 <p>At this, a bizarre image appeared in her mind’s eye. A frighteningly icy Ye Zhongjue cast a glance at Mo Suqing. A laser-like beam of light shot through the space between them, freezing the air in its wake. In an instant, Mo Suqing became a frozen stick. Splendid!</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao tittered.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue and Mo Suqing turned to look at her in unison, as if to say, <em>What’s the matter with her?</em></p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao was hurt by their reaction. <em>They were indeed a couple, acting like one person!&nbsp;</em>she thought. <em>Argh! I think I am mortally hurt!&nbsp;</em>As a single, how was she going to bear the sight of them?</p>
 <p>The three of them walked into the hotel and found a table next to a window.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue handed the menu to Leng Xiyao and let her take order first, just like a perfect gentleman.</p>
 <p>Although Mo Suqing and Ye Zhongjue had not spoken to each other, they had communicated with their eyes numerous times. Leng Xiyao felt abused like an inferior.</p>
 <p>There was a reason&nbsp;why&nbsp;Ye Zhongjue chose this place to dine. He seldom came to Tianyu Hotel, so there was a good chance he would not be recognized in front of Mo Suqing and, of course, Leng Xiyao.</p>
 <p>When Ye Zhongjue went to fetch the drinks, Leng Xiyao could not hold it any longer. “Suqing, what have you found! It is almost a miracle that you met such a handsome man! I would get myself heartbroken and drunk if I, too, could bump into a guy like that.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing gave her a speechless look. It was a miracle that she had met Ye Zhongjue? There was nothing the girl was afraid to say!</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao’s behavior tonight had earned her multiple imaginary murders, to say it frankly.</p>
 <p>She cast&nbsp;Leng Xiyao a cool glance and said, “Yao, did you forget to take your medicine today?”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao had not yet realized what that meant when Mo Suqing said, “Otherwise, why are you acting like a brat?” Leng Xiyao almost killed her then and there.</p>
 <p>However, she didn’t get to because she saw Ye Zhongjue coming toward them. Instead, her mouth twisted into a weird smile. She leaned closer and whispered, “Suqing, you are dead meat! I’ll settle this with you tomorrow!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue had brought some yogurt drinks&nbsp;and orange juice for them, in case they&nbsp;weren’t used to the&nbsp;other beverages.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao thanked him in good manners and put the juice on the table.</p>
 <p>Their order was being prepared, so the three of them just sat there in silence. It was very awkward.</p>
 <p>Remembering what Mo Suqing had said just now, Leng Xiyao smiled mischievously.</p>
 <p>“Ye Zhongjue, did Suqing tell you that she thinks you are extremely handsome?”</p>
 <p>The calm and cool Ye Zhongjue almost choked&nbsp;when he heard&nbsp;the unexpected question.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing, on the other hand, was trying very hard to steady herself. <em>Damn you, Yao! I would have asked you to go home if I knew what would happen! Can you bring any more shame on me?</em></p>
 <p>She could imagine that after Leng Xiyao left, Ye Zhongjue would probably stare at her and say, <em>Your friend is a nutcase.</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing covered her face with one hand hopelessly, not wanting to reveal her twisted expression.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue cleared his throat and replied, “Well, no she didn’t.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao was surprised. <em>What the…? Can you be any&nbsp;</em><em>more dull</em><em>?</em></p>
 <p>The dinner came to an end after all kinds of horrors.</p>
 <p>Upon leaving the hotel, Ye Zhongjue offered to drive Leng Xiyao home. However, she firmly declined.</p>
 <p>She had returned to her normal self and was no longer kidding when she said, “Ye Zhongjue, after my close observation this evening, I declare now: you really are perfect for my Suqing.” What she didn’t say out loud was, <em>You were both extremely cool and calm!</em></p>
 <p>“That said…” Leng Xiyao continued, ignoring Mo Suqing’s fierce glare. “Suqing is a sensitive girl. If you don’t treat her well, I will hunt you down and beat you up! There are plenty of good men out there, and I will not allow you to hurt her! She will probably&nbsp;do better being hurt by another…”</p>
 <p>“Yao!” Mo Suqing interrupted her. They did not consume any alcohol tonight, but somehow the girl was on fire, blurting out all kinds of stuff like when she was drunk!</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue just looked at Leng Xiyao, expressionless. Leng Xiyao waved her hand, dismissing Mo Suqing. “Don’t interrupt me. I wasn’t finished!”</p>
 <p>She turned to Ye Zhongjue again and said, “In short, you hurt her in any way and I’ll kill you!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was speechless. <em>Yao, are you a ruffian or what? Did you really say ‘I’ll kill you’?&nbsp;</em>She covered her face, feeling ashamed.</p>
 <p>However, Ye Zhongjue’s reaction was characteristically minimal. He said calmly, “I will never hurt her!”</p>
 <p>His tone was light but firm. Mo Suqing’s heart missed a beat. <em>Did he just make a vow to her?</em></p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao stared at him for a whole three seconds before her face beamed with pleasure. “Good! Don’t give me a ride; I can go home by myself.”</p>
 <p>She went to the truck and took out her bags.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked at Mo Suqing, as if inquiring, <em>Is it okay to let her go home by herself?</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing knew Leng Xiyao very well. All these years they had known each other, the girl never once invited anyone to her house, let alone asking or allowing anyone to take her home.</p>
 <p>She shook her head. “That’s fine. She doesn’t like to be taken home.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao did not want anyone to know anything about her family. Mo Suqing understood it very well and never felt that because they were good friends, she had a right to pry into her privacy.</p>
 <p>She knew that Yao would tell her when she&nbsp;was ready.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao hailed a taxi and left Ye Zhongjue and Mo Suqing. Ye Zhongjue said, “You have a very loving friend. I can see how much she cares about you.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing nodded; she knew it too.</p>
 <p>Although it seemed they were bickering and making fun of each other all the time, their friendship was stronger than most people. She was always aware of how much Yao cared about her.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go home now.”</p>
 <p>This simple declaration warmed Mo Suqing considerably. Suddenly, she thought about hugging him. And she put her thought into action.</p>
 <p>To Ye Zhongjue’s surprise, she hugged him.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue sighed contentedly and hugged her back.</p>
 <p>An attractive man and a lovely woman, embracing each other on the street amid the busy traffic. What a beautiful picture. It was so peaceful and heartwarming that passersby kept casting backward glances at them.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing blushed a little and punched Ye Zhongjue on the chest.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. People are watching us.”</p>
 <p>She barely finished her sentence when a woman turned her head to their direction. Ye Zhongjue glared at her in return.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing watched him, speechless. She had not known he was not only cool and domineering, seemingly austere and distant, but also quite childish.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing hurriedly grabbed his arm and pulled him over to the car. <em>God! How humiliating! It is already inappropriate and unbecoming of them to cuddle in a public place. He really shouldn’t have glared at someone who stared!</em></p>
 <p>Back in the car, Ye Zhongjue looked as if he would like to say, <em>Why did you pull me away?</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing did not know what to say. <em>Can we be any more disgraced?</em></p>
 <p>She suddenly felt the man in front of her was more and more adorable.</p>
 <p>Back to the apartment, Ye Zhongjue carried the shopping bags upstairs. Mo Suqing helped him open the door.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue walked over to the sofa and put everything down.</p>
 <p>His eyes fixed on something unusual. <em>Wasn’t she shopping for her own clothes for the upcoming change of season? Why is there men’s clothing?</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue opened the bag with the haberdashery’s logo on it and took a peek. It was a black overcoat.</p>
 <p>He pondered for a moment before putting the coat back in the bag as if nothing had happened.</p>
 <p>When Mo Suqing emerged from the bathroom after taking a shower, she found Ye Zhongjue working on his laptop on the sofa.</p>
 <p>Sometimes she had a feeling that he was busier than those big bosses.</p>
 <p>“Still working? You must be very tired now. Why don’t you go take a shower?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing asked while drying her hair.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked up from his computer. Slowly, he stood up and took her hair dryer, his eyes never leaving hers.</p>
 <p>“Come here.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing looked at him and then at the hair dryer. <em>D</em><em>oes</em><em>&nbsp;he want to dry my hair? But&nbsp;</em><em>does</em><em>&nbsp;he know how?</em></p>
 <p>He had a nobility look about him, which made her doubt his ability to blow-dry someone’s hair.</p>
 <p>Drying hair was easy enough for his own short hair. However, hers was pretty long. It would hurt a lot if it got tangled up!</p>
 <p>Guessing the reason for her hesitation, Ye Zhongjue said reassuringly, “I’ll be very gentle.”</p>
 <p>“Are you sure?” Mo Suqing looked at him suspiciously. Inwardly, she was once again surprised to find how easily he saw through her mind every time.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue nodded, not at all knowing what she was thinking.</p>
 <p>After some consideration, Mo Suqing decided to let him do it, not wanting to discourage him.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue turned on the hair dryer and gently combed Mo Suqing’s black long hair. He was very careful with every lock, so as not to hurt her.</p>
 <p>From time to time, his eyes kept drifting over to the bag on the sofa.</p>
 <p>Finally, he asked, as nonchalantly as he could, “Do you have anything you want to tell me?”</p>
 <p>Maybe it was because Ye Zhongjue was too gentle, Mo Suqing found herself starting to drift off. Therefore, she did not quite get her head around his question.</p>
 <p>“Ah!” she exclaimed. Ye Zhongjue’s hand jerked, hurting Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing cried out. Ye Zhongjue looked at her in embarrassment. He seemed to be terribly sorry for her and there was a faint sadness on his face.</p>
 <p>“Do you… not have anything you want to tell me?” His look became serious, his eyes as deep and unfathomable as a cold lake.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing seemed to be a little taken aback. After considering for a moment, she said, “Well… thank you for treating Yao to dinner tonight?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue gave her an exasperated look. <em>Am I the kind of man who would ask for gratitude for a meal?</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue felt sulky. <em>Apparently the overcoat is not for me! That’s why she doesn’t not have anything to tell me.</em></p>
 <p><em>However… if it is not for me, whom is it for?</em></p>
 <p><em>Gu Jiannan?&nbsp;</em>At the thought of it, Ye Zhongjue’s face darkened. He felt like killing someone right about now.</p>
