 <p>“Hey, it’s me!” Mo Suqing spoke in a low voice after casting a glance at the man across from her.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao was filled with energy in an instant. Her voice went up several decibels, “Suqing! Where have you been? Why didn’t you come to work today? Where are you?”</p>
 <p>There was distress, accusation and&nbsp;concern&nbsp;in her voice.</p>
 <p>“Last night… Well, I’ll tell you about it later. Did you tell our boss I took a day off?”</p>
 <p>“Of course!” Leng Xiyao replied promptly. “So where are you? What is with the hem and haw? Talk like a normal person!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing paused a moment. Sooner or later, she would tell Leng Xiyao everything. There was no need for any delay. “Yao, I got married. I’m having lunch with my… husband.”</p>
 <p><em>Hmm, that was not bad</em>, Mo Suqing concluded with self-approval.</p>
 <p>Upon hearing the word “husband,” Ye Zhongjue’s smile broadened.</p>
 <p>“You what? You got married!” shouted Leng Xiyao and Mo Suqing almost went deaf. “Talk about speed-marriage!”</p>
 <p>She looked at the man across from her, embarrassed. He must have heard their conversation with that smile on the corner of his mouth.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing said, exasperated, “Are you trying to impair my hearing? I’ll explain everything in detail next time I see you. Keep it a secret for now, okay?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing finished speaking and&nbsp;hung&nbsp;up the phone.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue studied her, seeming to laugh but not quite. His expression was placid and mysterious and hard to read.</p>
 <p>Somehow, Mo Suqing felt helplessly exposed in front of him.</p>
 <p>“Why are you looking at me like that?” asked Mo Suqing uneasily while handing his phone back to him.</p>
 <p>“Your friend… is cute…” Ye Zhongjue provided her with an irrelevant answer.</p>
 <p>“What the…” Mo Suqing looked at him stupidly, not really getting it.</p>
 <p>“But of course… you are&nbsp;even cuter!” Ye Zhongjue continued playfully.</p>
 <p>After a while, Mo Suqing realized what had happened. He was flirting with her! Mo Suqing opened her mouth foolishly.&nbsp;The simplicity and innocence shown&nbsp;on her pretty face&nbsp;made&nbsp;her even more attractive.</p>
 <p><em>Did he just utter a pick-up line?</em></p>
 <p><em>How could he flirt so calmly and composedly?</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s reaction pleased Ye Zhongjue a great deal. He picked up the chopsticks as if nothing had happened.</p>
 <p>“The dishes are here. Let’s dig in!”</p>
 <p>“Okay…” Mo Suqing nodded obediently, then she stopped talking and began to eat.</p>
 <p>Surprise flashed through Ye Zhongjue’s eyes.&nbsp;<em>So obedient?</em></p>
 <p>He liked it!</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue started to eat too, feeling content.</p>
 <p>After lunch, Ye Zhongjue dropped her off near her family’s villa.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing glanced at him, a little uneasily. She hadn’t told Ye Zhongjue anything about her family. She didn’t think he would care if he knew.</p>
 <p>Never mind. She would tell him about it at a later time. Besides, he must have sensed something.</p>
 <p>After all, this was an affluent neighborhood.</p>
 <p>“So… I’ll go and bring my luggage here…” Mo Suqing said unhappily.</p>
 <p>“Sure.” Ye Zhongjue replied flatly, without emotions.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing pondered for a moment. Then, she got off the car, still not saying anything regarding her family.</p>
 <p>When Mo Suqing entered the house, Bai Lian was watching some health and lifestyle show on the sofa.</p>
 <p>Seeing that it was Mo Suqing, she remarked unusually tartly, “Returning&nbsp;home&nbsp;twice&nbsp;in a day? That’s new.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was used to her acid tongue.&nbsp;In front of her father, she had always pretended to be a good loving wife. Yet, when it was just the two of them, she was harsh and unkind.</p>
 <p>There was nothing more capable of changing than this woman’s expression, she thought.</p>
 <p>But then she told herself that she would only come back here once in a while after today. She would not be roused by this woman now.</p>
 <p>So, Mo Suqing just shot Bai Lian a cold look before saying, “Aren’t you exhausted from all the pretentiousness?”</p>
 <p>Then, she quickly went upstairs without looking back.</p>
 <p>Bai Lian was still trying to devise a brilliant retort when Mo Suqing disappeared at the corner.</p>
 <p>She reminded herself that Mo Zhenfeng was right upstairs and swallowed what she was going to say back down. Her whole face went livid with suppressed rage.</p>
 <p>She threw the remote on the sofa and sat there fuming.</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian walked into the house in a brisk stride, humming to herself.</p>
 <p>She was clearly&nbsp;in a very good mood!</p>
 <p>But, when she entered the living room and saw an infuriated Bai Lian, she quickly went to her and asked, “Mom, what is the matter? Why are you so angry?”</p>
 <p>Bai Lian saw her daughter asking and immediately acted like someone had done her a great wrong, “Who else&nbsp;other&nbsp;than that wretched Mo Suqing? First it was the mother who abused me for so long, and now that she’s finally dead, it’s the daughter’s turn to domineer. Why do I deserve this kind of treatment?”</p>
 <p>Pure malice crossed Mo Sulian’s face. It was that Mo Suqing again. Did she think she would continue living happily?</p>
 <p>Ha! Mo Sulian sneered inwardly. Soon, she would let her know what it was like to be a failure.</p>
 <p>She spoke softly, “Mom, don’t be mad. Mo Suqing won’t be able to have her way for much longer. Let me tell you something…”</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian whispered her recent doings into Bai Lian’s ear with the proudest expression on her face.</p>
