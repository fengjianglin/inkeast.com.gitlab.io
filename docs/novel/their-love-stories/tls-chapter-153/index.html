<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">When An Huilin and Jian Jie were leaving, Mo Suqing saw Leng Xiyao raise her head to look at the both of them smugly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Sudden realization hit Mo Suqing. All of this was planned by Yao.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Yao was an innocent princess, but she had never let others trample over her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Whatever happened today was a lesson for An Huilin and Jian Jie. She did not want to see Jian Jie either, her relationship with Ye Zhongjue seemed too complicated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">After Jian Jie and An Huilin left, Leng Xiyao looked up at Mo Suqing, blinking slyly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing smiled and went upstairs, not wanting to disturb the other two.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao looked at Leng Haoyun’s chilly side profile, looking like someone owed him millions of dollars. She secretly stuck her tongue out at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun suddenly spoke, “Don’t do that next time, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Ah!” Leng Xiyao flinched in shocked, sucking in a breath of air in pain as she hit her hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun looked at her hand in concern, his tone serious as he said, “Don’t move!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao stuck her tongue out again, but remained silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun spoke after a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Just come to me if anything happens in future. You can just tell me if there’s anything making you unhappy, don’t use such methods to hurt yourself and to draw my attention. I’d go crazy if you were really hurt...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">There was a gloomy aura around Leng Haoyun as he finished.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao kept quiet. She did not know what to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Although Leng Haoyun had spoiled her, she was still rather afraid of him. She would just lose her temper in the past if she was upset, or if she wanted anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">But since her uncle slapped her, and after she pretended to get amnesia, she did not want to go back to being like her past self. She felt that he would simply continue treating her like a spoiled brat if she went back to her old ways.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">What she wanted was a secret that could never be known.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao turned away in silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun was flustered at this. He asked, “Did you remember something, Yao?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Her hand made Leng Xiyao grimace in pain. She calmed herself down and looked at Leng Haoyun with a pair of innocent eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“What are you talking about, Uncle? What happened in the past? Could you tell me about it? What was I like in the past?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun was at a loss for words once he saw those gleaming eyes of hers squinting in an expectant smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He looked at her hands, carefully applying the ice again, speaking in a low tone, “It doesn’t matter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao heaved a sigh of relief.<em> Phew! Uncle almost found out. If he knew that she remembered what happened in the past and how he had slapped her, would he still be able to face himself?</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao did not know if he could, and she did not dare ask him either. She was afraid that his answer would make her even more upset.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She admitted to herself that she was really cowardly in front of Leng Haoyun. She did not dare to fight for what she wanted, she did not dare say a thing. She could only act like a child who only knew how to throw tantrums.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">But she did not know what she should do either.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao bit her lip and looked up at Leng Haoyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Uncle, I’ll head upstairs first. Suqing will be bored alone!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao made her escape quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun’s gaze deepened as he looked at her. How he wished he could spend the rest of his life with her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">……</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu headed to the hospital immediately after leaving the Leng’s villa.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He was summoned by Gu Yi’an before he could visit Ye Zhongjue.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu was nervous as he looked at the grave expression on Gu Yi’an.<em> Was Leng Xiyao not Anne? Why would Gu Yi’an have such an expression?</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“How are the results, Yi’an? Let me see the report!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Instead of handing the report over to Ceng Hanyu, Gu Yi’an shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“It’s no hurry. I have three questions for you before I give you the report. If Leng Xiyao really is Anne, would you tell her the truth, or would you tell Leng Haoyun about it? Secondly, what would you do if she isn’t Anne? Lastly, would you take her away if she really is Anne?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu’s arm that was originally reaching for the report froze in midair. He looked at Gu Yi’an for a while before retracting his arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He did not expect these questions from Gu Yi’an. Gu Yi’an was very aloof, and it was difficult to discern his thoughts. But he knew that Gu Yi’an was very concerned when Ye Zhongjue got hurt and when Sin Eliminators had to evacuate.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He knew that Gu Yi’an cared deeply about him and Ye Zhongjue. But he still had not decided what to do about this matter with Anne.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu lowered his head to think with furrowed brows. It was after quite a while before he looked up at Gu Yi’an again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Yi’an, I may not have decided on my course of actions, but believe me when I say I’ll handle it properly. I won’t let you worry anymore. Jue is awake now, and I promise nothing like this will happen again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He paused for a moment before continuing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Actually, I have asked myself the same questions. You know that I’ve been looking for her all these years. Now that we have a slight clue, I really wish it was her. I think you understand this well. As long as she is Anne, I don’t really care about anything else. I’d respect her wishes too. If she wants to leave, then I’d do my utmost to take her away. Do you understand, Yi’an?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Gu Yi’an nodded slowly before handing the report to Ceng Hanyu.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Take a look. I’ll make a move first. I need to settle some matters at the hospital.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu nodded as he took the report in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He had already guessed the result from their conversation and from how Gu Yi’an behaved. But he still had to see it with his own eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu almost cried tears of joy when he saw the positive result on the last page.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He was wrought with emotion as he clutched the report tightly. Anne, his Anne, his fiancee. He had finally found her after so long.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu walked to Ye Zhongjue’s hospital room with the report in hand, wanting to share his immense joy with someone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Happiness emanated from him as he stepped into the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">One look at him and Ye Zhongjue could already tell what was up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He looked at Ceng Hanyu calmly as he asked, “Leng Xiyao is Anne?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">His tone was full of warmth, happy that this close friend had finally found his fiancee.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He was happy for Ceng Hanyu.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu was too emotional to even speak. He simply nodded vigorously with the report still in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“When are you planning to reveal it to her? Or should I be asking when you are planning to let Old Man An meet her? The old man is getting on in years.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu calmed down a little at the mention of An Zhenguo. He was sure that the old man is anxious to know about the results of the report.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He took a deep breath before answering.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“She’s been in a rather bad mood recently. I’ll wait until you’re better, before letting… before getting Sis-in-law to bring her out. Let’s all meet up. I want to drop a few hints first. I’ll be informing the old man soon, and I’ll tell him my thoughts. Anne hasn’t been living with us for all this time, so it would probably be difficult for her to accept the truth immediately. I’ll give her time to digest it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ye Zhongjue nodded. “That’s good. You just said you wanted to get Suqing to bring her out. You just went to see Suqing right? How’s her mood today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">There was a subtle change in Ceng Hanyu’s expression, and he looked at Ye Zhongjue hesitantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“What’s wrong? It’s fine, just say whatever you have to!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“She said her head’s in a mess right now and she wanted some time alone. She asked us not to bother her, and then...” Ceng Hanyu stole a glance at Ye Zhongjue, making the latter frown.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Then what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Then, she headed for the Leng’s villa. She said she wanted to stay with Anne for a few days. Don’t worry, I’ve already ordered some men to keep an eye on them. They will be safe even if they leave the house. Those are the top-tier agents from Sin Eliminators, and they’re probably cussing at you right now! Relegating them to mere security personnel!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu laughed after he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ye Zhongjue looked slightly displeased. “Why does it look like you’re gloating over this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“I’m definitely not!” Ceng Hanyu raised both of his hands in an attempt to defend himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ye Zhongjue leaned back in his bed, not speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Right at this moment, Ceng Hanyu’s mobile phone rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">His brows started creasing as he listened to the person on the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu was unsure if he should inform Ye Zhongjue about what the agents had just communicated over the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He might get too agitated if he learns about it. When that happens, Gu Yi’an will chide him for not taking good care of Ye Zhongjue again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">But if he keeps this a secret, he would probably never hear the end of it from Ye Zhongjue after he recovers.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Both of these guys were not to be trifled with. He suddenly felt like a very pitiful soul stuck between them.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Looking at Ceng Hanyu’s expression, Ye Zhongjue regarded him morosely.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“What’s going on? Can you be more normal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Don’t get too agitated at what I’m about to say!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ye Zhongjue stared at him as he spoke with a steady voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Okay, say it! I get it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Well… the agent keeping tabs on Sis-in-law said she went out with Anne earlier, but they met Jian Jie and An Huilin. I don’t know what they said to Sis-in-law, but her mood suddenly took a turn for the worse...”</span></p>
