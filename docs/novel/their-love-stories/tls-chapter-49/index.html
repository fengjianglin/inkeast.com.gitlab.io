<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Ye Zhongjue smiled. “Then?”</p>
 <p>“Then…” Mo Suqing consulted her memory and replied, “I told her it is impossible. Men’s suits all look the same. She admitted that she might have mistaken yours for something else.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue almost broke into a cold sweat. From now on, he had to pay more attention to what he wore, too. He also needed to prepare a few pieces of clothing for his usual wear in his office. He could not let Mo Suqing find out about his identity.</p>
 <p>He could not say what she would react, how she would see him if she knew.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue chewed a bite of vegetable and the situation over for a while before saying tentatively, “If I become a rich man someday, will you shut me out?”</p>
 <p>Then, he quickly added, “It is a hypothetical question!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing stared at him for a few seconds and burst out laughing.</p>
 <p>“That’s not possible! Stop making unrealistic jokes! You can’t just become a rich man overnight. If it is this easy, everyone in the world is rich. Besides, if you do become rich, it is because you work hard. Why would I shut you out for that? I wouldn’t as long as you are still you.”</p>
 <p>She put a mouthful of meat in her mouth, looking content.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s face showed nothing, but there were heavy clouds in his heart. It looked like Mo Suqing would never consider the possibility. Even though he wanted to help give her some mental preparation, he did not think there was a way.</p>
 <p>In the end, Ye Zhongjue decided to drop it and see what the future held.</p>
 <p>If Lin Ran knew what he was thinking right now, he would most certainly drop his jaws.</p>
 <p>To him, Ye Zhongjue was as mighty as God. He never did anything he had no confidence in achieving. No matter what he did, he did it with a well-thought-out plan.</p>
 <p>In the business world, his quick wit and decisiveness often made it difficult for his opponents to prepare themselves and gain the upper hand. In Lin Ran’s eyes, Ye Zhongjue was powerfully unknowable.</p>
 <p>He was not only capable of running Mighty Empire, but was also able to engage in affairs of the underworld. Lin Ran had never admired someone as much as he did Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was about to comment on something when she suddenly saw Mo Sulian walking into the restaurant.</p>
 <p>Her face showed plain hatred at the sight of her. <em>What a small world. I never expected to see her at lunch.</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue had his back on the entrance to the restaurant and he did not notice the change in Mo Suqing’s expression.</p>
 <p>Therefore, it was too late when he discerned something was wrong. Mo Sulian had already walked over to their table.</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian looked at Mo Suqing proudly and sneered.</p>
 <p>“Look who it is! It’s our great journalist who appeared on the headlines the other day! Your face certainly shows up in newspapers more often than mine, a celebrity.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing lost her appetite all of a sudden.</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian held her head high without giving Ye Zhongjue a single glance. She knew he was a man from behind, but she totally disregarded him.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing looked up right at Mo Sulian, not hiding her hatred at all. “Mo Sulian, I bet your Chinese zodiac is a dog. That’s why you always bark for no reason!”</p>
 <p>At her words, Ye Zhongjue was astonished while Mo Sulian was bristled with anger.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was shocked to hear such venom from Mo Suqing’s mouth. This was completely new to him. In his memory, she was a smart and considerate soul with a kind, gentle heart.</p>
 <p>He would believe it if she said she was an angel lost in the earthly world.</p>
 <p>But right now, she was a hedgehog in danger. To protect herself from getting hurt, she was showing her merciless spines.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, this was not the first time Mo Sulian was mocked by Mo Suqing. However, it was the first time Mo Suqing had done it at a public place at the expense of her own reputation. Mo Sulian had not seen it coming.</p>
 <p>She could still recall the last time when they were in the same room. The other person had only glared at her.</p>
 <p>“You! You…” Mo Sulian pointed at Mo Suqing, but she was too upset to finish her sentence. Her face had turned red like a pig’s liver.</p>
 <p>Then, she suddenly noticed Ye Zhongjue, who was sitting across from Mo Suqing. She gave her an evil look and said, “Mo Suqing, you are surely quick to turn your target to another man after just having a scandal with Guan Zixuan! Aren’t you married? Aren’t you afraid of being busted by your hubby? And you have the cheek to speak ill of me!”</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian finished her abuses. Ye Zhongjue immediately tensed up.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing exclaimed inwardly, <em>Oh no! Ye Zhongjue is obviously angry.</em></p>
 <p>She hadn’t had time to say anything when Ye Zhongjue suddenly stood up. His whole person was radiating with an intimidating vibe.</p>
 <p>He stared at Mo Sulian as if she was dead meat already, his expression tinged with fury.</p>
 <p>“Watch your mouth when you talk to her, unless you want to die here!”</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian was spellbound the moment Ye Zhongjue turned his head towards her.</p>
 <p>She was so stunned that she didn’t catch what he was saying.</p>
 <p>She just stared at him, enraptured by the most good-looking man she had ever seen.</p>
 <p>His arrogant and dictator-like air; his noble and graceful quality; his cool and unruffled demeanor; his outstanding look – it was such a charming and irresistible combination that Mo Sulian could not help but sink right into it.</p>
 <p>She felt she was head over heels in love with this man in an instant.</p>
 <p>She was full of regret. She should have taken a good look at him before blurting out those words. Now she must have made a very bad first impression on him. <em>But that’s okay</em>, she thought. <em>I am confident I can correct this.</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing and Gu Jiannan had been a happy couple, too, before she decided to break them up.</p>
 <p>When they were growing up, Mo Suqing had always been the prettier one. That was why she had worked so hard to get herself into the entertainment industry. Although she had never been a well-known superstar, at least she could count herself as a TV personality.</p>
 <p>She clenched her fists. <em>Why? Why can Mo Suqing have such an excellent man? I must snatch him from her!</em></p>
 <p>At the thought, Mo Sulian quickly concealed the enraptured expression on her face.</p>
 <p>She smiled sweetly at Ye Zhongjue and purred, “Oh I’m so sorry. I didn’t know you two are having lunch! We are sisters and like to bicker to show our affection to each other. Our squabbles are actually an enhancer to our relationship!”</p>
 <p>Then, she batted her eyes at Ye Zhongjue several times.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing looked away, disgusted. <em>There are always shameless people in the world! How can she tell such lies without blushing at all?</em></p>
 <p>Well, she was an actress. Of course she could change her expression immediately.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was eager to get away from Mo Sulian. He could see that Mo Suqing was not at all happy to see her sister.</p>
 <p>He said coolly, “Just to let you know, I am Mo Suqing’s husband!”</p>
 <p>Then, he took Mo Suqing’s hand and led her out of the restaurant.</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian was utterly speechless. <em>What? He is Mo Suqing’s husband? How is it possible</em><em>?</em><em>&nbsp;</em>She couldn’t believe that after she lost Gu Jiannan, Mo Suqing had somehow located another, more brilliant man.</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian was dumbstruck by the news.</p>
 <p>She stood on the same spot for a long while, gritting her teeth. She could not believe how lucky Mo Suqing was. She was so angry!</p>
 <p>After Mo Suqing and Ye Zhongjue had left for a long time, Mo Sulian finally calmed herself down and was not as overwhelmed as before.</p>
 <p>She had been working nearby today. To be honest, the role she played was very small. In fact, to say it was small was an understatement; it was as insignificant as an extra.</p>
 <p>She had come to the restaurant for lunch. She had already felt like a fool standing there with the other cast.</p>
 <p>However, little had she expected she would bump into Mo Suqing and, more importantly, her husband.</p>
 <p>After she had got a grip on herself, Mo Sulian remembered that Bai Tingnan had told her that Mo Suqing’s husband was just a penniless lad who worked as a regular office worker.</p>
 <p>Even so, Mo Sulian still could not get Ye Zhongjue out of her mind. She had not known there was such a handsome man in the world. Although she had seen a lot of cute guys in the entertainment industry, she did not think any of them were comparable to him.</p>
 <p>Resentful at Mo Suqing’s luck, she was keen on finding a way to come between those two. She was practically drooling over the beauty of Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>For her, if a man could be described as “beautiful,” it meant that he was good-looking in the extreme.</p>
 <p>Then, her face broke into a grin.</p>
 <p>She could trick them into the Mo’s villa, and see how things go from there.</p>
 <p>Since there was no need to put it off, Mo Sulian quickly fished for her cell phone and called Mo Zhenfeng.</p>
 <p>“Daddy!” said Mo Sulian in her sweetest tone. Anyone who heard it would have goose bumps all over.</p>
 <p>Mo Zhenfeng had always favored Mo Sulian more than his other daughter. He preferred the former’s sweetness to the latter’s stubbornness.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong, Sulian? Anything you want to tell me?”</p>
 <p>“I saw Suqing today!” Mo Sulian said with a malicious twinkle in her eye.</p>
 <p>“Okay…” Hearing his elder daughter’s name, Mo Zhenfeng’s tone changed. Not long before, she had helped his company survive a major crisis. However, when he called her to express his gratitude, she had been distant. He had not called her since then.</p>
 <p>“So how is she?” Mo Zhenfeng asked casually.</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian feigned stammering in a hesitant tone, “I don’t know if… if I should tell you or not… Well, this is not going to please you.”</p>
 <p>Mo Zhenfeng sighed. “Just tell me what it is. I’m used to hearing her bad news anyway.”</p>
 <p>Mo Zhenfeng’s voice was full of melancholy.</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian, sensing it was the right moment, hastened to tell him everything with a lot of embellishments.</p>
 <p>“Dad, here’s the thing. The other day, a good friend of mine… Her name is Bai Tingnan, whom you have met when she came to our house and who works in the same company as Suqing. She told me Suqing got married. The whole company knows. I feared you might get angry, so I dared not tell you about it.”</p>
 <p>“What?” Mo Zhenfeng raised his voice involuntarily.</p>
 <p>Come to think of it, he remembered that Mo Suqing had asked for her household register not long before, saying that she was moving out and needed it. He had not thought twice about it and given it to her.</p>
 <p>Now he knew she must have taken the household register to get married.</p>
 <p>Mo Zhenfeng almost forgot how to breathe. <em>Such an unfilial daughter I have!</em></p>
 <p>No wonder she abhorred the idea of his arranging a matchmaking dinner for her. He took a deep breath and asked, “And then what happened?”</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian quickly added fuel to the flames, “Today, I saw her having lunch with her husband, who is a common office worker. I told her she should come home with her husband and meet you, but she flew into a temper and hurled abuse at me.”</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian was very good at making herself sound pitiful.</p>
 <p>Her voice even broke a little when she continued, “Daddy, if you want to meet the guy, you could ask her to bring him home. Anyway, they have got married behind your back. What’s done is done, it’s too late to do anything about it.”</p>
