 <p>The recorded voice from the other end of the line said, “The number you have dialed has been disconnected or is no longer in service…”</p>
 <p>After hanging up, he grew restless. He went to Moments on WeChat and found that Mo Suqing had just shared an update a few minutes ago.</p>
 <p>After reading it, he finally understood why Mo Suqing had been in such a bad mood.</p>
 <p>Her update read, “The perfume was faint, but I smelt it; the lipstick stain was light, but I saw it. I feel so sad, but I don’t know why…”</p>
 <p>When Ye Zhongjue finished reading it, he knew two things: First, Mo Suqing was sulking because of Song Pingting’s lipstick mark; second, it showed that she might have some feelings for him.</p>
 <p><em>Can I safely conclude that she is jealous?</em></p>
 <p>At the thought, Ye Zhongjue picked up his car keys and headed to the headquarters of Trend Magazine.</p>
 <p>However, when he arrived there, the security told him that everyone had&nbsp;already&nbsp;got off work. Moreover, Mo Suqing and Leng Xiyao had left before everyone else.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue wanted to talk to her but didn’t even know where she had gone.</p>
 <p>He called her again, but it went to voicemail right away.</p>
 <p>In the end, he went back home to wait for her. Two hours passed, and Mo Suqing still hadn’t come home.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue considered sending someone to look for her, but it was very likely that his true identity would come out. She finally had some feelings for him. The last thing he wanted to do was to drive her away.</p>
 <p>All he could do now was to wait patiently.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><strong>In the pub August Hasn’t Ended Yet.</strong></p>
 <p>Two pretty women sat at the bar. One had an innocent face and the other had an aloof expression.</p>
 <p>They drank one glass after the other, as if they needed to drown their sadness.</p>
 <p>Yes, they were no one else but Leng Xiyao and Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>Although Leng Xiyao had said she was just helping Mo Suqing forget about the whole thing, she actually drank more beer than her.</p>
 <p>She herself was in a gloomy mood, too. As a matter of fact, her every smile had been forced recently.</p>
 <p>No one knew about it, but ever since she found out that her uncle and An Huilin were old friends, she had been very unhappy.</p>
 <p>They were two dejected women who had come to the pub to drink their sorrows away.</p>
 <p>At a table not far from the bar, a couple of men were chilling out with beautiful women around them. One of them was leaning against the sofa lazily, looking carefree.</p>
 <p>The others kept paying compliments and giving flatteries to him.</p>
 <p>Presently, one of them addressed him, saying, “Mr. Ceng, what do you think about the two women over there?”</p>
 <p>Indeed, the man sitting on the middle of the sofa was Ceng Hanyu.</p>
 <p>He turned his seductive eyes towards Mo Suqing and Leng Xiyao at the bar.</p>
 <p>All he could see was one side of Mo Suqing’s face and the back of Leng Xiyao.</p>
 <p>He chuckled, sounding charming and elegant. “What do I think about them? But they have nothing to do with me!”</p>
 <p>The man who had spoken looked crestfallen. He had heard that Ceng Hanyu was difficult to please, but this he had not expected. He had said something that had meant well, but somehow the other man’s response was cryptic.</p>
 <p>He laughed nervously and said, “Right, of course you are right…”</p>
 <p>At that moment, a burly, dark-skinned man with three followers tagging behind approached Mo Suqing and Leng Xiyao. He had the most obscene smile on his face.</p>
 <p>He put a hand on Mo Suqing’s shoulder, startling her. Mo Suqing stood up and looked at him warily.</p>
 <p>“What are you doing?” she demanded.</p>
 <p>Seeing that she had a stunning face, the man’s eyes sparkled. He had expected her to be average-looking before she had turned around. However, it looked like he was in luck!</p>
 <p>“What am I doing?” he chuckled disgustingly. “Beauty, you should have asked what I <em>would like</em> to do!”</p>
 <p>Perplexed, Mo Suqing frowned. “What would you like to do then?”</p>
 <p>The man came a step closer. He had barely touched her chin when Mo Suqing shrank away.</p>
 <p>“I clearly want to… do things to you!” he said in a lewd voice.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s face darkened. She hadn’t expected to bump into a bunch of ruffians in the pub.</p>
 <p>One of the man’s followers said, “Chick, you are fortunate to be favored by my brother. How dare you shrank from him!”</p>
 <p>Then, he extended his hand to grab her arm.</p>
 <p>The burly man stopped him. “Hey, what are you doing? We have to be gentle to beautiful women. Someone as crude as you would never give them a good impression. We want to conquer their hearts as well as their bodies, understand?”</p>
 <p>His follower nodded his head in agreement.</p>
 <p>Listening to their conversation, Mo Suqing felt she could not endure it anymore. However, just when she was about to say something, Leng Xiyao, who had been drinking quietly, stood up all of a sudden.</p>
 <p>She looked straight at the burly man in the eye and smiled eerily.</p>
 <p>“Oh? So this is what you would like to do to us…”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao’s voice, bewitching, aroused the burly man. But somehow, he was also afraid of her.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing looked around and frowned. People had gathered around them, but no one was coming to their rescue.</p>
 <p>“Isn’t he Black Dragon – the most respectable gangster in the area?” one of the onlookers whispered.</p>
 <p>“You bet your ass he is! They are going to succumb to him tonight!”</p>
 <p>Overhearing their talk, Mo Suqing’s face darkened even further. No wonder everyone just stood there and watched. It was because they didn’t want to have anything to do with the man.</p>
 <p>She saw that there was something wrong with Leng Xiyao, but when she realized what it was, it was too late.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao scooped up a beer bottle and swung it at the face of the burly man, or Black Dragon.</p>
 <p>The bottle shattered on impact. Before anyone could do anything, a string of blood began to flow freely from his temple.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was shocked, but the spectators were horrified. No one had expected Leng Xiyao to do such a violent act.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing knew they were in big trouble now. She tugged at Leng Xiyao, wanting to take flight.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, Leng Xiyao was having none of it.</p>
 <p>She sneered at Black Dragon contemptuously and teased, “What are you gonna do now, huh? That’s right, I just fucking hit you on the face! Let me tell you something, if you dare lay a finger on me… you are going to die a violent death! Your body will be thrown away like trash and you probably won’t even know how you die, either.”</p>
 <p>Everyone present, including Black Dragon and his followers, was awed into silence by her frightening threat.</p>
 <p>No one said anything while Leng Xiyao glared at Black Dragon as if she would like to tear him up into shreds.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing knew well that two women could never beat four strong men. They were at a distinct disadvantage.</p>
 <p>She started to drag Leng Xiyao away while everyone hadn’t got time to react. “Yao, let’s go!”</p>
 <p>At first, Black Dragon just stood there and let the blood gush from his temple, not sure what to do.</p>
 <p>He had never been treated like this before in this part of A&nbsp;City.</p>
 <p>However, what if it was not just an idle threat from a girl? What if he took revenge and did offend someone he shouldn’t have offended? That wouldn’t do.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao’s tone was too arrogant and confident to be faked.</p>
 <p>It gave Black Dragon the shivers and prevented him from acting.</p>
 <p>However, now he saw the two women were going to run away, he sprang into action.</p>
 <p><em>I don’t care! She’s just bluffing!</em></p>
 <p>He rushed forward and grabbed Mo Suqing’s hair to drag her back.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing felt like her hair was going to be separated from her scalp. Meanwhile, Leng Xiyao looked over her shoulder and saw Black Dragon’s savage face.</p>
 <p>Sobering up all of a sudden, she cried out, “Suqing!”</p>
 <p>She turned around to confront Black Dragon.</p>
 <p>“Let her go! Otherwise, you are going to regret&nbsp;it!” she commanded.</p>
 <p>Black Dragon sneered, not at all disturbed.</p>
 <p>“Drop it! I am not afraid of you! You can stop your fucking bluffing now. It’s not gonna work on me! Do you have any idea who I am? Do you really think you can dupe me into believing you with such an absurd lie?”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao, seeing that threatening alone was not enough, started to make the call with her phone in the pocket.</p>
 <p>Black Dragon glowered at Leng Xiyao and began to waver. She was way too calm.</p>
 <p><em>Have I made a mistake?</em></p>
 <p>“Hey, she’s making a call!” one of his followers warned.</p>
 <p>Black Dragon flew into a rage at this. He assumed that Leng Xiyao was calling the police.</p>
 <p>“Catch her!” he yelled. “You fucking chick, how dared you call the police in front of me!”</p>
 <p>Two of his followers each grabbed one of Leng Xiyao’s arms. Then, Black Dragon snatched the phone out of her hand and threw it down on the floor.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao panicked. She had called her uncle just now, but she doubted he would be here anytime soon.</p>
 <p>And now, Black Dragon was desperate because he thought she had called the police!</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao struggled to free herself, but she was not strong enough to get rid of the two men.</p>
 <p>Seeing that the situation was getting out of control, some of those who had been with Ceng Hanyu became antsy.</p>
 <p>After all, they were all gentlemen by heart. They couldn’t just sit there and watch two women get hurt.</p>
 <p>However, Ceng Hanyu raised his hand to stop them from doing anything.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a wail and a cry came one after the other. It turned out Leng Xiyao had stamped on the two men’s feet in quick succession, forcing them to loosen their grip on her to rub their feet.</p>
 <p>She had summoned up all her strength. Their feet were going to hurt for a very long time.</p>
 <p>Then, she threw caution to the wind and picked up another bottle on the table nearby and swung it at Black Dragon.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Mo Suqing elbowed him in the stomach and gave his private parts a hard kick.</p>
