<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu kept his eyes on Ye Zhongjue as he finished what he had to say, afraid that the latter would do something dangerous in his condition.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">To Ceng Hanyu’s relief, Ye Zhongjue looked rather calm, and he did not seem too agitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu laughed dryly as he thought about how he had to go see An Zhenguo later.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Jue, take your time to rest and recover. I’ll go get Yi’an to come over and keep you company. I’ll bring the report to Old Man An, and after you’ve recovered, we’ll go look for Sis-in-law and Anne together!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ye Zhongjue did not answer him. He was simply staring blankly at the air. Ceng Hanyu thought he agreed with the suggestion, so he left to get Gu Yi’an.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu kept reminding Gu Yi’an to keep an eye on Ye Zhongjue, and that he will be back very soon.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Gu Yi’an was in a consultation with a patient currently, so he instructed one of the nurses to go take a look at Ye Zhongjue.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu drove to the An family home with the report.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Zhenguo was reading the newspaper in the yard, with a row of black-clad bodyguards just a few steps away from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He glanced over when he heard the sound of a car, and realized it was Ceng Hanyu’s car. Standing up quickly, he rushed over. He already knew why Ceng Hanyu was here.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">This was the sole reason he decided to stay in A City for so many days.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Nobody else knew how nervous he felt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He was already above sixty. If he still cannot find Anne, he might not be able to see his biological granddaughter ever again in this life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu alighted, walking towards An Zhenguo with the report in hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Zhenguo had a cane in one hand and the newspaper in the other. He looked at Ceng Hanyu expectantly, glancing at the document he was holding.<em> That should be the report.</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“How’re the results?” He asked with trepidation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu supported An Zhenguo’s arm as he nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Calm down, Grandpa An. There’s no mistaking it this time. I’ve seen the results. This is the report, and you can take a closer look. Let’s have a seat over there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“It’s fine, it’s fine!” An Zhenguo waved as tears welled up in his eyes. He had waited so long for this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He let go of his cane and the newspaper, and opened the report with shaking hands. Emotion overwhelmed him as he flipped to the last page to see the result.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu was afraid that the old man would get too emotional, so he tried to support and console him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Grandpa An, now that you’ve seen the results, you don’t have to worry anymore. I’ll let Anne come back to you safely.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Zhenguo nodded with hot tears in his eyes, not wanting to look away from the report.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Regarding Anne, you don’t have to do anything for now. I’m planning to ask her out and drop some hints, so that I can gauge her thoughts about this first. I’m afraid that it might be too shocking for her if I tell her suddenly. Is that okay, Grandpa An?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu asked the old man.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Zhenguo wiped the tears from his eyes and looked into the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“This day has finally come. I’ve dreamt of finding Anne for so long, Hanyu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He patted Ceng Hanyu on the shoulder and said, “I’ll have to trouble you this time! Go ahead quickly with your plan, I’d really like to see Anne soon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Okay!” Ceng Hanyu nodded. “I will, Grandpa An. Please don’t think that you are troubling me at all. Anne is originally my fiancee. I should be doing this in the first place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Zhenguo nodded at him, but before he could give any reply, Ceng Hanyu’s mobile phone rang.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu looked at his phone. It was Gu Yi’an.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Hello, what’s up, Yi’an?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Was Jue still there when you left? I was in a consultation session with a patient, and when I went over, the nurse told me Jue asked her to buy some things, but he disappeared when she returned!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu’s heart sank as he heard this. He knew that Ye Zhongjue would go looking for either Jian Jie or Mo Suqing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">But he was in no condition to do so currently. Why is the man so stubborn!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“I’ll go look for him. Don’t worry, Yi’an. I’ll bring him back to the hospital safe and sound.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu spoke to An Zhenguo after he ended the call. “Grandpa An, I’ll bring Anne to you once I’ve sorted it out. There are some things I have to settle, so I’ll get going first!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Zhenguo nodded as he took in Ceng Hanyu’s uneasy expression. “Go ahead. I’ve already waited for so many years, I can definitely wait for a few more days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu called Mo Suqing immediately once he was in the car. Mo Suqing only answered after quite a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Hello, Sis-in-law. Is Jue with you now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing opened her mouth to speak, acting like a robot devoid of any human emotion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Shouldn’t he be in the hospital? Wherever he is, what has it got to do with me anyway!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu choked at that.<em> Sis-in-law, don’t say that. He’s still your husband. Why be so unfeeling and act like it has nothing to do with you at all?</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><em>Even if you’re planning on getting a divorce, you guys haven’t gotten it yet right?</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Don’t be like this, Sis-in-law. Jue hasn’t totally recovered from his injury...” The gears were turning furiously in Ceng Hanyu’s mind as he tried to think of something effective to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Don’t call me to ask about him in future!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Right after Mo Suqing said that, Ceng Hanyu heard Leng Xiyao’s voice through the phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Suqing, Ye Zhongjue is here. He’s downstairs. Do you want to see him?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu was so happy to hear this. He knew that there was an eighty percent chance that Ye Zhongjue would go looking for Mo Suqing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">The call got cut immediately after Leng Xiyao spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu shook his head. He felt like he was cannon fodder. This was something between Ye Zhongjue and Mo Suqing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">But he resigned himself to his fate as he thought of how close he was with Ye Zhongjue. They were almost like brothers. He then started driving towards the Leng’s villa.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He does not mind being the cannon fodder at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">----</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ye Zhongjue wanted to go upstairs initially, but Leng Haoyun frowned as he eyed Ye Zhongjue’s injury.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“It’ll be better if you wait here. She’ll probably come downstairs if she knows you’re here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ye Zhongjue thought about it for a couple of seconds before he nodded and sat on the sofa.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing was stunned after hearing what Leng Xiyao just said. Why did he come looking for her?</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Based on her estimation, he would have just woken up not long ago. <em>What is he doing in that condition? Is he going to blame me if anything happens to him like this?</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao shook her head when she saw Mo Suqing looking upset and conflicted. <em>Suqing will never be able to leave Ye Zhongjue like this. She just can’t come to terms with his identity overnight, but looking at how she’s acting, it’s obvious that she cares so much about him.</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao said, “Suqing, how about going downstairs first? I heard Uncle say that his injury started bleeding again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">It was no surprise that Mo Suqing immediately left the room after hearing what Leng Xiyao said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao sighed as she looked at Mo Suqing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">It seemed like Ye Zhongjue had become Mo Suqing’s weakness. She cannot remove it or let it go even if he hurts her!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao was rather worried, so she followed Mo Suqing downstairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Once she saw the couple lock eyes with each other, Leng Haoyun pulled her away towards the yard.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao was about to struggle free, but she knew that the couple needed some space, so she quietly followed Leng Haoyun out.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ye Zhongjue felt so sorry as he saw the feeble-looking Mo Suqing. She would not look like this if it were not for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She is pregnant now, and if she was in any other normal family, everyone would be so protective of her. But instead, she had to go through so much with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Not being able to let her meet his parents was already bad enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Now, he is letting her go through all this sadness and pain. He felt bad about everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He is not able to give her the best even when he loves her, but he cannot bear to let go of her either.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He had already decided that she will be his partner no matter what. Noone knew how important she was to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing looked at Ye Zhongjue, his lips pale and his face devoid of color. He remained rooted to the ground beside the sofa, like a statue staring at her, unmoving.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><em>Didn’t he know that he was the person she wished to see the least now?</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Dear...” Ye Zhongjue’s voice was hoarse as he spoke after a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing felt the tears coming as emotion flooded her. Why did he have to call her that?</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She was trying so hard not to cry.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She tried to remain calm and shifted her gaze to look out the window instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“What are you doing here? Also, I’m not your dear!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing sounded so indifferent and unfeeling that Ye Zhongjue frowned when he heard it. Palpable sorrow emanated from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He acted like a whiny child now. “But you’re my wife...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing stared at him in a fit of anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Go call someone else your wife, don’t come to me. I have nothing to do with you now. Didn’t you grow up with Jian Jie? Isn’t she very important to you? Go look for her! Why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing’s emotions were running amok. She could not bear seeing Ye Zhongjue act like a pitiful little puppy in front of her. But the one who is really upset and hurting right now is actually her!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ye Zhongjue stepped forward, attempting to explain himself. However, the movement aggravated his injury and his brows furrowed in pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Dear, it’s not what you think. We aren’t divorced yet, so don’t say things like that. If you think I’m not good enough, I can change for the better, okay? Could you tell me what Jian Jie said to you, if she did? I can explain everything, really. I’m not lying when I say there’s nothing going on between me and her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Concern flashed across Mo Suqing’s eyes when she saw him wincing in pain. She wanted to go to him, but thought better of it when she reminded herself of who he actually is.</span></p>
