<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked at the doctor in disbelief. “What? She’s pregnant?”</p>
 <p>The doctor rolled her eyes at him. “It’s almost two months now. How could you not know this!”</p>
 <p>She then looked at him in a way that seemed to say, <em>I bet you’re one of those unreliable husbands</em>, before saying, “She’s been under a lot of stress and fatigue, and the sudden emotional outburst was an additional trigger for her. Take good care of her especially for the first three months, or else it’s easy for a miscarriage to happen.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was still surprised at the news. He did not think that just one night was enough for a tiny life to be formed.</p>
 <p>He then asked, “Are the baby and my wife fine?”</p>
 <p>“She needs proper rest and it’s best that she doesn’t move around too much. They’re both fine but make sure to take good care of her. I’ll prescribe something that can stabilize the pregnancy. Come with me.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue nodded quickly and turned to Luo Qiqi. “Qiqi, take care of your Sis-in-law. I’ll go get the medicine.”</p>
 <p>A bitter smile appeared on Xia Xinsheng as she watched Ye Zhongjue leave with the doctor. <em>Xinsheng, Xinsheng, but have I really been reborn?</em></p>
 <p>She stopped herself from contacting Mo Suqing all these years, and all the pent-up emotions and guilt flooded her when she saw her daughter again today. <em>It’s my fault. I should never have abandoned her.</em></p>
 <p>Xia Xinsheng buried her face in her hands, unable to come to terms with reality. Luo Qiqi shook her head at this before going in to check on Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing just woke up and the corner of her eyes were still wet from her tears. She tried to get up when she saw Luo Qiqi appear.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi rushed forward to help raise the bed. “Sis-in-law, I’ll help you get anything that you need. Just tell me what you need help with.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing shook her head in confusion. “Qiqi, what happened? Why am I here?”</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi then said, “Sis-in-law, do you know that you’re pregnant for almost two months now? You passed out because you were too tired and that emotional outburst earlier was the trigger.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing held her stomach before staring at Luo Qiqi wide-eyed. “I’m pregnant?”</p>
 <p>“Yes!” Luo Qiqi smiled at her as she nodded.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi suddenly felt a sense of loneliness and a slight envy. <em>If Su Jincheng was still around, would they have children of their own too?&nbsp;</em>Sadness overwhelmed her again as she thought of A’jiu and Xiaoliu.</p>
 <p>She liked children too, but she would probably not have any in this life.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was on a roller coaster ride of emotions. She looked towards the door and asked, “Qiqi, where’s my… my mum?”</p>
 <p>After a moment of contemplation, Luo Qiqi decided to say, “She’s right outside!”</p>
 <p>She was reminded of what Ye Zhongjue said earlier, but she knew very well that her brother was just taking out his anger, and that proved that he cared deeply for Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>No matter what, Mo Suqing was his top priority.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi then asked, “Sis-in-law, do you want me to get her?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing thought for a while before shaking her head. “No, it’s fine!”</p>
 <p><em>Xia Xinsheng never came looking for me so it doesn’t matter. She’s just guilty for all those lost years. She’s guilty that she didn’t do her duties as a mother.&nbsp;</em><em>So what if Luo Qiqi gets her? There’s nothing I have to say to her! That won’t bode well for either of us.</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing did not want to go through the pain of losing a relative again.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi sighed and stayed by her bedside.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue saw Xia Xinsheng waiting at the door when he returned. He knew very well how much Mo Suqing cared for her mother, because she would not have had such an emotional outburst otherwise. <em>So what? Meeting Xia Xinsheng would only hurt her further.</em></p>
 <p>Xia Xinsheng saw him walking over and tried her best to collect herself as she looked up at him. They remained silent for a while before Ye Zhongjue asked, “Do you want to go in and take a look at Suqing?”</p>
 <p>Xia Xinsheng forced herself to smile and said, “It’s fine. She’s not in a good mood and she probably doesn’t want to see me now. You go ahead. I’ll be leaving!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue did not stop her as he entered the room alone.</p>
 <p>What happened today seemed to have shocked everyone greatly.</p>
 <p>Xia Xinsheng never thought that visiting A’zi would allow her to meet her daughter, Mo Suqing, after nine years.</p>
 <p>She also knew that she had not been very nice to Xia Zi in the past, and that made her feel even more sorry. She did all that for Guan Zixuan, but the reality was that she had let her own daughter down.</p>
 <p>She felt extremely guilty for having left Mo Suqing nine years ago, and the fact that she had personally hurt her younger daughter made her even more upset!</p>
 <p>Xia Xinsheng walked out of the hospital in a daze.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan had been in Xia Zi’s ward after Mo Suqing left, and he felt that the suffocating pressure seemed to have been lifted a little without the rest of them here.</p>
 <p>He just wanted to keep his A’zi company and he wanted to be there when she woke up. He had so much to tell her.</p>
 <p>He looked at Xia Zi tenderly.</p>
 <p>Someone suddenly knocked on the door to the ward.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan frowned as he turned to the door. <em>Mo Suqing or Luo Qiqi wouldn’t have knocked. Could it be Xia Xinsheng?</em></p>
 <p>He could only shake his head at the thought of his stepmother.<em>&nbsp;Could this turn of events be considered fortunate? How could Mo Suqing’s biological mother be my stepmother?&nbsp;</em><em>This also meant that Xia Xinsheng is actually Xia Zi’s mother.</em></p>
 <p><em>What’s fortunate is that Xia Xinsheng was unlikely to create further trouble for A’zi after this.</em></p>
 <p>He then said, “Come in!”</p>
 <p>It was Guan Mingchang standing at the door.</p>
 <p>Surprised to see his father, Guan Zixuan asked, “Dad, why are you here?”</p>
 <p>Guan Mingchang walked in and said, “I heard that your brother has already returned to the camp. Your mum said she wanted to visit Xia Zi in the morning to check on her, but she isn’t back yet. I can’t reach her on the phone either. I was worried so I thought I should just come over.”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan was shocked to hear this.<em>&nbsp;Xia Xinsheng did not return home?</em></p>
 <p><em>Maybe she needs time to reconcile everything.</em></p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan then said, “You’ll learn about this sooner or later, so let me tell you what happened earlier. Let’s talk outside.”</p>
 <p>Guan Mingchang glanced at Xia Zi before nodding and leaving the ward.</p>
 <p>They hung around near the ward and did not go far since there was no one else keeping Xia Zi company.</p>
 <p>“Dad, Mum was from A City right?”</p>
 <p>“Mm!” Guan Mingchang nodded at this.</p>
 <p>“Do you know that she has a daughter called Mo Suqing?”</p>
 <p>Guan Mingchang was surprised to hear this, but he nodded and said, “I know that but I didn’t look into it because your mum wanted to break free from her past. I know that she wouldn’t like it if I were to look into her past either. So, all I know is that she has a daughter. I never bring this up because I don’t want to upset her, but I can tell that she still misses her daughter after all these years.”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan nodded and said, “Dad, you’re right. Mum could not let go of her daughter, and she feels extremely guilty towards her. The more guilt she felt, the less courage she had to go look for her child. What she never expected was that I would become friends with Mo Suqing when I was in A City.”</p>
 <p>This was news to Guan Mingchang. “What do you mean?”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan continued, “I mean, Mo Suqing is in Emperor City now, and Mum met her right in A’zi’s ward this morning.”</p>
 <p>“What happened then!” This made Guan Mingchang anxious. <em>What were the odds of something like this happening!</em></p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan shook his head. “Dad, don’t panic. I know you’re worried about Mum but let me finish first. I’m guessing Mum never told you that she has more than one daughter right? She actually had twin daughters, but one of the girls went missing when they were younger. This was probably why she never told you, but she would never have guessed that Mo Suqing had already found her sister, and that they’ve already acknowledged each other as siblings!”</p>
 <p>A sense of foreboding crept up on Guan Mingchang. He frowned and asked, “Do we know that other daughter?”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan nodded and said, “Yes. Xia Zi is Mo Suqing’s twin sister!”</p>
 <p><em></em>This shook Guan Mingchang.<em>&nbsp;If that’s the case, Xia Xinsheng would probably be feeling extremely guilty at this point. The methods she used to protect Guan Zixuan had inadvertently hurt her own daughter.</em></p>
 <p><em>Now that Xia Zi was in the hospital, Xia Xinsheng was probably the one who felt the worst.</em></p>
