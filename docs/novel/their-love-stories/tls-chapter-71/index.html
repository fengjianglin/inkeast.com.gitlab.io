<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>After last night, Mo Suqing&nbsp;took some time to reflect.</p>
 <p>If she had not lost her temper and dumped all her fury on him, maybe everything could be well under control.</p>
 <p><em>We are both too stubborn.</em></p>
 <p>However,&nbsp;even if they weren’t on speaking terms, he didn’t have to avoid home.</p>
 <p>Night turned into day. When Mo Suqing woke up the next day and faced the empty room, she was once again reminded of the harsh fact that Ye Zhongjue&nbsp;had not returned.</p>
 <p>For three days, Mo Suqing did not see Ye Zhongjue once.</p>
 <p>On the third day, she called him on his phone, but it was not turned on. She called several times with the same result.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing realized, sadly, that she didn’t know anything about Ye Zhongjue except for the fact that he worked at&nbsp;Mighty Empire.</p>
 <p>Now that she was desperate to find him, she didn’t even know whom to turn to.</p>
 <p>This made Mo Suqing panic.</p>
 <p>The next day, after a sleepless night, Mo Suqing headed to Mighty Empire’s HQ after having her breakfast and waiting for the usual work day to start.</p>
 <p>Standing&nbsp;in front of the building with a hundred floors, Mo Suqing felt for the first time&nbsp;ever,&nbsp;how small she&nbsp;truly&nbsp;was.</p>
 <p>It was Monday. She had taken a morning off to come here.</p>
 <p>Plucking up her courage, she entered the building.</p>
 <p>She was instantly drawn by the low-key yet luxurious and exquisite decorations. No wonder people were dying to get in here. Mighty Empire was indeed extraordinary.</p>
 <p>She didn’t want to be seen as a country bumpkin, so she did not spend too much time gawking at the interior.</p>
 <p>She walked to the receptionist, who was a petite woman, and said politely, “Hello, I’m looking for someone.”</p>
 <p>The receptionist looked up from her phone.</p>
 <p>She smiled politely, revealing eight neat teeth.</p>
 <p>“Hi, may I ask who you are looking for and have you made an appointment beforehand?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing smiled embarrassingly. “My husband, Ye Zhongjue, works here. I’m looking for him. I can’t get through to him and I have something to tell him. So, I came. Could you please help me?”</p>
 <p>“Ye Zhongjue?” At the name, the woman furrowed her brows and considered for a moment.</p>
 <p>“No, I don’t think there’s anyone with that name in our company. Of course, there are a lot of people working here, but as the receptionist, I know everyone in every department.”</p>
 <p>The woman was well-mannered, but somehow she said she didn’t know Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing stood there, not knowing what to do. Suddenly, a thought struck her and she asked, “He is the assistant of Manager Lin. Can you look him up for me? Please?”</p>
 <p>She was so earnest in her request that the receptionist didn’t want to make things difficult for her.</p>
 <p>She did some searching&nbsp;and said, “There are six managers with&nbsp;the&nbsp;surname of Lin in our company. They are Lin Haoran, Lin Zeng, Lin Peng… However, none of them has an assistant called Ye Zhongjue.”</p>
 <p>She could see the news made Mo Suqing downcast.</p>
 <p>Feeling sorry for her, she said, “Miss, to be honest with you, I didn’t have to check to know there is no such person in the entire Mighty Empire. How do you think I made it here? It’s because I can remember a person with just one look.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing opened her mouth but couldn’t say anything.</p>
 <p>She could tell the woman was not lying. However, if she wasn’t lying, it meant it was the man who had registered marriage and slept on the same bed with her for three months before doing a vanishing act that was lying.</p>
 <p><em>But why? Why would he lie to me?</em> Mo Suqing could not understand it. She felt weak, as if the belief that had been supporting her was suddenly gone.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing emerged from the building. Outside, the sunlight was particularly harsh.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, a visitor was visiting the office on the hundredth floor in Mighty Empire.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu was sitting on the couch, not a care in the world.</p>
 <p>“So what’s up? I have been back for a couple of days now with no luck of seeing you again. Who is this wife of yours that makes you so obedient?” Ceng Hanyu asked jokingly.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue shot him a cold look, which shut his mouth right up.</p>
 <p>“Alright, alright! I’ll stop messing around!”</p>
 <p>After sitting on the couch cross-leggedly for a while, he gave Ye Zhongjue an amused look, remembering something.</p>
 <p>“Hey, stop working! I have a story for you. So the other night, I saw two&nbsp;aggressive&nbsp;women in August Hasn’t Ended Yet&nbsp;and…”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu recounted the whole thing with a keen interest. On the other hand, Ye Zhongjue just stared out of the window, deep in thought.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu stopped mid&nbsp;sentence. “Ye Zhongjue, are you listening to my story or not! Do you not believe what I’ve said? I have recorded the scene on my phone. You are so gonna believe me!”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu strode over to Ye Zhongjue’s&nbsp;desk and handed him his phone.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue had wanted to ignore him, but when he saw who the women were in the video, he could no longer feigned coolness.</p>
 <p>He forced himself to finish the video. When he saw the black-clad man appear near the end of the video, he understood everything.</p>
 <p>He had assumed everything. The truth was completely different from what he had thought!</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s expression had gone from the initial apathy and the sudden solemnness, to pain, anger and remorse, all combined.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu was utterly perplexed.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?” He took his phone back and looked at Ye Zhongjue, who had fixated his eyes at a point in the air.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue stood up and gripped Ceng Hanyu’s arm. “Is this three days ago?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah,” Ceng Hanyu’s eyes twinkled a little. “Why? What’s the matter? Now you can see that I am not lying! The two women were so fierce—”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue cut him off with a roar.</p>
 <p>“Ceng Hanyu, that’s my wife!”</p>
 <p>“Your wife. Hehe, your wife…” Ceng Hanyu murmured. Suddenly, his face seemed to freeze and then became contorted. He was dumbstruck.</p>
 <p>“What?!” he exclaimed, his voice going up several decibels. “That’s your wife? Fuck! Why didn’t you introduce her to me earlier, so I wouldn’t just sit there and watch! Tell me, which one is she? The long-haired one or the short-haired one?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue actually admired himself for being able to answer the question.</p>
 <p>“The short-haired one is her bestie!”</p>
 <p>With just one sentence, he succinctly got Ceng Hanyu to know who his wife and the other woman were.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu was still digesting the astounding information when Ye Zhongjue, who had just been talking to him in a calm voice a second before, slunk off and disappeared.&nbsp;Ceng Hanyu&nbsp;stared at the place where he had been, dumb-founded.</p>
 <p>He had never seen Ye Zhongjue acting like this.</p>
 <p>He replayed the scene that night in his mind. Mo Suqing gave him an impression of a gentle kitten that would never scratch but would catch you unawares and attack your weak point when threatened.</p>
 <p><em>So this is Ye Zhongjue’s type!&nbsp;</em>A wry smile tugged at the corner of his mouth.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Ye Zhongjue was driving toward his house&nbsp;at&nbsp;a high speed.</p>
 <p>When he parked the car in the garage, he realized belatedly that it was his Bentley.</p>
 <p>He had been staying at the Ye residence the past few days and had not been driving his white Volkswagen.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t believe that he had not only wrongly accused Mo Suqing, but also done something so evil to her when she needed to be comforted.</p>
 <p>His mind was in a turmoil. All he wanted to do now was to pull her into his chest and protect her.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue got off the car and thrusted the key of the Bentley into his pocket. Then, he quickly headed to his apartment.</p>
 <p>When he unlocked the door and saw no one there, disappointment was written all over his face.</p>
 <p>Then, he remembered it was a Monday. Of course she was at work.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue walked into the study to pick up his phone that he had put on the desk and turned it on.</p>
 <p>Immediately, countless messages came in. Almost all of them were notifications of missed calls from Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue felt a pang of regret. Self-reproach could be seen in his face.</p>
 <p>At that time, all he had thought was they needed to cool off. Little had he known that the truth was completely different from what he had assumed. She must have gone through a lot of grievances the past few days.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue opened WeChat. As he expected, Mo Suqing had been posting on her Moments.</p>
 <p><em>I am so disappointed…&nbsp;</em>she wrote the day after the night.</p>
 <p>At her words, Ye Zhongjue’s heart ached. A hint of bitterness crossed his mouth and his expression was plaintive.</p>
 <p>On the second day, she wrote, <em>I know I’m angry, but I also cannot help but miss him…</em></p>
 <p>On the third day, <em>I feel panic. I want to find him! Although we have been together for three months only, somehow it feels like many years have passed. I hate that I am so pathetic that I can’t seem to resist the overwhelming feeling of wanting to see him. I guess I have fallen hard this time… I just realized not only can</em><em>&nbsp;I&nbsp;</em><em>not reach him by phone, but I also don’t know any of his friends. It’s like he just vanished into thin air and disappeared from my world.</em></p>
 <p><em>This makes me feel utterly lost and panic, which is unprecedented. I don’t know what to do…</em></p>
 <p>Today, she had also posted something.</p>
 <p><em>I think he has&nbsp;</em><em>decided he no longer wants to be with me</em><em>. That’s why he just walked out on me. When I went to look for him, I was told there was no such person. I feel like a big joke!</em></p>
 <p>If Ye Zhongjue still didn’t acknowledge that he had made a huge mistake, he was not a real man. Fortunately, he did. He covered his heart with the phone and sank to the ground. Ever since he had founded Sin Eliminators with Ceng Hanyu, they had braved numerous tempests of shot and shell together. However, never had he been this painful as he was right now.</p>
 <p>Every word and every sentence from Mo Suqing was a knife that stabbed into his heart, hurting it in an unimaginable way…</p>
