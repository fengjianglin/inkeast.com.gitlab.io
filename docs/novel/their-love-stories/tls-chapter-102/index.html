<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Ceng Hanyu shook his head vigorously. <em>I must be thinking too much! I barely know her.</em></p>
 <p>He turned back to Mo Suqing and smiled. “Sister-in-law, of course I&nbsp;came&nbsp;to visit the patient. I helped get the blood she desperately needed!”</p>
 <p>He tilted his head, thought for a moment and cast Mo Suqing a glance.</p>
 <p>“It can be said that I saved her life!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing knew how Ceng Hanyu liked to mess around and talk like that, so she didn’t feel uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>“Well, now you have seen her, you can leave.”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu was speechless. <em>Is she kicking me out?</em></p>
 <p><em>Isn’t it a little strange to kick someone out of a hospital?</em></p>
 <p>He beamed at Mo Suqing and then cast a glance at Guan Zixuan, who was standing behind her. Although Ye Zhongjue didn’t ask him to be the third wheel today, he had decided he would do everything he could to disrupt Guan Zixuan and Mo Suqing’s interaction every time he saw them together.</p>
 <p><em>It’s all for the happiness of my friend!</em></p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu gave Mo Suqing&nbsp;a&nbsp;wicked smile.</p>
 <p>“How can I just leave my sister-in-law behind?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing rolled her eyes. <em>Who can take him away please? I barely know this guy!</em></p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan, unable to keep silent anymore, asked stiffly, “Where the hell is Ye Zhongjue? Why didn’t he come himself? Is he really that busy?”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu feigned shock. “You don’t know?”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan was shocked. <em>Is there anything I’m supposed to know?</em></p>
 <p>“Know what?” he spat.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu didn’t mind his attitude. He had a plan.</p>
 <p>“Don’t tell me you don’t know anything about the press conference. It was already over and now you are feigning ignorance? Don’t you try to cover it up with your misty eyes. I know my sister-in-law here is beautiful and kind-hearted and a good catch, but you can’t hide the news from her in order to get her to like you!”</p>
 <p>Guan Xizuan’s face darkened at Ceng Hanyu’s exaggerated version of the truth. <em>This guy is as nasty as Ye Zhongjue! No wonder it is said that “like attracts like”! They are both the same type.</em></p>
 <p>“What press conference?” Mo Suqing looked at him quizzically.</p>
 <p>“A conference where he told the journalists that you are his wife and that if anyone messes with you again, he’ll sue them.”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu looked like he didn’t give a shit&nbsp;about&nbsp;anything, but he did have the ability to give a succinct summary.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan stared at him, as if he wanted to pin Ceng Hanyu on the wall with his glare. “What has that to do with his absence?”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu looked at him, amused. “See, I knew you heard about the press conference. You were just faking ignorance. Now you have shown your true colors!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan’s face darkened even more. How he wanted to literally kick this man out of this place!</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu saw that Mo Suqing had become distracted and knew he had achieved his goal.</p>
 <p>He added unnecessarily, “His father heard about it, too, and had called him incessantly, so&nbsp;Ye Zhongjue&nbsp;had to go home right after the conference.”</p>
 <p>“So! That is everything you should know.” Ceng Hanyu shrugged and spread his arms casually.</p>
 <p>Then, he grinned at Mo Suqing. “Well, if there’s nothing I can do for you, I’m taking off. Sister-in-law, call me anytime you need me!”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu walked away without a care in the world, which made Guan Zixuan even more pissed.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing looked after him and then looked at Guan Zixuan.</p>
 <p>“Go and do whatever you need to do. I want to take a nap.”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan frowned, but said eventually, “Okay.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing went back to her ward and sat on the edge of the bed for a long time. In the end, she decided to turn on the TV.</p>
 <p>Almost every channel was replaying the same news: the press conference at Mighty Empire.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing quietly and calmly watched the replay from beginning to end.</p>
 <p><em>Seven years? I&nbsp;</em><em>didn’t</em><em>&nbsp;know we have known each other for seven years.</em></p>
 <p>Outside the ward, Guan Zixuan could hear the TV. He tightened his fist. <em>I am right here! But his hollow words mean more, apparently.</em></p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan stood there, his whole body emanating a chilly vide. The handsome young man whom everyone loved had suddenly become stiflingly cold.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, at the international airport, another handsome man in a khaki overcoat was standing next to a beautiful woman in an azure dress with wavy hair.</p>
 <p>The two of them were about to alight from the plane when the man whispered in the woman’s ear.</p>
 <p>“Do not act without my order. Got it?”</p>
 <p>His voice was a seductive bass, but somehow it sounded like a devil’s voice to the woman. She trembled a little when she heard his words and said, “Yes.”</p>
 <p>The man smiled satisfactorily and parted from her.</p>
 <p>The woman had just zipped up her suitcase when her phone rang.</p>
 <p>An affectionate and charming smile appeared on her face when she answered it. “Yeah, I’m back. Pick me up, will you?”</p>
 <p>The person at the other end of the line must have said something to make her giggle.</p>
 <p>After hanging up, she smiled and walked out of the building. The city she had not set foot on for a long time came into view. Everything felt so familiar.</p>
 <p><em>Jue, I am back!&nbsp;</em>she murmured inwardly.</p>
 <p>She was Jian Jie, the girl who had studied in the UK with Ye Zhongjue and whom Ye Wentian thought&nbsp;of&nbsp;as the best candidate for his daughter-in-law.</p>
 <p>Initially,&nbsp;Jian Jie had planned to return home with Ye Zhongjue. But, when Ye Zhongjue was&nbsp;heading back, she was just beginning to prepare for her graduate school – Ye Zhongjue had got his master’s and doctor’s degrees in quick succession. To be the woman who suited him best, she couldn’t do anything less.</p>
 <p>Therefore, she had spent three years finishing all the required courses and got a doctor’s degree for herself.</p>
 <p>She believed she was equal to him now. She, without doubt, was his perfect woman.</p>
 <p>When An Huilin arrived, Jian Jie was admiring the starry night of A City.</p>
 <p>An Huilin got off the car, and the two women hugged. It was pure coincidence that they had become friends.</p>
 <p>There was this time when Jian Jie was traveling in the US and her purse got stolen. An Huilin had happened to be there. She had helped her find her purse and host her during her stay. They got to know each other and discovered that they both came from A City. Later, they kept in touch and became close friends.</p>
 <p>An Huilin had told Jian Jie when she was&nbsp;leaving the country. Finally, it was time for Jian Jie to return home, too. Obviously, she was thrilled.</p>
 <p>It had been three years. They had been apart for that long. During these three years, she had never called Ye Zhongjue and he had never contacted her, either.</p>
 <p>But the fact was, she really missed him.</p>
 <p>She had missed him so much.</p>
 <p>Now, Jian Jie and An Huilin had got in the car and started catching up.</p>
 <p>Jian Jie looked out the window and said excitedly, “Did you see the woman just now? She’s really gorgeous, but her boobies are too big. I don’t like them.”</p>
 <p>“Because you like them flat!” An Huilin smiled. She was different from her usual, cool self.</p>
 <p>“It means I like men, not women, okay?” Jian Jie suppressed her laughter and retorted.</p>
 <p>An Huilin chuckled. “Someone has grown up, knowing how to make jokes!”</p>
 <p>“You, too!”</p>
 <p>They began laughing heartily.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Jian Jie saw the handsome face on the big screen on the Central Square.</p>
 <p>That was the face of the man she had missed day and night.</p>
 <p>“Huilin, can you pull the car over? I want to see something,” she said immediately.</p>
 <p>An Huilin checked the traffic light before pulling over. She looked to where Jian Jie was looking and saw the aloof man on the screen.</p>
 <p>He was saying, “My wife Mo Suqing has never been obsessed with or harassed me, because it is me who has loved her…”</p>
 <p>Jian Jie’s face paled in an instant. She turned to An Huilin, looking shocked and agitated.</p>
 <p>“He’s married?”</p>
 <p><em>Am I too late?</em></p>
 <p>“You know him?” An Huilin frowned. She could see Jian Jie was upset.</p>
 <p>“Of course I know him! He’s the person I talk about all the time! The man I like! If it’s not for him, I wouldn’t&nbsp;have&nbsp;stayed&nbsp;abroad all by myself. I did it because I wanted to be a more suitable wife for him. That’s why I worked so hard! Why is he married? Our parents are old friends; we grew up together. How can he be married? I didn’t know a thing!”</p>
 <p>Tears poured down her cheeks.</p>
 <p>An Huilin had composed herself from the shock, although she still couldn’t believe it.&nbsp;Leng Xiyao was the obstacle to her ideal man while Jian Jie’s romantic rival was Leng Xiyao’s best friend! Fate was messing with them.</p>
 <p>“Tell me it isn’t true, Huilin!”</p>
 <p>Jian Jie gripped her arm and sobbed grievously.</p>
 <p>An Hulin patted her on the back and soothed her in a gentle voice. She didn’t want to tell her the truth. It must be devastating when you had loved someone for so long and then realized out of the blue that he had got married.</p>
 <p>Although she herself had also waited for another man for many years, at least he hadn’t got married. As long as he didn’t, she could continue to wait and&nbsp;hope.</p>
 <p>“Silly girl, don’t be stupid. You don’t have to be with the one you love. Ye Jue has been very secretive about his marriage. Even his parents probably didn’t know about it until now, let alone you. Don’t be sad. Stop crying, okay? Shh…”</p>
 <p>An Huilin stroked her long hair and said, “You are such a pretty woman. You’ll see, there are going to be a lot of men who chase after you. Don’t limit yourself to one man.”</p>
 <p>“No, I only want him. I have committed myself to him a long time ago. How can he be married?”</p>
 <p>Jian Jie collapsed in An Huilin’s arms and sobbed.</p>
 <p>An Huilin handed her some tissues to wipe her face, then sighed. “As a matter of fact, I know his wife.”</p>
 <p>“You know her?” Jian Jie stared at her.</p>
 <p>“Huilin, what kind of a person is she? Do you know how she and Jue got together?”</p>
