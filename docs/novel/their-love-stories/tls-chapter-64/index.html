<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Ye Zhongjue wanted to tell him it was nothing, but the words wouldn’t come out.</p>
 <p>“Well, ahem, do you know WeChat?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, sure! I use it all the time. Is there a problem?”</p>
 <p>He said it in a smooth tone, although he was actually very surprised.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue never expressed an interest in any apps whatsoever.</p>
 <p>For him, the only function of a cell phone was to make phone calls. So the question was, why would he take an interest in this app all of a sudden?</p>
 <p>Somehow, Lin Ran believed it had something to do with Miss Mo.</p>
 <p>Ever since Miss Mo showed up, Ye Zhongjue’s life had undergone many unimaginable changes.</p>
 <p>Embarrassment crept across Ye Zhongjue’s face. Now, Lin Ran was utterly astonished. This had got to be the third expression he had ever read on his face!</p>
 <p>An expression apart from coldness and anger.</p>
 <p>His&nbsp;boss&nbsp;was embarrassed. This was totally unheard of!</p>
 <p>Seeing Lin Ran’s stunned face, Ye Zhongjue immediately switched to his coldness mode. He gave him a steely glance and asked in a stiff tone, “How do you add someone to your contact with WeChat?”</p>
 <p>Although Ye Zhongjue had put on his poker face, Lin Ran was no longer afraid of it. After all, his&nbsp;boss&nbsp;just showed another side of himself!</p>
 <p>This was&nbsp;enough&nbsp;evidence that his current expression was actually a cover for his real emotions.</p>
 <p>However, Lin Ran was still a very competent assistant. After he heard Ye Zhongjue’s question, he quickly walked over.</p>
 <p>“Boss, do you see this? It’s your WeChat contact list. When you press this button up here, you can add new friends.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s face darkened. It was as simple as that. He should have tried the button first before asking for help.</p>
 <p>He sounded uneasy when he said, “Alright, I&nbsp;understand. You can go.”</p>
 <p>Lin Ran, with a sly smile like a fox, turned to leave.</p>
 <p>He bumped into Song Pingting outside the door to the office. She was standing there, holding a cup of coffee.</p>
 <p>Lin Ran’s smile vanished. She must have heard the conversation between him and the president.</p>
 <p>To be honest, sometimes he really disliked her.</p>
 <p>His&nbsp;boss&nbsp;treated her no differently from the others, but she kept using her title as the head secretary to try to seek more favor from Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>However, he was in no position to tell her this; his&nbsp;boss must be the one to make things clear with&nbsp;her.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue gave her a look and said sternly, “Lin Ran, you can go. Miss Song, come in.”</p>
 <p>Song Pingting walked in with the cup of coffee. When Ye Zhongjue was going to work overtime, he usually drank some after lunch.</p>
 <p>However, Song Pingting came at the wrong time. She obviously heard him talking to Lin Ran, but had decided to eavesdrop at the door.</p>
 <p><em>What if they were not talking about WeChat, but something highly confidential?</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue frowned at the thought. “Miss Song, don’t forget to knock when you are at the door!”</p>
 <p>It was just a simple order, but tears immediately sprang into Song Pingting’s eyes.</p>
 <p>“President Ye, I didn’t mean to eavesdrop. It’s just…”</p>
 <p>The more she tried to explain, the more she didn’t know how. You would think Ye Zhongjue had just given her a death sentence.</p>
 <p>In the end, she said in a grieved tone, “I just wanted to bring you your coffee…”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s brows knitted together at her distressed tone.</p>
 <p>As a rule, Song Pingting was a competent and efficient secretary who seldom, if ever, made a show of herself. Though he was being a little stern to her, it was absolutely necessary under the circumstances.</p>
 <p>It looked like he had to find a new head secretary if she couldn’t learn her lesson.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked at her coldly and said the following words that practically broke her, “If this is too difficult for you, you can stop coming in from tomorrow!”</p>
 <p>Song Pingting’s face went pale. She looked at Ye Zhongjue in disbelief. She had worked for him for so long. How could he just fire her like that?</p>
 <p>She had always known the man was heartless, she thought mournfully, but she had still let herself fall for him, hadn’t she?</p>
 <p>What Song Pingting didn’t realize was, Ye Zhongjue’s heartless cruelty was only directed towards other women; he could never do that to Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>Song Pingting’s tone was very reluctant with a hint of suppressed emotions when she replied, “President Ye, I’ll never make the same mistake again. Please give me another chance.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue lowered his head to check his WeChat and tap open the contact list.</p>
 <p>A screen&nbsp;name “FarAway” appeared above the mobile contact that he had named “Honey.”</p>
 <p>A tender smile spread across Ye Zhongjue’s face. He tapped “Add.”</p>
 <p><em>So, her screen</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>name is FarAway. FarAway…</em> Ye Zhongjue muttered to himself. It was so cute.</p>
 <p>He thought he must have been under some spell. Otherwise, how could a screen&nbsp;name create such a turmoil in his heart?</p>
 <p>When he finally looked up after a while, he realized Song Pingting was still standing there piteously.</p>
 <p>He cleared his throat and said, “Okay. You can go now. Watch your behavior.”</p>
 <p>Song Pingting grunted a polite answer, then turned to leave. She closed the door behind her, a vicious expression on her face.</p>
 <p><em>He uses WeChat? Why would he want to use it?</em> She had a feeling it was because of the woman who bought him that overcoat.</p>
 <p>She couldn’t bear the thought that he was willing to change himself for some woman. She couldn’t bear it at all!</p>
 <p>Song Pingting clenched her fists so tightly that her nails punctured her flesh.</p>
 <p>Lin Ran walked by and asked, “What are you still doing here?”</p>
 <p>Song Pingting tucked away her emotions. When she looked up, she had put herself together as if nothing had happened.</p>
 <p>“Well, I’m just leaving, Mr. Lin.”</p>
 <p>Then, she walked past Lin Ran.</p>
 <p>Watching her go, Lin Ran couldn’t help but frown. Somehow, he just didn’t like Song Pingting.</p>
 <p>Although he and Song Pingting were the two most capable employees in the company (albeit the fact that he was the real right-hand man of Ye Zhongjue) and they were supposed to get along quite well, the truth was he did not want to see the woman at all.</p>
 <p>He shook his head. <em>Never mind. As long as she doesn’t do anything that compromises the company, he shouldn’t interfere.</em></p>
 <p>Two days later, Ye Zhongjue finally agreed to let Mo Suqing go to work.</p>
 <p>Like a happy bird who had just been freed, she kept chattering on the way to her office.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked at her fondly. He could see she had been bored to death staying at home and was very happy to be able to get back to work.</p>
 <p>When she got off the car, Ye Zhongjue reminded her to be careful with the wound and to have&nbsp;a&nbsp;light meal for lunch.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing smiled and nodded before running into the building.</p>
 <p>With Mo Suqing back in the office, Leng Xiyao came back to life and was her usual self again.</p>
 <p>She waved Mo Suqing’s hand happily. Then, cupping her ear with one hand, she leaned closer and whispered into her ear, “Suqing, I have insider information that a week from now, The Unparalleled and Mighty Empire are going to talk business at Jazz Club!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>We know that the presidents of the two companies have always been very mysterious; they’ve never shown&nbsp;up at any public events. If we can take some photos of either of them, the story will definitely generate record profits for our magazine! An Huilin will not push us around anymore,” Leng Xiyao said, although she was aware that An Huilin had not been giving her a hard time since she told Leng Haoyun about it the other night.</p>
 <p>However, she had thrown caution to the wind and decided to fight him until she won, even if it meant his identity would be revealed and she could benefit from it.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing quickly turned to look at her, her eyes huge with surprise.</p>
 <p>“Are you serious?”</p>
 <p>“You bet I am!” Leng Xiyao nodded.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing considered for a moment and frowned. “This is a great piece of information, no doubt. But, we don’t have a member card of Jazz Club. Without it, we won’t be able to get inside.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao’s eyes widened. Then, she rolled them around mischievously.</p>
 <p>She lowered her voice and said, “I’ll take care of it. I have a friend who might be able to get us a card, so we can enter the club without a hassle.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao looked at Mo Suqing expectantly, as if she was waiting for her compliment.</p>
 <p>Laughing, Mo Suqing gave her hair a tousle. “I knew you always have a lot of ideas and would come up with a solution.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing never mentioned the other day when Leng Xiyao had felt really down.</p>
 <p>She knew Leng Xiyao would tell her when she wanted to.</p>
 <p>In the afternoon, Ye Zhongjue was having an international online meeting when Lin Ran knocked on the door and walked in.</p>
 <p>Lin Ran had expected the meeting to be over by now. However, Ye Zhongjue had prolonged the meeting to discuss more issues.</p>
 <p>Lin Ran waited patiently until Ye Zhongjue wrapped it up ten minutes later.</p>
 <p>“What’s up?”</p>
 <p>“Boss,” Lin Ran said, “there’s a party you need to attend this evening.”</p>
 <p>He paused before continuing, his brow knitted together, “The problem is, I’m afraid I can’t be there with you tonight. I’ll need to pass it this time.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue considered this for a moment. “Ask Miss Song to get ready and go to the party with me in the evening.”</p>
 <p>Lin Ran nodded. “Okay, Boss, I’ll tell her.”</p>
 <p>After Lin Ran left, Ye Zhongjue rubbed his temple. He had a mild headache due to the long hours he had put in at work.</p>
 <p>He called Mo Suqing to tell her that he would go home late today.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing went to the restroom to answer the phone. She lowered her voice and asked, “Are you going to work overtime again?”</p>
 <p>She knew Ye Zhongjue had quite a lot of unfinished work from the week he busied himself to take care of her and that he had been working late these few days to catch up with it.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was not going to hide it from her, so he answered, “No, it’s not that. There is a dinner party I have to go to this evening. It will probably be late when I get home. Don’t wait up.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing nodded, a little downcast. “Alright then. Don’t drink too much!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue promised her he wouldn’t and then hung up the phone.</p>
 <p>Not long after he put his phone down, he picked it up again. As he had expected, Mo Suqing had shared a status in Moments.</p>
 <p>He had found out that Mo Suqing just loved to use WeChat.</p>
