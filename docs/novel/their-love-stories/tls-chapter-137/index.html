 <p>Ye Zhongjue chuckled. “I’m going to ask Lin Ran to bring me a document from home. In the second drawer on the left under my desk in the study, you’ll see a black folder on the top. That is it. The key is in the bedroom. When Lin Ran comes, just give him the folder. It will probably be pretty late when I get home. Go out to have some dinner. Don’t stay at home all day; it’s not good for you or the baby. After dinner, take a walk before going home. Don’t wait up for me and go to bed early!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing listened and nodded obediently. “Okay, I see. I’ll find the folder for Lin Ran.”</p>
 <p>Then, the two of them talked some more – all sweet nothings – before hanging up.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing stroked her belly. There was a baby inside her. The thought brought about the pregnancy glow on her.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing found the key in the bedside cabinet and walked toward the study.</p>
 <p><em>The second drawer on the left… This one!&nbsp;</em>She bent down and opened it. Just as Ye Zhongjue had said, there was a black folder on the top. Mo Suqing frowned. She had felt a bit weird when Ye Zhongjue mentioned that black folder.</p>
 <p>Usually, folders like this were blue, not black.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was going to open it, but thought better of it. It might contain some confidential information. She mustn’t read it.</p>
 <p>She closed the half-opened folder and was going to shut the drawer when her eyes caught a creamy jade pendant in it. Intrigued, she picked it up and examined it.</p>
 <p>It was a piece of round, cream-colored jade, with a sheen that indicated good quality. The character of Jue in calligraphic form was inscribed on it and filled with light-blue ink. It looked very&nbsp;beautiful.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing toyed with it for a while before putting it back.</p>
 <p>If Ye Zhongjue found it necessary to lock the pendant here, it must be very important to him.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing went to the living room and put the folder on the coffee table. After about half an hour, the doorbell rang.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing peered through the peephole. It was indeed Lin Ran. She opened the door and handed him the folder.</p>
 <p>Lin Ran looked like he was in a hurry. He took the folder and took leave without dawdling.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing frowned and closed the door behind her.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, at Tianyu Hotel.</p>
 <p>Two gorgeous women were on the balcony. One of them was leaning casually against the window, while the other was curling up on a beanbag chair.</p>
 <p>On closer inspection, the woman against the window had an identical look with Mo Suqing, although her black hair was shorter than the other woman. If it weren’t for the coldness she was exuding, it was easy to mistake her for Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>In her hand, she had a glass of red wine which she was swaying gently while giving off an aloof air.</p>
 <p>The woman on the chair, on the other hand, had the most enchanting look with shiny black eyes as bright as gemstones, a cherry-red mouth at the corner of which a wry smile tugged, and long, glossy black hair falling over her chest. She was typing fast on her laptop.</p>
 <p>Five minutes passed. A beautiful smile lit up her face.</p>
 <p>“Done!” she announced in a tinkling voice. “I’ve located it, Zi. I found the thief who stole my jade pendant! Let’s go catch him. I’ll teach that son of a bitch who dared steal from me a lesson…”</p>
 <p>She smiled devilishly, looking quite a hooligan.</p>
 <p>The cold expression on the other woman’s face shifted. She straightened up and walked over.</p>
 <p>“Let me see,” she said. Even her voice sounded cold.</p>
 <p>Two women, one fiery and the other icy-cold.</p>
 <p>That’s right. They were Luo Qiqi and Xia Zi, the two Interpol agents who were visiting A City.</p>
 <p>The reason that had brought them here was simple enough, not at all cryptic as Ye Zhongjue and the others had thought.</p>
 <p>A while ago, while they were investigating a crime in the States, Luo Qiqi’s jade pendant was gone. She insisted it had been stolen.</p>
 <p>The thief didn’t know she had installed a tracking device in the pendant. It was the latest model and extremely tiny for the naked eye to detect.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi hadn’t thought much when she installed the device. Little had she known it would become so handy.</p>
 <p>When Luo Qiqi was little, she had been taken away from her family by a group of human traffickers. She had ended up in the US, where the wrongdoers were brought to justice. She had been only two years old then and couldn’t remember anything about it. Later, she was sent to an orphanage.</p>
 <p>She had worn the jade pendant for as long as she could remember, so it was very important to her.</p>
 <p>Therefore, after she and Xia Zi finished the case at hand, they had tracked it back to their home country.</p>
 <p>Xia Zi had been another victim of the human traffickers. They had got rescued and sent to the same orphanage where they had grown up and become Interpol agents together. They both wanted to save more children like themselves and put criminals in jail.</p>
 <p>Even though they were as different as fire and ice, it didn’t affect their teamwork and friendship.</p>
 <p>They saw each other as the most important thing in the world and would die for the other person.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi handed the laptop to Xia Zi, who had sat down beside her.</p>
 <p>“Are you sure this is the place?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah,” Luo Qiqi nodded. “I’m sure!”</p>
 <p>“Great!” Xia Zi quickly devised a plan. She wanted to finish the business as soon as possible. Their superiors in France had been urging them to go back. They thought the two of them were still in the US.</p>
 <p>“We’ll start following him after he comes out of the Hilton Hotel. Then, I’ll go and confront him while you shoot him from afar. Remember, do not aim at any of his vital organs, although you do want to immobilize him. We’ll get this done tonight and go back to France tomorrow morning – I have booked the tickets already. Boss said he has some updates on The Dark Night and he wants us to follow up the clue.”</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi nodded thoughtfully. Xia Zi’s arrangement made sense. While Luo Qiqi was called a sharpshooter, Xia Zi was second to none in combating. When they were catching criminals, the former was in charge of shooting the target and the latter grappling them. This way, their collaboration was flawless.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi hugged Xia Zi’s arm and said, “I can feel how much you care about me, the way you, a person who is stingy with words, were willing to pour out so many of them in one go. I am flattered!”</p>
 <p>Her eyes sparkled with pleasure when she looked at Xia Zi.</p>
 <p>Xia Zi gave her a cool look. “Are you&nbsp;really?”</p>
 <p>“Of course I am!” Luo Qiqi jumped up from the chair. “Look at me, all excited!”</p>
 <p>“Let’s go!” Xia Zi said, not in the mood to talk nonsense with her. However, an indulgent fondness did cross her cold eyes.</p>
 <p>Most of the time, her world was made up of ice. Luo Qiqi was the only warmth in it.</p>
 <p>They quickly disguised themselves. In no time, they were unrecognizable.</p>
 <p>They gathered their stuff and left the hotel.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>After Lin Ran had left with the folder, Mo Suqing read for a while. She had found the book about firearm design quite fascinating, so she would try to study it whenever she had time.</p>
 <p>After some time, she became hungry. She got up to find&nbsp;something to eat in the refrigerator.</p>
 <p>However, it was empty. She remembered then that she and Ye Zhongjue hadn’t eaten at home for several days.</p>
 <p>Remembering that Ye Zhongjue had told her to get out of the house and find something to eat, she closed the refrigerator and left the house.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing went to a small bistro nearby, where she and Ye Zhongjue had dined a few times. Somehow, she found the food there much tastier than that in a high-end restaurant.</p>
 <p>She was quite full afterwards, so she decided to take a leisure walk home.</p>
 <p>It was completely dark now. The streetlights on either side of the road were very dim, so she quickened her pace.</p>
 <p>When she neared the Shallow Sea Area, Mo Suqing felt that someone seemed to be following her.</p>
 <p>Her heart was in her throat and she quickened her pace even more.</p>
 <p>The person behind her picked up their speed, too. Mo Suqing was very scared.</p>
 <p>The faster she walked, the more closely the person followed her. Finally, she was inside the community. She breathed out an audible sigh of relief. With the janitor at the gate, whoever it was couldn’t possibly get inside after her now.</p>
 <p>She slowly walked toward the villa at number eight. However, she immediately sensed that the person was still following her. Mo Suqing was frightened beyond description.</p>
 <p><em>Am I being followed by a stalker? Maybe even a sick serial killer?</em></p>
 <p>She dared not think about this kind of stuff anymore. <em>I have read and watched too many books and dramas on crime and suspense recently!&nbsp;</em>She shook her head to clear her mind and quickened her pace.</p>
 <p>Then, all of a sudden, the person was less than two steps behind her! Mo Suqing began to cry for help.</p>
 <p>However, her cry was cut off prematurely. The person covered her mouth and dragged her into the shadow.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing struggled violently.</p>
 <p>At the same time, she wrapped her belly with her arms protectively, afraid to hurt the baby in any way.</p>
 <p>The person who had her gave a groan of pain, but didn’t loosen their hand over her mouth.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing couldn’t make any sound.</p>
 <p>After a moment, she suddenly heard footsteps close by, then there were two women’s voices.</p>
 <p>“Zi, I don’t think he’s here. If he has a house here, why would he steal my pendant?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>We were able to get in because we have a villa here ourselves. This shows he is most likely a resident.”</p>
 <p>The two women were none other than Luo Qiqi and Xia Zi, who had tracked the pendant to the Shallow Sea Area.</p>
