 <p>Leng Xiyao looked disgusted when she said, “Appetite spoiled. God, we can’t catch a break even at lunch!”</p>
 <p>Since Mo Suqing had her back to Mo Sulian and Bai Tingnan, she didn’t know Leng Xiyao had seen them. She just casually asked, “What’s the matter?”</p>
 <p>“See for yourself!” Leng Xiyao stared hard at the space behind Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing looked over her shoulder promptly and saw Mo Sulian. She had hardly turned her head for more than a second before turning it back, unfazed.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao looked at her, surprised, “Suqing, aren’t you mad?”</p>
 <p>“When you can truly ignore someone, she’s invisible to you. She doesn’t deserve my wrath.” Mo Suqing said matter-of-factly.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao raised a thumb and gave her an admiring look. “Nice, Suqing! That’s the attitude toward such a shameless, immoral woman.”</p>
 <p>“Uh-huh.” Mo Suqing agreed vaguely.</p>
 <p>While they had been thus talking, Mo Sulian and Bai Tingnan had drawn near. Bai Tingnan was arm in arm with Mo Sulian. She looked at them triumphantly.</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian adopted a wired tone and said, “Look who it is! It’s our great journalist! Rumor has it that you are married. Congratulations!”</p>
 <p>She made her tone as venomous as possible, totally beside herself with rage remembering the scenario at home yesterday.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing didn’t say a thing. She just sat there and sipped at her tea as if it was nectar.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, the forthright Leng Xiyao could not tolerate any attacks against her bestie. She immediately stood up and returned fire.</p>
 <p>“What is this mediocre celebrity doing here? Watch her disgraceful behavior!”</p>
 <p>Bai Tingnan flipped out. “Leng Xiyao, watch your mouth! Who are you referring to?”</p>
 <p>“Who do you think I am referring to?”</p>
 <p>“You…” Bai Tingnan pointed at her angrily but couldn’t say a word.</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian narrowed her eyes and&nbsp;gave&nbsp;Leng Xiyao a fierce look. “I know your kind. You are the servant girl of Mo Suqing who speaks for her anywhere, anytime!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao glared at&nbsp;Sulian’s&nbsp;heavily powdered face and&nbsp;was just about&nbsp;to retaliate when Mo Suqing stood up unexpectedly and surprised everyone.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing did not wait to hear what Leng Xiyao had to say before making a swift response, “Mo Sulian, have you forgotten your manners, shaming yourself like this in a public place? Like mother, like daughter!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s remark was very much to the point, criticizing both Mo Sulian and Bai Lian.</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian was seething now. She completely lost it. The woman totally went over the line by thus insulting her in a public place.</p>
 <p>She hurled the glass at hand at Mo Suqing. “You bitch!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing seemed to have expected this. She turned aside just a little and the glass fell on the floor.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao was a bit shocked. Obviously, she hadn’t expected that Mo Sulian would do such a thing in a public place. Bai Tingnan was dumbstruck too.</p>
 <p>Only Mo Suqing knew better. She had hit Mo Sulian where it hurt and provoked a strong reaction. However, this was exactly what she had wanted, wasn’t it?</p>
 <p>The waiter, seeing this, quickly came over.</p>
 <p>At the moment, the most clear-headed and rational person was Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>Thinking of the other night when she had witnessed the betrayal by Gu Jiannan and Mo Sulian, she became even more ironhearted.</p>
 <p>“Has the restaurant not a screening process when it comes to the customers?” Mo Suqing asked the waiter. “This woman just threw a glass at me; she is clearly insane. I want to see your manager right now!”</p>
 <p>The other three looked a little stupefied, not knowing what she had in mind.</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian came to herself and retorted, “Mo Suqing, you are the one who’s insane!”</p>
 <p>Witnessing the hideous look on Mo Sulian’s face, the waiter dared not delay any longer. He quickly called security to see Mo Sulian and Bai Tingnan out.</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian kept hurling abuse while being manhandled, “Mo Suqing, you are a bitch! You will be punished!”</p>
 <p>After Mo Suqing sat back down, the owner of the restaurant showed up.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t stop apologizing, “I heard that you ladies almost got hurt. I am so sorry about it. As my profound apology, everything you order today is on the house.”</p>
 <p>“We are fine. Thank you for the meal.” Mo Suqing smiled at him. “However, you must be extra careful not to let in any more lunatics in the future. Otherwise, I can’t say nobody will be harmed next time. Also, other customers might not let it go so easily as I did.”</p>
 <p>The owner nodded in agreement. “Yes, you are absolutely right. We will be careful in the future. Bon appétit, young ladies!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing smiled slightly and gave him a nod.</p>
 <p>After the owner left, a startled Leng Xiyao looked at Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>“Suqing, you have changed! What happened to you the last few days? You were never a badass before, but you really hit the nail on the head this time!” she exclaimed, shaking her head exaggeratedly.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing smiled at her friend, “It’s not a big deal. You said your appetite was spoiled by them, so I thought I would kick them out for you. Now we can have a peaceful lunch together.”</p>
 <p>“But, Suqing, how did you think of this way to kick them out?” Leng Xiyao asked her curiously. “I myself was too busy arguing with them to come up with such a brilliant idea.”</p>
