 <p>Mo Suqing looked up. “Why stop?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue gave her an amused look. “Don’t you feel anything?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was still immersed in Ye Zhongjue’s story about him and his first love and looked confused at his question.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue smiled, defeated. He pinched her petite nose playfully, but Mo Suqing pouted and slapped his hand away.</p>
 <p>“What happened then? After you met her again?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue lowered his head and rubbed her hair with his chin. “I was talking business in a pub, but the other company didn’t know who I was. They thought I was just some minor manager at Mighty Empire. They drugged me. That was when I bumped into my girl. She took the brunt of the aphrodisiac effect of the drug, so I told her afterwards that I would be responsible for her.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing stared at him, realization finally starting to spread over her face.</p>
 <p>“You are talking about… me?” she asked incredulously, pointing at herself.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue kissed her hair.</p>
 <p>“Silly girl, what do you think? My first love and the woman I love has always been you.”</p>
 <p>“But you acted as if you didn’t know me when I first met you!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue scratched her nose a little and said, “If I told you I had loved you since high school, you would get spooked! Also, I could tell from your expression that something bad must have happened to you. I did some research and found out that you disliked the idea of wealthy families. If I told you who I am right away, you would definitely want nothing to do with me. Therefore, I decided I would hide my true identity and my feelings from you.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing felt dazed. She had had no idea there was a man who had kept her in his heart all these years.</p>
 <p>“So, even though I did lie to you, it’s not because I was fooling around or had any evil intentions. When you found out about the truth and broke down, I was agonized and didn’t know what to do. I was going to tell you everything, but then I was afraid you would stay only because you pitied me or were touched by me. However, I also feared that if I didn’t tell you, you would leave me forever. I didn’t know why every time I tried to explain these things to you, we would end up fighting. It wasn’t what I had intended to do! Ceng Hanyu said I don’t know anything about relationships. I admit, as powerful as I am, I’m a relationship virgin. But there is one thing you need to know. My feelings for you are genuine. All these years, you are the only one I have ever loved. I have kept you in my heart like the most precious thing in the world. When I was abroad, away from home, I would think about you and found the courage I needed to move on.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s eyes were brimming with tears. Ye Zhongjue’s moving confession had made her see how much she had missed.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue hugged her tightly. “Every time you mentioned Gu Jiannan, I became extremely jealous when I remembered how he was the one who had been with you all those years, even though I knew you had broken up and that no one would think I am any less than&nbsp;him. When we first got together, I tried very hard to suppress these emotions. I didn’t want you to discover who I am and to be scared away. I tried to make you think that tenderness and gentlemanship was in my nature. But, I became more and more out of control. I love you so much that I couldn’t help but want to possess you. The feeling got so strong in the end that I would get irritated or even fly into a rage every time I saw you with a man…”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing covered his mouth with her hand. Tears poured down her cheeks when she said, “Stop! I know it now.&nbsp;From now on,&nbsp;I&nbsp;won’t&nbsp;call&nbsp;you&nbsp;a liar&nbsp;again.”</p>
 <p>When she first found out she had been deceived, it had felt as if the whole world had betrayed her. However, now that she knew the man she loved had always loved her, she suddenly felt his lies were rather sweet.</p>
 <p>Perhaps, it’s only human nature to change so much and readily.&nbsp;It really depended on the perspective of the person.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue slowly took her hand away from his mouth and held it.</p>
 <p>“Okay! I’ll do whatever my wife says!” he said in a tender and affectionate voice.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing didn’t snap at his use of the word this time. After a while, she asked, “What about you and Mo Sulian?”</p>
 <p>“Mo Sulian?” Astonishment crossed Ye Zhongjue’s face. Then, he raised his eyebrows a little.</p>
 <p>“Initially, she said she would tell me things about you. And she did tell me a lot. In the end, I decided I could help her because she’s one of your family members after all. If something happens to her, your father will only find more reasons to trouble you. Although you act otherwise, I can see you are vulnerable when it comes to your family. A little hurt from them can break you down. However, even so, you still can’t say no to their requests. Am I right?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing pressed her lips together and replied after a moment, “No, you are wrong! The other day, when my father asked me to bring you home for dinner, I completely ignored him.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue chuckled at her grumpy expression.</p>
 <p>“That’s because you couldn’t bring yourself to speak to me after we had a fight, right?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s cheeks reddened. She pinched his waist and said, “How dare you expose me!”</p>
 <p>The smile on Ye Zhongjue’s face grew bigger. However, he placated her by saying, “Honey, I dare not do it again!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing blushed and stopped the pinching. With her pouty&nbsp;lips and sparkling eyes, she looked particularly attractive.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue felt much obliged to Ceng Hanyu. The love doctor had saved him.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s lips barely touched Mo Suqing’s when she pushed him away.</p>
 <p>She looked at him seriously. “We need to talk through everything tonight. We can’t behave like we used to be anymore. Otherwise, if something similar happens in the future, I’m not sure I can forgive you again!”</p>
 <p>“Okay!” Ye Zhongjue smiled and gave her a serious look.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing said, “Well, I have cleared up all my doubts. Now, you have to tell me why you always act so crazy every time you get mad? You just fly into a temper without warning! Also, why did you have to beat Gu Jiannan up so bad? I feel you are a violent man. Are you? And…”</p>
 <p>Before Mo Suqing could spill out everything she wanted to say, Ye Zhongjue leant over and planted a light kiss on her lips.</p>
 <p>“Why didn’t Guan Zixuan leave your place that night?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked at her, waiting for the answer.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing, startled by the unexpected kiss, jumped from the bed and almost fell.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fortunately, Ye Zhongjue caught her in time. Laughing, she fell into his arms instead.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s heart melted at her liveliness and gorgeousness.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing smiled slyly and pointed at Ye Zhongjue. “What, are you jealous of him?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s face darkened. <em>You devilish woman!</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing grinned. “Well, I guess it won’t hurt to tell you about it. That night, when Zixuan was leaving, Yuan – that’s his assistant – told him that journalists were gathering around his villa at the Shallow Sea. The model who was reported to be his girlfriend before seemed to have got pregnant. It was taken care of later that night, though. Zixuan was going to stay in a hotel for the storm to pass, but he noticed there were some journalists outside my building. In the end, I let him sleep on my floor.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing batted her eyelashes innocently.</p>
 <p>Although Ye Zhongjue didn’t care for the way she called him “Zixuan,” he forced himself not to flip out. He knew very well how Guan Zixuan had taken her in when she was going through a tough time.</p>
 <p>She was grateful for him. It was nothing to do with love; he was just a trustworthy friend.</p>
 <p>Therefore, he didn’t protest.</p>
 <p>“From now on, don’t mention Gu Jiannan’s name in front of me ever again. I was jealous of the guy, but now I simply hate him. Having said that, I still feel quite thankful for him for being by your side during your grief. That’s why I was relatively lenient to the Gu Group. If he can try his best not to incur my wrath, I will not harm him anymore. However, if he does anything that makes me unhappy, I can assure you he will be even more badly hurt than that night!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s expression was a little savage.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing frowned. “You were down there the whole night?”</p>
 <p>“You have no idea! Ever since we were separated, I couldn’t sleep well every night. I would always end up in front of your building and stay there overnight.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing hugged him. Ye Zhongjue’s hand began to move about.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing stopped its progress and knitted her brows together. “Can’t you be good for just a second?”</p>
 <p>The romantic atmosphere instantly got pierced.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s eyes gleamed with fire. He said huskily, “I want to skip the flirtation and get down to business!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was stunned. “Who told you that?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue rubbed her hair with his nose, taking in the fragrant smell.</p>
 <p>“Ceng Hanyu!”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu, who was still in the pub, sneezed.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s face darkened. <em>That bastard has&nbsp;</em><em>a</em><em>&nbsp;bad influence on Ye Zhongjue!</em></p>
 <p>“I’m going to kill him when I see him tomorrow!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing pouted her lips and ground her teeth.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue hugged her and chuckled. “Good! I’ll help you!”</p>
 <p>After enduring for such a long time, Ye Zhongjue could finally hug his wife! Of course he couldn’t help but start to do things to her.</p>
 <p>Moans of pleasure and sighs of satisfaction&nbsp;went on all night…</p>
 <p>The next morning when Mo Suqing woke up, she could still feel&nbsp;the lingering&nbsp;warmth&nbsp;in the space beside her. However, Ye Zhongjue was nowhere to be seen.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing got up and walked out of the room to find him making breakfast.</p>
 <p>Sunlight shone down on his black hair. He&nbsp;was&nbsp;extremely handsome and pleasant to look at.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing felt her heart bursting with happiness. This man was hers. He had loved her forever and all she wanted to do was to love him back for the rest of her life.</p>
 <p>If only two hearts can unite and never be separated from each other till death parts them.</p>
