<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Mo Zhenfeng thought for a moment. His younger daughter was right. What was done was done. However, he needed to meet this guy who Mo Suqing must marry even though she had to do it in secret and conceal the fact from her family afterwards.</p>
 <p>“Alright then. I’ll give her a call and make her come home for dinner with him. I would very much like to see what kind of a man he is to have cast her the spell to ditch her family and move out!”</p>
 <p>After ringing off, Mo Sulian finally felt her bitterness vented.</p>
 <p>Every time she thought about Ye Zhongjue, she felt so hot. There was no reason she couldn’t have him.</p>
 <p>If she could entice him with enough money, there was no way he would not betray Mo Suqing and be with her instead.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>After Mo Suqing and Ye Zhongjue left the restaurant, they took a walk for a little while. Then, Ye Zhongjue went back to his company.</p>
 <p>After all, the lunch break had&nbsp;a time limit.</p>
 <p>Soon after Mo Suqing had gone back to her office, Mo Zhenfeng called.</p>
 <p>She frowned at the screen of her phone. Her father had not called her ever since the crisis was solved.</p>
 <p>Why would he call her out of blue now?</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing picked up the phone. “Hey, dad, what’s up?” she said coldly.</p>
 <p>Mo Zhenfeng’s tone was full of paternal authority with a hint of anger.</p>
 <p>“You surely have the cheek to ask me that! Tell me, you lied to me about the household register, didn’t you? You said it was for an apartment allotted to you, but the truth is you wanted it to get married. There is no such thing as getting free accommodation now; it is not the seventies or eighties!”</p>
 <p>The more he talked, the angrier he became. It was as if Mo Suqing had done something heinous.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing immediately knew Mo Sulian had told him everything. She said calmly, “So I got married. Do you have to be this mad? So I didn’t play along with your matchmaking dinner. Do you have to be this angry?”</p>
 <p>Fuming now, Mo Zhenfeng bellowed, “You are such an unfilial daughter!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing had arrived at her desk in the meantime. Even Leng Xiyao could hear the roar from the phone in spite of the partition between their individual working space. She stood up and feigned a fear expression. “Ah! I’m frightened!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing glared at her and continued, “Yes, yes, I am not as filial as Mo Sulian. But, I think you know very well why that is!”</p>
 <p>Mo Zhenfeng almost had a heart attack. He tried to remind himself of Mo Sulian’s suggestion and calm himself down.</p>
 <p>“Okay then,” he conceded, his temper barely under control, “I am not going to discuss your&nbsp;marriage&nbsp;without my consent for now. But tell me this: when are you coming home and introducing him to me?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing considered the matter over. Since her father had softened the edge of his tone, she should drop her defensive posture, too.</p>
 <p>“Alright, I’ll talk to him. We’ll find a time and go home for dinner. But…”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s tone hardened when she continued, “You cannot get mad at Ye Zhongjue. If you do, I will walk away with him immediately!”</p>
 <p>Mo Zhenfeng did not expect Mo Suqing to say something like that. He put one hand on his chest and almost collapsed.</p>
 <p>“You are…” But Mo Suqing&nbsp;hung&nbsp;up before he could even finish the sentence.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing sat down on her chair, exhausted. Leng Xiyao slid over and asked curiously, “Didn’t you go on a date? Why are you so upset?”</p>
 <p>“You have no idea!” Mo Suqing took a moment to cope with her emotions before explaining, “During lunch, Mo Sulian showed up. I gave her dressing-down and she must have told my father I got married afterwards. My father wants me to take Ye Zhongjue home.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao pursed her lips after a momentary shock and said lightly, “Bring him home then! It’s no big deal. You have already got married, so there’s nothing he can do. There is no way he can force you to file for divorce, now is there? That would be a huge joke!”</p>
 <p>Without responding, Mo Suqing bowed her head and seemed to be lost in thought.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao added, “Mo Sulian is seriously over the top! Did&nbsp;she forget who she was? I could beat her up!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing gave her a look and teased, “Yao, you shouldn’t talk like a hooligan all the time. I’m afraid no one would want to marry you!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao blurted out without thinking, “Humph, no one would want to marry <em>you</em>!”</p>
 <p>Then, she remembered that Mo Suqing&nbsp;was already&nbsp;married.</p>
 <p>She looked at Mo Suqing with two huge, watery eyes like a pitiable puppy wagging her tail and begging to be petted. “You bullied me!”</p>
 <p>Then, she turned her back to her and started to work.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing grinned, a little exasperated.</p>
 <p>Alas! No doubt it would be another disturbing dinner this time. Unfortunately, she could do nothing but face it.</p>
 <p>When it was about time to get off work, Mo Suqing called Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>“Hey…”</p>
 <p>Hearing her gentle voice from the other end of the line, a smile spread over Ye Zhongjue’s face. “What’s up?”</p>
 <p>“What are you doing?”</p>
 <p>“Working, of course. Otherwise, how will I be able to provide for my babe?” Ye Zhongjue teased.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing blushed. “Well, you are free after work today, aren’t you?”</p>
 <p>There was a knock on the door. Ye Zhongjue said, “Come in.”</p>
 <p>Song Pingting opened the door and entered his office cautiously. “President, I just want to check…”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue held up his hand, stopping her short. “Yeah, I’m free. What’s up?” His voice was very tender.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing thought she had heard a woman’s voice at the other end of the line. She frowned a little and asked, “Are you talking with someone?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue cast Song Pingting a glance. She was standing in front of his desk, looking like she was feeling awkward.</p>
 <p>He shook his head and replied, “No, I was just saying hello to a colleague, nothing more.”</p>
 <p>Song Pingting was astonished at his words. <em>A colleague? Who is the president talking to? Not only is his voice extremely tender, but he also described her as a colleague. Is it true that he has someone he cares about?</em></p>
 <p>Song Pingting was acutely aware of the disparity. Although Ye Zhongjue had never really “seen” her, he had been no different with everyone else. He was very emphatic about equal treatment and never favored anyone.</p>
 <p>She was immeasurably envious of the person at the other end of the line.</p>
 <p>“Okay…” Mo Suqing nodded thoughtfully.</p>
 <p>“The thing is, Mo Sulian told my father about us. I&nbsp;hid&nbsp;from my family the fact that we are married, as you know very well, but now they&nbsp;have&nbsp;found out and&nbsp;are urging&nbsp;me to take you home sometime for dinner. I’m wondering if you are free tonight.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s face revealed a mischievous grin. <em>Sounds like our relationship is going official!</em></p>
 <p>He replied smilingly, “Suqing, are you finally willing to validate our marriage?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing had just drunk some water from a glass when she heard Ye Zhongjue’s words. She choked, making the water spurt out of her mouth.</p>
 <p>Looking at the computer screen&nbsp;covered in her spit, Mo Suqing felt helpless with the culprit at the other end of the line.</p>
 <p>“Can’t you be a little more indirect?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing sounded really pissed off. Ye Zhongjue figured if he were there with her, she would likely have torn him into pieces by now.</p>
 <p>“More indirect, you say?” he grinned. “Well… how about the reality can finally be justified?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing choked again. If she had drunk another mouthful of water, it would definitely have sprayed the screen all over once more.</p>
 <p>She began to wipe it with some tissues while saying, “Enough of the flirting! That’s it. We are going back to my family home after work. I’m hanging up.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue reluctantly&nbsp;hung&nbsp;up the phone, his eyes still affectionate.</p>
 <p>Song Pingting was utterly speechless. The smile in Ye Zhongjue’s eyes made her so jealous of the girl. At the same time, she could not help but long for it.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked up and saw the desirous look on Song Pingting’s face. He coughed a little and said, “What’s up?”</p>
 <p>Song Pingting snapped out of her reverie and looked at Ye Zhongjue embarrassedly. She quickly put herself together and briefed him on tomorrow’s schedule.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue bowed his head in deep thought. After a long while, he looked up and waved his hand.</p>
 <p>“Okay, thanks. you can go now.”</p>
 <p>Song Pingting walked away. Ye Zhongjue watched her and slipped into thoughts.</p>
 <p>He was aware of Song Pingting’s feelings for him. Normally, he would not allow someone like her to continue to work for him.</p>
 <p>It was because Song Pingting had worked for him for more than three years ever since she graduated from college and they had developed a good sense of teamwork that he had not wanted to fire her.</p>
 <p>However, if she could not control her feelings, he would be forced to find another head secretary to replace her.</p>
 <p>After work, Ye Zhongjue drove to the headquarters of Trend Magazine.</p>
 <p>Just as he was starting to call Mo Suqing, she came out from the building and got into his car.</p>
 <p>The car headed towards the Mo’s villa. Ye Zhongjue remembered the road from when he gave Mo Suqing a lift home to pick up her luggage when they had just got married.</p>
 <p>On their way there, Mo Suqing seemed to be a little restless. She said, “I think Mo Sulian might have exaggerated her version of the story. I could see my father wasn’t too happy about us when he called me. Don’t take it personally if he is in a temper tonight.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue nodded and comforted her, “Don’t worry, I won’t.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing nodded and sank back into thoughts.</p>
 <p>After a while, she turned towards him again.</p>
 <p>“Seriously, don’t take it too personally about their behaviors… I don’t quite get along with any of them…”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing knitted her brows together, not knowing how to explain to Ye Zhongjue the complicated relationships between her family members.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue, with one hand on the steering wheel and the other on her hand, gave her a comforting look.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. I can handle whatever situation it is.”</p>
 <p>Then, he chuckled. “Why are you much more nervous than me, when I am the one who is going to meet&nbsp;the&nbsp;in-laws for the first time?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing felt a bit uneasy at the thought. A meeting with&nbsp;the&nbsp;in-laws… Even though she had got married, she still felt this was not something of her concern. Ye Zhongjue had never talked about it either, which, as a matter of fact, had made her feel better.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue had already done some research on Mo Suqing’s family background, so he knew very well what she was thinking.</p>
