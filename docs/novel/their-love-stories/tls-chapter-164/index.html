<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao was surprisingly very serious about what she said as she continued speaking to Mo Suqing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“I’m going to A University to learn jewelry design. I don’t want to continue mucking about anymore, and I want to pursue my dreams. Even if I don’t become a jewelry designer, I will know that I have tried, and I will have no regrets.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing was not at all astonished when she heard this. She knew that although Leng Xiyao was playful, she would not joke about something like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">In order for Leng Xiyao to make this decision, she must have thought about it long and hard.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Since you’ve already decided, I’ll support you on this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Thank you, Suqing. Muacks! Okay, talk later, I’ll need to fill up the application. I’m sure it’ll be quite bothersome.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Mm, go ahead. I believe in you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing suddenly felt a little downcast after she ended the call.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Yao was working to pursue her dreams, but she, on the other hand, was now without a job.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Because of her pregnancy, Ye Zhongjue did not want her to continue going to work. He was overly worried about her, especially ever since she had gotten kidnapped.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">But she was so bored being stuck at home.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She would be left all alone when Ye Zhongjue left for the office.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Although Leng Haoyun owned Trend Magazine, she could not possibly keep applying to go on leave for the entire duration of her pregnancy either.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing thus decided to resign when she was taking care of Ye Zhongjue in the hospital.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Her plan was to look for a new job after she had her baby.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing was sitting on the sofa daydreaming when the doorbell rang. She was much more careful now, and looked at the camera display to check who it was before opening the door. It was Guan Zixuan, looking dishevelled and restless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing opened the door unceremoniously.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“What happened to you? Why do you look like this? Did you get robbed or tortured? Why did you come here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Guan Zixuan smiled at her like a sly old fox.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“I was afraid that you’d be bored alone, so I’m here to keep you company!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing rolled her eyes at this. “Don’t give me that! If you’re really here just for a chat, you wouldn’t look like that! Please take a good look at yourself before you tell a lie.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Guan Zixuan gave an awkward smile as he scratched his head. “I’ve been found out! It’s just that my fans are too crazy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing scoffed, “Demented fans who are out of their minds?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Guan Zixuan stared at her wide-eyed as he tried to defend his fans.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“They’re not! My fans are adorable and smart, it’s just that they can get a teeny bit crazy at times. Don’t bad-mouth them like this!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Oh,” Mo Suqing looked at him and deliberately continued, “Actually, you’ve misunderstood. I thought they were food. Cornflour, duck blood and vermicelli, leek leaf flour, sweet potato flour, wide noodles, thin noodles, hand-made noodles. I was wondering which of these would be most delicious. You were overthinking it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing spoke as if she was reading a tongue twister. <a href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Guan Zixuan was slightly stumped, and he trudged towards the sofa lazily. He sat down and mumbled to himself, “Was I really overthinking?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He thought about it again. <em>Wait! She described his fans as food!</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He looked back at Mo Suqing, eyebrows raised. “Don’t say that! They’re not things, they are my fans who are very dear to me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Mhmm!” Mo Suqing nodded, suppressing her laughter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“They’re not objects!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Guan Zixuan was staring at her now. “Why did you insult them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“I was just going along with your logic! Think about it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing settled into the other sofa, thinking to herself, <em>It’s pretty nice having someone to talk to.</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Guan Zixuan pondered over this for quite a while. “I think I was the first to mention that they’re not things!”&nbsp;<a href="#footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing laughed and said, “See, you said it yourself first. And you didn’t believe me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Oh… right! Suqing, when are you planning to promote me from being a male friend to being your boyfriend? It’s been such a difficult journey. I’ve tried so hard to pursue you but you still treat me as a good friend. My heart really hurts!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He then clutched at his chest as if it was hurting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing rolled her eyes again.<em>&nbsp;He’s really born to be an actor. That didn’t look the least bit awkward or unnatural.</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Don’t you know I’m already married? I don’t need a boyfriend, so you can continue being my friend!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Guan Zixuan appeared overwhelmed with sadness. “My heart has stopped beating… It knows it’s been rejected again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Guan Zixuan’s antics improved Mo Suqing’s mood greatly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Trying her best not to laugh, she said, “You’d be dead if your heart stopped beating. If it’s beating weakly but you’re still alive, I might even be able to earn some money if I interviewed you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“You’re horrid! You’re actually trying to make use of me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing laughed. “Well, women are indeed vicious!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Guan Zixuan stiffened and fell back onto the sofa, acting like he had really died. Mo Suqing was very amused.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">It took a lot of courage for Guan Zixuan to finally show Mo Suqing how he felt, but he did not wish to show how dejected he really felt for fear of upsetting her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Though he was aware she was married, it still hurt hearing her say that she had a husband. Even so, there was nothing he could do about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">While Mo Suqing bickered with Guan Zixuan, Leng Xiyao told Leng Haoyun of her intention to take jewelry design at A University. After thinking about it for a moment, Leng Haoyun agreed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao was not that naive to think that she would be able to successfully enter simply by applying. If Leng Haoyun did not help to pull some strings, she most likely would not have the opportunity to attend university a second time.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">After settling the application for A University, all she had to do was wait for the results.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao decided to put the second part of her plan into action. She wanted to get Ceng Hanyu to take her to An Zhenguo.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">If this was her only blood related relative, and he had never stopped searching for her, she definitely wanted to meet him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">It was not her grandfather’s fault that she went missing. Moreover, there was no need for him to feel guilty over what happened. His granddaughter was right here, but he did not dare acknowledge her. She felt that she was at fault for this, for acting so emotional when she heard the truth. Her grandfather would definitely feel wretched if he knew how she had reacted.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Although Leng Xiyao had decided upon this, she was still afraid of facing it alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She ended up calling Mo Suqing so that she had a friend for company. She felt that she would become braver with Mo Suqing around.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">When Mo Suqing told her that Guan Zixuan insisted on tagging along, Leng Xiyao made no further comment though she found it rather unusual.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Okay, it’s also safer for you if he keeps you company. I’ll wait for you at my place!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing and Guan Zixuan arrived half an hour later, and they went straight to Ceng Hanyu immediately after picking Leng Xiyao up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Just after the three of them left, An Huilin arrived at the Leng’s villa in her car.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She made a beeline for Leng Haoyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun was waiting for her in the study. He glanced at her as she walked in, but looked away after giving that glamorous outfit of hers a quick once-over.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Huilin smiled sweetly at him. “Haoyun, what is so urgent that you wanted to talk to me about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She was in a good mood today, because this was the very first time Leng Haoyun invited her over. She had not been to the Leng’s villa for quite a while now.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Instead of looking at her, Leng Haoyun directed his gaze towards the window.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“I have something to tell you.” He spoke without emotion.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun turned and made eye contact with her as he spoke. “I’ve decided to cancel the marriage. You can say you were the one who asked for it so that your reputation won’t be tainted!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Huilin paled instantly. She could not process what Leng Haoyun just said.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><em>He invited me over just to tell me that he’s cancelling the marriage? How can he be so cruel?</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">This was a major fall from grace!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Huilin could only look on in complete incredulity as Leng Haoyun continued mercilessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“This is the best way forward in my opinion. What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He added, “We’ve known each other for so many years, so I don’t want to make things too difficult either!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">An Huilin was extremely distressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“What do you mean by not making things too difficult? Leng Haoyun, you shouldn’t be doing this to me if you value our relationship. Getting me to say that I asked for it in order not to taint my reputation? It’s already gone with all those years that I’ve spent waiting for you! Leng Haoyun, do you even have a conscience?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun frowned in front of the hysterical An Huilin.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“I’m going to repeat myself very clearly. I have never asked you to wait for me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">n Huilin’s tears started falling. <em>That’s all he has to say? He wants me to leave by saying that he had never asked me to wait for him?</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Is it because of Leng Xiyao?” It took great effort for An Huilin to hold back her tears.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“You don’t need to know this!” Leng Haoyun answered coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Ha ha ha...” An Huilin gave a hollow laugh which sounded almost like a cackle.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Leng Haoyun, you’re really cruel, you’re really...” She gritted her teeth, at a loss for words. Leng Haoyun, on the other hand, did not seem to be affected at all. He treated her like a stranger would, and he could even bring up the matter of cancelling the marriage like it was nothing. He had really hurt her deeply this time!</span></p>
