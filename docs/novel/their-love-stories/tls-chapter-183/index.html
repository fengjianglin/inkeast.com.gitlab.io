 <p>Mo Suqing paused, gun still in hand.</p>
 <p>She then replied calmly, “Mm, I trust you on this!”</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng laughed, and Mo Suqing continued with her practice.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The days passed uneventfully, and Mo Suqing was already five months into her pregnancy. The bulge in her tummy could no longer be hidden.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue accompanied Mo Suqing for a visit to the gynaecologist.</p>
 <p>They sat in the corridor as they waited for their turn.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s heart was filled with warmth. Both of them were looking forward to welcoming a new member of the family, and they were basking in the warmth and happiness of this!</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue wanted to get a top expert in the field to do the check-ups for her, but Mo Suqing insisted on doing things like an ordinary person would, saying that it would make her journey towards motherhood feel more complete.</p>
 <p>She wanted to experience everything.</p>
 <p>Smiling sweetly, Mo Suqing leaned against him. “Dear, do you want a son or a daughter?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s brows raised. <em>You’ve asked me this countless times.</em></p>
 <p>If he said he wanted a daughter, Mo Suqing would pout and say he doesn’t love his son, but if he said he wanted a son, she would whine and say she wanted a daughter.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was in a bind. Having a conversation with a pregnant lady was no easy task, and he was still at the elementary level!</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing tugged at him. “Why aren’t you answering? You don’t like kids? Then I’ll go and….”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue took her in a gentle embrace before she could finish her sentence. He coaxed her softly.</p>
 <p>“My dear, what are you thinking about! How is it possible I don’t like my own child! I’ll like them as long as you give birth to them!”</p>
 <p>Seeing Mo Suqing smile in satisfaction, Ye Zhongjue sighed in relief.</p>
 <p>It was finally their turn, and Ye Zhongjue supported her to enter the room for her check-up.</p>
 <p>After a series of tests, the doctor said the baby was very healthy.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue asked the doctor eagerly, “Doctor, is it a boy or a girl?”</p>
 <p>The doctor gave him a look, and immediately assumed that he was the type who preferred sons over daughters. He scoffed, “I can’t believe there are still people who have such old-fashioned mindsets of wanting to have sons. According to the rules in our hospital, we’re not supposed to reveal the baby’s sex beforehand!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s face darkened.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing held onto the report and grabbed his arm to lead him out of the room.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s expression was even more dreadful now. <em>Wasn’t she the one who had been so curious? Why did it now look like he was the one who was eager to know?</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing knew he was upset again, so she tried cajoling him.</p>
 <p>“My dear, there’s no need to be so angry. That doctor is going through menopause and she’s just being rude, so don’t mind it!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue shook his head at this and looked at her with loving eyes.</p>
 <p>“Didn’t you want to know if the baby was a boy or a girl? This was why I asked.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing playfully stuck her tongue out at him. “I’m not actually that curious, I just wanted to know what you think. I’m more excited to actually find out after giving birth!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue ruffled her hair and supported her as they walked back to the car.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan was waiting for them at the entrance when they arrived back home. He was holding a suitcase.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing looked at him quizzically. “Zixuan, this is?”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan seemed anxious. “I’m here to bid you farewell. Something happened back at home, and I’ll have to go back. I don’t know when I can return to A City, so Suqing, …make sure you take care of yourself!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue could tell that something major had happened in Emperor City by observing Guan Zixuan’s behaviour. The latter would not leave so suddenly otherwise.</p>
 <p>But he knows how to take care of his wife on his own.</p>
 <p>He spoke with a tinge of indignance. “I’ll take care of my wife myself!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was rendered speechless at his reaction, and rolled her eyes at his childish behaviour.</p>
 <p>“Nobody will think you’re mute even if you don’t speak!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s face dimmed. <em>This pregnant lady is getting more gutsy by the day!</em></p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan gave them a blank look. He could only wish them all the best now, and he was happy as long as she was happy!</p>
 <p>“Okay, I’ve got to go now. All the best!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan then left.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s eyes reddened. She cried out, “Zixuan!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan paused, but instead of turning back, he took a deep breath and continued forward.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing teared up. Ye Zhongjue could only hug her tight as he tried his best to console her.</p>
 <p>She sniffed as she looked at Guan Zixuan’s departing figure, and her voice was nasal as she yelled.</p>
 <p>“Yao is gone, and Guan Zixuan is gone too! I have no more friends!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue lowered his head to gently kiss her on the forehead. “You still have me!”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan headed directly to the airport.</p>
 <p>His flight was scheduled to take off soon, so he rushed towards the departure gate as soon as he alighted.</p>
 <p>However, he bumped into someone on the way.</p>
 <p>A crisp, angry voice rang out. “Are you blind!”</p>
 <p>Afraid of getting recognized and missing his flight, Guan Zixuan wanted to leave after apologizing quickly. He did not expect for the other person to stop him.</p>
 <p>Someone grabbed his arm and he heard a voice say, “Your apology wasn’t even sincere!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan looked up to take a good look at this person, but when he did, a lady dressed in black from head to toe had dragged the person away.</p>
 <p>For a moment, he thought he saw Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>He shook his head to clear the image from his mind, and turned to take a second look. But this time, there was no one to be seen.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan thought it was his eyes fooling him. He just said goodbye to Mo Suqing, so why would she be here!</p>
 <p>He thus continued towards the departure gate without giving it further thought.</p>
 <p>A’zi held onto Luo Qiqi’s arm and dragged her all the way out of the airport.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi spoke excitedly, “Did you see that? Isn’t he the international superstar Guan Zixuan? He’s from China and he just returned to the country this year. I think it was him. I could’ve gotten his autograph if you didn’t pull me away earlier!”</p>
 <p>Exasperated, Xia Zi turned to look at her. “Yes, it was him, but with how loud you were, we would’ve been surrounded the instant you call out his name. So, you should count yourself lucky that I pulled you away!”</p>
 <p>Xia Zi then continued dragging Luo Qiqi to get a car.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi was unhappy. “What a waste!”</p>
 <p>Xia Zi shook her head at Luo Qiqi’s incessant grumbling. Passersby were already stealing glances at them with their gorgeous looks!</p>
 <p><em>Seriously, what is she even thinking!</em></p>
 <p>“Oh! Right!” Xia Zi gave Luo Qiqi a sudden squeeze on the arm.</p>
 <p>“Qiqi, where shall we stay this time?”</p>
 <p>They had received confirmation about The Dark Night’s activities in A City, and Xia Zi expected that they would need to stay for quite a while this time. It was no easy task tracking The Dark Night, and they would likely need more time to do so. They had to be ready for a prolonged battle!</p>
 <p>“If you don’t mind cleaning up on your own, we can go to the villa at Shallow Sea, otherwise, we can check in at a hotel!”</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi frowned as she pondered over this. She had to do the housework if they stayed in the villa, since they did not trust anyone else to do it, and it also felt like an invasion of her personal space.</p>
 <p>She was too lazy to do the chores, and it was such a huge villa.</p>
 <p>“Then… let’s check in to a hotel!” Luo Qiqi laughed and looked at Xia Zi mischievously.</p>
 <p>XIa Zi shot her a cold look. She had expected such an answer, and thus had already booked a hotel.</p>
 <p>“To Tianyu Hotel!”</p>
 <p>Surprised, Luo Qiqi asked, “You already booked it?”</p>
 <p>“What do you think!” Xia Zi then closed her eyes to rest them.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi was silently annoyed. <em>Would it kill you to say a few more words!</em></p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue had basically decided to work from home after Guan Zixuan left A City.</p>
 <p>Because of this, Mo Suqing did not have the chance to go to Su Jincheng’s place for shooting practice, and her pregnancy also made it more and more difficult for her to do so.</p>
 <p>Nonetheless, she had to find a way to tell Su Jincheng about this.</p>
 <p>Her opportunity came when Ye Zhongjue told her to stay home one morning as he had to return to the office to get something.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing nodded, secretly excited about this.</p>
 <p>She sneaked off to Su Jincheng’s villa immediately after Ye Zhongjue left.</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng looked at her clumsy self and reached out to support her. He was surprised at how large her tummy was when she was only five months into her pregnancy. To him, she looked like she was about seven to eight months into it.</p>
 <p><em>I wonder what Ye Zhongjue is feeding her!</em></p>
 <p>“Why did you come over? Isn’t it difficult for you to move around like this!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing frowned. “Su Jincheng, I’m here to tell you that I won’t be coming over for shooting practice anymore. I don’t have the time now, and Ye Zhongjue is staying home to take care of me, so he won’t let me sneak out either.”</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng looked at her, speechless. “You’re here just because of this?”</p>
 <p>“That’s right!” Mo Suqing nodded seriously.</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng then asked, “Mobile number?”</p>
 <p>“132-XXXX-XXXX!”</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng dialled the number on his own phone.</p>
 <p>“Okay, save my number and just call me next time. Don’t move around like this. It’s dangerous if nobody else is around to support you!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing stuck her tongue out at him and nodded. “Got it!”</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng wanted to walk her back, but he suddenly thought of something else.</p>
 <p>“Wait a moment. I’ll get something from upstairs before sending you back!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing nodded as she watched him make his way upstairs.</p>
