 <p>Ye Zhongjue gave the manager a stern stare to prevent him from saying anything stupid. The manager stopped in his tracks and dared not come any closer.</p>
 <p>Then, suddenly, he noticed the woman beside Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p><em>Isn’t she one of the girls who have fallen out with Black Dragon the other night?&nbsp;</em>he thought in alarm.</p>
 <p>Seeing how their fingers were entwined, the manager immediately felt he had made a huge mistake.</p>
 <p><em>Why didn’t I call the security to stop Black Dragon? She is no one but the president’s woman!</em></p>
 <p>He looked like he was gonna cry. Thinking back, he remembered that Black Dragon had gone missing afterwards. Rumor had it that he had incurred the wrath of someone unoffendable.</p>
 <p>But little had he expected the “someone” was the man right in front of him.</p>
 <p>In fact, the manager didn’t know Black Dragon had incurred the wrath of more than one unoffendable person that night.</p>
 <p>After all, Ye Zhongjue hadn’t known about the truth until earlier today. When he sent people to hunt down Black Dragon, they couldn’t find him anymore.</p>
 <p>They only knew that Leng Xiyao had been taken home by Leng Haoyun from the pub.</p>
 <p>Knowing how much Leng Haoyun cared about his niece, Ye Zhongjue reckoned Black Dragon was either dead or handicapped now.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue tugged Mo Suqing’s hand and walked toward his VIP room, leaving the manager behind with nothing more than a simple instruction, “Ask Ceng Hanyu to find me in my room when he arrives.”</p>
 <p>The manager nodded.</p>
 <p>It was only seven o’clock when Ye Zhongjue and Mo Suqing walked into the room. Ceng Hanyu hadn’t arrived yet.</p>
 <p>Although they seemed to have made up in the afternoon, when they were alone, Mo Suqing found herself a little unhappy with him still.</p>
 <p>After all, it was impossible not to be at least a little bit upset with him as he had gone missing for a few days. However, women were sentimental animals. All it took was some placation to curb her anger.</p>
 <p>But, she really didn’t know how to tackle the work problem.</p>
 <p>Therefore, the two of them fell into silence again.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue sighed in resignation. <em>Looks like it</em><em>’s going to take</em><em>&nbsp;a long time to appease her!</em></p>
 <p>He came closer, held her hand and drew her into his chest.</p>
 <p>Then, he poked her nose slightly and asked, “Honey, what’s wrong? Are you unhappy? Where did I do wrong?”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, tears began to pour down Mo Suqing’s face.</p>
 <p>She was never the crying type of a girl. However, Ye Zhongjue had successively left her without saying anything and showed up all of a sudden. It had been like a roller-coaster ride, and she did not like it at all.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked at a sobbing Mo Suqing, feeling ached. He leaned in and tenderly dried her tears with kisses.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s eyes widened. She stared at him and stopped crying.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue chuckled at her cute reaction.</p>
 <p>“Silly! It’s all my fault. I’ll never pick fights&nbsp;or get angry with you anymore, okay? Shh…”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing nodded obediently.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked at the time. “They should be here soon.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing stood up. “I’m going to freshen up. Otherwise, they will laugh at you when they see my face!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue gazed at her tenderly and shook his head. “I don’t mind it…”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing rolled her eyes. “How about I do mind it?”</p>
 <p>Then, she walked into the restroom.</p>
 <p>When Ceng Hanyu and Gu Yi'an arrived, Mo Suqing was still&nbsp;not back yet.</p>
 <p>They both brought a woman with them, so that Mo Suqing wouldn’t feel ill at ease.</p>
 <p>Gu Yi'an was another good friend of Ye Zhongjue. He was a gentle creature and the least talkative among the three.</p>
 <p>Moreover, he was also a member of Sin Eliminators. He used to handle the affairs of the organization with Ceng Hanyu and Ye Zhongjue during unstable times.</p>
 <p>Nowadays, he seldom interfered&nbsp;with&nbsp;the business. He was a doctor in profession and preferred saving lives.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue and Ceng Hanyu had supported his decision.</p>
 <p>After all, Sin Eliminators was stable now and kept expanding.</p>
 <p>Upon entering the room, Ceng Hanyu and Gu Yi’an saw Ye Zhongjue was alone.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu teased, “What? You didn’t bring your wife? I knew I was deceived! I even brought a date, so that she wouldn’t be too lonely!”</p>
 <p>Gu Yi’an’s mouth twitched and he stepped aside to separate himself from Ceng Hanyu.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue gave Ceng Hanyu a despising look without replying. Ceng Hanyu sat down and crossed his legs, totally making himself at home. There was no need to behave when Ye Zhongjue’s wife was not here.</p>
 <p>Gu Yi’an, too, sat down casually. Ye Zhongjue had prepared some wine.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu opened a Lafite and poured some in everyone’s glass.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue raised his eyebrows at his glass and ignored Ceng Hanyu’s gesture.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu complained, “Jue, why are you acting like this? Even though your wife didn’t come──”</p>
 <p>The door to the restroom rustled before he could finish.</p>
 <p>He stared at the door in alarm. <em>There’s someone else here? Ye Zhongjue, why didn’t&nbsp;</em><em>you say anything!</em></p>
 <p>He cursed endlessly, <em>Ye Zhongjue, you bastard! Why didn’t you tell me!</em></p>
 <p>Of course, he didn’t say it out loud. If he did, Ye Zhongjue would most likely give him a good beating! No, his combat skills were far poorer than Ye Zhongjue’s. He would probably get killed!</p>
 <p>Yes, Ye Zhongjue’s combat skills were so remarkable, even God would have been jealous.</p>
 <p>He could still remember when Sin Eliminators had first been founded and was in need of a lot of money. Ye Zhongjue had signed a “life or death” agreement with someone in order to win the prize.</p>
 <p>It turned out he had worried about him for nothing. Ye Zhongjue had pinned the other guy down and beaten him to death.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu looked toward the person who had just emerged from the restroom.</p>
 <p>He was glad to see Ye Zhongjue had kept his promise and brought his wife.</p>
 <p>He smiled at the beautiful woman. However, she was so startled to see him that she rushed over to Ye Zhongjue’s side, grabbed his arm, and looked at Ceng Hanyu warily.</p>
 <p>There was a reason for her reaction. It was because she remembered him to be among the group of men who just looked on merrily when she was being bullied by Black Dragon!</p>
 <p>Apparently, she didn’t realize he was Ye Zhongjue’s friend. All she could think of was what had happened that night.</p>
 <p>She thought he must have appeared in their room to pick on her.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue, noticing Mo Suqing’s unusually scared expression, glared at Ceng Hanyu, as if to demand, <em>What have you done to my wife to frighten her thus?</em></p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu felt wronged. He stepped closer and said, “Hey, sister, why are you so afraid of me? I don’t think we have met before?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue gave him a look. <em>It’s a pure lie! If he didn’t meet her before, where&nbsp;</em><em>did</em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>&nbsp;the video he showed&nbsp;</em><em>me come from</em><em>?</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing shrank away from him instinctively, although she understood what was happening now. The man was Ye Zhongjue’s friend.</p>
 <p>Hiding herself behind Ye Zhongjue, she looked at Ceng Hanyu in exasperation and said, “Humph, you weren’t this friendly when you watched me get bullied the other night!”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu was speechless. He had known the woman wasn’t easy. How could she, in her predicament, have noticed the onlookers was beyond him.</p>
 <p>Even Gu Yi’an, who was usually expressionless, smiled.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu felt remorseful. This was what they called “fry in one's own grease”! Alas, and to think he had even recorded a video!</p>
 <p>He wanted to explain himself, but with Ye Zhongjue sitting there and staring at him,&nbsp;</p>
 <p>he could only resort to being nice, hoping they would take pity on him.</p>
 <p>“Sister, I didn’t know who you were at that time! Please, could you find it in your heart to forgive me?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing knew she must save his face because he was Ye Zhongjue’s friend, although it wouldn’t hurt to mess around with him a little.</p>
 <p>“What if I don’t forgive you?” she asked.</p>
 <p>“Then I’ll offer my life as an apology!” Ceng Hanyu swiped his hand across his neck as if it was a knife.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing laughed. She leaned against Ye Zhongjue’s shoulder and said, “Alright, alright. I’ll forgive you.”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu quickly sat down and poured some wine in a glass.</p>
 <p>Handing her the wine, he said playfully, “I knew you’re a generous woman! You won’t get petty with me.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing took the glass smilingly.</p>
 <p>The men began to drink and chat; Mo Suqing chipped in once in a while. The atmosphere was neither too jovial nor too dry.</p>
 <p>After a while, Ceng Hanyu suggested, “Let’s play truth or dare! I have a deck of cards here. Whoever draws the highest-valued card can ask whoever draws the lowest-valued card a question that must be answered truthfully or simply dare the person to do one thing. What do you think?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing raised her hand gleefully in agreement. “Okay!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue seldom saw her this happy and wild.</p>
 <p>He cast Ceng Hanyu a glance. <em>This</em> <em>I can give him credit.</em></p>
 <p>Excited, Mo Suqing was the first to draw a card from the deck. Then, Ye Zhongjue drew one with an aloof expression on his face.</p>
 <p>The others drew theirs one by one. As a result, Mo Suqing got a four of hearts, Ye Zhongjue a king of hearts, Ceng Hanyu an ace of clubs, Gu Yi’an a ten of spades, and the two dates a six of spades and a queen of hearts respectively.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing, unfortunately, was the one with the lowest-valued card.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu, who got the highest-valued card, smiled slyly like a fox. Mo Suqing’s heart skipped a beat. She felt something ominous was about to happen.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu beamed at her. “Sister, truth or dare?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing hesitated for a while. In the end, her dark past stopped her from choosing to reveal a truth about herself.</p>
 <p>Her expression was that of a martyr when she replied:&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’ll go with dare!”</p>
