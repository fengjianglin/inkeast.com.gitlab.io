 <p>Mo Suqing shook her head.</p>
 <p>“Nope. She has never talked to me about it, I only knew she had an uncle. But it’s quite clear now that she doesn’t seem to have any other relatives apart from Leng Haoyun. Her parents passed away when she was only ten.”</p>
 <p>“Has she ever said that she wished she had other relatives?” Ceng Hanyu asked nervously.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing looked at him quizzically. “Other relatives? Like?”</p>
 <p>“Like a grandfather, a fiance, people like that!” Ceng Hanyu asked Mo Suqing earnestly.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing almost burst out laughing.</p>
 <p>She could understand the part about wanting a grandfather, but wanting a fiance is unlikely, unless she was forced into an engagement by Leng Haoyun and went insane.</p>
 <p>She pondered over it as she glanced at Leng Haoyun.</p>
 <p>“You’re overthinking it. In Yao’s heart, Leng Haoyun is her closest relative. No one else can compare to him. Moreover, her parents had passed on when she was still very young, and I’ve heard that her grandfather has been dead for years.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing thought to herself, <em>He can’t rise from the grave as a living corpse, can he!</em></p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu looked slightly disappointed at what she just said, but she paid no heed to it.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu walked her to the entrance of the ward. “Jue really loves you, and I’ve never seen him hold onto anyone so tightly. I hope you understand. Please don’t let him down, no matter who he is, his love for you will never change. I’ll head out first, go on in.”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu left after he said his piece.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing entered the ward and looked at Ye Zhongjue. Although he is unconscious, his brows were still furrowed, as if he was extremely worried about something.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing felt hurt and upset as she took in that expression of his. <em>What an idiot!</em></p>
 <p>She walked over and sat by the edge of the bed before reaching out to smoothen those furrowed brows on his forehead.</p>
 <p>She no longer wanted to quarrel with him anymore. She just wanted to spend lots of time with him after he wakes up.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing fell asleep after a while.</p>
 <p>----</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue recalled Mo Suqing’s harsh words before he passed out. He was unable to defend himself, but it had hurt him so deeply.</p>
 <p>He did not want to show her his weak side, but all he remembered was that he spat out a mouthful of blood before toppling over.</p>
 <p>He seemed to recall Mo Suqing crying by his side. He had wanted to reach out to wipe her tears away, but his arm was just too heavy and he could not move it at all.</p>
 <p>He was already in the hospital when he awoke again. He thought that it would be the same this time, that she would not be there.</p>
 <p>But he never expected to see a tiny head right beside the bed.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue thought he had ascended to heaven. Why else would he be able to see her here?</p>
 <p>Looking at her posture, Ye Zhongjue thought it must be uncomfortable. His pregnant wife probably stayed in such a hunched position for a prolonged period of time.</p>
 <p><em>Silly girl. No matter how harsh her words were, she’s still the kind girl I know.</em></p>
 <p>He reached out to stroke her hair.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was not in a deep sleep, and she jolted awake when she felt someone touching her hair.</p>
 <p>She looked at Ye Zhongjue with sleepy eyes. A smile hung on his lips as he looked sweetly at her.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing looked like she was still in a daze. Ye Zhongjue’s heart melted when he saw her face.</p>
 <p>“Silly girl, why are you hunching over the side of the bed? Isn’t that uncomfortable? Did you forget that you’re pregnant now?”</p>
 <p>Hot tears escaped Mo Suqing’s eyes. He cared about her so much, but all she did was to make him angry.</p>
 <p>It was obvious that Gu Yi’an was indirectly addressing her when he said everything outside the operating theater.</p>
 <p>But everything he said was true.<em>&nbsp;I’m so horrid. If I didn’t keep blaming him, Ye Zhongjue would not feel so frustrated either. If anything happens to him, I’d regret it for life!</em></p>
 <p>Like a little animal, Mo Suqing sniffed and looked at Ye Zhongjue with teary eyes. She pulled on his arm.</p>
 <p>“I was afraid that you’d never wake up...”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue laughed. “You’re here, silly. I won’t sleep forever!”</p>
 <p>He turned slightly and tapped the space on the bed next to him. “Come up! Lie here. Let’s cuddle and sleep. It’s not good for the baby if you keep hunching like that. You won’t get a good sleep either!”</p>
 <p>Shaking her head, Mo Suqing pursed her lips in disagreement.</p>
 <p>“No, I’ll hit your wound.”</p>
 <p>“You won’t. Nothing will happen if I don’t make any huge movements.” Ye Zhongjue took her tiny hand in his, smiling as he spoke.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing frowned. She looked so adorable to Ye Zhongjue now that he just wanted to eat her up.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing suddenly felt that Ye Zhongjue was thinking of something dirty now.</p>
 <p>She blinked as she regarded him suspiciously. Her eyes were like the stars in the night sky, dazzling and bright.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue kissed her hand and looked at her gently.</p>
 <p>“Be good, come up and lay here. Your back will hurt tomorrow!” It was either the gentleness or the allure in his voice that made Mo Suqing feel like she was being duped like a little child.</p>
 <p>She listened to Ye Zhongjue in the end. She lay down in his warm hug. She felt so content in that moment, as if nothing else mattered.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue took her in his arms, resting his chin on her head.</p>
 <p>“Will you forgive me, my dear? I promise that I’ll share everything with you from now on. I don’t have any other identities apart from being Mighty Empire’s CEO and the Poisonous Prince of Sin Eliminators, really! I was afraid that you’ll be scared, so I didn’t dare reveal it to you at first. Give me one more chance, okay?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s head was nestled in his chest as she nodded.</p>
 <p>“Mm, I forgive you.”</p>
 <p>Although Mo Suqing spoke extremely softly, Ye Zhongjue was overjoyed when he heard her reply.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing held his arm tightly. “Don’t move, be careful of tearing the wound.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue cuddled her closer.</p>
 <p>This is his wife, the woman he loves the most in this life.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue spoke after a while. “Darling, I’ll take care of the matter with Jian Jie. I’ll transfer her out after I’m discharged. I won’t allow her to continue being my head secretary.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing shook her head, as if upset.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need. That would just affect your work!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue laughed lightly. His laugh was especially enticing in the quiet night.</p>
 <p>“You don’t have to worry, I’ll never let anything hurt you again. Do you know that it pains me if you’re hurt in any way? Changing the head secretary wouldn’t affect anything. I’ll just get Lin Ran to stand in for the time being. I’m sure he wouldn’t mind.”</p>
 <p>“Lin Ran...” Mo Suqing creased her brows. “He seems to be a jack of all trades.”</p>
 <p>“Yup, he’s my special assistant, and he knows about as much as I do. Everyone in the company calls him the super assistant!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing laughed, her head still nestled comfortably.</p>
 <p>The night was chilly.</p>
 <p>Time passed as they chatted, and both of them fell asleep after some time.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing had been taking care of Ye Zhongjue in the hospital after they had made up.</p>
 <p>There were a couple of things that happened during this time which made Mo Suqing less upset.</p>
 <p>The first was Jian Jie coming to visit.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing did not say much, she simply let the other woman in.</p>
 <p>Jian Jie looked at her, red-faced. The jealousy in her could not be masked no matter how impeccable her makeup was.</p>
 <p>Jian Jie did not think they would be able to make up even after all that she said that day.</p>
 <p><em>Fine! Since Mo Suqing refuses to relent, don’t blame me if I plan something else.</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue literally ignored Jian Jie when she tried to talk to him. Jian Jie was furious, but she wanted to maintain a pleasant image and did not blow her top in front of Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>What she did not expect was for Ye Zhongjue to say to Mo Suqing, “Send the guest out, dear. I want to rest now. It’s too noisy beside my ears!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing almost burst out laughing when Ye Zhongjue shot her a purposeful look. <em>What a meanie he was!</em></p>
 <p>However, no matter what he says, someone like Jian Jie would definitely hold a grudge.</p>
 <p>But Mo Suqing did not mind it at all.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue will pay her no heed no matter what Jian Jie does. Mo Suqing believed in Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing walked Jian Jie out.</p>
 <p>When Jian Jie saw the door close, she turned to glare at Mo Suqing, as if she meant to devour the woman.</p>
 <p>“Don’t think that you’ve won, Mo Suqing. I’ll make you regret it one day! Jue is so nice to you now only because you’re pregnant. Don’t believe it? We’ll see about that!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing saw Leng Xiyao walking over before she could retort. Leng Xiyao spoke instead.</p>
 <p>“Certain individuals who are unable to get men’s attention are going crazy here. Gosh, so uncouth!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao shook her head as she spoke, her look a perfect combination of ridicule and disdain.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing smiled at her.</p>
 <p>Jian Jie turned and saw that it was Leng Xiyao. That girl was always ready for a catfight.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao was able to humiliate An Huilin at the Leng’s villa and even made Leng Haoyun hurl insults at her. Jian Jie now knew that Leng Xiyao was not one to be trifled with.</p>
 <p>Jian Jie, however, was not going to back down either.</p>
 <p>“That’s better than some others who are literally parading themselves in front of a man everyday, while said man remains unmoved. It’s better to feel sad than to drown yourself in alcohol even when the man you love gets engaged to another woman. That’s really sad!”</p>
