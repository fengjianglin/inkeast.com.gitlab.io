<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Ye Zhongjue had completely lost his reason. When he finally noticed that Mo Suqing had become all wooden and expressionless, he stopped dead.</p>
 <p>At that moment, he really wanted to kill himself.</p>
 <p>When he went upstairs, he had been determined to talk to her like a grownup. How come everything had come to this?</p>
 <p>He lowered his voice like a child who had done something wrong. “Suqing…”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing looked at him as if he was a total stranger.</p>
 <p>“Are you done? If so, I’m going to sleep!” she said in a cold and distant tone.</p>
 <p>Without looking at his stunned face, Mo Suqing turned her back to him.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue could not believe she had just asked him if “he was done yet.”</p>
 <p>He had just done something beastly to her! <em>She’ll never forgive me… After yearning for so many years, she is still going to slip away from him…</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue knew very well that she was not sleeping. He also knew that she wouldn’t be able to if he was here in the same bed with her.</p>
 <p>He got up slowly, opened the door and walked into his study.</p>
 <p>Everything that had happened tonight was as unrealistic as a dream. He had pushed her further away.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue knew he shouldn’t have done such a thing, but that was exactly what he had done. <em>Am I too possessive?</em></p>
 <p><em>Otherwise, why would I flip out every time I see her with another man?</em></p>
 <p>Annoyed with himself, Ye Zhongjue put his hands over his head and his body slid down against the door.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The next day.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing got up in the morning and noticed that the door to the study was closed. She didn’t pay much attention to it and went to work.</p>
 <p>The dark circles under her eyes indicated that she had not slept well last night.</p>
 <p>But even so, she didn’t care.</p>
 <p>Nothing made her more helpless than being&nbsp;unable to hate the person she liked&nbsp;despite the fact he&nbsp;had forced his way with her.</p>
 <p>That’s right. She couldn’t hate Ye Zhongjue because now she knew very well he had walked into her heart.</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, she couldn’t pretend nothing had happened, either. She was no saint; she couldn’t endure so much grievance and anger.</p>
 <p>Therefore, she chose not to say anything.</p>
 <p>She did not want to speak to or see Ye Zhongjue, at least not now.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue didn’t go to work that day. At noon, Ye Wentian happened to call him at the office. Lin Ran answered the phone, but even a skillful liar like him couldn’t deceive the older man.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t do anything but tell Ye Wentian the truth meekly – the president did not come to work today.</p>
 <p><em>Boss</em><em>&nbsp;will kill me if he knows!&nbsp;</em>he thought with apprehension.</p>
 <p>Ye Wentian called his son and found that he didn’t go to work. Hearing about it, Ming Jinhua immediately started to fret.</p>
 <p>“I hope everything is alright with him.”</p>
 <p>Ye Wentian gave her an exasperated look. “He’s a big boy. Don’t you worry so much!”</p>
 <p>However, Ming Jinhua was still disturbed. Her eyelid had been twitching nonstop, signaling bad luck. That was why she had asked Ye Wentian to call Ye Zhongjue, who had not picked it up. In the end, they had decided to call him at the office.</p>
 <p>It turned out he didn’t even go to work.</p>
 <p>This made Ming Jinhua even more worried. Her instinct told her something must have happened.</p>
 <p>Heedless of Ye Wentian’s attempts to soothe her, she changed her clothes and asked their chauffeur to drive her to Ye Zhongjue’s place.</p>
 <p>Ming Jinhua went up to his apartment and knocked on the door, but no one answered. She found the security and told him what had happened.</p>
 <p>“My son lives here. He didn’t go to work today and I’m really worried about him, so I came here. Could you please open the door for me?”</p>
 <p>The security could see that she was genuinely dismayed and didn’t seem to be lying. “What’s his name?”</p>
 <p>“Ye Zhongjue!”</p>
 <p>The security looked the name up. After determining there was nothing wrong about the identity of the resident, he opened the door.</p>
 <p>The moment Ming Jinhua entered the apartment, she could sense something was not right. The place was filled with an acrid smell, although it was not as strong as the smoke from a fire.</p>
 <p>Following the smell, she went to the study.</p>
 <p>She was sure the smell was coming from the study. She knocked on the door, but no one answered. She twisted the doorknob and found that it was not locked.</p>
 <p>The scene that greeted her after she opened the door nearly made her cry.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was sitting on the floor with his back against the couch and his pajamas on, looking utterly dejected. The window was closed, making the smoke even more acrid. It looked like the study had caught a fire.</p>
 <p>Ming Jinhua held back her tears and took a closer look. Her son was asleep. He looked like an awful mess. Although they had just seen each other a few days before, Ming Jinhua felt he had become much thinner.</p>
 <p>It&nbsp;pained&nbsp;Ming Jinhua’s heart to see him like this.</p>
 <p>She bent down to caress his face. It grieved her greatly to see him doing this to himself.</p>
 <p>The moment Ming Jinhua’s hand touched his face, Ye Zhongjue’s eyes snapped open. He grabbed her hand and cried out, “Suqing!”</p>
 <p>When he saw that it was Ming Jinhua, the light in his eyes immediately extinguished.</p>
 <p>Ming Jinhua’s heart ached. <em>Just how much does he care about the girl to make such a mess to himself?</em></p>
 <p>Except for the time when he ran away from home after a fight over the choice of high school, Ye Zhongjue had never worried her.</p>
 <p>Even during their&nbsp;high school&nbsp;argument, she had not been this distraught with worry.</p>
 <p>Although the happiness and spark in his eyes vanished immediately when Ye Zhongjue saw it was&nbsp;his mother&nbsp;rather than Mo Suqing, he did get up from the floor.</p>
 <p>He placed a hand on the couch for support and stood up before looking at Ming Jinhua calmly. “Mom, I’m sorry for making you so worried. Don’t worry, I’m just feeling a little down. It’s no big deal. Don’t worry about me too much.”</p>
 <p>Ming Jinhua shook her head sadly. She knew her son was saying this because he wanted to make her feel better.</p>
 <p>However, somehow she felt even worse.</p>
 <p>When Ye Zhongjue returned home after running away, he had seemed to grow up overnight. He had accepted her and Ye Wentian’s idea and gone abroad.</p>
 <p>However, with him acting more like an adult, she tended to worry about him more.</p>
 <p>After some hesitation, she asked it anyway, “Honey, would you like to tell me what happened?”</p>
 <p>It was difficult to see Ye Zhongjue’s face in the dark room, but Ming Jinhua could discern a choking sound in his voice when he said, “Mom, I made a mistake!”</p>
 <p>Ming Jinhua burst into tears. She embraced Ye Zhongjue and patted him on the back, trying to comfort him.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s tall figure was clouded in sadness.</p>
 <p>“Mom, I am such a beast! I forced her to… Is she ever going to forgive me?”</p>
 <p>Ming Jinhua could hear the despair in his voice.</p>
 <p>She felt as if her heart was filled with water, making it hard to breath. Tears poured down her face.</p>
 <p>“I can understand how you feel, but you are too possessive of the girl. I know this because otherwise, you wouldn’t set yourself against your father or lose your reason and harm her in any way. Son, you have to realize that you are hurting her with the name of caring about her. I think it best if you separate for a few days and calm down yourselves before you talk to her. Maybe she will begin to understand and forgive you.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked dejected. “Mom, it’s all my fault that you worry yourself so much and become upset too.”</p>
 <p>Ming Jinhua shook her head.</p>
 <p>“Honey, don’t say that. You don’t have to force cheerfulness in front of me, okay? I know you are very sad right now, but listen to me. Go take a shower and change into clean clothes. I’m going to cook something for you.”</p>
 <p>Before Ye Zhongjue could say no, Ming Jinhua had walked out of the study.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue watched her leave and stood on the spot for a long time. Then, he walked over to the window to pull back the curtain and tidied up the mess he had created.</p>
 <p>No matter what his mother said, it was his fault that she became upset.</p>
 <p>While Ye Zhongjue was taking a shower and cleaning the study, Ming Jinhua fried an egg, stir-fried two dishes and cooked some porridge for him.</p>
 <p>When Ye Zhongjue emerged from the study, he had returned to his usual, aloof self. But if one took a closer look, they could see the dark circles under his eyes.</p>
 <p>Seeing that he had put himself together, Ming Jinhua forced herself to smile.</p>
 <p>“Dear, I have made you something to eat. Come and have some. Otherwise, you’ll upset your stomach.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue answered with a grunt before sitting down and starting to eat the food quietly.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue remained silent throughout the meal. When he had eaten most of the food, a faint smile finally appeared on Ming Jinhua’s face.</p>
 <p>No matter what happened, one had to eat. Health was always the most important thing.</p>
 <p>When he was about to finish the meal, Ye Zhongjue announced, “Mom, I would like to go back home and stay for a few nights.”</p>
 <p>Ming Jinhua agreed with his decision after a momentary shock.</p>
 <p>“Good, good! I’m happy if you want to stay home for a while.”</p>
 <p>After the meal, Ming Jinhua went to clear up the kitchen while Ye Zhongjue made some preparations. Then, the two of them went back to his childhood home together.</p>
 <p>When Mo Suqing went home in the evening, no one was there. She went to the study and discovered that it was all tidied up. Ye Zhongjue was nowhere to be found.</p>
 <p>She had got off work for a long while, but because she didn’t want to face Ye Zhongjue, she had wandered in the streets until they became neon-lit and she realized it was time to go home.</p>
 <p>Little had she expected there would be no one when she got home.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing felt somehow disappointed.</p>
 <p>Of course, she was unhappy with Ye Zhongjue for what had happened last night. However, when she pictured the helplessness and struggle in his face and the sad, furious and defeated tone in his voice, she found it hard to really hate him.</p>
 <p>She hadn’t got the chance to ask him about the lipstick smudge on his shirt, and now another mishap had happened.</p>
