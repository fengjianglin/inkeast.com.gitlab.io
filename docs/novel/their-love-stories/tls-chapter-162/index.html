<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Su Jincheng frowned as he pondered over the events of the past few days.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><em>Of course, there was more to it than meets the eye.</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Zheng Hao found out that Mo Suqing was actually kidnapped just a day after she helped Su Jincheng.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Su Jincheng knew Jian Jie’s methods too well. He asked Zheng Hao to look into Jian Jie’s actual role regarding the whole fiasco, and just as he expected, everything had been planned by Jian Jie. She wanted to kill Mo Suqing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Although Su Jincheng was cold and aloof, he believed in repaying debts of gratitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He wanted to thank Mo Suqing personally after he had fully recovered, since she did save his life. Moreover, she was kind enough to do that even after being threatened by him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He wondered if she had ever heard the story about the farmer and the snake, where the farmer ended up being bitten by the snake after saving it from certain death. He was rather puzzled as to why she did not seem to hesitate to help a man who looked extremely dangerous to begin with.&nbsp;<a href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She is not the farmer, nor is he the snake. He is Su Jincheng, and he hated those who were ungrateful.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">After looking through all the information, Su Jincheng finally understood why Ye Zhongjue fell for Mo Suqing even when he and Jian Jie were acquainted for much longer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing’s kindness was able to disarm any man.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">There was a disturbance at the door, and Su Jincheng looked up to see Jian Jie and Zheng Hao entering.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Zheng Hao could tell that Su Jincheng wanted to talk to Jian Jie privately, so he excused himself tactfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">There was a slight trace of fear in her eyes as Jian Jie stood opposite Su Jincheng, maintaining a slight distance from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Do you know why I called for you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Jian Jie shook her head nervously.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Su Jincheng threw the documents in front of her as he smirked. “Take a look and you’ll be enlightened!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Uneasy, Jian Jie picked up the documents. Her face instantly paled when she realized it was about Mo Suqing’s kidnapping.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Dark Night, I didn’t do it on purpose! I won’t act independently again! Please give me a chance!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Jian Jie’s hand was trembling as she held onto the documents. She knew how terrifying that man can be. He was absolutely ruthless to any who went against him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Although Su Jincheng smiled at her, it only served to paralyze Jian Jie with fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“I can let it go this time, but don’t create any more trouble for that lady. If you do and I find out, you’re as good as dead!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Jian Jie was dumbfounded. <em>It’s because of Mo Suqing that I’m back in this country. Now you’re telling me not to create trouble for her? Are you kidding?</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">In her agitation, Jian Jie seemed to have forgotten her fear of the man. “Dark Night, why though? The reason I returned is...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Jian Jie!” Su Jincheng’s voice was sharp and his tone wintry, silencing Jian Jie immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Have you forgotten the number one rule in The Dark Night?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Su Jincheng’s piercing gaze was like a wake-up call for Jian Jie.&nbsp;Gosh, what am I doing?&nbsp;From the day she joined The Dark Night, she knew full well that nobody is to go against this man’s orders, and that the only other option was death.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She lowered her head in an attempt to mask her anxiety.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Dark Night, I messed up. I won’t do it again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Jian Jie did not dare move an inch as Su Jincheng remained silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Half an hour passed before he spoke again. “Remember what I told you. If you go against my orders, don’t let me find out. You’re aware of what will happen then. Get out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Though upset, Jian Jie still answered respectfully. “I understand, Dark Night. I won’t do it again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Right after exiting Villa Number 11, Jian Jie’s face distorted with malice and hatred. She could not believe that Dark Night did not allow her to go after Mo Suqing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She joined the organization to become stronger, so that she could achieve all her goals. She never would have imagined for something like this to happen.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">If she does anything to Mo Suqing now, Dark Night will surely get wind of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">But, she could still get others to do her dirty work.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><em>If I can get Mo Suqing to voluntarily leave Ye Zhongjue, then Dark Night will not be able to pin the blame on me!</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Jian Jie then left with a wicked smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">……</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">After relaxing in the hot springs, Leng Xiyao suggested they go to a bar.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Silk Empire International had a bar area, but Leng Xiyao insisted on going to August Hasn't Ended Yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Mo Suqing did not want to upset her since her mood had improved so much today.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Thus, the five of them decided to visit August Hasn't Ended Yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Right after entering, Leng Xiyao boldly waved and said, “Five dozen beers for us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu cringed slightly.<em>&nbsp;Oh gosh, that was rather awkward.</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><em>Also, we’re not cows. Five dozen beers? What is she even thinking?</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">On the other hand, Ye Zhongjue looked rather calm with Mo Suqing beside him, and Selina had a slight smile on her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Upon entering their private room, Leng Xiyao plopped herself on the couch.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Once the alcohol was served, she used the bottle opener to open every single bottle on the table. She looked extremely pleased with herself, leaving Ceng Hanyu speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao held onto a bottle of beer and sat herself right in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Barring her identity and the complicated relationship between them, Ceng Hanyu could still be considered a good friend.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">At least, that was what Leng Xiyao thought. She looked at him with a twinkle in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“How about a drinking match?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Seeing how arrogant she was acting, Ceng Hanyu did not want to back down. Grabbing a bottle, he said, “Bring it on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao laughed heartily and began downing the contents of the bottle in huge gulps.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Come on! Let’s drink ourselves to death!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu frowned when he smelled the alcohol from her breath. <em>This girl is so not ladylike.</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ye Zhongjue sipped on his red wine as he observed those around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Will she be okay like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Drinking her fruit juice, Mo Suqing thought about it for a moment. “She should be fine. I’m here anyway. She’s not in a good mood, so let’s just let her vent!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ye Zhongjue nodded and made no further comment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Bitterness flashed past in her eyes as Selina looked at the two currently engaged in a drinking match.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She liked Leng Xiyao’s personality. The forthright girl had such a cheerful disposition, and she was willing to learn from her mistakes as well. How can anyone dislike such an adorable individual?</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">But it was also this very girl Ceng Hanyu had been searching for all these years.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He was hot and cold towards Selina. Sometimes, it felt like he liked her, while other times, it felt like he was trying to keep her at bay.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Selina was confused herself. She did not know how he really felt about her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px"><em>I probably no longer have a chance now that his fiancee had been found.</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">As that thought crossed her mind, Selina began to intoxicate herself with the alcohol.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao’s alcohol tolerance was not great, since Leng Haoyun was rather strict with her and did not allow her to drink much.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She toppled over after just three bottles. Ceng Hanyu rushed forward to hold her, cradling her in his arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Tears began to well up in Selina’s eyes. She was afraid that she would cry there. If that happened, it would be way too embarrassing for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She had never once cried even when she, Ye Zhongjue and Ceng Hanyu had to brave real bullets. If she cried over this today, she would be mortified at herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She wanted to escape from reality for a while by drinking, but the more she drank, the more sober and upset she felt.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Selina looked at Leng Xiyao, who was looking up at Ceng Hanyu in a daze. Ceng Hanyu’s eyes were filled with a gentleness that Selina could no longer bear to witness. She stood up suddenly, causing the bottles on the table to fall one after another like dominoes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">As Selina was directly opposite Leng Xiyao, her movement caused all the beer to splash onto the latter.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu did not realize that Selina stood up, so before he could do anything, Leng Xiyao was already drenched in beer.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">His blood boiled at this. After settling Leng Xiyao on the sofa, he started berating Selina.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Are you blind or dumb, Selina? Why did you do that to Yao when she sees you as a big sister? You splashed all the beer on her! I think you should leave A City and go back to England!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ye Zhongjue’s expression darkened at this.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu was too harsh. Selina was Madame Melissa’s daughter, and both he and Ceng Hanyu owed Madame Melissa as well. She was a great help to them in the early days when Sin Eliminators had just been set up, and she even asked them to take good care of Selina when the girl joined the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Neither of them had ever said words so harsh to Selina. Moreover, Ceng Hanyu’s attitude was terrible, considering he knew that Selina had feelings for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Tears were about to escape from Selina’s eyes as she said, “I didn’t...”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">The words seemed to be stuck in her throat.<em>&nbsp;I didn’t do it on purpose, I was just upset and accidentally made the bottles topple over. It really was an accident.</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">She did not expect Ceng Hanyu to be so angry with her.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu stared at her coldly. “What? You’re going to say that you didn’t do it on purpose? I don’t believe an agent like you would make such a rookie mistake!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Selina could no longer hold her tears and she turned away as they began to fall.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu was a little flustered at this turn of events.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ye Zhongjue stood up, looking at Ceng Hanyu pointedly. “Ceng Hanyu, that’s enough! I can obviously tell that Selina didn’t do it on purpose, so what are you trying to do? Aren’t you just making use of her feelings for you? Who are you to say all that? Have you forgotten how Madame Melissa helped us out? And you’re treating her daughter like this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ye Zhongjue’s words made Ceng Hanyu panic. He looked towards Selina, abashed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Xiyao woke up at the ruckus.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Taking in the scene before her, she stood up to face Ceng Hanyu.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“It doesn’t matter if I am Anne or if I’m related to you in any way, I won’t allow you to speak to Big Sister Selina like this!”</span></p>
