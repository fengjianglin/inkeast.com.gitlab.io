<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>To welcome Mo Suqing and Ye Zhongjue, Mo Zhenfeng had asked Bai Lian to tidy up Mo Suqing’s room thoroughly and even to replace some of the fixtures and accessories with new ones, like the sheet, the curtain and the closet.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing understandably thought she had gone into the wrong room. After she checked again, she was reassured that she hadn’t.</p>
 <p>There was a picture of her in a frame on the nightstand, which made her more certain that this was indeed her room.</p>
 <p>It&nbsp;had&nbsp;only&nbsp;been&nbsp;three months, but her old room was already beyond recognition. Mo Suqing smiled mockingly.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue comforted her with a hug.</p>
 <p>They lay side by side on the bed. After a while, Mo Suqing asked, “Ye Zhongjue, you know what?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue interrupted her, “Call me Jue or honey! You have been calling me with my full name since we made up. Yet, somehow you always call Guan Zixuan with his given name. This really makes me…”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue frowned, feeling awkward. Mo Suqing laughed.</p>
 <p>“Serious? You are jealous of such a small thing?” As if she couldn’t believe it, Mo Suqing leaned over and observed Ye Zhongjue’s expression carefully for clues. Ye Zhongjue was exasperated. <em>You are crossing a line here!</em></p>
 <p>He turned over and pinned the laughing woman down.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing immediately stopped messing with him. <em>He can be aroused anywhere, anytime!</em></p>
 <p>“Fine, fine! I won’t laugh at you anymore. I know it’s just because you like me a lot!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing blinked at him smilingly. Ye Zhongjue pinched her nose. “I’m glad you finally see that.”</p>
 <p>Then, remembering the mixed feelings she had for this place, he slid off and lay down next to her.</p>
 <p>Their fingers were intertwined. Warmth filled up Mo Suqing’s heart.</p>
 <p>“I was actually going to call you Jue. But then I heard Jian Jie call you that and could no longer bring myself to say it. I am too shy to call you honey, either.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing blushed a little and looked away.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue chuckled lightly and&nbsp;made her face him.</p>
 <p>“Silly, honey is a special nickname. Only you can call me that. On the other hand, anyone can call me by my real name. That’s why we have names – to call someone by! Come on, try to call me honey.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing twisted her head a little and called shyly, “Honey!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue stroked her soft hair happily and said, “There you go! My wife is so obedient. This makes me love you even more!”</p>
 <p>Then, he kissed her on the lip passionately.</p>
 <p>They were both burning with desire when a knock came.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue froze and cursed inwardly, <em>Shit! Who’s knocking at this moment?</em></p>
 <p>“Who is it?” Ye Zhongjue asked with a sour look.</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian answered in a coy tone, “Sis, brother-in-law, what are you doing in the bedroom? Can I come in? Would I interrupt you?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue replied, “What do you think we are doing in the bedroom? Do you want to watch? And why did you knock if you think you will interrupt us?”</p>
 <p>Then, as if it wasn’t enough, he added, “Do not let anyone else knock on our door! We are sleeping!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing could imagine Mo Sulian’s expression&nbsp;on the other end of the door.</p>
 <p>She giggled and rubbed Ye Zhongjue’s chin with her head.</p>
 <p>“Honey, you are a badass! No wonder you never let me win in a verbal fight. You like to show off how vicious you can be!”</p>
 <p>“No, you’re wrong. It’s in bed that I like to show off how vicious I can be. Don’t you know that?” Ye Zhongjue looked at her.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was speechless. <em>Tut! You are so thick-skinned and are able to make anything dirty!</em></p>
 <p><em>What a brazenly dirty man!</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue pinched her cute face and said, “Now you know you can never beat me, don’t wage a <em>tongue war</em> against me ever again!”</p>
 <p>He emphasized the phrase ‘tongue war’ in a seductive way. Mo Suqing felt defeated. <em>I just want to be a Snow White! Who wr</em><em>e</em><em>cked my prince?</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing didn’t say anything. She knew Ye Zhongjue would only continue to turn her words dirty. He had obviously made a habit of teasing her.</p>
 <p>They lay there in silence for a long time.</p>
 <p>Because of his “Do not let anyone else knock on our door,” indeed no one came to look for them.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing swayed her head left and right on the pillow and said, “I had a lot of good memories here, so I felt sad to leave home even after mom was gone. But now, I don’t want to be here any longer. It makes me feel oppressive. Let’s go!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was about to get up when Ye Zhongjue stopped her.</p>
 <p>“Honey, let’s visit my parents some time.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing felt touched by his gesture. However, remembering how his parents thought about their marriage, she shook her head.</p>
 <p>“Maybe after some time!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue had made a very high-key announcement in the media. Of course his parents would have got wind of it. They probably didn’t want to fall out with their son, but they surely didn’t approve of her either.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue knew what she was thinking. He nodded and said, “Fine by me. Well, let’s go home now!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing pressed her lips a little and nodded smilingly.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing and Ye Zhongjue went downstairs. Mo Zhenfeng walked over to them and smiled at Ye Zhongjue like a kiss-ass. Mo Suqing felt nauseous.</p>
 <p>“Zhongjue, you guys had a good rest?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue nodded. “Thank you for the hospitality tonight. The next time I hold a dinner party at Silk Empire International, please honor me with your attendance.”</p>
 <p>Mo Zhenfeng and the gang were all rejoiced. They nodded vigorously, afraid Ye Zhongjue would take his promise away any second.</p>
 <p>Mo Zhenfeng saw them off. Mo Suqing got in the car without looking at the house again. Finally, she felt she could breathe properly.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue got in the car and saw that she looked as if she had just retreated from the battlefield. He chuckled.</p>
 <p>“Silly! Many people are like this in the business world. I’ve seen enough. When you are not as powerful as the others, all you can do is to flatter and please. I can handle those kinds of people. You don’t have to get so nervous. Also, I won’t get too far with your father.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing nodded without saying anything.</p>
 <p>She hated her father’s behaviors. However, she loved Ye Zhongjue and had sworn she would never leave him – they would get through every difficulty together. Therefore, she couldn’t really stop her father from taking advantage of Ye Zhongjue once and for all, which made her feel powerless.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was right. No matter what, he was her father.</p>
 <p>Before going to sleep, Mo Suqing remembered something as she lay prone on the bed, feeling drowsy. The other day in Leng Xiyao’s house, Ye Zhongjue had told Guan Zixuan, “You think I don’t dare to harm you because you’re a prince?”</p>
 <p><em>What did he mean?&nbsp;</em>Mo Suqing frowned. She had felt perplexed, but hadn’t asked him about it in front of so many people. Guan Zixuan had replied something along the lines of, <em>Looks like you do care about my existence! Otherwise, why would you have done&nbsp;</em><em>so much research about me.</em></p>
 <p>The more Mo Suqing thought about it, the more confused she felt. She turned over and looked at the man who was reading a book with his back against the headboard.</p>
 <p>“Honey, what did you mean when you said Zixuan is a prince the other day? I am totally baffled by your Middle-Age choice of word!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue glanced at her and pinched her face.</p>
 <p>“You are a curious girl!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing slapped his hand away. “Be serious and don’t make fun of me!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue chuckled. “Fine, fine! I’ll stop making fun of you and get serious. I guess I can tell you his true identity, but you mustn’t tell anybody. I can see he doesn’t want people to know about it.”</p>
 <p>The mystery had sobered Mo Suqing up. She placed her hand on his arm and urged, “Come on, don’t keep me in suspense. I can’t take it anymore!”</p>
 <p>“Can’t take it anymore, you said?” Ye Zhongjue twisted her words on purpose and gave her a lustful look. Mo Suqing rolled her eyes. <em>Oh no! He is turning into a beast again!</em></p>
 <p>She rolled away, wrapping herself tightly with the blanket. Now she looked like a silkworm.</p>
 <p>“Come on! I want to know!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue gave her a sad look. “Honey, I’ll get jealous if you keep asking about other men!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was defeated. <em>Again?</em></p>
 <p>“Well, then go ahead and get jealous!” she said coolly.</p>
 <p>Seeing that she was about to lose patience, Ye Zhongjue quickly lay flat and pulled her into his arms.</p>
 <p>“Okay, I’m telling you now. Guan Zixuan’s father is the head of the emperor’s city, if you know what I mean. Why else would he be called a prince? It’s likely his parents don’t approve of him pursuing a career in the entertainment field, so he never tells anyone his family background.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Then how did you find out?” Mo Suqing asked him curiously.</p>
 <p>Of course, Ye Zhongjue couldn’t divulge anything about the intelligence agents they had in Sin Eliminators. He felt he was shooting himself in the foot by even&nbsp;telling Mo Suqing Guan Zixuan’s identity.</p>
 <p>“I think it’s time to go to bed! Stop asking so many questions. Otherwise, we&nbsp;won’t be able&nbsp;to sleep.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing pouted. “I don’t want to sleep. Not until you answer my question.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue felt his head start to ache. This was all his fault! He really couldn’t be honest with her about Sin Eliminators. It wasn’t because he didn’t trust her. Rather, he feared she might get entangled in some ugly affairs if she was in the know.</p>
 <p>The only thing he wanted was her safety.</p>
 <p>He hugged Mo Suqing tightly and said, “Since you don’t want to sleep, how about we do some stuff?”</p>
 <p>He sounded like an abductor who was trying to lure a child with candy.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing shivered and snapped her eyes shut. “I’m asleep!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue chuckled.</p>
