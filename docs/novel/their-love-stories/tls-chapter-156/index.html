<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu felt that he was already controlling his emotions very well, but Leng Haoyun seemed bent to go against him today.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">And it just so happens that he had a bone to pick with Leng Haoyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Apart from him raising Anne, he hated everything about Leng Haoyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He spoke in a low tone, “Don’t go overboard, Leng Haoyun. I’m here to see Jue, and that has nothing to do with you. Move!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun sent him a sideway glance. “I don’t like that there’s a rabid dog barking right at my door. If you understand human speech, please leave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu blew his top at this. “Leng Haoyun, if I’m a rabid dog, then what are you? How different are you from a rabid dog? Have I offended you today? I think you’re goddamn insane!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Leng Haoyun stared at him. “Did you bring your manners out today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">Ceng Hanyu was about to rip him a new one, but being aware of Leng Xiyao’s presence made him feel that it was too uncool to do so.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">He said nonchalantly, “President Leng, don’t you know that something as valuable as manners should be kept locked in a safe?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Oh, so Mr. Ceng has never brought his manners out with him!” Leng Haoyun answered sarcastically.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">It took extreme strength for Ceng Hanyu to push all of his boiling anger down. He had never thought that the man in front of him could be so vicious and childish!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“My manners are very valuable, and they’ve always been used for normal people. I’ve never bothered to use them when it comes to rabid dogs!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Only those who have absolutely no manners will find excuses for their behaviour!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“Leng Haoyun, I think you’re really out of your mind today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 14px">“If you’re not crazy, please don’t barking non-stop at our door!”</span></p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao was lost for words as she stood observing the childish exchange that was laced with sarcasm between the two men. Were they still her uncle and the Ceng Hanyu she knew?</p>
 <p><em>Have they been possessed?</em></p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao felt that the day just got livelier with that verbal spar.</p>
 <p>She suddenly heard Mo Suqing crying.</p>
 <p>She shouted, “Stop! Is Suqing crying?”</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun and Ceng Hanyu froze as they continued staring at each other, none of them willing to look away.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao could no longer bother with the two of them and tried to listen carefully to the sound. It was definitely Mo Suqing crying. She seemed to be yelling as well.</p>
 <p>She glared at Ceng Hanyu like an angry lion cub. “It must be that brother of yours again! He’s bullying Suqing again! I won’t let him off the hook if anything happens to Suqing!”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu simply nodded at Leng Xiyao’s harsh words. “Okay, okay, okay, grandaunt. You have the final say. Please get your uncle to move aside so I can enter and assess the situation, okay?”</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun harrumphed and walked into the villa without giving Leng Xiyao a chance to speak. Both Ceng Hanyu and Leng Xiyao followed closely.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao was dumbstruck as she entered the living room. Ye Zhongjue lay on the floor, pale as chalk. It was obvious he had passed out.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was holding onto his arm and crying for him to wake up.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu rushed forward and pulled Mo Suqing away. He yelled at Mo Suqing in agitation.</p>
 <p>“You’re going to tear his wound if you don’t stop shaking him like that. When that happens, even God Almighty won’t be able to save him!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was stupefied, but she refused to let go of Ye Zhongjue’s arm. She no longer dared to shake it further.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao frowned. <em>What happened between the two of them?</em></p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu reached out and felt the blood on Ye Zhongjue. Looking at the bloodstains along his lips, he flared up at Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>“What did you do to him!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was tear-stricken. Apart from squatting beside Ye Zhongjue like a child who made a mistake, she did not know what to do.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao felt upset at that. She went forward to pull Mo Suqing up, and placed herself in front of the girl as if to shield her.</p>
 <p>“Are you mad, Ceng Hanyu? He’s a grown man. What can Suqing do to him? How about you send him to the hospital now instead of arguing with Suqing in our house!”</p>
 <p>Glancing at Leng Xiyao, Ceng Hanyu calmed down slightly. He was too agitated earlier and lost control of his emotions. If Ye Zhongjue knew he had been so fierce with Mo Suqing, he would definitely get skinned alive.</p>
 <p>But sending him to the hospital was of utmost importance at the moment.</p>
 <p>He looked at Leng Xiyao, and she immediately understood what he was trying to communicate.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, help to bring Ye Zhongjue to the car!”</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun moved forward without hesitation.</p>
 <p>He just left the room for a short while. He never would have imagined that Mo Suqing and Ye Zhongjue would have such a huge quarrel. He quickly helped Ceng Hanyu support Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu quietly harrumphed, but Leng Haoyun paid it no heed.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing followed them to the hospital, and it was only until Ye Zhongjue entered the operating theater did worry and concern plaster her face. She was leaning against the wall as Leng Xiyao went over and held her arm in an effort to console her.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing turned to hug her suddenly, her tears dripping onto Leng Xiyao’s neck.</p>
 <p>“Yao, if something happens to him, I will never be able to forgive myself!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao sighed and said, “Why do the both of you do this? You care about each other deeply, so why do you hurt each other like that? If you were able to look at things from Ye Zhongjue’s perspective, you may then be able to understand why he chose to keep things from you. Sometimes, it isn’t on purpose, but it’s because you may inadvertently be hurt by it. It’s to protect you, that’s all. This is all I can say, you’d have to think about this on your own. If you still want to be with him, then don’t fight anymore. He’s already like this, so just give each other a chance. In fact, your situation is rather cheerful compared to those who love each other but are unable to do so.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao fell silent after that, and Mo Suqing did not speak either.</p>
 <p>If even Leng Xiyao could see things from Ye Zhongjue’s perspective, why can’t she do so too?</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue may be right in saying that she brings up divorce every time they fight. She had never talked things through with him.</p>
 <p>She knew full well that she was unable to leave him.</p>
 <p>She would literally die inside if she leaves him, and very few people could understand such a feeling.</p>
 <p><em>If that was the case, how about trying to put myself in his shoes and be more understanding?</em></p>
 <p>Maybe because she had already chosen him, she should stop trying to avoid matters and stop thinking of running away all the time.</p>
 <p>When she saw Ye Zhongjue spitting blood, her heart had almost stopped in shock.</p>
 <p>She promised herself that she would settle matters more amicably between them in future.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was in the operating theater for much longer than the first time.</p>
 <p>Gu Yi’an looked haggard when he finally walked out of the operating theater.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu rushed to him. “Yi’an, how’s Jue?”</p>
 <p>A trace of anger could be seen in the usually aloof Gu Yi’an, his aura keeping others at bay.</p>
 <p>“He won’t die, it’s just that the wound tore open. Suppressing his emotions caused a blood clot to form in his chest. It’s not that bad since he already spit some of it out. But he needs to take care. If that happens again, I might not be able to save him!”</p>
 <p>Gu Yi’an glanced at Mo Suqing as he finished.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing felt chills run down her spine when she caught his glance. This aura was totally different from the first time she met Gu Yi’an.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu heaved a sigh of relief. Ye Zhongjue was pushed out, still unconscious. Ceng Hanyu and Mo Suqing both followed closely.</p>
 <p>It was only after they reached the ward did Ceng Hanyu look at Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>“Let’s chat outside.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing nodded.</p>
 <p>They took the elevator up to the rooftop.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu did not speak for a long time.</p>
 <p>“I wasn’t being very polite at the Leng’s villa. Please don’t mind it, I was just too agitated.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing shook her head to signal that she did not take it to heart. She realized that she was more calm and that her head was much clearer after thinking through everything.</p>
 <p>She spoke softly, “It’s okay. I get it. If anything happens to him, I’d probably be as agitated as you.”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu felt that something seemed to have changed in Mo Suqing, but he simply could not put a finger on it.</p>
 <p>He said in a serious tone, “I should still apologize.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing remained silent as she smiled lightly.</p>
 <p>After a couple of seconds, she said, “I’ll make my way down first. I’m worried about Ye Zhongjue being alone in the ward.”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu nodded. “Okay, I’ll go with you.”</p>
 <p>“It’s fine. You can enjoy the breeze for a little longer if you’d like. I can make my way there on my own.”</p>
 <p>“Let’s go. Jue hasn’t woken up, so I’m in charge of your safety. If anything happens to you, he’d kill me after he wakes up!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing laughed. “Okay then, let’s go.”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu asked an unexpected question when they were in the elevator. “Sis-in-law, do you know what Leng Xiyao likes?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing creased her brows as she pondered over the question. “Yao… there isn’t anything that she likes in particular. She’s just like an overgrown kid who’s rather curious about things, and she likes it when it’s lively...”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing stopped suddenly. “Why are you asking me this? Are you planning on wooing her?”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu made a face. <em>I’m not trying to woo her, she’s already my fiancee!</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing thought he was embarrassed, and continued, “No need to be embarrassed. I’ll support you in that. Since there’s someone who doesn’t treasure her, it’s nice that somebody else is interested!”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu only laughed humorlessly at that. He was now racking his brains over how he should tell Yao about her real identity.</p>
 <p>He stepped out of the elevator, but turned back to look at Mo Suqing again.</p>
 <p>“Do you know much about her background? Like, has she ever talked to you about it? &nbsp;Of course, I’m not talking about Leng Haoyun.”</p>
