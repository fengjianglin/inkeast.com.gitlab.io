<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Leng Xiyao, who was still in the car, saw Mo Suqing freeze on the spot. She followed the line of her gaze.</p>
 <p>Her face became a degree paler when her eyes set upon An Huilin. Then, she quickly forced herself to smile.</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun opened the car door when the other three cars stopped in unison. They all got off the cars and saw Jian Jie and An Huilin. A look of uncertainty passed through one to the other.</p>
 <p><em>What are they doing here?</em></p>
 <p>Although Mo Suqing now knew that Jian Jie was Ye Zhongjue’s chief secretary, it didn’t lessen her dislike for the woman. Jian Jie had told her some very misleading things, and it had made Mo Suqing believe she was a manipulative hypocrite ever since, despite the fact that she had taken a gunshot for Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun seemed to expect them here. He walked around the car and carried Leng Xiyao out of it.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao deliberately wrapped her arms around Leng Haoyun’s neck. An Huilin’s expression shifted, but she wisely didn’t make any comment.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao’s gesture didn’t cause any hindrance to Leng Haoyun’s movement, although he did go rigid for a moment before walking toward the villa.</p>
 <p>“This is An Huilin and her friend Jian Jie. I invited them. Everyone, please come in!”</p>
 <p>Then, he led the way inside the house.</p>
 <p>An Huilin and Jian Jie followed Leng Haoyun.</p>
 <p>Jian Jie looked over her shoulder at Ye Zhongjue for a few times, making Mo Suqing very uncomfortable as if she had swallowed a fly. She placed her hand on Ye Zhongjue’s arm, feeling sick.</p>
 <p>She had not expected the two women would show up.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue did not speak. When they reached the porch, Jian Jie turned around and looked Ye Zhongjue in the eye.</p>
 <p>“Jue, I didn’t expect to see you here, too.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked at her expressionlessly. “How is your wound?”</p>
 <p>Jian Jie smiled gently. “Don’t worry, it’s much better already.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing felt nauseous to hear another woman call her husband so intimately and affectionately. Worst of all, she couldn’t do anything about it even though she knew the woman liked her husband.</p>
 <p>After all, the woman had saved her husband’s life.</p>
 <p>It was such a gut-wrenching feeling!</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan cast a concerned glance at her. Ye Zhongjue squeezed her hand and gave her an assuring look.</p>
 <p>Jian Jie turned away and walked into the house with An Huilin as if she didn’t see it.</p>
 <p>When everyone was inside, Aunt Zhang had already cooked up their lunch.</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun carried Leng Xiyao to wash their hands. When they came back, everyone was seated around the table.</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun carried Leng Xiyao to an unoccupied seat.</p>
 <p>He sat down on her left while An Huilin was on his left. Leftward sat Jian Jie, Ye Zhongjue, Mo Suqing and Guan Zixuan.</p>
 <p>Finally, Ceng Hanyu sat next to Guan Zixuan, with Leng Xiyao on the other side.</p>
 <p>Aunt Zhang began to bring the food. Before Leng Haoyun opened his mouth, An Huilin said with a magnificent smile, “I want to thank you all for your help and support during Yao’s hospitalization. Today, Yao finally went home. Her uncle and I are very happy. Allow me to make a toast first. Bon appétit!”</p>
 <p>An Huilin acted as if she was the hostess. Jian Jie smiled from ear to ear and raised her own glass of wine.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue frowned. “Jian Jie, abstain from drinking! Your wound hasn’t healed completely.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing lowered her head and pressed her lips together. Leng Xiyao’s face had already gone white.</p>
 <p>If Leng Haoyun had noticed anything weird, he didn’t show it. He picked up his chopsticks and transferred some food to Leng Xiyao’s bowl.</p>
 <p>“Please tuck in, everyone. Eat something first before you drink to avoid upsetting the stomach.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue helped Mo Suqing to the dishes quietly. Ceng Hanyu looked like he was enjoying a good drama. Guan Zixuan had his eyebrows raised high. What was playing out now was much more brilliant than that in his filming studio.</p>
 <p>He looked at Mo Suqing with concern. Mo Suqing could be quite hidebound sometimes. Although Ye Zhongjue wasn’t doing anything untoward, Guan Zixuan knew she was struggling inside.</p>
 <p>In the middle of the meal, one of the dishes had been emptied.</p>
 <p>An Huilin stood up and picked up the plate. “I’ll go and ask Aunt Zhang in the kitchen if there are enough ingredients for another plate of the dish.”</p>
 <p>An Huilin was too at home. Leng Xiyao held the chopsticks so tightly that her fingers whitened.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s spirit had been low because of the unexpected appearance of Jian Jie. However, now she noticed that Leng Xiyao was very unlike herself, too.</p>
 <p>She was worried about the girl. She didn’t look like she had lost her memory at all.</p>
 <p>However, why would she lie about it if she hadn’t?</p>
 <p>An Huilin emerged from the kitchen. After she seated herself, she picked up her glass again.</p>
 <p>“I see that the dishes have been pretty much emptied. I want to make a second toast! Haoyun, don’t get mad. I am simply exalted today.”</p>
 <p>She turned around and blinked at Leng Haoyun.</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun made a noncommittal reply. An Huilin raised the glass and drank the content.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao’s expression had gone extremely dark by now. Mo Suqing wondered why Leng Haoyun tolerated An Huilin so.</p>
 <p>She no longer paid any attention to the looks Jian Jie kept throwing at Ye Zhongjue’s way. She just looked at Leng Xiyao with concern.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu leant back against the chair casually and sipped at his wine. Guan Zixuan kept drinking glass after glass of alcohol in silence.</p>
 <p>Jian Jie, on the other hand, had stopped drinking after Ye Zhongjue’s admonition. She just ate her food and cast furtive glances at Ye Zhongjue from time to time.</p>
 <p>When An Huilin raised her glass yet again, Mo Suqing finally had had enough.</p>
 <p>“An Huilin! You are no longer my boss, so don’t get offended if I call you by your full name.”</p>
 <p>An Huilin gave her a fake smile and said deliberately, “You are Mrs. Ye now. How do I dare to be your boss?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s face darkened. Acting in the best interests of her best friend, she sneered, “I hope you mean it! Well, if you are in a drinking mood, I’ll drink to my heart’s content with you!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing picked up a bottle to drink directly from it.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue frowned. He grabbed Mo Suqing’s hand and took the bottle from her. “You shouldn’t drink, either,” he said, gazing at her. “How about the rest of us drink a few glasses?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue then poured some wine into his glass and emptied it in one gulp.</p>
 <p>His lips were pressed together and exasperation showed on his face. Mo Suqing knew he was unhappy that she didn’t know how to take care of herself. She knew he hated it when she drank.</p>
 <p><em>But, how can I do nothing to show my support for Yao?</em></p>
 <p>An Huilin raised her glass smilingly and gave Leng Xiyao a contemptuous stare. Leng Haoyun didn’t speak. He just filled Leng Xiyao’s bowl with food when it was emptied.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao, like a soulless robot, kept repeating the same set of movements: picking up the food with her chopsticks, putting it into her mouth, chewing for several times, and swallowing.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing couldn’t understand why Leng Haoyun didn’t try to stop An Huilin.</p>
 <p>Then, when lunch was near the end, Mo Suqing found out the answer.</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun, who had been quiet during the whole meal, finally spoke. Almost everyone at the table was shocked at what he had to say.</p>
 <p>“With this meal, I want to express my gratitude to all of you for being there for Yao. Meanwhile, I also want to make an announcement. One month from now, I’ll&nbsp;be&nbsp;getting&nbsp;engaged with An Huilin.”</p>
 <p>It was like a rock had been thrown into an originally peaceful lake and made ripples on its surface.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao lowered her head. Mo Suqing looked at the others. They all had different expressions.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu seemed amused. Guan Zixuan was frowning. Ye Zhongjue looked as aloof as usual. An Huilin had a victorious look on her face, as if she was the winner rooster in a cockfight.</p>
 <p>Jian Jie gave Mo Suqing a contemptuous look, as if to say, <em>You are going to be as pathetic as your BFF here!</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing felt panic rise in her.</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun was still talking in a flat tone, “I hope I’ll see you all again&nbsp;at&nbsp;our engagement party. We are going to get married after Yao is fully recovered. I’ll send wedding invitations to each of you.”</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun was very calm when he said all of this. Although Leng Xiyao was hanging her head low, Mo Suqing could see the light in her eyes diminished little by little.</p>
 <p>An Huilin, smiling happily, threaded her arm through Leng Haoyun’s.</p>
 <p>“Haoyun, how straightforward of you. I feel so shy! Anyway, please do come to our wedding, you guys.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing had never seen An Huilin so coy and smug before. The An Huilin she had known was always icy cold.</p>
 <p>To quote Leng Xiyao’s words, she had always been like some old spinster during her menopause with had no sex life.</p>
 <p>Now, she was so puffed-up while Yao was miserable and powerless!</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao seemed to be on the very brink of breaking down. She tried not to choke out the words when she said, “Suqing, I want to get some fresh air. Can you accompany me?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing stood up and went to fetch the wheelchair in the living room. Leng Haoyun didn’t say anything when he carried her into it.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing didn’t look at him. She hated Leng Haoyun for making Yao sad.</p>
 <p>Even though Yao did lose in An Huilin’s game, she would not lose her dignity!</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing pushed her to the garden. She paused in front of the pale yellow chrysanthemums and stood behind Leng Xiyao quietly.</p>
 <p>After a long while, she sighed.</p>
 <p>“Yao, you have been faking it, right? You did not lose your memory!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao went rigid. Then, she laughed bitterly. “So you know! Looks like my acting is still not good enough.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing walked around and looked at her in the eye. “Yao, can you tell me why you are doing this?”</p>
