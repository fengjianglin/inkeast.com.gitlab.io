<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked at Mo Suqing. There was something she could not interpret in his eyes.</p>
 <p>“I disagree!” Ye Zhongjue protested in a stubborn tone, like a child who had been grievously wronged.</p>
 <p>Somehow, this hit Mo Suqing’s soft spot.</p>
 <p>She turned to him irritably and retorted, “Then why didn’t you say anything? Silence means tacit agreement, doesn’t it?”</p>
 <p>His face darkened, Ye Zhongjue ground his teeth and said, “Who says so? If silence means tacit agreement, what about the fact you have never&nbsp;given&nbsp;me an explanation regarding Guan Zixuan? Do you mean to make me think you have ‘tacitly agreed’ what the newspaper reported?</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue had completely turned into a man-child who was throwing a tantrum by now.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was shocked.</p>
 <p><em>So he knows! Why didn’t he just ask her about it?</em> He was more and more like a closed book to her.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing sighed inwardly, for the hundredth time.&nbsp;<em>Sometimes men are as difficult to understand as women, if not more.</em> She never thought it was because of Guan Zixuan that he had been sulking.</p>
 <p>She blurted out without thinking, “You have known all along?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue raised his eyebrows, apparently annoyed.</p>
 <p>“Why&nbsp;wouldn’t I?”</p>
 <p>“Then why didn’t you ask me about it?”</p>
 <p>“Why should I?” Ye Zhongjue countered matter-of-factly.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was exasperated. The man was extremely reticent, not revealing his thoughts readily and wanting her&nbsp;to&nbsp;guess them. How could she have guessed it?</p>
 <p>She had thought he didn’t know about Guan Zixuan and had been afraid she would only make things worse by mentioning it, so she had thought better of it.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, this was exactly what he had been sulking about.</p>
 <p>How would Mo Suqing like to lament for her poor self now! God, what was he thinking?</p>
 <p>“So this is the reason you’ve been&nbsp;ignoring&nbsp;me for the last few days?” Mo Suqing, feeling utterly wronged, looked at him in dismay.</p>
 <p>She had tried so hard to explain to him about Zhang Yubin, but he had never really cared about that.</p>
 <p>“Humph,” Ye Zhongjue huffed and said proudly, “No it isn’t!”</p>
 <p>His refusal to admit his thoughts was exactly the evidence that she had guessed it. Mo Suqing almost burst out laughing. The man was so cute!</p>
 <p>It was obviously he was mad at her because of this, but he just wouldn’t admit it.</p>
 <p>She began to explain everything in a gentler tone, “It was not what you thought. I wanted to tell you about it, but then the scandal was cleared the next day. I thought you didn’t care and maybe didn’t even know, and I was afraid to make things worse if I mentioned it to you. Anyway, I have only met Guan Zixuan twice. I didn’t think there was any need to trouble you about it.”</p>
 <p>“So it went like this…”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing told him everything, from how she had met Guan Zixuan at the airport, lied to him about her true identity, taken a picture of him and Mu Ling’er, and promised him she would not publish it, to how the picture had been stolen and published anyway, and how Guan Zixuan had decided to take revenge on her.</p>
 <p>Although still acting aloof as if he didn’t care one bit, Ye Zhongjue was actually very satisfied with her explanation.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing saw right through his pretense.</p>
 <p>She sighed inwardly. He had such a mature and unflustered outward appearance, but no doubt a child lived in him.</p>
 <p>It was a well-known fact that men are children who never really grow up, that they are sometimes excruciatingly childish.</p>
 <p>After Mo Suqing finished her story, she continued to fold her clothes.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s face, which had finally brightened up, immediately darkened again.</p>
 <p>He grabbed Mo Suqing’s arm, anger rising a little. <em>Why does she insist on leaving after everything has cleared up?</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing gave him a puzzled look. “What are you doing?”</p>
 <p>“You still want to go!” Ye Zhongjue said in a gloomy tone.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was about to tell him that she was just folding her clothes and that he needed not react so strongly, but decided to mess with him a bit first.</p>
 <p>She feigned a cold voice and an unhappy look. “Yeah…”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue flew into a temper. He did not understand why she insisted on leaving after he had patiently listened to her explanation. <em>Did I do something wrong?</em></p>
 <p>He could not calm himself when he thought she was leaving because of someone else.</p>
 <p>At the thought, he tightened his grip even more on Mo Suqing’s arm. She frowned at the pain.</p>
 <p>Well, it was no fun messing with him. He was really hurting her.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was the kind of man who did not reveal his feelings easily. Although he was unhappy, he would not talk or even let others find out about it. Therefore, right now he just grabbed Mo Suqing’s arm without a word.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing shook his hand off angrily and said, “Hey, you are hurting me. I was just kidding.”</p>
 <p>Smiling, she lowered her head and closed the suitcase.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue only realized he had been tricked into reaction several seconds&nbsp;later.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing barely put the suitcase down before she found herself pulled backward with a great force.</p>
 <p>The next moment, she felt Ye Zhongjue’s mouth on hers. He was kissing her passionately, relentlessly.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing slapped his back hard. “Don’t… I… I can’t breathe…”</p>
 <p>But Ye Zhongjue seemed to be under a spell and did not let her go.</p>
 <p>Her voice faltering with moans, she pushed his shoulders and said disgustedly, “You haven’t showered!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue teased, his voice full of smiles, “Great! You are going to shower with me!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing exclaimed in alarm when Ye Zhongjue carried her into the bathroom and closed the door behind them.</p>
 <p>Water came rushing down from the shower. The place was saturated with misty, hot vapor soon. Mo Suqing couldn’t see anything clearly.</p>
 <p>Except for the handsome face right in front of her.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing wanted to resist Ye Zhongjue, but at the same time was aroused by his caress. This only made Ye Zhongjue even more excited.</p>
 <p>The night was filled with her moans; it was a night of indulgence and pleasure.</p>
 <p>The next day, Mo Suqing felt she might not even be able to get&nbsp;out of&nbsp;bed.</p>
 <p><em>You are an animal in bed, Ye Zhongjue!</em> she cursed inwardly. <em>I was almost devoured!</em></p>
 <p>When she said she had had enough, he had insisted that a no from a woman always meant yes.</p>
 <p>She could not believe there was anyone like him and had said so to him, telling him he was a big rascal.</p>
 <p>However, he had only smiled tenderly and told her that he was a rascal in front of her, not anyone else.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s heart had melted at this. She did not think any woman could resist a man like him.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing struggled to sit up. Just when she was about to put on some clothes, the door to the room opened.</p>
 <p>As a reflex, Mo Suqing quickly covered herself with the blanket and lay back down on the bed, feigning sleep.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue approached while looking at the figure on the bed. Mo Suqing had curled herself into a ball. Her body seemed to quiver slightly.</p>
 <p>He smiled. <em>She is so cute! I have already seen her naked. She needn’t be so shy.</em></p>
 <p>He walked over and tugged at the corner of the blanket.</p>
 <p>“What should we do? We are going to be late if you don’t get up soon.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing, knowing that she had not deluded him, gave up the pretense and hid her head under the blanket.</p>
 <p>Her face was bright red, maybe from overheating it under the blanket, maybe from shyness.</p>
 <p>“Get out! I’m going to put on my clothes,” said she, sounding like an unhappy child, bashful yet adorable.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue chuckled lightly. “If you don’t get up now, I’m going to help you put on clothes!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing felt defeated. If he were to help her put on the clothes, they would likely not&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to get to work today!</p>
 <p>She huffed under the blanket and repeated, “You get out of the room first!” she whined, her voice imploringly sweet.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue gave up teasing her further and left the room.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing put on her clothes as fast as she could. Then, she went into the living room and saw him reading&nbsp;the&nbsp;newspaper on the sofa.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue had put on the black overcoat she bought for him. He looked very hot in it.</p>
 <p>His whole person was radiating an inborn noble elegance, making him a hundred times more handsome than those on magazine covers.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing, a proper fangirl now, found it very difficult to turn her eyes away from him. She sighed in admiration inwardly, <em>What a shame! A man like him should go and become a superstar.</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue had noticed her gaze from the start; it was, after all, impossible not to feel the scorching heat from her stare.</p>
 <p>He looked up casually in slo-mo. “What do you think? Which one does my lady prefer, me with clothes on or me without?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue raised his eyebrows. Somehow, he gave the impression that he was half human, half devil. He stood up and looked at Mo Suqing curiously, “Have you&nbsp;seen enough, my lady? If&nbsp;so, we should probably get going.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue seldom said a sentence of this length, which should have been a good thing except that its content was too embarrassing for Mo Suqing. It was only the beginning of a new day; her little heart had a hard time digesting it and her face had already glowed red.</p>
 <p>She feigned an angry tone and said, “You like to call me that, don’t you?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue smiled. He put his arm around her waist and said in the most tender tone, “But you <em>are</em> my lady.”</p>
 <p>Feeling like she had just eaten a spoonful of honey, Mo Suqing blushed even more and bowed her head.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s mood was extraordinarily good today. Lin Ran could feel it when he emerged from the elevator.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was beaming with happiness. Although a smile was still nowhere to be found on his face, everyone felt his good humor. Even his gait was brisker than usual.</p>
 <p>A couple of secretaries were hanging around and gossiping in their office.</p>
 <p>“Did you see it? The president looked so happy when he entered his office just now. I am so drunk with that look…”</p>
 <p>“The most important thing is his overcoat! Did you see the black overcoat he’s wearing? When did he start wearing one? Even when it is mid-winter, he’s never worn an overcoat.”</p>
 <p>“Maybe some woman bought it for him!”</p>
 <p>“Maybe he has fallen in love with someone?”</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>The secretaries were making all kinds of wild guesses and giggling excitedly.</p>
 <p>Song Pingting noticed it, too. She also knew that what they were saying was all true. At the thought, she almost broke the file folder in her hand in half out of rage. <em>Why? Why can’t he&nbsp;</em><em>notice</em><em>&nbsp;her once and appreciate her instead?</em></p>
