<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Mo Suqing, adding fuel to the flames, remarked, “Well, I can feel I’m not very welcomed here!”</p>
 <p>She shot Bai Lian a pointed look.</p>
 <p>Bai Lian flared up at the taunt. “What do you mean by that? Do you not know how to respect your elders?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing had not expected that she who usually acted the most obediently would flip out.</p>
 <p>Looks like Mo Zhenfeng’s offer of a job in the Mo Group to Ye Zhongjue really got to her.</p>
 <p><em>Good!&nbsp;</em>sneered Mo Suqing inwardly. <em>Can’t keep it in any longer, can you? Let’s see what’s behind that hypocritical façade!&nbsp;</em><em>It’s time you drop all your pretense!</em></p>
 <p>“Elders? Are you my elder? Are you <em>worthy</em> to be my elder?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing attacked ruthlessly. Bai Lian’s face immediately went livid.</p>
 <p>Mo Zhenfeng cast a quick glance at Ye Zhongjue and barked, “Mo Suqing, you have crossed a line! You, of all people, will not disrespect the hierarchy in the family!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing laughed miserably. It was a glorious yet sorrowful smile, like the last second of some magnificent fireworks. Ye Zhongjue felt pained seeing her like this.</p>
 <p>“Is that right? I have always known I’m a nobody in this family, so you don’t have to remind me! And why should I respect her? She’s not my mother!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing fixed her eyes on Mo Zhenfeng, holding her head up.</p>
 <p>Mo Zhenfeng thundered, “You are going to infuriate me to death one day, you unfilial girl!”</p>
 <p>Then, he coughed violently a few times.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing seemed to be determined to provoke him as much as possible today. She glared at Mo Zhenfeng with her huge, black eyes and said, “Yes, I am unfilial, definitely not as filial as your younger daughter. Please take your time and enjoy her filial obedience!”</p>
 <p>She looked around the living room indignantly and fixed her eyes on something.</p>
 <p>“Ever since mom&nbsp;had passed, nobody has ever truly welcomed me, an outsider. I’m leaving&nbsp;and&nbsp;I will&nbsp;never set foot here&nbsp;again!”</p>
 <p>Then, she took Ye Zhongjue’s hand, turned and left, without a second glance at Mo Zhenfeng.</p>
 <p>Mo Zhenfeng seemed to throw something down hard.</p>
 <p>From a distance, Mo Suqing could still hear him yell, “Don’t you ever dare come back, you unfilial daughter!”</p>
 <p>Bai Lian smiled, pleased with the developments. <em>The Mo Group will only belong to my daughter in the end!</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing, hearing what Mo Zhenfeng had said, smiled bitterly. She did not pause; she just kept walking further and further away from her father.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue turned to look at her. She was obviously very sad, yet kept trying to put on a brave face.</p>
 <p>“Ye Zhongjue, don’t let go of my hand or look at me; I fear I will cry if you do.”</p>
 <p>There was a twinkle in Ye Zhongjue’s eyes when he turned his head away and replied resolutely, “Okay, I will never let go of you for the rest of my life!”</p>
 <p>A smile slowly spread over Mo Suqing’s face. It was a half-smiling, half-crying ugly smile.</p>
 <p>After Ye Zhongjue and Mo Suqing left the Mo’s…</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue did not drive home. Instead, he took Mo Suqing to dinner.</p>
 <p>After that, they got on the car once again.</p>
 <p>On the way to their place, Ye Zhongjue handled Mo Suqing’s mood with great care, which only made her feel awkward.</p>
 <p>She peered at him uneasily and&nbsp;blurted, “Don’t treat me like a delicate flower. I am not that weak and fragile. They are not going to affect me!”</p>
 <p>Despite what she said, Ye Zhongjue knew she just did not like to show her vulnerability.</p>
 <p>However, he would give her anything she wanted.</p>
 <p>He said, “Sure, I don’t think you are ‘a delicate flower.’ I just feel that you have a complicated relationship with your family, that is all.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing pursed her lips, not buying his words. He was obviously trying to comfort her; his expression already betrayed what was on his mind.</p>
 <p>That being said, she was still very grateful for his&nbsp;willingness to grant her&nbsp;whatever she was asking for.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, she looked at him amusedly and curiously.</p>
 <p>“Hey, Ye Zhongjue, why did you buy those expensive gifts for Mo Sulian and Bai Lian? It was totally unnecessary and made me even more disgusted with them.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue sighed. “I&nbsp;did that for your father. After all, they lived together. I couldn’t possibly have given him a gift without thinking about the other two.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing pouted her lips like a little girl. “Humph! I don’t think so! I think you like Mo Sulian and that’s why you bought such pretty earrings for her. Am I right?”</p>
 <p>She raised her voice&nbsp;for&nbsp;the last sentence. Ye Zhongjue almost drove the car into the curb.</p>
 <p>“You have never bought anything for me! And then you bought her an expensive and lovely&nbsp;gift! I am mad at you!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing covered her eyes with her hands, but there were huge gaps between her fingers for her to observe Ye Zhongjue’s reaction.</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, she became a chirpy bird, as if nothing had happened earlier.</p>
 <p>He shook his head. “I didn’t buy those gifts myself. I gave a colleague some money and asked her to buy gifts for a man and two women for me. She was very happy to help me out.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing leaned closer, smiling. “I hope you didn’t ask her for the favor in exchange for your body!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue could feel her breath in his ear and became a bit restless.</p>
 <p>“Stop it, I’m driving a car! Are you jealous because I didn’t buy you a gift?” Ye Zhongjue teased.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing tilted her head as if deliberating something that could not be taken lightly.</p>
 <p>Looking at her cute behavior, Ye Zhongjue said in a tender voice that wrapped her with affections, “I’ll never ask anyone a favor in exchange for my body… unless it’s you.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing blushed scarlet. Then, she turned to look at him and said mischievously, “Drive safe, or I will not ask you any favors in exchange for <em>my</em> body!”</p>
 <p>Looking at her cute and charming smile, Ye Zhongjue laughed, “Alright, alright!”</p>
 <p>After arriving at their destination, they got off the car and walked into the elevator.</p>
 <p>Before she knew it, Mo Suqing was enveloped in a tight embrace.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue kissed her passionately and persistently. It was difficult to get away from it.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing slapped at his waist and moaned, “Ye Zhongjue… no… camera… in the elevator!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue kept kissing her. He was probably not kissing her hard enough, he thought, or she would not have time to think about trivial things like the camera.</p>
 <p>“That’s fine, I have you blocked!” Seeing that she could barely gasp for breath, Ye Zhongjue paused a moment.</p>
 <p>Then, before Mo Suqing could say anything, he locked her mouth with his again.</p>
 <p>Her face was flushed and so soft as if water could be squeezed out of it.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue felt compelled to show his, well, “animal” side.</p>
 <p>Out of the elevator, Mo Suqing turned her head this way and that, avoiding Ye Zhongjue’s mouth while giggling uncontrollably.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue scooped her up in his arms, then, walking over to their door, opened and closed it in one smooth motion.</p>
 <p>Closing the door behind them, he locked the girl, still in his arms, in a tight embrace and kissed her on the mouth hard.</p>
 <p>Shy and exasperated at his behavior, Mo Suqing could not help but wonder, <em>Do you have aphrodisiac in your system? What’s with the roughness?</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing, gasping, pushed him away and laid her hands firmly on his chest.</p>
 <p>“Let’s take a shower first…”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue didn’t heed her words and was about to lower his head toward her face.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing, panicked, pushed firmly against him. “No… Ye Zhongjue, what is the matter with you today…”</p>
 <p>She looked extremely embarrassed and bashful.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue chuckled. In a sexy tone filled with desire, he said, “Tell me, who is it that said even if I want to cheat on you…”</p>
 <p>On hearing the first few words of the quote, Mo Suqing moaned inwardly, <em>Oh no, he did hear the conversation between her and Mo Sulian earlier! This is so bad…</em></p>
 <p>She laughed nervously and kept his face in a distance while hers screwed up into a crumple. “Ye Zhongjue, I beg your pardon! Please spare me. I did not mean it. It was just for pissing off Mo Sulian that I said it. It truly didn’t mean anything…”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue leaned forward forcibly and hugged Mo Suqing tightly. Mo Suqing could feel the hardness against her abdomen.</p>
 <p>No longer an innocent maiden, she sure knew what it was.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue lowered his head, his warm breath tickling Mo Suqing’s ear. “Suqing,” he said, “but it is too late. It is ready to do what it must do. I can’t stop it…”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing could not believe she was hearing&nbsp;such&nbsp;dirty words from him.</p>
 <p>Now, her hands had been stuck between their chests, so they were useless to resist him. She said exasperatedly, “Rascal!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue chuckled. “Only in front of you…”</p>
 <p>He kissed her earlobe tenderly and fondly.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing trembled. It was as if an electric current had just shot through her. She knew very well what it meant: she had been aroused big time.</p>
 <p><em>No way! He is planning to have her right here and now! She should resist him harder, but she cannot… Now she is going to succumb to him.</em></p>
 <p>The weak struggle from Mo Suqing, in Ye Zhongjue’s eyes, was just proof that she had wanted this all along. This made him even rougher.</p>
 <p>They did it from the carpet in the living room to the bathroom. Mo Suqing had no idea how she ended up in bed.</p>
 <p>The next day when she got up, she saw bruises all over her body, more than after the first time they had done it in the hotel room.</p>
 <p>She could kill Ye Zhongjue now! He was just ruthless last night. Naturally, her back hurt like hell.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing rubbed her back and was about to put on her clothes when Ye Zhongjue emerged from the bathroom.</p>
 <p>Smiling, Ye Zhongjue came over and touched her nose with one finger. He suggested he help her&nbsp;put on&nbsp;clothes and Mo Suqing, although a little shy, nodded. After all, they had been together for a while now.</p>
 <p>Besides, she was too tired to do it herself. However, the moment Ye Zhongjue laid eyes on her smooth body, he was immediately aroused.</p>
 <p>Men usually had the highest sex drive in the morning.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing had not expected that an act as innocent as putting on some clothes would result in&nbsp;more wild sex.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing, her back pain unbearable, struggled to pack her handbag for work. She kept cursing Ye Zhongjue in her heart. <em>Monster! The man is a sheer monster!&nbsp;</em>She could barely walk straight.</p>
 <p>However, seeing that she was going to be late, Mo Suqing quickened her pace to brush her teeth.</p>
 <p>She swore she would never let him help her change into her clothes.</p>
 <p>Once again, they had their breakfast in the car.</p>
 <p>When Mo Suqing got off the car, she gave him a look and&nbsp;exclaimed, “You are not allowed to act like that ever again!”</p>
 <p>She quickly ran toward the building, not wanting to see Ye Zhongjue’s darkened face.</p>
