<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Guan Zijue had already found quite a bit of evidence that points to Su Xiaoran being the murderer. He simply had to find her and get her arrested.</p>
 <p>Guan Mingchang wondered what Guan Zijue meant when he said he had yet to thank Xia Zi for her help. <em>What did she help him with? Why was I unaware?</em></p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan caught his father’s expression and he knew instantly that though curious, pride would get the better of him and his father would not ask about it. He thus asked, “Bro, what did A’zi help you with? Why don’t I know about it?”</p>
 <p>Guan Zijue looked at him, as if saying,<em>&nbsp;You obviously already know.</em> He glanced at his father and saw that he seemed not to mind this, so he answered, “A’zi didn’t tell you? She was the one who helped to look for the final pieces of evidence so we could bring down the Su family.”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan pretended to be surprised at this. “Oh… I see!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zijue nodded and fell silent.</p>
 <p>Guan Mingchang looked at Xia Zi. He had heard about who she really was and that she was quite well-known in Interpol. The part about her helping Guan Zijue collect evidence was likely to be true.</p>
 <p>He turned to Xia Xinsheng who was now helping to serve the dishes.</p>
 <p>To him, his beautiful and elegant wife had always been understanding. It was Guan Zixuan who could not understand that what they were doing was all for his own good.&nbsp;He then looked at Xia Zi and said, “Since you’re here, let’s have dinner. We’ll talk about things after!”</p>
 <p>Everyone heaved a sigh of relief at this. This meant that it would be peaceful tonight.</p>
 <p>It was an irrefutable fact that Xia Zi had run away from their marriage, but the fact that Guan Mingchang had not yet flown into a rage at this point meant that there was still a chance for them.</p>
 <p>Due to the change in Guan Mingchang’s attitude, Xia Zi felt a lot more comfortable now.</p>
 <p>While they were having dinner, something else was happening at a bar in Emperor City.</p>
 <p>At the Color of Water Bar.</p>
 <p>A woman sat at the counter as she drowned herself with endless drinks.</p>
 <p>Her eyes glinted when she spotted a man nearby. <em>Lu Ming from the Lu family. Great!</em></p>
 <p>Before she walked over to Lu Ming, she spotted two sleazy men at a corner.</p>
 <p>She approached the men on purpose without alarming them in order to eavesdrop on their conversation.</p>
 <p>“Laosan, think about it. Even though we did that to Su Xiaoran that day, isn’t it the boss' fault for not reminding us? He didn’t tell us that it was the Guan family’s young master who wanted to scare Su Xiaoran!”</p>
 <p>“Well… Boss is looking for us everywhere now. If we really end up in a corner, we can always go look for Guan Zixuan and threaten him. It was his idea to capture Su Xiaoran in the first place. We can sue him for that. When that happens, it’ll be a lose-lose situation and I’m sure he wouldn’t want to see that either...”</p>
 <p>The woman froze.</p>
 <p><em>Guan Zixuan. The culprit was Guan Zixuan. I would never have guessed that it was him. How could it be Guan Zixuan who sent those men to take those photos?</em></p>
 <p>That woman was none other than Su Xiaoran. Revenge was the only thing on her mind after her mother committed suicide and her family fell from grace. She left with the facial prosthetics that her brother gave her and turned into someone even she herself could not recognize.</p>
 <p>She never expected for the Guan family to be behind everything.</p>
 <p>Su Xiaoran’s fists clenched, but she forced herself to smile as she walked over to the men, revealing a little bit under her collar.</p>
 <p>“Gentlemen, let’s have fun together!”</p>
 <p>Su Xiaoran’s voice was nothing but enchanting. The men exchanged glances before sleazy smiles appeared on their faces.&nbsp;They had been trying to hide from their boss because of what happened recently, and they did not dare to go out much.&nbsp;They were overjoyed now that there was one who came knocking on their door voluntarily!</p>
 <p>The three of them then walked out of the bar together.</p>
 <p>After a while, two cries could be heard from a dark alley nearby. Su Xiaoran walked out of that same alley shortly after with a&nbsp;bloodthirsty smile.</p>
 <p><em>Guan Zixuan, Guan Zixuan! It’s all your fault! I’m going to make you pay with your blood!</em></p>
 <p>She entered the bar again and saw that Lu Ming was still sitting in the same place having his drinks. He looked rather serious.</p>
 <p>Su Xiaoran walked over and smiled at him. “Hey handsome, let’s have a drink!”</p>
 <p>She looked quite refined and did not look like she was in prostitution, but what she said made Lu Ming frown slightly.</p>
 <p>Su Xiaoran knew Lu Ming very well.&nbsp;Lu Ming had feelings for her from a long time ago, but because she only had eyes for Guan Zixuan, nothing had happened between them.</p>
 <p>She knew very well what kind of girls Lu Ming fancied.&nbsp;Lu Ming thought that the woman in front of him felt familiar, and he even thought that she seemed rather similar to Su Xiaoran in a way. Even her build was similar to Su Xiaoran, but it was obvious from her facial features that she was not the girl.</p>
 <p>He wondered where Su Xiaoran went as he watched the woman in front of him act like a sly fox, trying to seduce him.&nbsp;He then pulled her towards him and smiled at her, exchanging drinks.&nbsp;They continued drinking for a while before they left the bar hand in hand.</p>
 <p>They spent the night together.</p>
 <p>Lu Ming saw Su Xiaoran smiling at him when he woke up the next day, revealing a little bit of her smooth shoulders.&nbsp;His expression changed. “We...”</p>
 <p>Su Xiaoran reached out to stop him from continuing. “What? You’re going to say that you drank too much and can’t remember a thing?”</p>
 <p>Lu Ming shook his head at this. “No, it’s not that. I just didn’t think that...”</p>
 <p>He never thought that the woman would follow him to a hotel last night, and he never expected for them to...</p>
 <p>Su Xiaoran said, “I know you’re Lu Ming. The Lu family is quite well-known in Emperor City. I won’t ask for much. I just want to spend some time with you. Because, I’ve harbored feelings for you for a long time...”</p>
 <p>Su Xiaoran spoke gently, but her words were like a spell which enamored Lu Ming.</p>
 <p>Lu Ming’s gaze darkened as he looked down, as if contemplating something. He then looked back at her and agreed.</p>
 <p>“Okay!”</p>
 <p>Su Xiaoran reached up to touch Lu Ming’s chest. “All I want is to be together with you to make up for all this lost time over the years...”</p>
 <p>Though Lu Ming could not really understand her, he did not want to interrupt the woman either.</p>
 <p>Su Xiaoran targeted Lu Ming because she knew that he had feelings for her. Even though she was unable to reciprocate those feelings, she treated this as a way to pay him back for all those years. She was making use of him, but it was also an avenue for her to return his feelings.&nbsp;She wanted to manipulate Lu Ming and use him to get closer to Guan Zixuan!</p>
 <p>Su Xiaoran would fill with rage every time the name ‘Guan Zixuan’ appeared in her mind...</p>
 <p>She spent her time together with Lu Ming. There was something about her that made Lu Ming like her more and more, and he began taking her to most of the events that he had to attend.</p>
 <p>It was the Fengteng Group’s annual gala dinner tonight, and all the business elites of Emperor City were invited.&nbsp;Lu Ming brought Su Xiaoran with him.</p>
 <p>Xia Zi’s eyelids kept twitching when she was changing into her outfit for tonight. She had this sense of foreboding but did not know why she felt so uneasy.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan picked her up before the gala dinner and they left together with Luo Qiqi.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi tried to comfort Xia Zi when she saw how uneasy she seemed to look.&nbsp;“A’zi, are you okay? It’s just a gala dinner. There’s no need for you to take it so seriously...”</p>
 <p>Xia Zi shook her head and said, “I don’t know why but I just feel a bit uneasy!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan smiled at Xia Zi through the rearview mirror.&nbsp;“Don’t worry, A’zi. It’s just business elites there tonight, and my dad wouldn’t be there either. There’s no need for you to feel uneasy...”</p>
 <p>“Mm!” Xia Zi nodded.&nbsp;She did not know how to describe that feeling to Luo Qiqi and Guan Zixuan, but she felt extremely anxious and uneasy, as if something bad was about to happen.</p>
 <p>When they arrived at the event, Luo Qiqi excused herself and left for the event first, giving Guan Zixuan and Xia Zi some time together.&nbsp;Xia Zi shook her head at Luo Qiqi’s smirk.</p>
 <p>When Guan Zixuan and Xia Zi walked in, everyone there seemed to freeze as all eyes landed on them. Guan Zixuan was the star for tonight.&nbsp;Xia Zi was not used to this sort of attention and was slightly flustered at first, but she was able to calm herself down very quickly.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan’s hand was on her shoulder as the both of them walked in.&nbsp;A crowd formed around the couple, with many of the guests trying to get into Guan Zixuan’s good books.</p>
 <p>Lu Ming kept his eyes on Guan Zixuan. <em>He’s the one who caused Su Xiaoran’s family to fall. I’ve wanted to take revenge on him, but Dad just won’t let me do so.</em></p>
 <p>His father told him that the Guan family was not one to be trifled with, and he warned him multiple times not to do anything.</p>
 <p>Lu Ming clenched his fists, his knuckles cracking loudly as he did so.&nbsp;He wanted to slice Guan Zixuan into a thousand tiny pieces right now. With all his focus being on Guan Zixuan, he did not realize how the woman beside him reacted when she saw Guan Zixuan walk in.</p>
 <p>A myriad of emotions seemed to flash in her eyes as she stared at Guan Zixuan.</p>
 <p>Lu Ming did not notice this change in her as he walked up to Guan Zixuan directly.&nbsp;Su Xiaoran followed behind him quickly.</p>
 <p>Seeing how unfriendly Lu Ming was, some of the guests in the crowd made way for him, not wanting to be embroiled in a possibly messy situation.&nbsp;The two men had never been on good terms in the past because of Su Xiaoran, and now that she was missing, it was highly likely that they might even get into a fight right here.</p>
 <p>Lu Ming looked at Guan Zixuan mockingly. “Looking good, President Guan!”</p>
