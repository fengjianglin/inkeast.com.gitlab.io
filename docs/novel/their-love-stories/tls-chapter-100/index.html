 <p>“An Huilin is a member of the An family?” Ye Zhongjue frowned at Ceng Hanyu.</p>
 <p>“You bet!” Ceng Hanyu followed Ye Zhongjue and got into the passenger seat of his car.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue got in, too. “Tell me everything.”</p>
 <p>“That would be a long story.”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu was trying to keep him on his toes, but Ye Zhongjue just gave him a look and said, “Make it short then.”</p>
 <p>“Alright, alright! You just love to tyrannize me!”</p>
 <p>“Anyway, An Huilin is not directly related to the Ans, although she does own some shares of the Group. I have met her&nbsp;at&nbsp;the shareholders meeting a few times. She’s a distant relative of the old man. They are not very close.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue nodded his understanding.</p>
 <p>“By the way, where are you going?”</p>
 <p>“My company,” Ye Zhongjue answered him flatly and began to make a phone call.</p>
 <p>“Yes, hold a press conference now. I’ll be there in a minute. Just make it happen.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue rang off and headed toward Mighty Empire at full speed.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu was speechless. “Why didn’t you tell me you are going to your company? Are you going to dump me along the way?”</p>
 <p>“Either get off now, or go to the company with me.”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu didn’t know what to say. <em>It’s unfortunate of me!</em></p>
 <p><em>What kind of a friend is he?</em></p>
 <p>“Oh well. I guess I can look around in your company.”</p>
 <p>They had barely arrived when Lin Ran appeared to take over the car.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue took the documents Lin Ran had prepared for him and walked toward the elevator.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu followed suit.</p>
 <p>The elevator stopped at the tenth floor. Ceng Hanyu and Ye Zhongjue strode across to the backstage area.</p>
 <p>A huge event venue which could house a thousand people occupied the whole floor. But even so, it was crowded with journalists.</p>
 <p>When everything was ready, Ye Zhongjue walked onto the spotlighted stage.</p>
 <p>The journalists below looked at him expectantly. This was the king of the business world in A City they were looking at! A word from him could cause a turmoil.</p>
 <p>And now, his true identity had just come out along with a scandal between him and a gossip journalist!</p>
 <p>Everyone was excited. They rubbed their hands and got ready to cook up some huge stories.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu felt the journalists were looking at Ye Zhongjue like a bunch of hungry wolves at a chunk of meat.</p>
 <p>He rubbed his nose, chuckling. <em>Sorry&nbsp;</em><em>for having a wild imagination&nbsp;</em><em>and draw</em><em>ing</em><em>&nbsp;an analogy between Prince Charming and a chunk of meat!</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue stood on the stage with careless ease; he was emanating a powerful vibe.</p>
 <p>He was the kind of person who attracted attention among a crowd with his mere existence.</p>
 <p>His appearance, his manner, his privilege, his vibe, his background, his aura – they were all looked up to.</p>
 <p>“Today, I would like to clarify the scandal between me and Miss Mo Suqing.”</p>
 <p>This caused an uproar in the audience. It was totally worth it to come here!</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue continued leisurely, “About the exposure of my identity, I can let it go. Although I am no superstar or TV personality, I know as the president of Mighty Empire that I cannot have complete peace in my life. If you are able to dig out and expose my true identity, that just means you are good.”</p>
 <p>“However,” Ye Zhongjue’s tone became stern, “what the hell is ‘Journalist Obsessed with Him’ supposed to mean? And who is ‘Clown Character,’ if I may ask? And ‘Journalist Covets After the Rich and Harms Self to Win Sympathy’? I mean, what kind of a moron wrote that?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s voice was as chilling and sharp as the wintry gale.</p>
 <p>“I am going to make a declaration: Mo Suqing is neither your so-called clown character, nor a Cinderella who wants to marry into a wealthy family. She has never been obsessed with or harassed me, because it is me who has loved her, who wants to cherish her and give her a happy home. Today is&nbsp;our 3rd month anniversary.”</p>
 <p>Now, the uproar had turned into a full-blown commotion.</p>
 <p><em>What? Mo Suqing is married to Ye Jue? That’s breaking news!</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue continued firmly, “That’s right, I am married. My wife is the gossip journalist who you thought wanted to marry into a wealthy family. I have never thought what she does is lowly, because she is the kindest, most ethical gossip journalist I have ever known. She never makes others suffer for her career.”</p>
 <p>“So let me ask you this: what exactly did she do wrong? How come a fight between husband and wife would be described as self-harm on her part, and her being seen with me would be deemed as an obsession? Well?”</p>
 <p>At his words, the journalists looked ashen.</p>
 <p>Many of them worked for magazines or newspapers who had published scandals about Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue chuckled scornfully. “I respect my wife. I love her. She is my precious treasure,&nbsp;and&nbsp;has always been. I will not tolerate anyone who tries to ruin her reputation. I will sue each of the newspapers that have published those stories without solid proof for defamation. My lawyer will send&nbsp;the notice to your office this afternoon.”</p>
 <p>His words were a slap that hit across the face of every journalist.</p>
 <p>They had brought this to themselves! And&nbsp;this was what they got!</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue paused for effect and then continued, “I want those who have defamed my wife to make a public statement as an apology in three days. Otherwise, I’ll follow through the lawsuit against all of you.”</p>
 <p>One of the journalists spoke up.</p>
 <p>“President Ye, how should we believe what you said about Miss Mo being your wife? It may well be that you two are good friends and you lied&nbsp;about it in order to protect her.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue raised his eyebrows and gave the journalist a look before responding, “On the screen behind me, I’m going to show our marriage certificate. If this isn’t enough evidence for you, feel free to look it up on the website of the Civil Affairs Bureau to ascertain it.”</p>
 <p>The screen lit up and showed a clear image of a marriage certificate. The journalists hastened to snap photos of it.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, another journalist raised a bold question, “President Ye, I can’t imagine your parents would approve of a daughter-in-law like Miss Mo. Did they approve of your decision to marry her? Also, you said Miss Mo didn’t harass you, so I take it means you were the one who chased after her?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked around the audience and replied calmly,&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“First of all, I don’t have to answer the question about if my parents approve of my wife; it’s my private affair. Second of all, you said so yourself that I was the one who got married, not my parents. I have my right to choose my own wife, and even if they don’t approve of it, I’ll try my best to persuade them. We are married now; I just want to treat her well with all my heart.”</p>
 <p>Then, he turned to look at the journalist who had asked that question. “You asked me if I was the one who chased after her, if she didn’t harass me. My answer is yes. I chased after her. I have known her for seven years and liked her as long. I can do anything for her and make the impossible possible.”</p>
 <p>His eyes swept the venue once more before he spoke again, “Now, are you clear about everything? If so, let’s call it a day. Lastly, I’ll say it again that I will not tolerate anyone who tries to ruin my wife’s reputation. Please respect others and conduct yourselves!”</p>
 <p>He turned around elegantly and disappeared into the backstage.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu was dumbstruck. He was completely shocked.</p>
 <p>He had never seen Ye Zhongjue like this before. It was as if the girl he was talking about meant everything to him.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, he felt a bit envious that he had found the one and that he could defend his love so staunchly.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>When Mo Suqing woke up in the hospital, Guan Zixuan was by her bed.</p>
 <p>She immediately threw the blanket away and tried to get off the bed, despite the fact that she was still on a drip.</p>
 <p>Shocked, Guan Zixuan grabbed her. “What are you doing? Your body&nbsp;has&nbsp;just recovered. You wanna pass out again?”</p>
 <p>“Where’s Yao? How is she?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing sounded like she was about to burst into tears.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan was reluctant to reply. “Don’t! Please don’t cry. Mo Suqing, my queen, do not cry anymore. Your eyes are so swollen, they are like walnuts now! What should I do about you?”</p>
 <p>“Save it and answer my question!”</p>
 <p>“Alright, alright. I will. But you need to lie down first.”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan pressed her down.</p>
 <p>“Stop worrying. It’s the most useless thing to do. Leng Xiyao is badly injured, but luckily. She survived the operation. I heard that she has multiple fractures and we can’t be certain about the prognosis at this point. She had just finished the surgery and is in the ICU. Even Leng Haoyun can only stay outside, so there is no use for you to go find her. Just be reassured and wait here.”</p>
 <p><em>Yao survived the operation! But, her future is uncertain…</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing felt both happy and worried at the same time. <em>I hope there won’t be any sequelae. You have to be okay, Yao.</em></p>
 <p>“What about Bai Tingnan? We mustn’t let her go! She did this to Yao!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was a little worked up. After all, if it wasn’t for Bai Tingnan, Yao wouldn’t be here at all.</p>
 <p>“Don’t get so worked up. Listen to me,” Guan Zixuan soothed. “After you and Leng Xiyao got on the ambulance, the police arrested Bai Tingnan. It is said that she is mad.”</p>
 <p>“What?” Mo Suqing sat up, using her hands as support.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan got up and adjusted the angle of the bed, so that she could lean back.</p>
 <p>“I have done some research. It was Trend Magazine who first published the stories about you and Leng Xiyao, and Bai Tingnan was the one who dug out the information. She must have felt bold at that time, because she submitted everything to An Huilin. I heard that you two don’t get along with An Huilin, and that’s probably why she decided to publish the stories as they came to her. she didn’t even run it by Leng Haoyun.”</p>
