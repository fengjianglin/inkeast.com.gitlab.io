 <p>However, even if she would love to cut ties with these people by getting married, she didn’t want to marry into a rich and powerful family. Throughout history, rich and powerful families had been a complicated race. She had known best for all these years, hadn’t she?</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing laughed, “That’s fine. All I want is to stay away from the filthy world of rich people…”</p>
 <p>She sounded utterly sad.&nbsp;Initially, she had thought that if she got herself a job after graduation instead of working in her father’s company, she could finally be rid of the troubles that had been haunting her all these years. Little did she know that real life never went the way you wanted it to. Not for a second was she rid of the filth. By the look of it, Gu Jiannan and Mo Sulian had been together for a while. It was&nbsp;pathetic&nbsp;she hadn’t realized it until now.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was surprised. All she wanted was to stay away from the filthy world of rich people? He remembered that her family was quite well-off too. Something must have happened without his knowing. Otherwise, why would she say that?</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue made a decision. He quickly&nbsp;interjected, “Oh no,&nbsp;this is a misunderstanding. I am just an assistant. I went to the pub on behalf of my boss last night and someone drugged me. They paid for this room out of guilt… Please don’t misunderstand.”</p>
 <p>Watching his earnest expression, Mo Suqing felt her stiffened body relax a little. She gave him a dubious look, “Are you telling the truth?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue nodded fervently. “I want to take responsibility&nbsp;for my actions&nbsp;and give you a home…”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Mo Suqing was touched. She admitted that she was actually stirred.&nbsp;<em>Home, what a wonderful word. The world is such a big place, yet I can’t find a shelter. I no longer want to return to the so-called home.</em></p>
 <p>Gu Jiannan used to say that if&nbsp;she left home, their social status would not match and that could be a hindrance to their&nbsp;marriage. So, she stayed.</p>
 <p>But now… ha! There was truly nothing at all that could attach her to that home. She not only lost&nbsp;all&nbsp;attachment, but was also filled with great disgust.</p>
 <p>She lowered her head and thought for a while. Then, “Can you promise me something?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue raised his brows and moved his lips, “And what is that?”</p>
 <p>“Let it be a conditional marriage. After three years, we will go our separate ways…”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue frowned, not getting it.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing blushed, “I mean, we will get a divorce after three years. However, during our three years of marriage, I will&nbsp;fulfill my duties as the wife…”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue realized what she meant&nbsp;and&nbsp;thought about it. A lot could happen in three years. He would take the bet. He was going to bet that she wouldn’t want to leave him after three years.</p>
 <p>He said in a deep voice, “Okay, I can promise you that!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was a bit surprised. But, didn’t she get what she asked for?</p>
 <p>She said calmly, “Okay! Let’s get married!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue and Mo Suqing exchanged their phone numbers and decided to go home&nbsp;to fetch&nbsp;their household registers.</p>
 <p>After Mo Suqing left, Ye Zhongjue thought about it all before fishing for his phone and dialing a number.</p>
 <p>The person on the other side of the phone sounded breezy, “Hey&nbsp;Boss, what’s the matter? Are you coming in today?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s voice was slow but steady, “I don’t care how you do it, but purchase every single project the company who paid my drinks last night is trying to get. I am going to buy their company in a week.”</p>
 <p>His tone was authoritative, leaving no room for questions. The other person paused for the briefest moment, then replied, “No problem,&nbsp;Boss. Consider it done.”</p>
 <p>“Also…” Ye Zhongjue sounded a bit hesitant. “Procure a condo in or near the Tri-ring Area for me. Not too big; seventy to a hundred square meters will do. Not too luxurious either; just something a normal office staff can afford. Furnish the place by noon with some simple, elegant furniture. After that, take my clothes there and tidy up the house. That’s all.”</p>
 <p>The other person dropped his jaw. He said, uncertainly, “No way,&nbsp;Boss! You are moving to Tri-ring? In a place a normal office staff can afford? What…”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue remembered that he still needed to get his household register, so he hurriedly cut off the other person’s rambling in a rather icy tone, “Just do what you are told! No more bullshit!”</p>
 <p>“Okay okay, no more bullshit,&nbsp;Boss. I’m going now. Your condo will be ready before noon as you wish.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue hung up the phone. Then, he slowly raised his hand to rub his sore forehead. Needless to say, he had to play his part well for that woman.</p>
 <p>Although he did look a little weary, his brows gradually unfurled. Everything was worth it if he could win her heart.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing returned home and saw Bai Lian lounging on the downstairs sofa leisurely. She gave Mo Suqing a fleeting glance full of pride and menace. One day, she would kick that woman’s daughter out, too.</p>
 <p>Then, this house would belong to her and her precious Sulian only.</p>
 <p>It was difficult to tell her mood when she casually remarked, “Isn’t it our great journalist? We were worried you were not coming home anymore…”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing ignored her and went upstairs.</p>
 <p>She came back to get hold of the household register, not to fight with that woman. She was so fed up with this “home” that she couldn’t stay here for more than a minute.</p>
