 <p>Ceng Hanyu shook his head, not knowing how to make him feel better.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked at Tang Zeng, who had passed out, and said, “Let him go. I owe him a life.”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu’s expression changed. “Are you sure about this?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue turned around, gave a noncommittal reply, and began to walk away.</p>
 <p>However, he had barely taken a few steps when his knees gave way.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu quickly caught him in time.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu had touched something wet. Alarmed, he raised his right hand and saw blood all over it.</p>
 <p><em>I can’t believe him! Being so severely injured, he insisted on speaking with Tang Zeng first!</em></p>
 <p>“Take everyone away except Tang Zeng!” he quickly ordered.</p>
 <p>Then, he supported Ye Zhongjue and walked out of the factory.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Shortly after Ceng Hanyu and Ye Zhongjue left the place, a slender figure emerged from a dark corner, followed by two black-clad men.</p>
 <p>When the figure reached where there was enough light, Jian Jie’s beautiful yet evil face was revealed.</p>
 <p>She wrung her hands together. She had taken great pains to devise the plan, but the stupid Song Pingting still failed. She hadn’t killed Mo Suqing or harmed the baby!</p>
 <p>Jian Jie walked over to the unconscious Tang Zeng, kicking Song Pingting’s body on the way, and smiled a creepy smile.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue had decided to let the man go. However, she didn’t think Tang Zeng would let go the hard feelings Tang Mo’s death had caused.</p>
 <p>“Take him away,” she commanded.</p>
 <p>The two men in black combat clothing pulled Tang Zeng up. Then, the three of them quickly left the factory.</p>
 <p>-</p>
 <p>When Ye Zhongjue woke up, he was in an empty hospital ward. He struggled to sit up as memories of what had happened before he passed out came flooding back.</p>
 <p><em>Suqing has been rescued. And the baby… How is the baby?</em></p>
 <p><em>She probably knows my identity by now.&nbsp;</em>This time, it wasn’t going to be easy to explain himself.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue put a hand over his wound around the waist and frowned in pain.</p>
 <p>Right then, the door to the ward opened.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu strode inside. Seeing that Ye Zhongjue was not lying on the bed, he frowned.</p>
 <p>He put down the food he had brought and sat down in the chair next to the bed.</p>
 <p>“You just woke up and now you want to roam already. Can’t you wait for your injury to heal completely before you do that?” he asked and raised his eyebrows at Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue frowned at him. “How is Suqing?”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu sighed. “Don’t Suqing this, Suqing that! It seems to me that you can’t see anyone else except for Mo Suqing! Don’t you know you are wounded? Can’t you begin to care about your own life?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue repeated stubbornly, “How is Suqing? And how is the child?”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu knew that for Ye Zhongjue, his poker face didn’t match his worried heart. He snorted and replied, “She’s fine. Yi’an said that thankfully, they were sent here in time, so the child is okay, too. It got a little&nbsp;unstable, but will be fine with a few days’ rest. As for you! Can you please&nbsp;take better care of&nbsp;yourself?”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu looked at him in exasperation. Ye Zhongjue’s eyes dimmed as he asked calmly, “She knows, right?”</p>
 <p>“She probably&nbsp;found out&nbsp;about it back in the factory. She never left your side on the way here. After Yi’an gave her the green light, she stayed with you until you underwent the operation and the doctor said you would be alright. Then, she left with… Leng Xiyao.”</p>
 <p>“She left,” Ye Zhongjue said in a distant voice.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu sighed. He had no idea how to talk about these stuff. He himself had never faced&nbsp;such a thorny problem.</p>
 <p>Lies were a taboo in relationships, and Ye Zhongjue had told tons of them. Even though they were white lies, the truth behind them was still too much for Mo Suqing, who had got entangled in a world she didn’t belong to.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue stared into space and said, “I have been wondering if I made a mistake at the outset. But, it had been seven years and I hadn’t been able to forget her. That’s why on the night we met&nbsp;again, I decided to give myself a chance. I told myself if she was willing to get married with me and perhaps could fall in love with me, I would never ever let her go again. However, now she has discovered my many different identities. All I feel is panic. What should I do if she never forgives me? Hanyu, do you know this feeling I have?”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu opened his mouth but the words only came out after a while, “Well, I can’t say I know exactly how you feel, but I do know I have never seen you like this, bro. Don’t worry. You are going to have a child together. Mo Suqing has a good heart. I think she will prefer giving her child a complete family. She just can’t swallow everything all at once, you know? And she really cares about you. She was more nervous about your operation than anyone else. It was after she was certain that you would be alright that she began to feel awkward about your identity. Once you explain everything to her, I believe she will come around eventually, at least for the child. After all, no one can blame you for what happened to her this time and the reason you want to be with her is simply&nbsp;because of&nbsp;love. She will understand. Now, you are still quite weak. Eat something before resting more.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue shook his head. “I still feel concerned about her safety. No matter what you said, what happened to her is partly due to the fact that I was too neglectful. Send some men to protect her, will you? I’ll feel much more relaxed. Also, look deeper into the abduction. Somehow I feel things are not as simple as we think. Song Pingting said someone wanted to kill Suqing. She wouldn’t say it without a reason. Hanyu, I am injured now. Please help me watch out for her. She’s pregnant and must be well taken care of!”</p>
 <p>Watching Ye Zhongjue’s worried and eager expression, Ceng Hanyu couldn’t help but feel emotional himself. <em>Love always&nbsp;</em><em>brings</em><em>&nbsp;so much pain, but why&nbsp;</em><em>does&nbsp;</em><em>everyone still&nbsp;</em><em>fight</em><em>&nbsp;for it?</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was like this, but he wasn’t any better!</p>
 <p>“Okay, you don’t have to worry about it. Eat something first. After you have eaten, I’ll go look for Mo Suqing and make sure she is always safe. Also… I have something to tell you.”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu hesitated. Ye Zhongjue frowned. “What? What’s the matter?”</p>
 <p>“I think… I found Anne!”</p>
 <p>“What? After so many years of fruitless search, how&nbsp;did you find&nbsp;her so suddenly?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue felt incredulous. He had only taken a gunshot. He couldn’t have slept for more than a few days. How could Ceng Hanyu have found Anne in such a short time?</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu chuckled lightly. “I have you to thank for. If it weren’t for you and Mo Suqing, I wouldn’t have met her.”</p>
 <p>“Are you talking about Leng Xiyao?” Ye Zhongjue said disbelievingly.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu nodded and sat back down. “You bet! Grandpa An recognized her on Leng Haoyun’s engagement party. He said she looks exactly like her mother when she was young. I myself have forgotten what she looked like because I was too little. However, the old man showed me the picture. They are truly alike! I have taken her and Grandpa An’s hair to the laboratory for a DNA test. The result will come out tomorrow. I’m guessing she is most likely Anne.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s expression was hard to read. <em>No wonder Ceng Hanyu suddenly became so interested in her.</em></p>
 <p>“That’s good news. At the very least, you don’t have to use her as an excuse to reject Selina anymore.”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu jumped up from the chair like a cat whose tail had been stamped.</p>
 <p>“When did I use her as an excuse? I just don’t want to be involved with anyone because I want to focus on finding Anne!”</p>
 <p>An indiscernible smile tugged at the corner of Ye Zhongjue’s mouth. After so many years, Ceng Hanyu still didn’t know how he truly felt. He was totally oblivious of the way he panicked and became unlike his usual self every time someone brought up Selina.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was not going to argue with him. Ceng Hanyu must come to the realization himself. Others couldn’t help him.</p>
 <p>“Where’s Selina anyway?”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu glowered at him in exasperation.</p>
 <p>“She is taking care of some affairs in the organization. We made it a point to have a conspicuous evacuation and then we had to tell our members it was time to return. Naturally, it has been a hectic business. I’ll ask her to go back to England after everything is settled.”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu glanced at Ye Zhongjue and continued, “Alright! You take a good rest while I go to see Mo Suqing. Otherwise, you will probably kill me if one of her hair goes missing!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue watched Ceng Hanyu hurry off – or should he say “flee”? – in panic and smiled. Every time he mentioned Selina, the man&nbsp;would&nbsp;lose&nbsp;his cool or simply refuse to have the conversation. When could he be honest with himself?</p>
 <p>However, if Leng Xiyao was indeed Anne, it would probably be more difficult for Ceng Hanyu to think about him and Selina, considering the state Leng Xiyao was in these days.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu left the hospital and headed to the Shallow Sea Area.</p>
 <p>Although Mo Suqing was concerned about Ye Zhongjue’s identity and angry with him for lying to her again and again, she could feel with her heart how much he loved her. For god’s sake, she had witnessed how he risked his life to save her! It was impossible for her not to be moved.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, the baby was fine. She could deal with their issue after Ye Zhongjue’s wound healed.</p>
 <p>To ensure her own safety and the baby’s, she had gone back to the villa in Shallow Sea. Ceng Hanyu had told her he would send people to protect her.</p>
 <p>She didn’t want to live under the guard of Ye Zhongjue’s people, but what she hated more was to see her baby get hurt. It was the only link between her and Ye Zhongjue now.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was taking a long time off&nbsp;from work. Leng Haoyun had asked her not to go to work for a while, in case something should happen to her again. After all, everyone had gone to a lot of trouble rescuing her this time.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue had even gotten shot to protect her and the baby.</p>
