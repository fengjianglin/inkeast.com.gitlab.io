<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>All of a sudden, the door opened.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was in one of the cubicles in an instant. Holding his breath, he listened to the movement outside.</p>
 <p>It seemed to be a woman.</p>
 <p>“Asshole! Bitch! I feel&nbsp;terrible… So&nbsp;terrible… Ugh…”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue frowned.&nbsp;<em>Why, it sounds like a drunken woman throwing up, rather than those bastards looking for him.</em></p>
 <p>The vomiting continued. He opened the door of the cubicle just a crack and peeked out of it.</p>
 <p>A woman with&nbsp;shiny black&nbsp;waist-length hair came into sight. She looked… so beautiful.</p>
 <p>However, beautiful as her back suggested, she was also a stupid drunkard that had walked in the wrong restroom!</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue tried to suppress his burning desire before opening the door and walking out.</p>
 <p>His forehead was beaded with cold sweat; his expression became even more sullen.&nbsp;<em>Sons of bitches… how dared they&nbsp;</em><em>drug him</em><em>&nbsp;with something so&nbsp;</em><em>strong</em><em>!</em></p>
 <p>His every step&nbsp;appeared&nbsp;extremely&nbsp;constrained, his breathing labored.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing hadn’t realized she was drunk until now. She bent over the sink and began vomiting,&nbsp;completely oblivious that&nbsp;someone was coming&nbsp;from&nbsp;behind her.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was just walking past Mo Suqing when&nbsp;he heard&nbsp;light footsteps&nbsp;approaching.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue cursed inwardly.&nbsp;<em>Such measured footsteps can’t be right. They must belong to those bastards.</em></p>
 <p>He cast a glance at the woman bending over the sink, turned off the faucet and dragged her into the nearest cubicle without demur.</p>
 <p>As soon as the door was shut, he heard someone talking outside, “Boss, I don’t think Ye Jue is here…”</p>
 <p>Another person’s voice boomed out, “The bartender said he hadn’t left. Where else can he be except here? The drug is very strong; in a minute, he will fuck anyone including his own mother…”</p>
 <p>He gave&nbsp;the&nbsp;most obscene laugh.</p>
 <p><em>Sons of bitches!</em> Ye Zhongjue cracked his knuckles and thought gloomily.</p>
 <p>“Boss, someone is in that cubicle!”</p>
 <p>“Come! Let’s take a look!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue scowled. He looked at the woman whose mouth he had been covering and who was struggling to break free.</p>
 <p>Her face had makeup smudges all over it, so it was difficult to make out her real appearance. However, a woman getting herself drunk in a pub couldn’t be an angel either!</p>
 <p>Thinking this way, Ye Zhongjue hardened his heart and stopped trying to control the growing desire.</p>
 <p>He covered Mo Suqing’s mouth with one hand and used the other one on her soft waist to swiftly pull down her trousers and panties.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was so drunk and disoriented that she had not the slightest idea what this man was doing. She just kept struggling&nbsp;subconsciously.</p>
 <p>Without warning, a spasm of pain shot through her body. She bit into the hand that covered her mouth.</p>
 <p>The bite hurt a lot, but it didn’t stop Ye Zhongjue from satisfying his hunger. It was sheer bad luck that she walked into the wrong restroom and bumped into him in this state.</p>
 <p>The hoarse groan of a man and the low moan of a woman came out of the cubicle on and off.</p>
 <p>The two men from outside burst into laughter. One of them commented, “Boss, looks like people are having fun in there. Are we going to interrupt them?”</p>
 <p>The other man was silent for a while before speaking, “Let’s go. Ye Jue is probably not here. Let’s go look for him outside!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue felt a wave of relief when their footsteps faded away.</p>
 <p>However, there was no way to quench the roaring flame. He ignored the struggling and sobbing woman while continuing doing it…</p>
 <p>After a long while, Ye Zhongjue finally came out of the cubicle, pulling Mo Suqing along. His expression could not be any darker.&nbsp;<em>Those bastards! What kind of drug&nbsp;</em><em>did they use</em><em>?</em> It had been a long time, but the effect didn’t seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;wearing&nbsp;off. If anything, it became stronger.</p>
 <p>He gave the woman a sidelong glance, face still darkened.</p>
 <p><em>There is no difference between doing it once or multiple times, is there? Okay then!</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue half dragged, half pulled a staggering Mo Suqing all the way to the nearest hotel, Walton Hotel. He was a VIP member.</p>
 <p>He threw his VIP card in the direction of the receptionist and, without looking back, strode toward the elevator with Mo Suqing in his arms.</p>
 <p>Once in the room, Ye Zhongjue took Mo Suqing to the bathroom. He hardly knew how he could have done it in Blue Phantom when she looked so hideous.</p>
 <p>He swore tomorrow he would kill them for the goddamned drug.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue pushed Mo Suqing under the showerhead. She responded by trying to get away from the falling water.</p>
 <p>But, with Ye Zhongjue’s powerful hands locking her in place, she could do nothing but let the water pour down on her face.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue reached over and pushed her wet hair aside, revealing a makeup-free face that was light-complexioned, innocent and beautiful.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue froze the instant his gaze fell on her, utterly stunned.</p>
 <p><em>It</em><em>’</em><em>s her?&nbsp;</em>Seven years had passed, but her appearance hadn’t changed much.</p>
 <p><em>There’s no way he wouldn’t recognize her. It’s really her!</em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Joy, fury and confusion found Ye Zhongjue all at once.</p>
 <p>Joy found him because it was her; fury found him because he was angry with himself for having treated her like this; and confusion found him because a girl like her would never go to a pub and get drunk&nbsp;to this extent.</p>
 <p><em>Can it be that seven years have turned her into a different person?</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s heart ached badly for her. Enduring his own discomfort, he quickly washed her body clean, covered her with a towel and carried her to the bed.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked at her cleansed face. It was as attractive as he remembered. On an impulse, he&nbsp;kissed&nbsp;her red, small mouth.</p>
 <p>The kiss rekindled the fire that he had barely kept under control.</p>
 <p>With the effect of the drug in full swing, Ye Zhongjue’s eyes became blood-red.</p>
 <p>He could no longer think clearly. Desire overcame reason, and he buried himself deep inside her.</p>
 <p>He kept telling himself that he would be a responsible man. He would be responsible for her.</p>
 <p>The night progressed; pleasure and passion formed a duet.</p>
 <p>The first thing that occurred to Mo Suqing when she woke up in the morning was that her whole body felt like a car had run over it. That was how sore and hurt she was.</p>
 <p>She frowned. Fragments of the night before swept over her wave after wave.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was entirely stupefied.&nbsp;<em>Was it really her last night?</em></p>
 <p>She remembered she saw Mo Sulian and Gu Jiannan went into the hotel. Then, she and Leng Xiyao went to Blue Phantom for a drink. But after that…</p>
 <p>She seemed to&nbsp;have gone&nbsp;to the toilet and some guy seemed to&nbsp;have&nbsp;shown&nbsp;up out of nowhere. And then, there was pain.&nbsp;A&nbsp;throbbing, excruciating pain. Moreover, it seemed that it had rained and that she was soaked through.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing could only vaguely remember what had happened afterwards. In fact, she dared not be honest with herself about it.</p>
 <p>Then, she carefully pulled the sheet back. When she saw the purple marks all over her body, she was dumbstruck.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing couldn’t move at all, as if she had been hit by lightning.</p>
 <p>She had only one thought.&nbsp;<em>Did everything from the night before&nbsp;</em><em>actually</em><em>&nbsp;happen?</em></p>
 <p><em>Did she seriously sleep with some stranger?</em></p>
