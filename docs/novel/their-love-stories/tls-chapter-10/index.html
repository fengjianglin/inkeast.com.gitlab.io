 <p>Ye Zhongjue produced the keys from his briefcase and opened the door to the apartment.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing followed.</p>
 <p>She saw that it was a condo with an area of about a hundred square meters. There&nbsp;was&nbsp;a living room, an open kitchen, a bathroom, two bedrooms and a room that she assumed to be the study, whose door was ajar. Mo Suqing could make out a bookshelf inside.</p>
 <p>Her eyes blinked; an indefinable expression showed on her beautiful face.</p>
 <p><em>This is where he lives?</em> It was quite fitting, as a matter of fact. The place was just like its owner, clean and neat.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing took the suitcase from his hand and said in a quiet voice, “I’ll go unpack.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked at her, expressionless. “That&nbsp;can wait; you can take your time to unpack later. You are exhausted. Take a shower first.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing gave him a “are you kidding me” look. That was not true and he knew it. She had been sleeping all afternoon! If anyone was exhausted, it would be him.</p>
 <p>“So…” Mo Suqing looked at the two bedroom and&nbsp;hesitated, “Which one is my room?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue paused a moment before pointing at the bigger room on the left hand side and replying, “You can take your luggage to that room. From now on… it will be your bedroom.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing hesitated. At last, she dragged her suitcase toward the room he had indicated without another word.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue&nbsp;picked&nbsp;up his phone and made a call.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was at a loss when she entered the room. Sure, the bed was big, but the overall tone of the room was mostly black and gray.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing frowned. The man was so cold that even his condo was filled with cold colors. Was she really going to live here from now on?</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing shook her head. She couldn’t deal with this right now.</p>
 <p>She quickly took her clothes out from the suitcase and hung all of them in the silver-gray wardrobe. The colorful clothes instantly brightened up the whole room where originally there were only black, gray and white.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing closed the wardrobe, feeling satisfied, then took her nightdress to the bathroom for a shower.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue didn’t know that the room he had randomly pointed at was the one Lin Ran had prepared for him.</p>
 <p>He feared Mo Suqing&nbsp;would resist him very much, so he had decided to take it easy and to not rush anything. He was confident that his coy wife would fall in love with him one day.</p>
 <p>When Mo Suqing came out of the bathroom, a heavenly smell filled her nostrils. Her stomach had long been rumbling. She quickly ran out to the living room and saw that Ye Zhongjue was sitting on the sofa, working on his laptop and waiting for her.</p>
 <p>She stuck her tongue out mischievously. <em>Oh my god, just how hungry am I?</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue saw her, closed his laptop and signaled her to come&nbsp;closer.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing noticed that he was still wearing the suit; like a business elite he sat there.</p>
 <p>She frowned.</p>
 <p>“Why haven’t you changed out of the suit? You seem to be extra busy because you didn’t go to the company today… I’m sorry to have wasted your time.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue didn’t react at first. Then, the corner of his mouth arched into something like a grin.&nbsp;<em>Is she concerned about me?</em></p>
 <p>“It’s alright,” he reassured her. “Besides, I am the one who should be sorry. Today is the day we got married, but instead of taking you&nbsp;to a nice place, I ordered some takeout.”</p>
 <p>He glanced at&nbsp;the stunned&nbsp;Mo Suqing, and said, “Come, let’s eat.”</p>
 <p>“Okay…” Mo Suqing nodded. She went to sit near Ye Zhongjue and opened the takeout bag. One sniff at the delicious food sent her digging in.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue opened his own takeout, his mouth again curving into a smile at her cute behavior.</p>
 <p>After dinner, Mo Suqing threw the takeout packaging away. Then, she stood in the living room, facing the man on the sofa, looking hesitant.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue raised his eyebrows at her expression.&nbsp;<em>What does she want?</em></p>
 <p>“Umm…” Mo Suqing didn’t know how to say it.</p>
 <p>“So… tonight…” she paused, looking uneasy. How on earth could she speak what she had in mind out loud? But she had made a promise. She would do whatever a wife should do. Was it a good idea?</p>
 <p>Almost as soon as she had said the word “tonight,” Ye Zhongjue understood.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing closed her eyes and gritted her teeth. <em>It’s not a big deal. I am just going to say it!</em></p>
 <p>She and Ye Zhongjue spoke at the same time, “I’ll sleep in the guestroom tonight!”</p>
 <p>Both felt awkward after they said it.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing laughed nervously, suddenly acutely aware of her hands and feet.</p>
 <p>“Umm…” her expression was very uneasy.</p>
 <p>“This is your house. You should be the one who sleeps in the main bedroom. I can stay&nbsp;in&nbsp;the guestroom…”</p>
 <p>Then, fearing that Ye Zhongjue would take it the wrong way, she hastily added, “Don’t take it the wrong way. It’s just I am still getting used to all of this. I won’t sleep in the guestroom forever…”</p>
 <p>She lowered her head like a child who had done something wrong.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue sighed heavily.</p>
 <p>“This is your house too, you know.”</p>
 <p>Hearing his words, Mo Suqing nodded vigorously. “I know! I will try my best to feel the same way!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue felt even more helpless at her words.</p>
 <p>He sighed inwardly. Things like this couldn’t be forced. He would take his time.</p>
