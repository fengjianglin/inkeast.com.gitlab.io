<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>When Mo Suqing was back at their place, she looked terrible, her face as pale as&nbsp;a&nbsp;ghost.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue opened the door and saw a lost soul outside his house. His heart ached at the sight.</p>
 <p>He had guessed she didn’t get along with her family, but never expected things would be bad enough for her to become another person after&nbsp;returning&nbsp;home.</p>
 <p>Watching her shaking shoulders, Ye Zhongjue pulled her into his arms. The hug was comforting. Mo Suqing immediately felt anchored.</p>
 <p>She bit her lip and hugged him tightly in return.</p>
 <p>Then, suddenly, she looked up and said hoarsely, “Ye Zhongjue, I feel like I’m dying inside…”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue just gazed at her without a word. Eventually, he lowered his head to plant a light kiss on her lips.</p>
 <p>Initially, it felt like feathers, soft and tender. However, gradually, it became something else.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s expression was untangled by the kiss, as if it could help her forget her misery. She closed her eyes and tried hard not to think about what had happened tonight.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue tightened his embrace, wishing to protect her from all the dangers in the world. Mo Suqing opened her eyes and peeked at him. She could see the lust in his face.</p>
 <p>She shut her eyes and locked her arms around Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue trembled. He snapped his eyes open and looked at Mo Suqing incredulously.</p>
 <p>Expressionless, Mo Suqing looked at him in return and said in a clear voice, “If only I could lose my memories, how great would that be…”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s gaze was deeply affectionate. After some hesitation, he seemed to reach a decision. He pulled her into his arms again and started to kiss her. Then, he scooped her up and carried her toward the bedroom.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing put her arms around his neck. A drop of tear slid down her face from the corner of her eye without&nbsp;him&nbsp;noticing.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing could feel that Ye Zhongjue was restless. Somehow, his mood was even more out of control than hers.</p>
 <p>Slowly, she followed his lead and let go of the unpleasant emotions.</p>
 <p>In the beginning of a long night, clothes were tossed casually around the house…</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing opened her eyes. She remembered they had done it from the living room to the bathroom, and then to the queen-size bed in which she was lying now.</p>
 <p>She blushed at the memory of the night. She couldn’t believe she could be so wild!</p>
 <p>The arm she had rested her head on moved. Mo Suqing turned to see Ye Zhongjue lying next to her and looking at her with the most tender gaze.</p>
 <p>She made a sound, but it came out as a purr and she was startled by the touch of seduction and lust in it –&nbsp;<em>what happened to her normal voice?</em></p>
 <p>She really gave in to her body’s desire tonight.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?” she asked. Ye Zhongjue still wore the same expression as usual.</p>
 <p>He was still watching her without wavering.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s face did not betray anything, but she could feel that something between them was changing, or, to be more precise, developing. Their relationship had become more and more natural without her knowing.</p>
 <p>The silence stretched for about two minutes. Both looked at the other; neither wanted to speak first.</p>
 <p>Then, Ye Zhongjue broke the silence and asked, “What happened to you tonight?”</p>
 <p>His voice was very sexy, with a different huskiness from the usual one.</p>
 <p>At first, Mo Suqing did not understand what he meant. When she did, she answered, “Nothing!” Then, she turned her back to him.</p>
 <p>However, Ye Zhongjue put his hand on her body and twisted her around, forcing her to look at him.</p>
 <p>His gaze seemed to harbor a fire, but it was so low that Mo Suqing doubted if she had imagined it.</p>
 <p>“What happened in the evening? I hope you don’t hide anything from me.”</p>
 <p>Although Mo Suqing was locked in his embrace, she was too stubborn to talk.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue, in a dictatorial manner, forced her head to turn around and made her look at him again.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing stared at him. She refused to submit to his tyranny!</p>
 <p>Maybe she&nbsp;was a masochist&nbsp;or something, she thought bitterly. Otherwise, why would she worry about her father and feel anything about his actions even when all he did&nbsp;</p>
 <p>was to use her as a tool?</p>
 <p>When she turned her gaze to Ye Zhongjue again, his eyes seemed to become deeper.</p>
 <p>“I’ll ask you one last time: what exactly happened&nbsp;earlier?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing snapped around and sat up. She fought out of Ye Zhongjue’s grasp and glared at him. Ye Zhongjue’s breathing became heavier; his brawny chest rose and fell. Apparently, he was a little angry too.</p>
 <p>Now, Mo Suqing did not try to hide anything. She looked at Ye Zhongjue and told him everything in a calm voice with a thread of fierceness.</p>
 <p>“You want to know what happened to me tonight? Okay! I’ll tell you what happened. My father didn’t know I got married. I didn’t tell anyone about it because I didn’t want him to find out. I didn’t want him to find out because I knew he would stop me in every way he could. All he can think of is his own interest, and he wants me to go into a marriage of convenience to fulfill it. There is no way he would let me marry a young man with no money.”</p>
 <p>A bitter smile crossed Mo Suqing’s face. She reached over to touch Ye Zhongjue’s handsome face, and felt a thin layer of moisture.</p>
 <p>“You probably can’t imagine this is what I went through this evening – a matchmaking dinner! Ha, how ridiculous! A married woman at a matchmaking dinner! What an idea it is! Why should I sacrifice my happiness to save his company? Why?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing became more and more agitated. She pounded Ye Zhongjue’s chest with her tiny fists.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue caught her hand with a worried look. “Mo Suqing, calm down. You don’t solve a problem this way!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing struggled to get rid of his grip. Her voice broke when she poured out the unfairness and discontent she felt, “Calm down? How can I? I have a heartless man as a father who wants me to get married so he can keep his company. And the most absurd thing? I can’t stop worrying about him. Tell me, how can I calm down?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing burst out the last sentence hysterically.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue pulled her firmly into his arms, comforting her wordlessly. Mo Suqing began to wail. Then, when she became tired, wailing gradually turned into sobbing. Her shoulders twitched uncontrollably.</p>
 <p>In the end, she was so tired as to fall asleep right in Ye Zhongjue’s arms.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue held her, his eyes showing a new light. He said, as if to himself, “I will always be by your side no matter what happens.”</p>
 <p>His words were as solemn as an oath.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Meanwhile, in Room 2108 of&nbsp;Tianyu Hotel, a couple were kissing passionately on the bed. Soon, they had stripped off all their clothes.</p>
 <p>The woman pouted her lips and said grudgingly, “Jiannan, when can we take over that old man’s company completely? Then, we can finally get married!”</p>
 <p>Her eyes twinkled with maliciousness.</p>
 <p>That’s right. They were Gu Jiannan and Mo Sulian, who had ganged up on Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>An evil grin crossed Gu Jiannan’s face. <em>You want me to marry you?&nbsp;</em>he thought. <em>I only want the Mo Group! I would never marry you!&nbsp;</em>However, he had to keep her satisfied now.</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, babe. I’ll find the right time to do it. You just need to trust me.” He started to cuddle her.</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian protested and gently pushed him away.</p>
 <p>She looked at him affectionately and said, “Stop fooling around, you lecher! I am&nbsp;being&nbsp;serious! If you don’t act quickly, the old man might find a way to save his company! He arranged a matchmaking dinner for Mo Suqing tonight.”</p>
 <p>She watched Gu Jiannan’s face carefully, not wanting to miss any change in his expression.</p>
 <p>When Gu Jiannan heard that Mo Zhenfeng set up a matchmaking dinner for Mo Suqing, his eyes darkened into a chilly cave where poisonous snakes lurked.</p>
 <p>“Isn’t Mo Suqing married?” he asked in a cruel tone. “Doesn’t your father know?”</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian decided to confuse him. “Who knows? Maybe she didn’t get married after all. Maybe she said she did because she wants to help her father save the company by going into a marriage of convenience. Or, maybe she did get married, but now she wants to serve a second guy!”</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian covered her mouth and burst into laughter.</p>
 <p>Gu Jiannan’s expression was even more sinister by now, like a rapier drenched in poison.</p>
 <p><em>Mo Suqing! How dared she betray me!</em></p>
 <p>And Mo Sulian! When Mighty Empire started to give Gu Group a hard time, he decided to buy Mo Group so he could survive. In doing so, he also fulfilled Mo Sulian’s wish, but for him, she was nothing more than a prostitute, a tool with which he could vent his sexual desire anytime he wanted. And she was trying to create a division between him and Mo Suqing and confuse him like he was a simpleton!</p>
 <p>He tore open Mo Sulian’s&nbsp;clothes&nbsp;and penetrated her without preamble or any tenderness.</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian, hurt, knitted her brows together and protested, “Be gentle!”</p>
 <p>But Gu Jiannan did not heed. He vented all his lust and fury on her while thinking about how he would kick this woman away from him as soon as Mo Group was&nbsp;destroyed.</p>
 <p>She had slept around for as long as she was in the entertainment industry. He did not believe she sincerely wanted to get married.</p>
 <p>Besides, even though Mo Suqing was married now, once he bought Mo Group, he would make her come back to him.</p>
 <p>The woman under him could only be a tool. Deep in his heart, Mo Suqing was the only one. Although he was mad at her for getting married, the feelings he had for her never disappeared.</p>
 <p>They had, after all, been together for years.</p>
 <p>He was convinced that if he tried hard enough, he could achieve all of these goals.</p>
 <p>As these thoughts ran through his mind, Gu Jiannan’s expression got more and more gleeful.</p>
