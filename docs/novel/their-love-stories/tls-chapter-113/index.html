<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>It was well past seven in the evening when Leng Xiyao woke up again.</p>
 <p>With bleary eyes and a fearful expression, she looked warily around her environment.</p>
 <p>Agitated, she tried to pull up the fringe of the duvet, then found that she could only move one of her arms. The other was in a cast.</p>
 <p>She looked at the three people in front of her fearfully and asked tentatively, “Who are you?”</p>
 <p>The others looked at each other, dismayed. Guan Zixuan looked as if he had been struck with lightning. <em>After having been in a coma for so long, these are your first words?</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing looked at the woman nervously. “Yao, I’m Suqing. Don’t you recognize me?”</p>
 <p>“Am I supposed to?” Leng Xiyao frowned. She looked like a disorientated animal, which was heartrending.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s heart sank at her words.</p>
 <p>Then, it leapt with joy the next moment when Leng Xiyao said, “I do recognize your voice. Did you say my name over and over again while I was sleeping?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing nodded. “Yes, yes! That was me. I have been talking to you! I visit you every day.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao gave her a small smile and a grateful look.</p>
 <p>Then, she turned to Leng Haoyun. Her eyes were filled with gentleness and naivety. “Suqing, who is he?”</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun looked at her with mixed feelings. <em>She can’t remember anything?</em></p>
 <p>He slowly closed his eyes. <em>It’s probably for the best. At least, she doesn’t feel pain right now, doesn’t remember the slap I gave her…</em></p>
 <p><em>As long as she isn’t sad…</em></p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun opened his eyes and forced a tender expression, like the one he had given the ten-year-old Leng Xiyao when he had met her for the first time.</p>
 <p>She had been watching him behind the sofa with a timid and fearful expression, just like now.</p>
 <p>“Yao…” Mo Suqing had never heard Leng Haoyun sound like that. He spoke as tenderly as the spring breeze brushed one’s cheek, so soft one could simply fall asleep.</p>
 <p>“I’m your uncle. Don’t you remember me? That’s okay. I have taken care of you for many years and I will continue to take care of you in the future.”</p>
 <p>It was probably the longest sentence Mo Suqing had heard him utter.</p>
 <p>Bafflement appeared on Leng Xiyao’s face. She muttered, “My… uncle?”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. I’m your uncle!”</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun’s voice was very tender and sweet, as if he was cooing at a small child. Mo Suqing found it hard to adjust herself to the new version of the man.</p>
 <p>Yet, seeing that Leng Xiyao’s eyes were sparkling with curiosity, she realized it was probably a good thing.</p>
 <p>Yao obviously liked this version of Leng Haoyun!</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing told them she would take leave now. Leng Xiyao had multiple fractures and needed rest. She couldn’t go home yet, either. Leng Haoyun followed her and Guan Zixuan to the entrance of the hospital to see them off. “Thank you, Miss Mo,” he said politely. “If you didn’t come here and talk to her every day, I really don’t know when she&nbsp;would have woken&nbsp;up.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing shook her head. “You are very welcome. I am willing to do anything for that girl! Everything I did, I did it happily, so you don’t have to thank me. Just take care of her.”</p>
 <p>Then, she left with Guan Zixuan.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan sent Mo Suqing back to her apartment, then went home himself. He had rushed to the hospital when he heard that Leng Xiyao had woken up in the afternoon. He still had a lot of lines to memorize.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing felt sorry&nbsp;for troubling him, but Guan Zixuan stopped her apology by saying he was happy to do anything for her.</p>
 <p>After going home, Mo Suqing did the laundry. Looking at the clean white shirt and the pair of black boxer shorts, she fell into deep thoughts.</p>
 <p>He had told her he had gone on a business trip and would explain things to her when he was back. <em>What is he going to explain? How he had his reasons when he lied to her, or why he’s acting so weird lately?</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing lay on the bed and mulled it over, until she fell asleep.</p>
 <p>The next morning, Guan Zixuan called when she had just woken up. There was an edge to his voice. Mo Suqing’s heart skipped a beat. <em>What now?</em></p>
 <p>“What’s wrong, Zixuan?”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan sounded a bit tired. Mo Suqing guessed he hadn’t slept at all last night. She used to think that celebrities were always glamorous. After she met Guan Zixuan, she realized how hard they needed to work.</p>
 <p>The presentation on stage was the result of the suffering backstage!</p>
 <p>“Have you seen the entertainment news?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing frowned. Working in the field, she was always able to find out the latest news in the entertainment industry even if she didn’t keep herself updated in her private life.</p>
 <p>“What news? I have just gotten up.”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan sighed.</p>
 <p>“Suqing, I don’t know what the deal with you and Ye Zhongjue is now, but I have to tell you this: I can’t say I care for his behavior! Who the hell does he think he is? Someone the rest of the world must revolve around? I like you, so I would never make you sad. But what about&nbsp;him? He’s married to you, but he still flirts with Mo Sulian! If he wants to commit polygamy, well, he’d better think twice. I’m not letting it happen!”</p>
 <p>Listening to Guan Zixuan’s outburst, Mo Suqing frowned. <em>What happened exactly? What’s Mo Sulian to do with anything?</em></p>
 <p>She remembered how Mo Sulian had acted around Ye Zhongjue&nbsp;at&nbsp;the charity dinner, as if she was very close to him. The way she had kept purring out the word “brother-in-law” was indeed more flirtatious than one would call one’s husband.</p>
 <p>It had also looked like Ye Zhongjue had done her a big favor.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing shook her head and said, “It’s none of my business, really. Don’t think too much or get angry over it. What is yours will be yours and no one can take it from you no matter what; if it’s not meant to be, there is no point&nbsp;in&nbsp;forcing&nbsp;it.”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan sighed at the other end of the line, saying something like, “I’m such a good guy, but you always keep your distance and won’t choose me!” “And then you insisted that we be friends.” “My heart is broken!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing laughed. “Stop the nonsense! Who insists that we be friends&nbsp;but you? Also, does anyone know you are deeply in love with yourself?”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan’s heart lightened. He laughed, too.</p>
 <p>However, after Mo Suqing hung up and looked up the news on the Internet, her face dropped.</p>
 <p>The man who had promised he would give her an explanation had been seen coming out of a hotel with Mo Sulian at midnight. The journalists made it sound like they were flirting with each other, and although Mo Suqing wouldn’t say so, she didn’t like what she was seeing either.</p>
 <p>What’s worse, the press even put the photo of Ye Zhongjue and Jian Jie when they got out of the car to attend the dinner party side by side with the one of him and Mo Sulian, and made comparisons.</p>
 <p>Some even commented that it was sister-in-law and brother-in-law committing incest and that wealthy families were all unethical like them. Others mocked Mo Suqing, saying that she had failed to put a rein on her husband, so that Ye Zhongjue was free to be polygamous.</p>
 <p>How could Mo Suqing not feel bad after reading these news?</p>
 <p>That day at work, Mo Suqing kept feeling that people were talking about her behind her back, as if she had become a big joke.</p>
 <p>She couldn’t help but remember how Ye Zhongjue had held the press conference the other day and essentially talked her up. It was such a stark contrast now that he was stamping her dignity under his foot.</p>
 <p>In the eyes of the population, it was common for a rich guy slash president of a big company to be a fickle lover.</p>
 <p>All Mo Suqing could do was to comfort herself that she hadn’t fallen into his trap again. Otherwise, things would have been much worse for her.</p>
 <p>That being said, the looks people tossed at her direction still tormented her.</p>
 <p>She finished her work early and went straight to the hospital. Leng Haoyun was cutting an apple into cubes and feeding Leng Xiyao.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing could see how much the cold-looking man cared about the girl. In the past, she had been curious why Leng Xiyao always talked about her uncle with a glow on her face. Now she understood.</p>
 <p>If someone cherished her like Leng Haoyun cherished Leng Xiyao, she would see him as a god, too.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was watching them from the door, not wanting to disturb them. However, Leng Xiyao saw her.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing smiled and went inside. Leng Xiyao was sitting on the bed with a bright grin on her cute face – a happy and content child.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, Mo Suqing felt a bit envious. She, too, wanted to forget everything that had happened in the past three months. That way, she could duly accept Guan Zixuan and his love, putting the man who had let her down out of her mind.</p>
 <p>However, she knew very well this was not going to happen.</p>
 <p>It had been just three months, but her whole life had been flipped over more than once. The man had taken root in her heart; she couldn’t get rid of him.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing knew she shouldn’t spread her negative mood to Leng Xiyao, who had just woken up. However, she couldn’t help it.</p>
 <p>She had no friends except for Leng Xiyao and Guan Zixuan, and it was not like she could tell Guan Zixuan about it. He could get hurt.</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun put the apple down and stood up.</p>
 <p>“You girls should talk. I’ll go buy some dinner.”</p>
 <p>After Leng Haoyun left, Mo Suqing noticed that Leng Xiyao’s expression had changed, although she couldn’t really say how it was.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao smiled at her and said softly, “Suqing, Uncle said we were very good friends. Is that so?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing nodded. She sat down next to her and asked, “How are you feeling?”</p>
 <p>“Great! Uncle is really nice to me,” she said, then paused, as if she wanted to say something.</p>
 <p>“Suqing, I can see you are in a bad mood. What happened?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing thought of the news about her. She shook her head, deciding not to share her vexations.</p>
 <p>“No, it’s nothing. Don’t worry about me; worry about yourself! I’m looking forward to going to work and hanging out with you after you recover.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao nodded and looked at her curiously.</p>
 <p>“Suqing, were we really that close?”</p>
