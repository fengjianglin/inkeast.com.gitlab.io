<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>For a moment, Mo Suqing didn’t know whether she should cry or not.&nbsp;<em>How did this happen?</em></p>
 <p>Even though she saw Gu Jiannan and Mo Sulian cheating on her, she wouldn’t have been so stupid as to hurt herself&nbsp;this&nbsp;way. How&nbsp;did she&nbsp;end up here?</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing felt like crying, but tears wouldn’t come. This unfortunate incident dimmed everything, including Gu Jiannan and Mo Sulian’s affair.</p>
 <p>She&nbsp;truly could not remember a thing from&nbsp;last night. And also, where&nbsp;did&nbsp;Leng Xiyao&nbsp;go? She must be worried&nbsp;sick about her.</p>
 <p>When Ye Zhongjue emerged from the bathroom, this was what he saw:&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was sitting on the bed and holding up the sheet very tightly, or, he should say, bundling herself up real tight. Her expression was difficult to tell;&nbsp;it alternated between fear and concern.</p>
 <p>Just like a frightened bunny.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue approached her in his bathrobe.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing didn’t notice him until he stood right in front of her. Then, she became so shocked that she flinched away from him instinctively. The violent movement sent the back of her head into the headboard. She grimaced in pain.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue went forward hastily to check if she was alright, but Mo Suqing extended her arm to stop him. “Don’t come near me!” she screeched.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue felt crushed at once. She thought he was a bad man!</p>
 <p>“I will take responsibility…” he said in a steady voice without betraying any&nbsp;emotion.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing flew into a rage. She glared at Ye Zhongjue like a furious little tigress.</p>
 <p>“What do you mean you will take responsibility? If you killed someone, would you say you will take responsibility for his funeral?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was taken aback. Obviously, he hadn’t expected Mo Suqing&nbsp;to&nbsp;say that. For a moment, he, who had never been rejected by a woman, did not know what to say.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing felt angry and wronged. How could she do this to herself? How could she behave so improperly? She had protected her virginity so well for the seven years she had been with Gu Jiannan, and now she just lost it to a total stranger.</p>
 <p>Thinking about it all, Mo Suqing couldn’t help but start&nbsp;to cry…</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was greatly shocked. He couldn’t believe she was crying.</p>
 <p>He went closer to her and hurriedly explained, “Please don’t cry. I didn’t mean to do that to you last night. I was drugged, you walked into the wrong restroom, and then one thing led to another… I swear, I didn’t mean to hurt you on purpose. Don’t cry…”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was sputtering, but Mo Suqing had no intention&nbsp;of stopping her cries. Instead, she&nbsp;wept&nbsp;more and more loudly.</p>
 <p>During the&nbsp;past few years, she lost her mother in a car accident, her father had taken in another woman and her&nbsp;stepsister snatched&nbsp;everything from her.&nbsp;Now,&nbsp;her stepsister&nbsp;even&nbsp;stole her boyfriend.&nbsp;Not to mention, she didn’t get her act together and did such a terrible thing to herself. What else&nbsp;does she have left?</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing kept weeping bitter tears. They were falling like a heavy downpour.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue stood there foolishly for a while. Then, all of a sudden, he sternly&nbsp;demanded, “Stop crying!”</p>
 <p>As expected, his tone did stop the crying woman. Mo Suqing looked at him fearfully, thinking he was going to lose his temper. She sobbed quietly, looking very pitiful.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue felt his heart soften again,&nbsp;as he really could not handle her wronged pitiful expression. It made his whole heart ache so much, as if something was gnawing at it.</p>
 <p>“Alright, don’t cry anymore. I will take full responsibility. Let’s get married!”</p>
 <p>The reason Ye Zhongjue proposed marriage to her was that he realized&nbsp;that he had taken Mo Suqing’s first time&nbsp;last night. He could gauge from her response today that she must have been in a very bad mood yesterday. That was why she had let herself&nbsp;get&nbsp;so drunk.</p>
 <p>Maybe, for a traditional girl like her who always took great care of protecting herself, only marriage could make her feel secure.</p>
 <p>On hearing what he had said, Mo Suqing stopped sobbing altogether. She pointed at Ye Zhongjue, and then at herself, sounding unsure, “You and I get married?”</p>
 <p>She looked about, taking in the surroundings. This hotel was unusually luxurious. Every feature exuded intricacy and extravagance. So, the man in front of her must be either rich or powerful.</p>
 <p>She was so sick of rich and powerful people. Even though she lost her virginity to this man, she couldn’t marry him just like that and lose her freedom too.</p>
 <p>However, he did have a kind attitude. Plus, she hadn’t noticed before, but he was actually quite good-looking.</p>
 <p>Although she had stopped crying, Mo Suqing certainly didn’t sound happy either. She said with a little choke, “I don’t think so.&nbsp;Give me something to wear,&nbsp;I want to leave!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked at her helplessly. He really didn’t want to lose her once again. So he tried again, “I know we just met, but you have to believe me that I’m not joking about marrying you. I promise I will treat you well!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was a little moved by his sincerity. In any case, she didn’t feel&nbsp;like&nbsp;she had a home anymore. Every time she went home, she would witness her stepmother Bai Lian and her daughter Mo Sulian get their way.</p>
 <p>Moreover, she feared she would not be able to stop herself and give Gu Jiannan another chance. After all, it had been seven years, not seven days!</p>
