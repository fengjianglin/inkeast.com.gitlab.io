<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Leng Xiyao looked like she hadn’t said enough.</p>
 <p>She glanced at the dress Mo Suqing was wearing and said unapologetically,</p>
 <p>“The dress is obviously made for Suqing, okay? You shouldn’t even think about getting it for yourself. Ha, when I imagine how you will look like in it, I feel disgusted! Look at Suqing. How becoming the dress is for her, compared to some slut with horribly heavy makeup!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was speechless.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao was such a fighter, she could just look on without speaking.</p>
 <p><em>I’m so lucky to have her as my best friend!</em></p>
 <p>Mo Sulian, knowing that she couldn’t possibly win in a verbal fight with Leng Xiyao, turned her target to Mo Suqing and sneered, “I doubt she can afford the dress!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing didn’t quite understand what she meant. On the other hand, Leng Xiyao’s expression changed dramatically.</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian gave Mo Suqing a steely look. That dress was a limited edition. Even she, who ranked high in the Mo family, couldn’t hardly afford it. In fact, it was only because the venture capitalist was willing to invest on her that she could get it. It would be impossible for Mo Suqing, who had long stopped taking money from her dad, to have that kind of money.</p>
 <p>She thought the dress hadn’t been paid yet.</p>
 <p>Changing tactics, an evil smile spread across her face. <em>Mo Suqing, don’t blame me if you want to make a laughing-stock of yourself!</em></p>
 <p>She looked at Mo Suqing proudly and said, “Fine. I’m not fighting you over a dress. You can have it if you want – if you are able to.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing turned to look at Leng Xiyao, who tugged at Mo Suqing and said, “Suqing, let’s go. You know how filthy that woman’s mouth is!”</p>
 <p>Then, she quickly dragged Mo Suqing away.</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian was taken aback. <em>They just left? Have they paid?</em></p>
 <p>She didn’t believe it!</p>
 <p>She couldn’t accept the truth until Mo Suqing and Leng Xiyao had disappeared from her sight.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, she just lost it. “Hey! Have they paid? Why did you let them go just like that?” She screamed at one of the clerks.</p>
 <p>The clerk didn’t expect that the woman with exquisite makeup would turn into a mad woman in an instant.</p>
 <p>However, she knew she couldn’t afford to anger her, so she only said calmly, “Miss, they did pay for it with a card.”</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian felt stunned. <em>They paid for it with a card?</em></p>
 <p>The clerk was eying her with disgust. Although Mo Sulian did make a reservation for the dress and she did reserve it for her (she was an actress, after all!), she hadn’t even paid a deposit! She had every right to sell it to another person.</p>
 <p>Bai Tingnan could no longer stand the on-lookers’ whispers. She tugged at Mo Sulian and said, “Sulian, let’s go. Don’t make a scene!”</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian pushed her away and glared at her, “Of course you can just drop it. you are not the one who has been humiliated!”</p>
 <p>Bai Tingnan was flabbergasted. <em>Who says I haven’t been humiliated? I was insulted by Leng Xiyao today, too! In the office!</em></p>
 <p>She had snuck out the company for some fresh air, and Mo Sulian had taken her here to see the dress.</p>
 <p><em>You thought no one could afford it but you. However, they have already paid for it! Now you are dealing with the fact with bad grace by venting your rage on me? Ha! Do you really think you are Her Highness?</em></p>
 <p><em>You are more like a rabid dog that bites whoever&nbsp;</em><em>approaches you</em><em>!</em></p>
 <p>Bai Tingnan couldn’t endure it anymore, so she just walked away.</p>
 <p>Mo Sulian watched her go, her expression changing from disbelief to fury. <em>Everyone&nbsp;</em><em>bullies</em><em>&nbsp;me!</em></p>
 <p>She shouted after Bai Tingnan, totally ignoring how people would see her, “Bai Tingnan, you are so ungrateful! When you ask me for something, you are a different person! If you leave me behind now, don’t you dare come to see me anymore!”</p>
 <p>Bai Tingnan paused a moment and then walked away without looking back.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was on edge the entire afternoon. She was like a young girl who was going to meet her lover soon. Her heart beat so fast it felt like a rabbit was living in there.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao kept teasing her, but whenever Mo Suqing asked her what Mo Sulian was talking about back in the mall, she would immediately turn her back to her and pretend she didn’t hear her.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing would probably kill her for spending so much money on a dress for her.</p>
 <p>Finally, it was time to get off work. However, Ye Zhongjue hadn’t called. Feeling skittish, Mo Suqing decided to open up the post he had&nbsp;written&nbsp;on Moments.</p>
 <p>The simple sentence warmed her heart whenever she read it. She just couldn’t get enough of it.</p>
 <p>Just when she was staring at the post, lost in reverie, her phone rang.</p>
 <p>It made her jump and she almost dropped it. But, when she saw who the caller was, she became all shy.</p>
 <p>She answered the phone and heard Ye Zhongjue say, “Honey…”</p>
 <p>His voice was husky and filled with infinite love and tenderness. It felt so, so sweet.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao could see from her face that Ye Zhongjue had called. She gave her a look and said, “You are weak. It’s just a guy!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing glared at her without reply.</p>
 <p>“Fine, pretend I didn’t say anything and go back to your call. I’m out of here!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing nodded. Leng Xiyao took her purse and left.</p>
 <p>“Is that Leng Xiyao?” Ye Zhongjue asked.</p>
 <p>“Yeah, she was just talking to me before going home.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue didn’t say anything else but, “You can come out now. I’m here.”</p>
 <p>“Okay, I’m coming.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing hung up and walked&nbsp;out.</p>
 <p>She saw the familiar white Volkswagen and the handsome man right away.</p>
 <p>Slowing down, she approached him.</p>
 <p>When Ye Zhongjue saw her in that white dress, he suddenly regretted having to introduce her to Ceng Hanyu.</p>
 <p>She was so beautiful, like a nymph who had stumbled into the commoners’ world or a pure white lotus blossom.</p>
 <p>How lucky he was to have met and be together with her!</p>
 <p>Her beauty was of the most stainless and touching kind.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue found it hard to breathe all of a sudden. All he wanted to do was to put her in a treasure chest and never let anyone see her.</p>
 <p>He didn’t come back to his senses until Mo Suqing was right in front of him.</p>
 <p>“Honey!” he called out softly.</p>
 <p>Somehow, Mo Suqing could hear a hint of grievance in his tone.</p>
 <p>She put on a poker face and stared at Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue hastened to apologize, “Honey, I’m&nbsp;sorry!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing softened at his sincere expression and conceded, “Let’s get into the car first.”</p>
 <p>Her voice sounded even, with no emotions betrayed.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s expression was a little sad. He got in the car after Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>However, he didn’t start the car right away. Instead, he turned to look at Mo Suqing and cooed yet again, “Honey…”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing felt her heart missing a beat. <em>Can you stop calling me that? My heart is a mess now.</em></p>
 <p>She feigned exasperation and looked at him.</p>
 <p>“Why do you keep calling me? Drive your car!”</p>
 <p>“Honey, I won’t start the car unless you forgive me!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was speechless. The man was practically threatening her! <em>I’m not gonna fall for that!</em></p>
 <p><em>Let’s see who can hold out longer!</em></p>
 <p>It was Ye Zhongjue’s turn to feel speechless. Lin Ran had clearly told him that it was the easiest way to soften a girl’s heart!</p>
 <p>Yet Mo Suqing just kept the poker face on, unwavering. Ye Zhongjue’s face darkened. <em>I’m going to catapult Lin Ran to Africa when I see him next time!</em></p>
 <p>But, what about now? He couldn’t&nbsp;remain&nbsp;here forever with his wife, could he?</p>
 <p>So, he turned around and looked at Mo Suqing in earnest.</p>
 <p>“Honey, please don’t be mad with me anymore. It was all my fault. I was such a bastard to have flipped out without hearing you out! Please, be the bigger person and forgive me…”</p>
 <p>As a matter of fact, Mo Suqing had already softened; she was just acting like she hadn’t. But hearing what he had said just now, she couldn’t help but act otherwise.</p>
 <p>“Fine. Let’s go to dinner. I’m so hungry!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was overjoyed. He hastened to reply in an excited tone, “Sure, let’s go! I don’t want my wife to starve!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was a little awkward. <em>How come he has become so smooth and suave after only a few days?</em></p>
 <p>They arrived at a steakhouse called The Waltz House.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing knew it was quite a high-end place. She looked at Ye Zhongjue, who gave her a reassured look in return.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing walked in.</p>
 <p>A waiter came over and acted like he was going to greet Ye Zhongjue. However, Ye Zhongjue stopped him and sent him away.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was a little surprised, but soon forgot about it.</p>
 <p>They chose a table by the window to admire the view. After ordering, they just sat there in silence.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was very quiet, which confused Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t be sure whether she had truly forgiven him or not, and he dared not speak lest he should say something that upset her again.</p>
 <p>At last, Mo Suqing could not stand the silence anymore.</p>
 <p>She coughed a little and cleared her throat.</p>
 <p>“Umm… So this is quite a expensive place!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing wanted to cut her tongue off. <em>What a stupid comment</em><em>!</em><em>&nbsp;You have finally plucked up your courage to speak, and this is what you came up with?</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue felt the same way, too. <em>What is she thinking?</em></p>
 <p><em>I took her for dinner after we just made up, and the only thing she cares about is the price of the meal? Who would do that?</em></p>
 <p>He didn’t know what to say…</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing knew she had spoiled the atmosphere, so she turned her head toward the window.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked at her, as if expecting something from her.</p>
 <p>Under his fervent gaze, it was impossible for Mo Suqing not to react.</p>
 <p>She turned around with a smile that was a little unnatural.</p>
