 <p>“I don’t care!” Ye Zhongjue said firmly and it sounded as if he genuinely didn’t care.</p>
 <p>“I’m going to take her back safe and sound even if it means I must die!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao approached the doorway quietly. She could see Ceng Hanyu glaring at Ye Zhongjue, the veins standing out on his temples.</p>
 <p>“Jue, I can’t believe after so many years you do not know what I’m thinking! That son of a bitch Tang Zeng clearly wants you dead this time. If you evacuate the entire Sin Eliminators, your life is over! Why can’t you listen to me?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked Ceng Hanyu in the eye and said in a calm voice – although Leng Xiyao could detect the volcano that was about to erupt, “But if I don’t evacuate everyone, my wife and child will die.”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu fell into silence.</p>
 <p>He didn’t know what to say. They had reached a dead end.</p>
 <p>If they evacuated the organization from A City, even if Ye Zhongjue could see Mo Suqing tonight, he was unlikely to survive the conflict. Naturally, they couldn’t tell the police.</p>
 <p>However, if they didn’t evacuate, Tang Zeng would kill the hostage right away. It would be a fatal blow to Ye Zhongjue, too.</p>
 <p>Therefore, whether or not they evacuated Sin Eliminators, Ye Zhongjue would die. It was just a matter of when.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked at Ceng Hanyu and said, “If I don’t come back, take care of my parents and Sin Eliminators. Do not let our work go to waste!”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu grabbed his arm, looking agitated. “Jue, don’t do anything stupid! Tang Zeng probably doesn’t know how many people we have placed in A City. Why not leave a portion of them behind? We might be able to turn the tide in the end!”</p>
 <p>“I can’t bet Suqing and our child on something we are unsure of!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue finally exploded. The two men faced each other, both looking angry and pained.</p>
 <p>“I know what to do!” Leng Xiyao’s voice came from behind. Ceng Hanyu and Ye Zhongjue froze.</p>
 <p>Then, Ceng Hanyu turned around and stared at her nervously. “What are you talking about?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s eyes dilated a little and fixated on the woman.</p>
 <p>He began to feel some hope. After all, Leng Xiyao would never kid about anything regarding Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao glanced at Ceng Hanyu, who caught sight of her bare legs which were fair-complexioned and slender and absolutely alluring.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu’s face darkened. He took off his jacket and tied the sleeves around Leng Xiyao’s waist.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao blushed with embarrassment. She had forgotten she had on only a white shirt.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu’s jacket covered her legs very well.</p>
 <p>After a moment’s pause, Leng Xiyao looked at Ceng Hanyu and Ye Zhongjue in turn.</p>
 <p>“I suggest you evacuate Sin Eliminators from A City and make your enemy believe you have no one. Then, I can find help for you.”</p>
 <p>“Who can help us?” the two men asked in unison.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao dropped her eyes and said, “My uncle Leng Haoyun!”</p>
 <p>Baffled, Ye Zhongjue frowned and asked, “Leng Haoyun?”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu’s expression darkened at the mention of Leng Haoyun’s name. <em>It’s him again! Is he destined to stay in her life forever?</em></p>
 <p><em>Leng Xiyao is obviously his Anne, but he is too late to claim her as his fiancée…</em></p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao didn’t notice the change in his expression. For her, they were just friends who had met each other a couple of times.</p>
 <p>The only memorable encounters with him were the awkward incident in Guan Zixuan’s villa and the time when he had provided blood for her transfusion when she had lost a lot of blood.</p>
 <p>And then, there was yesterday, when he kept her company all day.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao said, “Sin Eliminators and The Dark Night are two of the biggest mafias in the world. However, have you ever&nbsp;heard of ‘Red Kill,’ a secret mercenary army?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue watched her without reply. He realized she must know what she was saying, so he waited for her to continue.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu, on the other hand, drew his brows together and narrowed his eyes at her. <em>Why would a girl like her know these things?</em></p>
 <p>“How do you know about that?” Ceng Hanyu stared at her.</p>
 <p>“Because Leng Haoyun is the founder of Red Kill!” Leng Xiyao answered in a fearless and straightforward manner, as if she didn’t care if Ye Zhongjue and Ceng Hanyu learned about Leng Haoyun’s identity.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu’s heart skipped a beat. <em>Leng Haoyun has hidden his identity well!</em></p>
 <p>“Leng Haoyun told you this?” Ceng Hanyu asked, his eyes never leaving her face or missing any change in her expression.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao smiled and raised her eyes. “You probably&nbsp;won’t believe it, but he has never told me this. I found out about it myself because I have the password of his safe and I know where every spare key of his is.”</p>
 <p>The light in her eyes dimmed a little. Yeah, she knew everything about him. Everything with a password was set with her birthday and he had never hidden any keys without telling her where they are.</p>
 <p>Yet, she couldn’t be the one to grow old with him.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue had a different question in mind. He didn’t care how Leng Xiyao had learned about it; he just wanted to know why Leng Haoyun would possibly help them.</p>
 <p>Red Kill was second to none when it came to its covert operations. What’s more, they never failed in the commissions they were entrusted with. This was why the organization became so famous even though they had endeavored to keep its existence as a secret.</p>
 <p>However, Ye Zhongjue didn’t think Leng Haoyun would offer him such a big help at the risk of his mercenaries.</p>
 <p>“Why do you think he will help?”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao smiled brightly and attractively. For a moment, Ceng Hanyu almost lost himself in it.</p>
 <p>“Because of me! When I had the car accident, I heard that you called Ceng Hanyu and secured the blood for me. You helped him before, and he has no reason not to repay you.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue watched her without reply.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao pressed her lips together and continued, “Don’t underestimate how important I am in his heart. I always know I am the single most important person in his life. No matter what happened... I’ve never denied it.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao looked sad. Ceng Hanyu clenched his teeth and cracked his knuckles.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao shook her head to dispel her melancholic expression. It was as if the momentary sadness was but Ye Zhongjue’s and Ceng Hanyu’s illusion.</p>
 <p>She smiled. “I am as worried about Suqing as you, so I will beg him to help anyway. I believe if there are two of us, he will definitely lend a hand.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue uttered his last doubt, “Do we have Red Kill mercenaries here?”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao smiled again. “Red Kill mercenaries are all over the world. Don’t you know?”</p>
 <p>Noticing the impish twinkle in her eyes, Ye Zhongjue knew she was confident of success.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the door of the house opened. The three of them turned.</p>
 <p>Selina walked in. She was wearing a white dress not unlike the one Leng Xiyao had worn the day before.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue frowned. “Selina, when did you come here?”</p>
 <p>Selina’s mouth twitched. “Yesterday. Han hasn’t told you?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue glanced at her without replying. Selina raised her eyebrows and looked at Leng Xiyao and the jacket around her waist.</p>
 <p>“Hi, little one. I bought a skirt for you. I thought you might have awoken.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao’s first impression of Selina was that she was stunning.</p>
 <p>She ran over to her and looked at her excitedly.</p>
 <p>“Pretty lady, what’s your name? You are so beautiful! You have lovely eyes that are as blue as the ocean!”</p>
 <p>Selina smiled at her compliments, the blue ocean in her eyes sparkling with delight.</p>
 <p>She handed the skirt to Leng Xiyao and said smilingly, “You can call me Selina. You are pretty, too! No wonder everyone likes you. You are the cutest girl I’ve ever met!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao was very pleased. However, she suddenly remembered the situation Mo Suqing was in and her smile faded.</p>
 <p>“Well, Selina, I’ll go put on the skirt. By the way, you can call me Yao.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao left the room. Selina turned to look at the others solemnly.</p>
 <p>“Ye, what happened? Why that gloomy face?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue pressed his lips together without replying. Worry was written all over his face.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu exclaimed, not without a hint of frustration in his tone, “Jue’s wife was taken away by International Dragon &amp; Tiger Mafia. She is pregnant and Jue is concerned for her safety. Tang Zeng, the leader of the gang, demanded that the whole Sin Eliminators evacuate from A City and that he go to take his wife back alone.”</p>
 <p>Selina said, “It’s impossible! Is the bastard mad? How could he ever think a small gang like his is able to defeat a great mafia such as Sin Eliminators?”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu pointed out, “Don’t you see? He just wants Jue dead!”</p>
 <p>“We mustn’t agree to that. We mustn’t!” Selina protested.</p>
 <p>“But he insists we must! He won’t risk his wife’s and his child’s lives!” Ceng Hanyu said in exasperation, although sorrow could be seen in his eyes. It was sorrow for his good friend. However, Leng Xiyao’s proposal aside, there were no other solutions.</p>
