 <p>After Ye Zhongjue withdrew his foot, he didn’t leave his corner in the shadow of the adjacent building. His eyes dimmed a little, melting into the darkness.</p>
 <p>He watched Guan Zixuan look Mo Suqing up and down and ask her if she was alright. Smiling at him, Mo Suqing waved her hand dismissively and said she was fine.</p>
 <p>Then, he watched Guan Zixuan follow Mo Suqing upstairs. Gu Jiannan, on the other hand, didn’t get up for a while. He finally understood he was nothing to Mo Suqing now. Despite his severe injuries, Mo Suqing just walked away from him with Guan Zixuan without hesitation.</p>
 <p>Gu Jiannan experienced a sharp pang in his heart, as if thousands of ants were gnawing at it. He regretted it now. He regretted choosing Mo Sulian in the hope of consolidating Gu Group and losing Mo Suqing in the process.</p>
 <p>He lay there on the ground and watched the night sky for a very long time. Then, finally, he got up slowly and staggered out of sight.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s eyes&nbsp;showed no apparent emotions but remained closely on&nbsp;Mo Suqing’s apartment.</p>
 <p>The light was still on in Mo Suqing’s apartment. Ye Zhongjue kept standing there, waiting. For what? He didn’t really know himself.</p>
 <p>After they went upstairs, Mo Suqing poured a glass of water for Guan Zixuan, who whined brazenly, “Suqing, I’m hungry!”</p>
 <p>“Well, go find something to eat then,” Mo Suqing said while she tidied up the room.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan’s mouth twitched a little. <em>She always acts coolly toward me. I have been by her side&nbsp;</em><em>during all her darkest times</em><em>, for crying out loud!</em></p>
 <p><em>I have just solved a big problem for her down</em><em>stairs</em><em>! Humph, why can’t she be nicer to me?</em></p>
 <p><em>I rushed over here right after leaving the filming studio, even though it is late at night, and this is how she repays me?</em></p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan knew that he was but an important friend for Mo Suqing – she had no feelings for him whatsoever – but he couldn’t give up just yet.</p>
 <p>“I don’t like what they have out there! Besides, I just came from outside. How could you be so cruel to kick me out so soon?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing paused what she was doing and looked at Guan Zixuan. “You are really hungry?”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan nodded his head vigorously.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing threw the clothes in her hands on the sofa and sighed. “Fine. I’ll prepare something for you. But I must warn you: I am not a good cook.”</p>
 <p>It was true. She had never cooked for once until she and Ye Zhongjue got together and she couldn’t stand by and watch him cook for her almost every day after work.</p>
 <p>At first, she couldn’t even cook up something as basic as scrambled eggs with tomatoes. However, after some practice, she had learned to cook a few dishes, although they weren’t very tasty.</p>
 <p>She wouldn’t have cooked for Leng Xiyao if she hadn’t nagged her to after finding out that Mo Suqing cooked every day.</p>
 <p>Thinking about Ye Zhongjue and Leng Xiyao made her blue again.</p>
 <p>She walked toward the kitchen, ignoring Guan Zixuan, who was yelling, “No matter how distasteful it is, I’ll finish it&nbsp;and&nbsp;lick the plates clean!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan’s voice was cheerful like a child’s. Mo Suqing felt her mood improve a little.</p>
 <p>She made three dishes along with a soup, all very simple. The three dishes were cucumbers with smashed garlic, stir-fried pork and green pepper, and stir-fried&nbsp;Indian lettuce, while the soup was egg drop soup with tomatoes. It was a typical home-made meal.</p>
 <p>Although they didn’t look appealing, they didn’t taste as bad as Mo Suqing had said.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan seemed to be starving. He had two heaped bowls of rice and finished everything on the table. Then, he belched satisfactorily, not caring about the image a super star should endeavor to maintain. His eyes sparkled like a satiated child.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing sat across from him, but she didn’t finish her rice. She was not in a good mood and did not have the appetite.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan helped her transfer the dirty tableware to the kitchen. His phone began to ring.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan answered the phone. At first, he listened casually, not really taking in what was being said at the other end of the line.</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, he shouted, “What? What happened?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing looked over her shoulder to see Guan Zixuan’s ashen face. It was as if there was an impending storm.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing put the cutlery down and walked toward him, her eyes full of concern.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan was usually merry in front of his friends. He had a jolly and sunny disposition. Sometimes, he behaved like an innocent child. It was always pleasant spending time with him. He seldom got mad like this.</p>
 <p>Now, his face darkened as he listened on. “I see. I’ll stay away from my place tonight. Quickly instruct the PR team to deal with the issue. I don’t want it to appear in the newspaper tomorrow morning!”</p>
 <p>After pondering for a moment, he added, “We have to solve this as fast as we can. If you need to, go to my brother, but don’t tell my parents. If my father knows, I’m dead meat!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan hung up the phone.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing stood in front of him, looking worried. “What’s the matter? What happened?”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan tried to sound casual, but his tight smile betrayed him.</p>
 <p>“It’s no big deal, just some minor problem. Yuan called to tell me about it and said I should probably stay away from my house. Paparazzi might be there.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing gave him an exasperated look. “Enough of the act! You were obviously upset. What exactly is going on?”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan’s mouth twitched a little. <em>How&nbsp;</em><em>could I not know she could</em><em>&nbsp;be so bossy? However, this only makes me like her even more!</em></p>
 <p>He arched his eyebrows a little and replied, “It’s really no big deal. I think Mu Ling’er went to the hospital and found out that she seemed to have got pregnant. A journalist followed her to the Shallow Sea when the silly woman went to look for me. Yuan thought I was at home. He didn’t realize anything was wrong until he went there. I told him to deal with the issue as soon as possible; he asked me not to go home tonight, saying I shouldn’t see Mu Ling’er right now and that he will take care of it.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s expression was hard to read. After a while, she said, “Is Mu Ling’er the model I saw at the airport?”</p>
 <p>At the mention of the airport, the images of what had happened in that bathroom cubicle that day immediately popped into Guan Zixuan’s head. His face clouded.</p>
 <p>He admitted he had been some sort of a playboy, but why did she still remember that?!</p>
 <p>He nodded anyway. “Yeah, that was her.”</p>
 <p>Then, he quickly added, “But there is nothing between us. I was in a bad mood that day and she kept seducing me! It was fortunate you showed up in time and interrupted us. Nothing really happened.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing watched him desperately explain to her how nothing had really happened between him and Mu Ling’er, then slowly shook her head. “I don’t care what happened or did not happen between you two. I just want to know if you have any solutions to this situation.”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan’s eyes dimmed a little at her first words. Then, hearing that she still cared about him, his face brightened up.</p>
 <p>“Yuan is dealing with it now. Anyway, the journalists are keeping Mu Ling’er in their sight, so I can’t go meet her. I don’t know why she came to look for me in the first place!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan looked forlorn. If his old man found out he had got himself into such a big trouble, he would probably break his legs!</p>
 <p>But honestly, he was a victim here! That was the only time when anything had (almost) happened between him and Mu Ling’er. He had been in a foul mood after having a big fight with his old man and wanted an outlet for his anger. In the end, it had been disrupted by Mo Suqing. Nothing had ever happened thereafter.</p>
 <p>Therefore, he himself didn’t know why she would want to see him!</p>
 <p>“Okay…” Mo Suqing nodded. “You should find a hotel to stay then. Anything else can wait until tomorrow.”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan nodded. “Right. I’ll leave in a minute.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing gave him a look and turned back into the kitchen.</p>
 <p>When she emerged from the kitchen again, Guan Zixuan was about to go.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was going to walk him downstairs. However, her phone began to ring.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing picked up her phone. Guan Zixuan waved his hand at her. “Don’t see me off. I’m a guy; you don’t have to worry about me.”</p>
 <p>Before Mo Suqing could react, he closed the door behind him and disappeared.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing took a look at the caller ID and answered the call.</p>
 <p>It was Mo Zhenfeng. She didn’t really want to answer it, but her mother had told her to try to get along with her father right before she died. Besides, he was her father no matter what. She couldn’t deny their relationship.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing answered the phone and said in a cold voice, “What’s up?”</p>
 <p>Mo Zhenfeng said in a nice tone, “Suqing, how have you and Zhongjue been? You should come home for dinner sometime. I’ll tell the servant to make some of your favorite dishes! And what does Zhongjue like to eat? Say it and I’ll get it prepared. Just let me know when you are coming home. How does that sound?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s patience completely ran out at his ass-kissing attempt.</p>
 <p>Here she was, trying to make amends for their nearly ruined relationship, and her father was scheming how to best take advantage of her. Wasn’t it ridiculous?</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing replied coldly, “That’s impossible. I’m not going back for dinner and neither is Ye Zhongjue. Just give up taking advantage of me! Otherwise, I’ll divorce him right away!”</p>
 <p>Hearing that she would divorce Ye Zhongjue, Mo Zhenfeng panicked.</p>
 <p>If she really divorced him, his social ladder would be gone, too!</p>
