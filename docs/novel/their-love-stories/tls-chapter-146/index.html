<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Tang Zeng was sitting in repose with his eyes closed when a man came in.</p>
 <p>“Boss, the last of Sin Eliminators evacuated at five o’clock. Now we are sure none of their people is in A City.”</p>
 <p>The man sounded very pleased with himself. Song Pingting sneered. <em>It’s show</em><em>time. I would like to know how Ye Zhongjue is going to rescue Mo Suqing!</em></p>
 <p>Venom gleamed in her eyes. She would never let him succeed.</p>
 <p>Song Pingting gave the gun stuffed in her belt a pat and smiled broadly.</p>
 <p>Tang Zeng stood up from the sofa. After a moment of silence, he instructed, “Tell everyone to get ready. When Ye Zhongjue comes, act according to my signal. Now, send him the location.”</p>
 <p>The man quickly left to carry out the order.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing slowly opened her eyes. <em>The end is coming.</em></p>
 <p>The abduction had happened so suddenly that it felt like a nightmare. She had never thought she would get involved with gangsters.</p>
 <p>Now, not only did she get involved with them, her husband had also turned out to be the head of one of the biggest criminal organizations in the world – Sin Eliminators. Numerous practical issues swirled around in her head. She couldn’t escape; she was forced to deal with them.</p>
 <p>She was reminded of the gunshot Jian Jie had taken for Ye Zhongjue. When she first learned about it, she had felt puzzled. What kind of business had he been doing that would make another person want to kill him?</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue had told her that the company he had been trying to make a deal with was connected with gangsters. She knew that gun control in some countries was not as restrictive as here. It was relatively easy for common people to get a gun, not to mention for gangsters.</p>
 <p>So, she had believed him. Little had she expected that the truth was far from what he had told her.</p>
 <p>Most likely, it was a negotiation between gangsters that had gone sour.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing had felt pain the last time she found out about his deception. This time,&nbsp;</p>
 <p>she felt both pain and lost. She wasn’t sure what their love meant anymore.</p>
 <p>Yes, he had fallen in love with her at first sight when he was younger, then had eventually left because she had got together with someone she mistook for him.</p>
 <p>However, they were simply too different. She had never thought she would get even slightly entangled in the underworld.</p>
 <p>Why must he enter her life and marry her?</p>
 <p>Hate, annoyance, anger, resentment, and many other emotions clashed with one another in Mo Suqing’s heart. She thought she had become numb, but no, she still felt very much hurt.</p>
 <p>The man she loved had a scary identity. She was no longer sure what kind of man he was.</p>
 <p>Even so, she knew she loved him. She had given him her heart and she couldn’t take it back; it was like water that had been spilled. However, she also hated him. She hated him for drawing her into his life when he knew it wasn’t right.</p>
 <p>They didn’t belong to the same world! If it weren’t for the incident all those months ago, they would still have been two parallel lines now.</p>
 <p>All these thoughts tortured her as she hung there in midair. Moreover, she was very uncomfortable, being pregnant with a baby and having not eaten the whole day. She could feel herself drifting&nbsp;in and out of consciousness.</p>
 <p>Yet, the moment the door of the factory was thrown open, she sobered up.</p>
 <p>In the end, it pained her to see him in danger.</p>
 <p>She could see Tang Zeng wanted him dead.</p>
 <p>No matter who he was, Mo Suqing couldn’t wish him any harm. No matter how many lies he had told, her heart couldn’t help but go to him.</p>
 <p>Love was water that had been spilled.</p>
 <p>Her eyes reddened as she watched the silhouette against the setting sun.</p>
 <p>Song Pingting stared at him hard. Obsession and struggle showed in her eyes. <em>I loved you so much. How could you treat me so? This is so unfair! Because of you, I even became Tang Zeng’s mistress…</em></p>
 <p><em>Do I regret it? I don’t know. All I know is when we meet again, I’ll make you</em> <em>regret not choosing me.</em></p>
 <p>Tang Zeng sneered. “Should I call you Ye Zhongjue, Poisonous Prince, or President Ye?”</p>
 <p>Instead of replying, Ye Zhongjue looked up at Mo Suqing. His face was strained.</p>
 <p>There was pain deep in his eyes when he gazed at Mo Suqing. <em>I am the reason she is&nbsp;</em><em>suffering. I didn’t protect her well enough.</em></p>
 <p><em>I will make anyone who dares hurt her pay the price!</em></p>
 <p>Tang Zeng looked at him and continued, “If it weren’t for the incident where your secretary took the gunshot for you in England, I might never have found out that you, Ye Zhongjue, is the Poisonous Prince of Sin Eliminators. How well you have hidden your identity these years! Now, since you are here, let us settle accounts with each other!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue slowly shifted his gaze to Tang Zeng.</p>
 <p>“What do you want?” he said coldly.</p>
 <p>Tang Zeng narrowed his eyes and gave Ye Zhongjue a dangerous look. “What if I say I want your life?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue gave a blood-curdling chuckle, exuding a sinister and powerful vibe.</p>
 <p>Song Pingting looked at him in disbelief and shuddered. <em>This is the real him. The aloof and heartless appearance is just a disguise for the darkness inside.</em></p>
 <p>But somehow, she was still infatuated with him.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue caught a glimpse of Song Pingting. Disgust crossed his eyes. He had set a vicious woman free! Alas, he had underestimated how daring she was…</p>
 <p>“Tang Zeng, that is very ambitious of you. Why not destroy Sin Eliminators first before you destroy me?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue hadn’t moved from his spot. With his compelling demeanor, he didn’t look like someone being threatened at all.</p>
 <p>Tang Zeng fixed his eyes at him and said, “Sin Eliminators? Do you really think that’s what I aim for?”</p>
 <p>Surprise crossed Ye Zhongjue’s eyes. <em>He doesn’t want to destroy Sin Eliminators? Then what does he want? Simply to avenge how I took his territory three years ago?</em></p>
 <p>Seeing that Ye Zhongjue didn’t know what he meant, Tang Zeng suppressed his rage and began to say, “Ye Zhongjue, have you forgotten the accident three…”</p>
 <p>Someone rushed inside and interrupted him, “Boss, they brought backup…”</p>
 <p>Before the man could finish, a bullet penetrated his torso from behind and he fell on the ground.</p>
 <p>Tang Zeng’s face livid. He glared at Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>“Ye Zhongjue, you vile, shameless hypocrite! How dare you&nbsp;bring&nbsp;backup here?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked at him coolly. “How about you, who dares to abduct my wife? Have you forgotten the most important rule of the underworld? You do not hurt your enemy’s family! If you have the guts to do so, you must have the guts to take the consequences!”</p>
 <p>Behind him, Ceng Hanyu rushed inside with the backup, confronting Tang Zeng’s people.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu looked at Tang Zeng contemptuously. “We have subdued those outside. Are you sure the rest of you can walk out of here alive?”</p>
 <p>Tang Zeng’s shoulders heaved. He had a panicky look on his face.</p>
 <p>At this moment, a black-clad man near him answered the phone. His face fell as he listened.</p>
 <p>“Boss, the headquarters was razed. Our people there are all dead!”</p>
 <p>Tang Zeng’s eyes widened. He glared at Ye Zhongjue with extreme fury.</p>
 <p>“How dare you wipe out International Dragon &amp; Tiger Mafia’s headquarters!”</p>
 <p>He sounded genuinely shocked, unable to believe Ye Zhongjue had really done that.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue didn’t reply. Ceng Hanyu sneered, “Listen to me and take out the word ‘international’ from your name! Even Sin Eliminators and The Dark Night, two of the biggest mafias in the world, didn’t try to give their organizations such arrogant names. If you are not strong enough, don’t give yourself&nbsp;such&nbsp;a powerful name. Otherwise, you are just making a joke!”</p>
 <p>Tang Zeng turned his attention to Ceng Hanyu and the mercenaries behind him. His expression changed and his eyes dilated.</p>
 <p>“You are Ceng Hanyu!” he pointed at him and said.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t believe it. The two leaders of Sin Eliminators were both here in A City!</p>
 <p>Moreover, he recognized the people behind them as the Red Kill mercenaries. They were a mysterious group who were scattered all over the world and who never failed a mission.</p>
 <p>He was so out of luck this time. He had never expected this!</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu raised his eyebrows and his mouth curled up. “That is observant of you.”</p>
 <p>Tang Zeng suddenly aimed his gun at Mo Suqing and said, “If you kill me, I’ll make sure she dies with me! Ye Zhongjue, how dared you destroy my headquarters and talk to me like that! You’ve got Red Kill and&nbsp;Ceng Hanyu to help you, so what? I have her in my hand! I’ll kill her if I need!”</p>
 <p>With a ruthless look on his face, Tang Zeng placed his finger on the trigger and looked at Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue snapped his head toward Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was expressionless, as if what they were doing or saying had nothing to do with her.</p>
 <p>Pain crossed Ye Zhongjue’s eyes. <em>She knows. She knows I have lied to her, again!</em></p>
 <p>However, the most important thing now was to save her.</p>
 <p>The air was full of tension. One could almost smell the imaginary gunpowder. In this second, everything would be decided.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue and Ceng Hanyu gave each other a fleeting glance. Then, before Tang Zeng could say anything more, <em>bang!&nbsp;</em>there was a splitting pain in his arm and he dropped the gun.</p>
 <p>He never saw how Ye Zhongjue had fired the shot.</p>
 <p>He had done it in a split second. His movement was so fast that one could hardly see it.</p>
 <p>The shot unnerved everyone.</p>
 <p>Amid the commotion, Song Pingting suddenly raised her gun and gave Mo Suqing an evil look.</p>
 <p>A bullet shot out of the barrel of her gun.</p>
