<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Guan Zixuan shook his head again. <em>The person is an idiot.</em></p>
 <p>Everyone knew how precious the niece was to the president of The Unparalleled. For so many years, Leng Haoyun had never once let her appear in public. This was how protective he was of her.</p>
 <p>The person who had exposed the pictures was simply crazy!</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan looked at the newspaper, speechless. <em>Nowadays, there are all kinds of people, even those who are not afraid of death!</em></p>
 <p>Having said that, having been in the entertainment industry for so many years, he knew there were some gossip journalists who could sacrifice a lot for valuable scandals. He could more or less understand why someone would want to go down that path.</p>
 <p>But even so, he still believed the journalist who had published the stories was a fool.</p>
 <p>He figured that even Mo Suqing had not known the true identity of Leng Xiyao. This showed how well Leng Haoyun had been protecting her.</p>
 <p>The guy would definitely find out who the person was and make them pay.</p>
 <p>The saucy stories completely stole the focus of today’s entertainment section.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan guessed the reason Mo Suqing had lost her control yesterday must have been related to them. He looked at the picture of Ye Zhongjue holding Mo Suqing again, and somehow felt annoyed.</p>
 <p>The president of Mighty Empire was famous for his ruthlessness; he was one the dominant players in the economics of A City. <em>How could he possibly have anything to do with Mo Suqing?</em></p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan was perplexed. However, he was not the kind of person who would rack his brains for something he couldn’t understand. The only way was to ask someone who would know the answer.</p>
 <p>At this moment, he looked up and saw Yuan looking at him with sparkling eyes. They seemed to be saying, <em>Boss, now you know what I meant! You can finally understand my concerns,&nbsp;</em><em>right</em><em>?</em></p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan gave him an exasperated look. “Don’t look at me with watery eyes. I am not fond of cute animals.”</p>
 <p>Yuan almost died inside. “Boss, you know what I mean. You have to send her away. She is like a bomb that can explode anytime! Once she does, there will be more scandals about you and Linda will kill me!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan smiled slyly at Yuan and said, “Don’t you worry about it! Even if the sky falls on us, I am the taller one and can cover it for you. You have nothing to be afraid of. Besides, just like what you said, I have way too many scandals already. There won’t be any difference if there are more. You should just do your job as my agent and not worry about the other stuff. Also, tell Linda she is here. Otherwise, you know the consequence…”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixaun said threateningly and gave Yuan a smile that sent shivers down his spine.</p>
 <p><em>Such a frightening smile! I can’t take it!</em></p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan folded up the newspaper and cast a smiling glance at Yuan. “Take this away when you leave. I don’t want her to see it and affect her mood.”</p>
 <p>Yuan’s face crumpled. Though reluctant, he still did as told.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan walked over to the door to the guest room. Mo Suqing was still sitting rigidly on the bed with blank eyes.</p>
 <p>He closed the door lightly and called Leng Xiyao with his phone.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao was shocked when she saw who the caller was. She had just exchanged numbers with Guan Zixuan and now he was calling her already.&nbsp;<em>Could something have happened to Suqing?</em></p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao quickly answered the phone and walked outside.</p>
 <p>Because of the headlines, she took a day off today. Her uncle was tackling the issue now and asked her not to go to work until everything was settled.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao seated herself on the porch swing and said, “Guan Zixuan, is everything alright?”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan chuckled, as if he had discovered evidence that held her culprit of something. Leng Xiyao felt guilty.</p>
 <p>“What? What are you laughing at? Guan Zixaun, is your mouth having a cramp? Say something!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao taunted him, trying to get him to drop the attitude that was making her very uneasy.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan did not heed her words at all.</p>
 <p>“Leng Xiyao, are you forgetting to tell me something? Like the fact that you are the niece of the president of The Unparalleled?”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao went rigid. <em>He knows!</em></p>
 <p>She deflated like a balloon. <em>Of course. I should have expected it.</em></p>
 <p>“Why are you asking if you already know?” Leng Xiyao demanded, her tone a little aggressive.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan chuckled. “Ha! Someone is pissed when I should be the one who is! Even though I don’t mind Mo Suqing staying in my place, I should at least have been briefed on what happened yesterday. You are a gossip journalist yourself and know best how it would make me look if people find out she is in my house. And I’m pretty sure everyone is looking for her now, with all the headlines and stuff. So you aren’t really supposed to get angry with me when I haven’t even said anything!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao was unable to refute.</p>
 <p>Of course she was aware of these things. It was exactly because she knew how delicate Guan Zixuan’s reputation was and how the fact that Suqing was staying with him would affect it that she was feeling guilty!</p>
 <p>Otherwise, why would she feel guilty?</p>
 <p>If you ask her, she didn’t want Mo Suqing to stay with Guan Zixuan either. However, Suqing didn’t want to see her and preferred him over her.</p>
 <p>The thought saddened Leng Xiyao, who screwed up her face.</p>
 <p>She was a victim in the whole thing, too! Last night, she even had a fight with her uncle. She blamed him for making her hide her true identity and thereby turning Suqing against her.</p>
 <p>However, her uncle had called her a little brat who was ungrateful and heartless.</p>
 <p>She knew he had been right, but she just couldn’t help but get angry with her uncle. To be honest, she blamed herself more.</p>
 <p>Then, her uncle had talked her around by explaining to her how Mo Suqing was just venting her rage toward Ye Zhongjue on her; it was not that she was angry with her per se.</p>
 <p>Of course she knew it. But it was such an unfortunate coincidence that everything had chosen to blow up at the same time!</p>
 <p>Now it had come to this, she was really sad.</p>
 <p>“What? Why aren’t you saying anything? Are you mute? Leng Xiyao!” Guan Zixuan said coldly.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao pursed her lips. “So what are you going to do? Are you going to kick Suqing out at such a critical time? &nbsp;Those gossip journalists are going to eat her alive!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao kept falling deeper and deeper into the trap Guan Zixuan had set.</p>
 <p>Satisfied with what she had been tricked to say, Guan Zixuan replied, “What do you think I’m going to do? If you don’t tell me everything I want to know, I’ll do just what you said – kick her out!”</p>
 <p>“No, you can’t do that!” Leng Xiyao protested like an angry lion cub.</p>
 <p>“Enlighten me. Why exactly can’t I do that?” Guan Zixuan asked in a light tone that made Leng Xiyao grind her teeth.</p>
 <p>“Well… I… I’ll tell you everything! Only if you don’t kick Suqing out! She doesn’t want to go home or stay with me, and people will immediately recognize her if she leaves your house,” she pleaded.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan, satisfied, finally conceded, “Alright then. If you do a good job with telling me the truth, I can promise you not even a single hair of hers will be harmed!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao organized her thoughts before telling him what had happened.</p>
 <p>“There is this man named Ye Zhongjue, whose true identity is Ye Jue, the president of Mighty Empire – you know how easy it is for people like him to make up another identity. Poor Suqing didn’t know that and fell in love with him. She didn’t find out about it until yesterday, after they have been married for three months.”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan was not pleased to hear that she had got married.</p>
 <p><em>Three months? So she was already married when I met her.&nbsp;</em><em>Fate likes to play trick</em><em>s</em><em>&nbsp;on us!</em></p>
 <p>Although he was troubled by the news, he didn’t show it.</p>
 <p>At least, Leng Xiyao couldn’t detect anything unusual in his voice.</p>
 <p>“It’s not just Ye Zhongjue, right?” he asked coolly. “I can see she also didn’t know your true identity until yesterday. Otherwise, she wouldn’t avoid you.”</p>
 <p>His words hit like a thunder.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao lamented inwardly, <em>Is he a mind reader? How did he guess it?”</em></p>
 <p>“You guess correctly, again! I am already upset. Stop being a scoundrel!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan said unabashedly, “I always guess correctly about everything!”</p>
 <p>“Do you know how to be modest?” Leng Xiyao said, wanting more than anything to tear him up and grind him into bits with her teeth.</p>
 <p>“Right back at you!” Guan Zixuan retorted smilingly.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao pressed her lips into a thin line and looked out the villa. Being stuck at home like a canary in a cage made her even more blue.</p>
 <p>“Guan Zixuan, are you going to help or not? You don’t have to threaten me anymore; I have told you everything. Just say if you’re going to help her or not!”</p>
 <p>“Tut! You sound like a brigand! Is this the tone of someone who is asking for help? I guess you think I’ll help her no matter what?”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao rolled her eyes. <em>If you were right in front of me, I could kill you with a look! Your fans have liked the wrong man! You have no conscience, you bully only the weak and little, you are the minion of Satan…</em></p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao cursed him vehemently inside with all the bad phrases she could think of, before she finally replied, “Of course I don’t think that! How do I dare?”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan sat on the sofa in the living room lazily and a half-hearted smile appeared on his face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I am the one who dares not make you unhappy! Leng Haoyun would kill me! Anyway, your friend is still gazing into the void without touching her breakfast. You should come when you’ve got some time. I guess she’ll forgive you soon enough. After all, friendship is different from relationship.”</p>
 <p>“That’s for sure! Suqing will never abandon me!” Leng Xiyao pouted her lips and said indignantly.</p>
 <p>“Okay, okay! I wonder who it was that wanted to know if Mo Suqing would ever talk to her again just now?” Guan Zixuan arched his eyebrows.</p>
