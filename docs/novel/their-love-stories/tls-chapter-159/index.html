<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Mo Suqing picked up the fruits that were dropped on the floor and entered the ward.</p>
 <p>She and Leng Xiyao initially wanted to take a short walk outside the hospital, but she felt that the weather was a little chilly outside. Eventually, Leng Xiyao bought some fruits near the hospital entrance and dragged her back in, saying that the cold might be bad for the baby.</p>
 <p>This was why they heard the conversation between Ye Zhongjue and Ceng Hanyu.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing looked at Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>She asked calmly, “You already knew?”</p>
 <p>“Mm!”</p>
 <p>“How long?”</p>
 <p>“For about half a month?”</p>
 <p>“Is it true?”</p>
 <p>“Yi’an did the check. An Zhenguo is really Leng Xiyao’s grandfather. The ages match up as well.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing walked over and placed those documents away before sitting down at Ye Zhongjue’s bedside.</p>
 <p>“Do you blame me for not telling you?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing shook her head and smiled.</p>
 <p>“No, I won’t be this unreasonable. I don’t wish for you to keep secrets from me, but I’m referring to things between us. This is between Yao and Ceng Hanyu. Ceng Hanyu shared it with you because he trusts you, and you should have kept it a secret for him.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>“I was also afraid of things going awry. I asked Ceng Hanyu to come over because I wanted him to tell Leng Xiyao the truth sooner rather than later. The man Leng Xiyao duped today is none other than An Zhenguo, her biological grandfather. The old man just misses his grandchild.”</p>
 <p>Sudden realization hit Mo Suqing. “He’s actually Yao’s grandfather? Isn’t he An Huilin’s relative?”</p>
 <p>“Mm!” Ye Zhongjue nodded. “An Zhenguo is a distant uncle of An Huilin’s. By right, Leng Xiyao should be calling her Auntie.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was speechless. <em>Wasn’t this too much of a coincidence? Yao and An Huilin were actually related!</em></p>
 <p><em>The both of them fell in love with Leng Haoyun too! Was this heaven trying to play a joke on them?</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue continued. “Actually I’m telling you all this so you could talk some sense in Leng Xiyao. You girls are so close, and I know you’d be devastated if anything happens to her. An Huilin is not an easy target, so Leng Xiyao should be extra careful, especially now that they are at loggerheads with each other. An Huilin holds some shares of the An Group as well. An Zhenguo has only one granddaughter, Leng Xiyao. Now that he’s found her, his inheritance and the An Group will be left to her for sure. Apart from Old Man An and Ceng Hanyu, there’s basically no one else she can trust now!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing nodded at this, but her brows creased as she asked, “I heard you guys say that Ceng Hanyu is Yao’s fiance?”</p>
 <p>“Mm!”, Ye Zhongjue answered. “That’s right. The Ceng and An families have had close ties for a long time. The adults at that time had a verbal agreement on this after Leng Xiyao was born. After she went missing, Ceng Hanyu has been looking for her all this time.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was lost for words. She did not know what to say to this, nor did she know which side she should be on.</p>
 <p>None of them were at fault, and it was just a twist of fate which led to them meeting each other like this.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu chased after Leng Xiyao and they ended up at the rooftop.</p>
 <p>She stood quietly at the edge of the roof. Ceng Hanyu did not dare to make any sudden movements, afraid that she might suddenly decide to jump off the building.</p>
 <p>“Anne, calm down. Listen to me, okay?”</p>
 <p>Hearing Ceng Hanyu’s pleading tone made Leng Xiyao turn around. The wind whipped the hair around her face, and Ceng Hanyu could not understand the expression on her face.</p>
 <p>She looked like a confused doe lost in the forest, doubt, conflict and dilemma evident in her eyes. It was heartbreaking to see her like this.</p>
 <p>“You… What you said earlier, is it all true?” Leng Xiyao asked fearfully. She did not know what the answer would be, but she knew that she felt extremely confused and terrified right now.</p>
 <p><em>If Ceng Hanyu was speaking the truth, then I’m not a part of the Leng family at all. Who am I then? Why did I have to go through all those years of pain?</em></p>
 <p><em>If he was lying, then why did he say all that? The probability of it being a lie was close to zero.</em></p>
 <p><em>If they discussed it, then they would have been a hundred percent sure of it. They aren’t idiots.</em></p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu looked at her with a serious gaze. “I’m telling the truth. I’ve never lied to you! Walk back here first, and I’ll tell you everything, okay?”</p>
 <p>Instead of listening to him, Leng Xiyao became more agitated. She backed away towards the edge, almost making Ceng Hanyu’s heart leap out of his chest.</p>
 <p>“Anne, don’t!”</p>
 <p>“I’m not Anne, I’m Leng Xiyao! Tell me this, Ceng Hanyu. Did you already know who I was when you approached me for the very first time?” Leng Xiyao stared at Ceng Hanyu as she asked.</p>
 <p>“I’ll tell you everything once you walk back here, as long as you’re safe, I’ll tell you everything you want to know. Anne, whether you’re Leng Xiyao or Anne, please cherish your life. It’s more important to stay alive than anything else!”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu’s words might have triggered something in Leng Xiyao. She did not plan on jumping off the building. She merely wanted to feel the breeze here. It was Ceng Hanyu who was worried that she would jump off.</p>
 <p>She stepped away from the edge and moved to somewhere safe before she spoke.</p>
 <p>“Okay, you can tell me everything now. I’m listening!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao was keeping her emotions in check as she waited for Ceng Hanyu to speak. It was as if she was waiting for a verdict to be passed.</p>
 <p>Buffeted by the wind, Ceng Hanyu’s voice sounded almost ethereal.</p>
 <p>He said, “Your name is actually Anne. When you were younger, you were brought to the hospital since you were ill, but you went missing after that. The marriage agreement was made from when we were both children. I’ve been looking for you all these years, and I’ve never thought that you would be with the Leng family. You asked if I already knew who you were when we first met. No, I didn’t.”</p>
 <p>“At that time, I just thought you were mischievous, and that you were full of ideas. For some reason, you just felt familiar to me, that’s all. I didn’t approach you on purpose either. It was only until Leng Haoyun’s engagement, where Grandpa An was invited, that he recognized you instantly!</p>
 <p>“I was still too young when you went missing, and I can’t even remember what Auntie looked like. It was Grandpa An who told me that you looked exactly like her. This then reminded me of the time when I had to go get Rh-negative blood for you after your accident. From then on, I felt that the probability of you being Anne was rather high. So, I took a strand of your hair to do the DNA testing with Grandpa An, and that was the confirmation we needed.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao stood there numbly. “DNA testing. How did you get my hair?”</p>
 <p>“We went drinking after the engagement party, and you got drunk after...”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu did not dare meet her eyes as he was afraid that she would be angry.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao was a little upset at this. She pointed at him, saying, “You...”</p>
 <p>No other words came out of her mouth. She felt helpless.<em>&nbsp;What can I say? Logically speaking, I can’t blame Ceng Hanyu for this. He had been searching for me all this time.</em></p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao spoke again after some time.</p>
 <p>“The Grandpa An you’re referring to, it’s that old guy who was looking for you during the engagement party?”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu said in resignation, “That’s your grandfather!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao looked up at the sky, trying hard not to let her tears fall.</p>
 <p><em>Was this a joke? That weird old man I pranked turned out to be my grandfather.</em></p>
 <p>She tried to force a smile and keep her head up, but the tears eventually fell.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu stepped towards her and took her in an embrace. Leng Xiyao did not push him away.</p>
 <p>She weeped silently against his shoulder, her tears soaking his jacket.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao cried for a long time until Ceng Hanyu started speaking again. It was only then that she stopped crying so much.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu said, “Stop crying, Anne. I know all about what happened between you and Grandpa An today. He misses you dearly, and he has never forgotten about you.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao looked up with swollen eyes. “Then… what about my biological parents?”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu sighed. “They passed away within a year after you went missing. Auntie was devastated. She almost went insane looking for you. It was unfortunate that she had to leave this world with regrets.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao stared at Ceng Hanyu blankly, not knowing what to say.</p>
 <p>She grew up in the Leng family while her blood relatives were going through so much pain.</p>
 <p>“Could you not tell Uncle about this?” Leng Xiyao asked.</p>
 <p>“It’s up to you. I’ll support you in whatever decision you make!” Ceng Hanyu patted her on the head as he spoke.</p>
 <p>After a short pause, he continued, “Grandpa An misses you a lot. I’ll bring you to see him, if you have the time, okay?”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao looked at him awkwardly, slowly pushing him away.</p>
 <p>“My head is in a mess right now, and I don’t know what to think about this. Can you give me some time to think it over? I’ll go see him when I’ve calmed down a bit.”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu sighed again. “Okay! I’ll respect your choice. Do you want to have a look at the DNA testing report?”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao shook her head.<em>&nbsp;I don’t need that since we already know the results. The An family isn’t the type to acknowledge just anyone off the streets. They must have checked it thoroughly before they approached me on this.</em></p>
 <p>“Okay, I’m tired now. I’ll be going back first. I’ll look for you again when I’ve thought this over!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao then turned to leave.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu followed closely behind. “Let me send you back. I’m worried about you.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao turned to him suddenly. “Ceng Hanyu, even though we have a marriage agreement, I don’t have feelings for you. Please stop bringing up things like fiancee or fiance. I’m grateful that you’ve been searching for me all this time, but I’m not able to reciprocate your feelings. I don’t wish to promise you anything, nor do I want to lead you on!”</p>
