<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Mo Suqing wiped her face&nbsp;with her palm. She couldn’t pretend she didn’t know he was downstairs.</p>
 <p>He had so much work to do every day. Could he really sleep well in a cramped space like the car seat?</p>
 <p>His health would be compromised in the long run.</p>
 <p>At the thought, Mo Suqing made up her mind and went downstairs.</p>
 <p>If he was doing this to induce her sympathy, well, he had succeeded. She couldn’t bear to see him like this; it made her heart ache.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing looked at the man in the car. He had his eyes closed but didn’t seem to be having a sound sleep.</p>
 <p>He was frowning, as if he was having a bad dream.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing knocked on the window. Within ten seconds, his eyes flew open and he woke up in a start.</p>
 <p>There was sleepiness in his eyes, but when he saw that it was Mo Suqing in her pajamas, he immediately threw away his jacket that he had covered his body with and opened the door.</p>
 <p>Watching his nervous expression, Mo Suqing looked at him in exasperation.</p>
 <p>“Ye Zhongjue, are you crazy?&nbsp;Why are you&nbsp;sleeping in a car like this?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue did not get mad. Instead, he smiled foolishly.</p>
 <p>“Yes, I am crazy. I’ve gone extremely crazy without you sleeping with me!"</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was in no mood to squabble; it was already early in the morning. She closed the door and said, “Come on, let’s go upstairs. It’s too cold here.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue followed behind her happily. Although he wore a cold expression all the time, it was also particularly obvious when he was in an exultant mood.</p>
 <p>The corner of Mo Suqing’s mouth curved upward. <em>What a childish man!</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue followed Mo Suqing into her small apartment. It was only about fifty square meters&nbsp;wide, with a small living room, a bedroom and a petite bathroom, but overall, it had everything one might need.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was a tidy person. Although she had just got up, the apartment remained clean and neat without the slightest of mess.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing turned around and smelled alcohol from Ye Zhongjue, who was looking about. She frowned in disgust and said expressionlessly, “Sit on my bed. I’ll go prepare a bath for you.”</p>
 <p><em>He’s always very conscious of his own clean</em><em>lin</em><em>ess. Why did he make such a mess with himself?</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing turned on the faucet and felt more and more pissed. <em>He must have bet that I wouldn’t leave him alone!</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing kept slapping the water in the tub, venting her anger on no one.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue came in and saw Mo Suqing sulking and pouting there. He felt amused.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing heard the footsteps belatedly. She spun around. “Why didn’t you make a sound when you came in!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s eyes swept the petite bathroom. With the bathtub snuggled inside, there was barely any space left.</p>
 <p>He spoke while looking around, “You have been inside for a long time. I thought you passed out, so I came to check on you.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing rolled her eyes. <em>I will not believe such a line!</em></p>
 <p>“Well, I’m&nbsp;leaving.”</p>
 <p>She stood up and wiped her hand dry, then was going to go back into the bedroom.</p>
 <p>However, Ye Zhongjue grabbed her arm. Mo Suqing, startled, turned around. Before she could have time to react, Ye Zhongjue had pulled her toward him and the two of them slipped together.</p>
 <p>They fell into the tub. It was too small, so Ye Zhongjue’s back hit the edge hard. He grumbled, using his arms to protect her.</p>
 <p>When Mo Suqing realized what had happened, her pajamas had gone totally wet and began to stick on her body.</p>
 <p>She looked down at Ye Zhongjue, who was trying not to laugh, and said angrily, “What’s the matter with you!”</p>
 <p>She pushed him hard and half sat up.</p>
 <p>The moment she emerged from the water, her clothes glued to her body and showed the curves of her torso.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing glared at Ye Zhongjue. Anger showed on her face.</p>
 <p>However, Ye Zhongjue seemed to think it was funny. He looked at her amusedly. When she got angry, she was like a tiger cub cutie-pie, bluffing without fangs.</p>
 <p>He chuckled foolishly. “I don’t know what the matter is with me, either!”</p>
 <p>His eyes shifted from Mo Suqing’s face and down to her chest. Heat sparkled in his eyes like roaring fire burning fiercely.</p>
 <p>His breath became heavy, too.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing detected the weird light in his eyes. Then, she looked down at her chest.</p>
 <p>“Ah!” she screamed and splashed some water onto his face.</p>
 <p>“You ruffian, Ye Zhongjue!” Mo Suqing’s chest heaved out of rage.</p>
 <p>The heat in Ye Zhongjue’s eyes didn’t extinguish because of the water; it burned hotter. He swallowed and said huskily, “I act like one only in front of you!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was speechless. <em>He’s probably the only person in the world who can act like a ruffian and then admits it so matter-of-factly!</em></p>
 <p>She glared at him one last time and began to stand up.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue grabbed her arm. Mo Suqing said coldly, “Let me go!”</p>
 <p>She didn’t want to stay here with him any longer. He had so many ways to make her soften her heart.</p>
 <p>“No!” Ye Zhongjue said in a grieved tone like a child who couldn’t get his candy.</p>
 <p>“Ye Zhongjue, why are you doing this?” Mo Suqing looked at him with a poker face.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue stiffened a little, but he still didn’t let go of her. After a moment, he said unhappily, “But you are soaked through. You’ll get a cold if you go out like this.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing almost laughed. <em>What an unreasonable man!</em></p>
 <p>“If I do get a cold, it’s because of you!”</p>
 <p>He frowned. “You can totally avoid getting a cold.”</p>
 <p>“What?” Mo Suqing gave him a puzzled look.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue grinned slyly. “Take a hot bath with me before you go. That way, you definitely won’t get a cold!”</p>
 <p>“You wish!” Mo Suqing splashed more water onto his face and quickly slipped out of the tub. Standing a few meters away, she looked at him warily.</p>
 <p>“Take your time in the tub. I’m going to change out of these. Get out after you finish your bath. I need to go to work tomorrow!”</p>
 <p>Then, she closed the door behind her. Turning to her bed, she breathed out a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>She quickly changed out of the wet clothes. Otherwise, she would probably get a cold like Ye Zhongjue had warned.</p>
 <p>After changing into dry clothes, she made the bed and pulled out a blanket before carrying it to the living room.</p>
 <p>The sofa was too small for him. If she was going to let him sleep there, she might as well not have taken him up to her apartment. On the other hand, she was shorter, so it would be okay for her.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing lay down on the sofa and covered her face with the blanket, but sleep wouldn’t come.</p>
 <p>After a long while, there still wasn’t a sound from the bathroom. She began to feel a bit worried.</p>
 <p>She stood up and walked toward the bathroom. When she opened the door, she found him sound asleep in the tub.</p>
 <p>He was naked, so Mo Suqing tried not to look directly at him when she slowly approached him.</p>
 <p>She bent down and tested the water. It had gone lukewarm.</p>
 <p>Just when she was about to withdraw her hand, it was grabbed by the man in the tub. “Suqing!” Ye Zhongjue yelped.</p>
 <p>He had a terrified look on his face before he suddenly woke with a start.</p>
 <p>He realized that he was lying in the tub and grabbing Mo Suqing’s arm. As for Mo Suqing, she was squatting by the tub and looking at him with a shocked look.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue cleared his throat and said, “I seemed to have fallen asleep.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing freed herself from his grip and turned away. <em>Seemed to have fallen asleep? I think you totally passed out!</em></p>
 <p>Otherwise, it was impossible for a cautious man like him not to know she was approaching.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing took down the bathrobe hanging on the wall and extended her arm backward, so she didn’t have to turn around.</p>
 <p>“Here you go. And the towel is on the rack next to the tub. Quickly wipe yourself dry and put on the robe.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked at the white bathrobe. It was obviously hers judging from its size.</p>
 <p>He didn’t argue with her. He just stood up and wiped himself dry, then took the bathrobe from her hand.</p>
 <p>When Mo Suqing heard the splash that indicated he had come out of the tub, she couldn’t help but see his naked body in her mind. A hint of red crept into her face.</p>
 <p>“I’m done!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing turned.</p>
 <p>When she wore the bathrobe, it would reach her ankles; on Ye Zhongjue, it was well above his knees.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing only cast a glance at him before walking out of the bathroom without saying anything.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue followed closely behind. When Mo Suqing entered the living room, she found&nbsp;that&nbsp;Ye Zhongjue had come out with her, too.</p>
 <p>She turned around and said in exasperation, “What are you doing? Go to sleep!”</p>
 <p>“Then what are you doing out here?” Ye Zhongjue looked at her with an unfathomable expression.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing didn’t want to try to figure him out. He had always been a mysterious man who was difficult to understand. She had no way to crack his mind open.</p>
 <p>She walked to the sofa and lay down.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue frowned. “You are going to sleep here?”</p>
 <p>“What do you think? Or do you want to sleep here?” Mo Suqing asked sharply.</p>
 <p>“Okay, I’ll sleep here.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue answered without thinking.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was so furious! She felt that she could explode any minute now. She sat up and stared at Ye Zhongjue with an icy-cold look.</p>
 <p>“Ye Zhongjue, just spit out what you want! It’s very late now. Are you going to let me sleep or not? If you love to sleep in your car so much, just go back! Don’t stay here and disturb my rest time, okay?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s expression remained elusive and hard to read.</p>
 <p>Then, he looked at her and said in a tone as pitiful as a fluffy Labrador’s watery eyes, “The wound on my hand has been soaked in water!”</p>
