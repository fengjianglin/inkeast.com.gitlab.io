 <p><strong>Five years later.</strong></p>
 <p><strong>In the President’s office of Fengteng Group, Emperor City.</strong></p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan rubbed his forehead as he looked at the rows and rows of figures on his computer screen.</p>
 <p>After taking Mo Suqing away, she had lost her memories.</p>
 <p>He remembered she hated it when he called her Suqing. She said even though she did not remember what happened in the past, she felt that it was not her name.</p>
 <p>Until one day, she suddenly told herself that she should be called A’zi, because she always heard a crisp female voice calling her A’zi everytime she dreamt.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan started calling her A’zi from then on.</p>
 <p>After some time, he felt that Mo Suqing belonged to Ye Zhongjue, while A’zi belonged to him!</p>
 <p>When he took A’zi home, his family had just one request. They wanted him to take over the family business, or he can forget about being a part of their family ever again. A’zi needed treatment at the time, and he had agreed to their request as he wanted to save her.</p>
 <p>Both his father and older brother were in politics, while his mother was taking care of the business. His older brother would follow in his father’s footsteps, while he had to follow in his mother’s.</p>
 <p>They had no other siblings, and this was what their parents wanted for them.</p>
 <p>Time flies, and five years pass in the blink of an eye. A’zi was getting more and more reliant on him as time went by. She was extremely wary of outsiders, but she never treated him like one.</p>
 <p>His family wanted them to get married soon.</p>
 <p>A tiny smile hung on the corner of Guan Zixuan lips as he thought about the wedding that was to happen a week later.</p>
 <p>He could not be sure before, but he was very sure now that he and A’zi were in love. This was why he promised her, and why he decided to marry her.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan was deep in thought when his mobile phone rang.</p>
 <p>His butler spoke in an urgent tone right after he picked up the call.</p>
 <p>“Young master! Miss A’zi fell!”</p>
 <p>A’zi had finished her check-up when Guan Zixuan arrived at the hospital.</p>
 <p>He felt the air change when he stepped into the ward, as if something was different now.</p>
 <p>A’zi looked at him coldly, her gaze devoid of the usual warmth.</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong? A’zi?” Guan Zixuan stepped forward in concern, not minding the change.</p>
 <p>Xia Zi shook her head. “I’m not the one you’re looking for!”</p>
 <p>“What?” Guan Zixuan’s brows creased, puzzled by what she just said.</p>
 <p>Xia Zi looked at him and tried to mask her emotions. Guan Zixuan loved her, and she had grown to rely on him. She had even fallen in love with him.</p>
 <p><em>So what?&nbsp;</em><em>He mistook me for someone else, so I need to end this quickly and cleanly. I can’t trap myself in this.</em></p>
 <p>“Let me ask you something. Who do you like more? Mo Suqing or A’zi?”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan’s brows were furrowed deeply now. <em>What is she talking about? Isn’t she both A’zi and Suqing?</em></p>
 <p>“I...”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan was at a loss for words. Xia Zi then decided to go straight to the point.</p>
 <p>“There’s no need for you to explain. I remember everything now. What I’m trying to tell you is that I’m not Mo Suqing, I’m Xia Zi, an interpol agent based in Lyon, France. I got shot while trying to save Mo Suqing, so this happened. There’s no need for you to feel responsible for me, because I’m not the one you’re looking for.”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan’s expression turned awful, and hesitation flashed past Xia Zi’s face.</p>
 <p>She steeled her heart and continued.</p>
 <p>“I’m an orphan, and I don’t know who my relatives are. Mo Suqing is definitely related to me, otherwise we won’t look so similar. However, I can’t confirm anything without looking into it first. So, you don’t have to keep taking care of me. I think it’s time I leave too.”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan staggered backwards as she finished.</p>
 <p>He looked at her in disbelief.<em>&nbsp;She isn’t Mo Suqing, but… I’ve already fallen in love with her. What do I do?</em></p>
 <p>After a moment of contemplation, Xia Zi plucked out the drip in her hand and made her way out.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan wanted to stop her, but he froze with a cold glare from her.</p>
 <p>He was frozen in place, feeling utterly lost. <em>She really isn’t Mo Suqing!</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing would never glare at someone in such a way, and she could never be this callous.</p>
 <p>He wanted to take Xia Zi’s hand, but she dodged it instinctively and walked her shoulder into him, making him fall backwards unexpectedly.</p>
 <p>He did not expect for someone who looked so feeble to have such great strength of will, even though she looked chilly on the outside.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan picked himself up quickly. He had no grounds to deny that she was, in fact, interpol agent, Xia Zi, and neither could he insist that she was Mo Suqing, the girl he once had feelings for.</p>
 <p>Xia Zi walked out without a second glance, leaving Guan Zixuan alone in the ward.</p>
 <p>The wedding had turned into nothing but a joke.</p>
 <p>It was fate that allowed him to meet Xia Zi, causing him to subsequently fall in love with her. However, his love seemed to be unrequited. <em>Why would she have been so adamant in wanting to leave otherwise?</em></p>
 <p>Furthermore, he knew it was difficult to stop her from leaving if she had already made her decision.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan was all alone in the ward.</p>
 <p>He never knew the heavens would play such a big joke on him.</p>
 <p>Xia Zi leaned against the wall after she exited the ward. She shut her eyes in her agony. <em>Let’s end everything here.</em></p>
 <p>The butler brought her daily necessities to the hospital, but the only item she took with her when she left was her wallet.</p>
 <p>She wanted to locate Luo Qiqi as quickly as she could. She knew the other girl would be going insane trying to look for her.</p>
 <p>Xia Zi obtained a fake passport and flew directly to France from Emperor City.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, Luo Qiqi was playing a game of cat and mouse with Su Jincheng in Munich.</p>
 <p>It all started five years ago.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi did not manage to capture Su Jincheng, and she did not know where Xia Zi went either. Only Jian Jie was left at the scene.</p>
 <p>She learnt from Jian Jie that Su Jincheng was in charge of The Dark Night, and his moniker was none other than ‘Dark Night’.</p>
 <p>Xia Zi went missing after he shot her, so Luo Qiqi had suspected that it was Su Jincheng who captured Xia Zi.</p>
 <p>She initially pulled out all stops and chased after Su Jincheng in a frenzy. Everywhere he went, she would arrive shortly after.</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng was a cunning individual. He had disguised himself with facial prosthetics countless times, but she was able to recognize him almost every single time.</p>
 <p>By a twist of fate, she got entangled in a mafia war while in England, and of all people, it was Su Jincheng who saved her.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi remembered he did not have any help when he extricated her from that dangerous situation.</p>
 <p>When she asked him why he shot Xia Zi, he explained that he thought Xia Zi was trying to harm Mo Suqing, and Mo Suqing was his saviour, so he wanted to prevent any harm from befalling her.</p>
 <p>She then asked if he was the one who captured Xia Zi, but he told her he merely sent Mo Suqing away from A City, and he had not involved himself with any other individual.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi felt rather confused. Su Jincheng did not seem to be lying, but where did Xia Zi go?</p>
 <p>She refused to believe that something untoward might have happened to A’zi.</p>
 <p>The relationship between the two of them was rather intriguing.</p>
 <p>One was an interpol agent while the other was in charge of The Dark Night. Logically, they should be at loggerheads with each other, but interestingly, they were not at each other’s throats.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi planned to leave with Su Jincheng, but the jade pendant on Luo Qiqi caught his eye.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi saw him staring at her pendant, and looked at him cautiously.</p>
 <p>Unexpectedly, Su Jincheng asked if she had been in B City during a certain period of time.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi then began to tell him her story of how a criminal stole her jade pendant, and how she was smart enough to track the villain down and successfully retrieve her pendant.</p>
 <p>There was a subtle change in Su Jincheng’s expression as he listened to her. Just as she described how the arrogant thief was shot, Su Jincheng said something.</p>
 <p>He said, “I’m that thief you’re talking about.”</p>
 <p>What happened next was an absolute surprise to him.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi ran away.</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng was quite bewildered. He was her saviour, but she decided to run away like this without even a word of thanks. What annoyed him was the fact that she was the one who had shot him and almost got him killed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;Su Jincheng was experiencing a flurry of emotions he had never experienced before.</p>
 <p>He and Luo Qiqi had been spending a lot of time together.</p>
 <p>Everytime she landed in the city he was in, he would put on facial prosthetics and follow her around as she embarked on her search. He did not expect that he would actually love pranking her like that. This time, however, she no longer wanted to chase after him. She ran away instead.</p>
 <p>She literally ran away from him.</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng could not believe she did that. Thus, this evolved into a long-running game of cat and mouse.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi was the cat chasing after him initially, but for the past two years, it was Su Jincheng chasing after Luo Qiqi.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi put all her effort into locating Xia Zi, and she hid from Su Jincheng whenever she saw him.</p>
 <p>She contacted headquarters for help when Xia Zi went missing five years ago, but no help was sent. At that time, she had made a decision to leave Interpol.</p>
 <p>If they did not even bat an eyelid when one or two of their agents went missing, then justice was nothing but a fancy word to them.</p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi heard that Xia Zi might be in Munich, but she only realized it was a trap set by Su Jincheng when she arrived.</p>
 <p>This was what happened that led up to this very moment.</p>
 <p><strong>On a dreary street, Munich.</strong></p>
 <p>Luo Qiqi stared at the man in front of her. “Are you sick in the mind, Su Jincheng? Stop chasing me around!”</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng raised his brows. “I’m just trying to help you locate someone. Why don’t you believe me?”</p>
 <p>“I’d have to be retarded to believe you! Stop shedding crocodile tears. If you’re still sore over being shot five years ago, then I’m right here in front of you. I’ll let you take a free shot right now!”</p>
