 <p>“The car...” Ye Zhongjue wanted to explain himself, but Mo Suqing turned away.</p>
 <p>“What has it got to do with me!” She then walked back to her own car, trying to hide her awkwardness.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was flustered. He quickly alighted and went after her, grabbing her arm before she could reach her own car.</p>
 <p>“You...” He looked at her, not knowing what he should say.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing shrugged him off and said, “I didn’t know President Ye stuttered!”</p>
 <p>He sucked in a breath. <em>This woman has such a vicious tongue. Can’t she just have a proper conversation with me?</em></p>
 <p>She looked up at him stubbornly, causing his heart to melt instantly. There were some things which simply did not change.</p>
 <p>“Suqing, why can’t we have a proper chat!” He asked her seriously. This was the first time he called her by her name in five years.</p>
 <p>He may have looked too solemn and serious, because Mo Suqing turned away from him instead.</p>
 <p>There was no way Ye Zhongjue would allow her to escape. He stepped forward to close in on her.</p>
 <p>She shrunk back instinctively, her back hitting the car.</p>
 <p>She looked at him and asked, “What… what are you doing?”</p>
 <p>“I just want to know if we can have a proper chat, Suqing!”</p>
 <p>She tried to avert her gaze as she answered, “Aren’t we already chatting now?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue stared squarely at her. “Suqing, you know what I mean. I just want to talk to you!”</p>
 <p>“There’s nothing to talk about. Also, please don’t call me Suqing. I’m Annly now!”</p>
 <p>She did not want to entertain his request at all. Ye Zhongjue’s expression dimmed. He did not expect it to be easy, but he never thought she could be this cold-hearted.</p>
 <p>“It’s been five years. Don’t you miss...”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing cut him off before he could say ‘the children’.</p>
 <p>“Why should I? Are you saying I should be reminding myself of that accident eight years ago?”</p>
 <p>Her words shocked him. Despair was apparent in his eyes as he stared at her, speechless.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing walked away from him and spoke with her back to him.&nbsp;“Please don’t bother me anymore, President Ye. And please stop following me!”</p>
 <p>She got into her car and drove off. After some distance, she could still see Ye Zhongjue standing in the same place, as still as a statue.&nbsp;She felt frustrated all of a sudden. Scratching her head in irritation, she sped towards her apartment in the city center.</p>
 <p>She did not want to get in touch with Ye Zhongjue because she did not want to be reminded of what happened five years ago. She would only be reminded of her children, and how her mother died if she saw him. She could not forgive herself for not being able to let go of him.</p>
 <p><em>What should I do?</em></p>
 <p>When she returned to her apartment, Mo Suqing decided to take a bath to relax after the series of stressful events.</p>
 <p>Her mobile phone kept ringing after she came out of her bath.</p>
 <p>It was an unknown number from A City. Mo Suqing wondered who it could be.<em>&nbsp;I’ve only been back for a couple of days. Who would be contacting me? It can’t be Ye Zhongjue, can it?</em></p>
 <p>She shook her head at this.<em>&nbsp;It can’t be him. He should hate me now, especially after all that attitude I gave him earlier. Given his arrogant nature, he wouldn’t stoop to look for me like that.</em></p>
 <p>She heard the voice of a female when she answered.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing smiled after recovering from her initial surprise.</p>
 <p>“Yao, what’s up?” Mo Suqing’s mood instantly improved as she heard Leng Xiyao’s voice.</p>
 <p>“Suqing, why did you take so long to answer the call?” Leng Xiyao asked in concern.</p>
 <p>“I was in the bathroom earlier and I didn’t hear it. What’s up?”</p>
 <p>“Did anything happen? I saw Ye Zhongjue follow you after you left.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was reminded of the expression on his face when she left him earlier, paling at the thought.</p>
 <p>“Nope. Oh! I didn’t get to ask at the banquet earlier, but when did you return to A City? I wanted to go to England after giving birth to look for you after your operation, but I didn’t expect for things to turn into a huge mess after that.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao had heard about what happened in the past five years from Leng Haoyun and Ceng Hanyu, and she tried to console Mo Suqing. “Suqing, it’s over now. I don’t want to keep harping on the past, and I just want to spend my time with Leng Haoyun. I hope you can be happy too.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing replied with an affirmative and fell silent.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao then asked, “Suqing, there’s something I don’t understand. Why did you choose to leave? I didn’t think you could harden your heart like that. Sometimes when I look at A’jiu and Xiaoliu, I can’t help but wonder how determined you had to be to actually choose to leave. How can you bear to leave them?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was confused at this. She frowned as she asked, “A’jiu and Xiaoliu? Who are they? I don’t know them?”</p>
 <p>“You don’t know?” Leng Xiyao felt something amiss. “You don’t know who A’jiu and Xiaoliu are?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing shook her head and answered with conviction. “I don’t!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao was stunned. <em>It’s no wonder Suqing chose to leave. She wasn’t even aware of this!</em></p>
 <p>But Leng Xiyao was still confused. If Mo Suqing had given birth, how would she not know that her children were alive?</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao took a deep breath to steady herself. She knew this would be a very shocking piece of news to Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p dir="ltr">“Suqing, listen to me. Don’t get too emotional. Just listen to what I have to say first, okay?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was thoroughly confused now. She asked, “Yao, what’s going on? I won’t get emotional, just say what you have to.”</p>
 <p>After the past five years, she did not think that there would be anything that could shock her anymore.</p>
 <p>But disbelief and astonishment were apparent on her face when Leng Xiyao revealed the truth.</p>
 <p>“Suqing, listen to me. I’m not sure what happened then, but A’jiu and Xiaoliu are your children...”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was stunned at the news.</p>
 <p>“What? What did you just say, Yao!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao expected such a reaction from her. She knew very well how important her own children were to a mother.</p>
 <p>“Suqing, listen to me. When you left after giving birth, Ye Zhongjue was in critical condition. This is what I heard from the others as well, and when I just returned, I even thought that A’jiu and Xiaoliu were Mo Sulian’s children. I only learnt the truth recently. I think you can go to Ye Zhongjue if you want to know what happened. I believe he’ll tell you everything.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing ended the call in disappointment.</p>
 <p>The color drained from her face. She never expected for her children to still be alive.</p>
 <p>Tears of joy escaped her eyes as inexplicable emotion welled up in her. It was Su Jincheng who told her that her children had died, causing her to make the decision to leave A City. If she had known that her children survived, she would never have left them.</p>
 <p><em>Was it Ye Zhongjue who deliberately kept it under wraps, causing Su Jincheng to give me the wrong information?&nbsp;</em><em>But he couldn’t have done so since he had been shot, and he had no reason to do so either.&nbsp;</em><em>Who was the culprit then?</em></p>
 <p><em>Did Su Jincheng mislead me on purpose? But it was unlikely for him to lie to me.&nbsp;</em>Having spent the past five years with him, she knew him enough to know that he was not someone who would do that.</p>
 <p><em>What exactly happened then?</em> She was dying to know.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing looked at the time. It was close to midnight.<em> Ye Zhongjue should already be asleep by now, and the children… they were probably asleep too!</em></p>
 <p>She thought about it for a while before calling Su Jincheng.</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng was getting into bed when his phone rang.</p>
 <p>“It’s late, Suqing. Not asleep yet?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s voice trembled slightly. “Jincheng, didn’t you tell me that my child died...”</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng knew this was something that had always weighed heavily on her heart. He nodded as he answered, “Mm!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s eyes were red. “Jincheng, do you know that my children are fine? They should be about five now...”</p>
 <p>“Huh!” Su Jincheng was shocked. <em>Her children were alive?</em></p>
 <p>“It wasn’t me!” Su Jincheng knew Mo Suqing would suspect him. He thus explained hastily, “The children were barely alive, and they were sent straight to the operation room. Gu Yi’an even said that their chances of survival were not very high. You had just given birth and in low spirits because of what happened with Ye Zhongjue, so I didn’t dare to tell you the truth for fear of disappointing you if they didn’t survive. When you asked me to take you away, I thought it was a good idea at the time, since time might be able to heal all wounds. I didn’t know about this at all. I haven’t been back to A City either and I’ve not kept myself updated on things here. I had absolutely no idea...”</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng suddenly felt that it was pointless for him to continue explaining himself. A gesture he had originally thought could protect her had become the very reason that separated her from her own flesh and blood for five whole years.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing could feel his guilt even through the phone.</p>
 <p>She took a deep breath to calm herself down and said, “It’s fine. I know you didn’t do it on purpose, Jincheng. Have an early night...”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing ended the call before Su Jincheng could say anything else.</p>
