<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Ye Zhongjue drove at a high speed. When he carried Mo Suqing to the driver’s seat, he had covered her chest with his jacket.</p>
 <p>Presently, their surroundings became more and more familiar. Mo Suqing looked at Ye Zhongjue, astonished. <em>How did he know this place?</em></p>
 <p>This was the community of Mo Suqing’s current apartment. It was not a big one, but the neighborhood was nice.</p>
 <p>“How did you know where I live?” Mo Suqing grabbed Ye Zhongjue’s arm.</p>
 <p>“Why&nbsp;wouldn’t&nbsp;I know?” Ye Zhongjue retorted, watching Mo Suqing’s hand on his arm. Her arm was fair-skinned and as smooth and enticing as a piece of top-quality jade.</p>
 <p>He always knew she had got wonderful skin and could never get enough of it.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing didn’t realize the jacket had slipped down a little when she reached out to grab Ye Zhongjue’s arm, exposing her wet gown.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue, seeing this, began to pant. He forced down the heat inside his body and said hoarsely, “Let go of me if you don’t want to die from a car accident!”</p>
 <p>At first, Mo Suqing didn’t understand what he meant. But when she saw that he was staring at her chest, she realized her bra was showing underneath the gown.</p>
 <p>The gown was totally soaked through in the chest area!</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing quickly pulled the jacket up and covered herself tightly.</p>
 <p>She stared at the road and thought, <em>Fortunately it is not a busy road. Otherwise, it would be a miracle if we haven’t hit something.</em></p>
 <p>They arrived at the apartment building. His familiarity with the route, the kind look the janitor gave him and the way the guard interacted with him as if he knew him better than Mo Suqing did, all made her very curious.</p>
 <p>“How did you know where I live?”</p>
 <p>“What do you think?” Ye Zhongjue turned to her once he had parked the car.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing remembered the figure outside Guan Zixuan’s villa at night when she had stayed there. She thought she knew what the answer was, but she couldn’t be sure.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue gazed at her, as if he wanted to melt her with his eyes. “Well?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing became a bit panicky. She didn’t care for the suffocating sensation she was feeling now. Her heart was beating fast.</p>
 <p>She tried to open the door but found it was locked.</p>
 <p>She turned to Ye Zhongjue and glared at him. “Ye Zhongjue, unlock the door and let me get out! I don’t have time for this!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue wasn’t upset or angry. He just gazed at her, which made Mo Suqing even more panicky.</p>
 <p>She didn’t want to look him in the eye, afraid that she would get softened by the heat in it if she did.</p>
 <p>His attractive and husky voice flowed toward her. Mo Suqing had always felt it was comparable to the sound of a cello.</p>
 <p>His voice was so beautiful that every time she heard it, she practically swooned.</p>
 <p>Because of this, she knew she could easily drown herself in his voice.</p>
 <p>“Answer my question first,” he said.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s head snapped up. Her face was red, either from the heat or from anger.</p>
 <p>“Who knows how you found out where I live, or how you even came to a place like this? Someone like you is supposed to live in a big house and drive an expensive car, leading a life as different from a commoner like me as night and day! Who knows what has got into your head?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was still looking at her, unmoving.</p>
 <p>“Suqing, you know the answer. You definitely do. You just don’t want to say it. You just can’t forgive me!”</p>
 <p>It tormented Mo Suqing to hear Ye Zhongjue this agitated and hurt. Her heart became extremely soft now.</p>
 <p>However, she still didn’t let her guard down. The man was so good at lying that he could make his every word sound genuine.</p>
 <p>And she was stupid. She was not clever enough to resist his sweet nothings.</p>
 <p>Somehow, his accusatory tone made her feel she had greatly wronged him.</p>
 <p>So, she hung her head low and dared not look into those eyes.</p>
 <p>“President Ye, please let me go! You can easily find a lot of commoners like me. Why can’t you find someone else who’s willing to fool around with you? I’m sick of it!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s face darkened.</p>
 <p>He glared at her and said, “What’s that supposed to mean? If I want just about anyone, why would I do all those things? Any woman would <em>dive</em> if I do so much as wave at her, but I didn’t do that. I hid my true identity for you, cooked for you, took great care for you, dropped you to work and picked you up from work, and all I got in return is you saying I have been fooling around!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing forced herself to be tough. She turned to the window and said cold-heartedly, “Who knows what’s in you wealthy people’s mind? Who knows if you had gone crazy when you decided to abandon your villa and move into a commoner’s apartment or if you just like to cook? Don’t act all sincere. You probably just want to try something different from exotic delicacies. If you can have as many women as you want, go do it then! I didn’t beg you to take me!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s expression had gone completely icy when she finished.</p>
 <p>He gritted his teeth while looking at&nbsp;Mo Suqing, who&nbsp;had her back facing him.</p>
 <p>Then, he said, enunciating each word, “I just like to cook? I just want to try something different? But I fucking chose you, Mo Suqing! Why do you always have to contort what I say? I said any woman would dive if I do so much as wave at her, but I also said I didn’t do that! But of course you are so fucking good at twisting my words and filtering out those you don’t want to believe! You intend to piss me off to death, don’t you, huh? Fine, I’ll let you go!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue unlocked the door. Mo Suqing was going to look at him, but she forced herself not to do it. <em>Isn’t this what she wants?</em></p>
 <p>She opened the door, got off, then ran into the building without looking back.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked at the jacket she had dropped on the driver’s seat. He was sure it would still smell like her. Suddenly, he felt absolutely pathetic.</p>
 <p>How he wanted to tell her everything, that he had always loved her, only her.</p>
 <p>She had lost her virginity to him the night they met in the pub, but it had been his first time, too.</p>
 <p>He always thought he had been very lucky to have bumped into her that night, not anyone else.</p>
 <p>Only after she had run into the building had Mo Suqing realized that she had been crying. She was touching her face when she ran into Mrs. Zhang, the lady living opposite her. It looked like she was going to buy some groceries.</p>
 <p>“You two had a fight again?” she asked, looking first at her face and then at the car outside.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing gave her a puzzled look.</p>
 <p>Mrs. Zhang pointed at Ye Zhongjue’s car. “Isn’t that your husband? I have seen him countless times. He parks his car here every night. When I asked him why he didn’t go upstairs, he said he didn’t want to disturb you. I can see you guys had a fight. Young lady, couples shouldn’t have fights that&nbsp;last overnight. Don’t be so stubborn! He always leaves early in the morning.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing thought her own voice seemed far&nbsp;away when she said, “He parks his car here every night?”</p>
 <p>“That’s right. He goes upstairs every night, too. Every time I&nbsp;see&nbsp;you have locked him out again, I feel&nbsp;sorry for him. Don’t fight so severely every time!”</p>
 <p>Mrs. Zhang said patiently and earnestly, but Mo Suqing had gone numb.</p>
 <p>If Mrs. Zhang didn’t tell her, she would never know she had a guardian angel who kept watch for her every night.</p>
 <p>Tears poured down her cheeks. She quickly turned away and mumbled “I need to go” before fleeing from Mrs. Zhang.</p>
 <p>Mrs. Zhang looked after her and then at the car outside, shaking her head.</p>
 <p>After Mo Suqing went back to her apartment and had a good cry, she found that Guan Zixuan had called her several times.</p>
 <p>She called him back. “Are you home yet?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah,” Mo Suqing replied unhappily.</p>
 <p>“I just got a job for tonight and probably won’t get&nbsp;home until late. Remember to lock all your doors and windows before going to sleep!”</p>
 <p>“Okay, I know. Go home and get some rest as soon as you finish it!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was about to ring off when she heard Guan Zixuan&nbsp;asked&nbsp;hesitantly, “Did he… take you home?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah,” Mo Suqing said in a low voice, clearly not wanting to say anything more.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan sighed and hung up.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing took a shower and changed into her pajamas.</p>
 <p>She tried hard not to check if his car was still there. But in the end, she couldn’t help but go to the window and pull back the curtains just a little bit, almost as if she was under a spell.</p>
 <p>Sure enough, the car was still exactly where it had been.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s heart skipped a beat. <em>He’s here every night for the past week?</em></p>
 <p>She dared not linger on that thought in case she gives in.</p>
 <p>However, deep in her heart, she knew she had already softened her heart irrevocably. Her heart went to him without her control. She couldn’t lie to herself, even if she could keep lying to others.</p>
 <p>Her heart was his,&nbsp;and had&nbsp;always been…</p>
 <p>Ever since he had promised her he would give her a home, her world had been turned upside down.</p>
 <p>Like a stalker, Mo Suqing would snuggle down in her bed for a while, and then go to the window to see what the person downstairs might be doing.</p>
 <p>The night went on.</p>
 <p>At midnight, Mo Suqing saw that his car was still there.</p>
 <p>She decided to get tough and go to sleep and not go to the window again.</p>
 <p>After a while, she fell into sleep. However, she didn’t sleep well because her mind was in a jumble.</p>
 <p>When she woke up again, it was still very dark. She switched on her bedside lamp and went to the window.</p>
 <p>His car was still there.</p>
 <p>The faint street light made it a bit vague.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing went back to her bed and checked her phone. It was three o’clock in the morning.</p>
 <p>She could no longer stand it.</p>
 <p>She had lived with him before, so she knew how much work he had to do every day. After all, he was the president of a company.</p>
 <p>She remembered during the period when she was hospitalized because of acute gastroenteritis, he had been perusing papers and documents at her bedside, too.</p>
 <p>He was reading them before she fell asleep and was still reading them when she awoke.</p>
 <p>She hadn’t been able to understand why an assistant needed to see so many papers.</p>
 <p>Now she finally understood and her heart ached so much.</p>
