<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Looking at his happy face, Mo Suqing couldn’t help but&nbsp;tease&nbsp;him a little.</p>
 <p>She put on a solemn expression and said, “Yeah, you are dreaming. I lied. It’s just your fantasy.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue looked both puzzled and disappointed.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing didn’t have the heart to mess with him any longer, so she reached into her purse and pulled out the test result.</p>
 <p>“I’m kidding! Don’t look like that. I’m really pregnant. I came here because I can’t wait to tell you this!”</p>
 <p>She blinked mischievously.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue had a dumb look on his face. In the end, what she had told him at first was true, then she decided to fool him a little! He tickled her on the waist.</p>
 <p>“Humph! You fooled me? I’m going to punish you!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing giggled and wriggled on his lap. “Honey, I’m sorry! I won’t fool you anymore. Stop it! You are killing me!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing had a tinkling bell of a laugh, so Lin Ran could hear it clearly outside. He rubbed his nose in embarrassment. <em>I’m not hearing anything… I’m not hearing anything…</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue stopped tickling her. His wife was pregnant. He must not go too far. Otherwise, the baby would protest!</p>
 <p>After they enjoyed some alone time, Lin Ran knocked.</p>
 <p>“Boss, ten minutes has passed. The managers are still waiting for you in the meeting room.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue hated to let go of his beautiful wife, so he said, “Tell them that we will pick up where we left off the morning on the day after tomorrow. The rest of the meeting is canceled for today.”</p>
 <p><em>Boss, where’s your principle?</em></p>
 <p>“Honey…” Mo Suqing chuckled in a low voice.</p>
 <p>“Yes?” Ye Zhongjue answered, feeling incredibly soft at the sound of her sweet, gentle call.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing could almost see his eyebrows arch as he said the word “yes.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing, afraid he would tickle her again – God knows how sensitive her waist was – when she said what she had in mind, grabbed his hands and asked in an innocent tone, “Honey, where’s your principle?”</p>
 <p>“Principle? What is that?” Ye Zhongjue asked, his expression serious.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing choked on her own saliva.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue patted her back. <em>What a silly</em><em>&nbsp;girl</em><em>, to get choked on nothing!&nbsp;</em>he thought in defeat.</p>
 <p>The good news delighted Ye Zhongjue so much, he decided he would skip work for the rest of the day and took his wife out for celebration.</p>
 <p>Watching the two of them enter the elevator, Lin Ran beamed happily. On the other hand, Jian Jie stared after them with jealous eyes and such intensity, she might well bore two holes in the elevator.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing and Ye Zhongjue went to Silk Empire International for a grand lunch before taking a short walk and going to the movies.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue let her pick anything she would like to watch. She eagerly chose a sci-fi blockbuster.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue gaped at her in awe. <em>Why is my wife so different from other men’s wives? While others would select a romance, my wife decided she would go for a sci-fi.</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue contemplated. <em>It must be a boy she’s carrying. He is controlling her mind. That must be it!</em></p>
 <p>After watching the movie, they went home.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was in an elated mood all day. Ye Zhongjue had never spent so much time with her. He was always very busy. Sometimes, he would even work at weekends, although he did endeavor to go home as early as possible.</p>
 <p>Even so, they had almost never&nbsp;gone on a date aside from&nbsp;having dinner at a restaurant once in a while.</p>
 <p>She had a really wonderful time today, but she was also exhausted.</p>
 <p>When Ye Zhongjue emerged from the shower, Mo Suqing had&nbsp;already&nbsp;fallen asleep. There was a smile on her face and she would smack her lips from time to time like a child.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue gazed at her tenderly. He had never known he could love someone so much.</p>
 <p>The next morning, Mo Suqing was leaving for Leng Xiyao’s place when Ye Zhongjue stopped her. “Honey, what about me?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing frowned at his hand on her wrist. Then, a mischievous smile appeared on her face.</p>
 <p>“You can go with Ceng Hanyu. Didn’t he say he would attend the party?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue gave her a sullen look. “Honey, I can’t believe you would send me off to a guy!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing laughed. “Be good, okay? Send me to Yao’s place first and go to find Ceng Hanyu before you go to the party together. Someone once said, ‘Love between men and women is for the purpose of reproduction only, while love between the same sex is true love.’”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s handsome face darkened. <em>What the hell?</em></p>
 <p>“Let’s go.&nbsp;I’ll take you to Leng Xiyao’s house first. Also, I’m not interested in Ceng Hanyu. For me, humans can be divided into two categories only: Mo Suqing vs. those who are not Mo Suqing. Got it?”</p>
 <p>Then, Ye Zhongjue took her hand and headed out.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing watched his tall figure and felt very sweet. <em>I’m so weak to be easily moved by him all the time!</em></p>
 <p>After they arrived at their destination, Mo Suqing walked past the gate while Ye Zhongjue drove away. Mo Suqing immediately saw Leng Xiyao&nbsp;standing on the balcony and watching her.</p>
 <p>Yes, Leng Xiyao was standing!</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing quickly climbed the stairs to the second floor. Leng Xiyao was walking toward her in a white dress.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing gaped at her. Although she knew the girl had mostly recovered and was more or less pretending she hadn’t, she didn’t realize she could be up and about already.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao smiled self-mockingly.</p>
 <p>“Suqing, you look positively surprised. You see, I can’t possibly sit in a wheelchair in Uncle’s engagement ceremony, now can I? That wouldn’t be pretty. Speaking of which, how do I look? Uncle used to say I look the prettiest in a white dress.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s eyes were brimming with tears. It pained her a lot to see Yao like this.</p>
 <p>“Yao, stop saying those things. Let’s go to the hotel now.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao nodded smilingly. She looked very calm.</p>
 <p>“You’re right. Suqing, don’t worry about me. I have thought this through. He’s my uncle. The way I feel about him will never be approved by people. If so, it would be better if he marries someone else and cuts off my vain hope for good. From now on, I’ll stop thinking about those impractical things. Don’t worry, I won’t make a scene today. I have never been so clear-headed before.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing looked away. Though the girl said she was clear-headed, she was exuding with sadness.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing took her hand. “Let’s go!”</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun and An Huilin were greeting the guests at the gate of the Hilton Hotel.</p>
 <p>An Huilin had the biggest smile on her face. She was utterly flushed with happiness.</p>
 <p>When Leng Haoyun saw Mo Suqing get off the car, he thought she had come with Ye Zhongjue. He had never planned to tell Leng Xiyao about the engagement, let alone wanted her to attend the party. For him, it was just a ceremony.</p>
 <p>However, Mo Suqing walked around the car and opened the door on the other side.</p>
 <p>A figure in a white dress emerged from it. Leng Haoyun’s eyes dilated with shock. <em>Yao!</em></p>
 <p>Then, he shut his eyes tight. <em>She’s here. When did she start to walk? How come I didn’t know about it?</em></p>
 <p>He had planned not to let her attend the party.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao and Mo Suqing, both beaming, approached An Huilin and Leng Haoyun. Leng Xiyao was smiling ear to ear. No one could detect anything wrong in her mood.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, happy engagement day! I’ll look forward to your wedding favors!”</p>
 <p>Then, she walked inside without looking at An Huilin. Mo Suqing gave the older woman an accusatory look. She felt sorry for Yao, yet she couldn’t do anything for her.</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun had gone completely rigid on the spot, unable to move.</p>
 <p>Frowning, An Huilin nudged him lightly.</p>
 <p>“Haoyun, another group of guests is coming. Put yourself together!”</p>
 <p>She was having a hard time maintaining her smile, but she was still trying. As long as she could survive today, she would be engaged with Leng Haoyun. She would never have to be intimidated by Leng Xiyao’s existence anymore!</p>
 <p>Leng Haoyun glanced at her and said, “I’m a bit tired. You can greet the rest of the guests by yourself.”</p>
 <p>Then, he walked away without waiting for a reply.</p>
 <p>An Huilin’s cheeks heated up. However, guests were coming and she forced herself to stay right where she was instead of running after Leng Haoyun. <em>Fine! Everything will be alright after today. I can handle this alone.</em></p>
 <p>An Zhenguo was the next to arrive. Two black-clad bodyguards opened the door for him to get off the car and he slowly approached An Huilin. “Huilin,” he said affably, “very nice. Leng Haoyun’s company is getting stronger and stronger these days. You have found yourself a good husband.”</p>
 <p>An Huilin smiled humbly. “Uncle, you’re kidding! He’s much younger than you. Of course your kingdom is much stronger than his.”</p>
 <p>An Zhenguo chuckled. Even though his hair had gone completely grey, he looked fit and in good shape.</p>
 <p>An Zhenguo then walked inside. An Huilin narrowed her eyes at him. The old man hadn’t started to look for candidates to take over the An Group; he was still hoping to find his granddaughter, who had got lost since she was little.<em>&nbsp;You are looking for a needle in a haystack! How can you possibly find her again?</em></p>
 <p>An Huilin turned around and greeted the next guests.</p>
 <p>The party had begun, but the groom-to-be was nowhere to be found.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue and Ceng Hanyu had already arrived and were talking near the patio.</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu teased, “Now you think of me after your wife abandoned you?”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue gave him a cold look. “I feel no difference with or without you.”</p>
 <p>Ceng Hanyu bristled. <em>No difference, huh? Then why did you come to me? This contemptuous attitude is outrageous!</em></p>
 <p>“Well, if that’s the case, why don’t you go find your honey? See if she’ll pay you any attention,” he said.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue sipped at his wine and leaned against the window, looking pensive.</p>
 <p>He and Mo Suqing were going to have a child now, but his parents hadn’t accepted her. And he hadn’t been able to find Ye Mingke, either. The thing mustn’t be delayed any longer.</p>
 <p>Worse comes to the worst, he would have to talk to his father again.</p>
