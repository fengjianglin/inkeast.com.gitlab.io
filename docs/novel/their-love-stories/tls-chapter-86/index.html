<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>The next morning, Mo Suqing was still asleep.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Guan Zixuan had got up early and asked Yuan to prepare some breakfast. Yesterday, he had also sent for a doctor to check if she was alright. The doctor said she had been too worked up when she passed out.</p>
 <p>However, there was no need to worry about her health, as long as she got some rest.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan’s beautiful eyes twinkled as he recalled how miserable she had looked when he took her home and how she and Leng Xiyao were arguing.</p>
 <p>He didn’t know what had happened, but he could see that she was really upset. What could possibly have happened that turned a person into such a miserable creature?</p>
 <p>He remembered when he first met Mo Suqing that she had given him the impression of a clever and bright woman.</p>
 <p>Of course, he was mad at her at first because he thought she had lied to him. But then, after he found out the truth at the hotpot place, he became a little baffled and even a bit angry. Angry about what? He didn’t know the answer himself.</p>
 <p>Usually, women loved to chase after him and would definitely not want him to misunderstand them.</p>
 <p>On the contrary, Mo Suqing not only had not wanted to clear up the misunderstanding, but she had also not cared at all if he misunderstood her. Moreover, she had tried to give him a wide berth. This really pissed him off!</p>
 <p>But it piqued his curiosity about her, too.</p>
 <p><em>The woman is very interesting!</em></p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan opened the door of the room where she was staying. She had woken up.</p>
 <p>However, she just sat there on the bed like a soulless wooden puppet, staring into space.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan could not link this woman to the one he had met at the airport restroom and who had threatened him to buy some sanitary napkins for her.</p>
 <p>Somehow, he felt a little annoyed.</p>
 <p><em>Who did this to her?</em></p>
 <p><em>Is it Leng Xiyao or someone else?</em></p>
 <p>Suddenly, a phone began to ring.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan found that it was Mo Suqing’s phone that was ringing. Her phone had not stopped ringing after he took her home yesterday.</p>
 <p>Therefore, he had turned it off. He turned it on again when he checked on her earlier in the morning, not wanting her to miss important calls.</p>
 <p>He didn’t know why he was being kind to her. Not only had he brought her, practically a stranger to him, home, he had also looked after her. <em>I should get a Good Man of the Year title!</em></p>
 <p>The phone was still ringing nonstop; Mo Suqing had no intention&nbsp;of&nbsp;picking&nbsp;it up.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan, sick of it, walked over and took a look at the caller ID.</p>
 <p>It was Leng Xiyao.</p>
 <p><em>It is her!&nbsp;</em>Guan Zixuan glanced at a spiritless Mo Suqing and picked up the phone.</p>
 <p>Then, he walked out of the room and answered it on the balcony.</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao felt immense relief when the phone was finally picked up.</p>
 <p>“Suqing,” she said in a remorseful and grievous voice. “You finally picked up! You didn’t reply&nbsp;to&nbsp;my WeChat message and your phone was off when I called you. I thought you would never talk to me!”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao was so earnest, Guan Zixuan really didn’t want to spoil her happiness.</p>
 <p>However, he couldn’t just listen to her apology that was directed to Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>“Ahem…” Guan Zixuan cleared his throat.</p>
 <p>“Mo Suqing doesn’t want to answer her phone right now. I saw it was you who called, so I picked it up. What do you want?”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao was surprised to hear it was not Suqing at all. Her face fell, sadness and sorrow written all over it.</p>
 <p>“She&nbsp;really&nbsp;doesn’t want to talk to me?”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan hadn’t the heart to say anything cruel to her, so he replied after a moment, “Well, she’s not in a good mood now. But I think she will get better after a couple of days. She will talk to you after she calms down, I think.”</p>
 <p>Then, he remembered why he had answered the phone in the first place and asked, “So why did you call?”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao hesitated, like she didn’t know if she would like to tell him about it.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan turned his eyes to the garden below and said impatiently, “I’m going to hang up if you don’t want to say it!”</p>
 <p>“Wait!” Leng Xiyao replied. “Something happened today, so I have helped her take a day off. Tell her not to go to work! Also, I’ll go see her tomorrow and the day after that; it’s the weekend.”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan pursed his lips and said, “Whatever!”</p>
 <p>He continued, “And don’t call her anymore. I don’t want to say it, but I don’t think she’ll answer the phone if you call. To stabilize her mood and to protect myself, I hope you don’t mind that I’m going to turn off her phone hereafter! But I’ll give you my number, which is…”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao hastened to write it down. Then, she asked, “I can see the point of stabilizing her mood, but what about the shit about protecting yourself?”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan replied matter-of-factly, “Hey, have you forgotten what you two have done in August Hasn't Ended Yet? You were so violent! I do not want to face the risk of letting people know I am beaten in my own house, by a woman! I have my reputation to think about, you know.”</p>
 <p>Leng Xiyao laughed despite her situation. She had never thought the guy who always acted sincere and serious on screen was quite funny in private.</p>
 <p>She was still very thankful for his help the other night. Since then, she had looked at him with different eyes, and it was also why she was willing to put Mo Suqing into his care.</p>
 <p>“Anyway, I want to thank you for helping us again. After everything settles and returns back to normal, Suqing and I will treat you to dinner!”</p>
 <p>“Great. I’ll look forward to it!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan hung up and walked back into the house in his careless way.</p>
 <p>Yuan was standing by the door to the guestroom and gaping at Mo Suqing with a widened mouth.</p>
 <p>Hearing a rustle, he turned around to look at Guan Zixuan with a shocked expression.</p>
 <p>“Boss, why is she still here?”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan gave him an embarrassed look and scratched his nose. <em>Humph! What is that supposed to mean?</em></p>
 <p>When he took Mo Suqing home yesterday, Yuan had told him to ask Mo Suqing to leave once she woke up, in case he would bring some unnecessary trouble to himself. Even though the committee of Shallow Sea Area put a lot of emphasis on the villa owners’ privacy, sometimes you couldn’t keep out all the trouble-makers.</p>
 <p>However, he just couldn’t bring himself to ask Mo Suqing to leave when she was in this condition.</p>
 <p>Moreover, he found himself actually reluctant to do so.</p>
 <p>“Boss, it is because of her that you asked me to prepare so much breakfast, right?” Yuan’s face clouded, which puzzled Guan Zixuan.</p>
 <p>Usually, Yuan didn’t care much about his personal affairs or do anything out of line.</p>
 <p>But why was he acting like he cared a great deal about the fact that Mo Suqing was in his house?</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan cleared his throat and turned toward the window.</p>
 <p>“It’s a good day. Let’s have breakfast.”</p>
 <p>Yuan said, “Boss, you are not changing the subject! I don’t intend to interfere with your personal affairs, but god knows how many scandals you have had! We don’t need yet another set of headlines that put you in a negative light.”</p>
 <p>“Yet another set of headlines that put me in a negative light?” Guan Zixuan frowned at him.</p>
 <p>Yuan sighed heavily and handed the rolled-up newspaper in his hand to Guan Zixuan.</p>
 <p>“Take a look yourself!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan spread out the paper and saw huge letters staring up at him.</p>
 <p>There were three whole pages that held three different stories, each with a saucy headline. Even Guan Zixuan felt it was too much.</p>
 <p><em>Mighty Empire: Identity of Mysterious Boss Exposed; Journalist Obsessed with Him</em></p>
 <p><em>Clown Character: Journalist Covets After the Rich and Harms Self to Win Sympathy</em></p>
 <p><em>The Unparalleled: Identity of Legendary President and His Spoiled Niece Exposed</em></p>
 <p>Accompanying each of the stories was a very suggestive picture.</p>
 <p>For the first story, it was a picture of Ye Zhongjue holding Mo Suqing in his arms. Mo Suqing’s face was obscured, but Ye Zhongjue’s handsome face was very clear.</p>
 <p>It was obvious that the woman was the said obsessive journalist.</p>
 <p>The picture for the second story served to be the proof.</p>
 <p>It was a picture of Mo Suqing, who had an extreme despair and grief on her face and whose hands were horribly bloodied.</p>
 <p>Somehow, Guan Zixuan felt a sharp pang in his heart.</p>
 <p><em>The journalist is Mo Suqing!</em></p>
 <p>No wonder Yuan would react like that. Everyone would think Mo Suqing was a nobody who craved fame and anyone who got in touch with her would be implicated, not to mention a celebrity like him.</p>
 <p>It made sense that Yuan was worried. However, now he was aware of it, it only made him more concerned for her. It was impossible for him to abandon her.</p>
 <p>This, he realized, was the first time he truly wanted to protect someone.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan’s mouth curved into a smile when he read the third story.</p>
 <p><em>Leng Xiyao is the niece of the president of The Unparalleled?</em></p>
 <p><em>Ha, Interesting!&nbsp;</em>Although he had known she was no common person – he had known it the day he saved her and Mo Suqing at the pub – he hadn’t realized she would be this uncommon.</p>
 <p><em>So the wickedly beautiful man who was holding her in the picture must be Leng Haoyun, the legendary president of The Unparalleled!</em></p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan looked at the newspaper thoughtfully. Suddenly, he felt sorry for the person who had exposed the stories.</p>
 <p>The person was plain stupid to have offended Mighty Empire and The Unparalleled at the same time. They were dead meat.</p>
 <p>Never had the presidents of the two companies shown themselves on newspaper or TV. Their identities had been a mystery and they had always been mentioned by names only.</p>
 <p>It was obvious they did not want to show their faces in public. And they were certainly capable of preventing that, too.</p>
