<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>The situation took a while to sink in. Then… <em>He is Mo Suqing’s husband?&nbsp;</em>Zhang Yubin thought.</p>
 <p>Seeing his expression (he looked as if he had just swallowed a fly), Mo Suqing felt awkwardly sorry. She did&nbsp;tell&nbsp;him she was waiting for Ye Zhongjue, but he chose not to believe her.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue, his face darkened, went silent and tightly held Mo Suqing close, to the extent that her shoulder hurt a little.</p>
 <p>She knew Ye Zhongjue was really upset. He didn’t usually reveal his emotions in such an obvious way.</p>
 <p>Zhang Yubin looked at Ye Zhongjue stubbornly and asked, “Are you Suqing’s husband?” even though he already knew the answer.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing moaned inwardly. She desperately hoped Zhang Yubin would not divulge what had happened today. He did see that Ye Zhongjue looked as if he would like to kill someone, didn’t he? She needed him <em>not&nbsp;</em>to aggravate the situation.</p>
 <p>Otherwise, she had no idea how she could explain everything to Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>“What if I am?” Ye Zhongjue gave him a look and said calmly.</p>
 <p>His tone was calm, but there was a hard edge to it.</p>
 <p>Zhang Yubin was a little taken aback. “Even so, you cannot curtail her freedom!” he said furiously.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue gave him an eerie smile. Mo Suqing had never seen him like that – arrogant, condescending, as if the whole world was under his thumb.</p>
 <p>“What if I do? What are you going to do about it?”</p>
 <p>Zhang Yubin almost choked. He did not expect him to be this high-handed and dictatorial.</p>
 <p>“Don’t you know there is such a thing called a divorce, other than a marriage?” he retorted on an impulse.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue, not wanting to waste any more time on this, controlled his anger and said, “Which reminds me there will still be a lot of annoying pursuers even if one gets married.”</p>
 <p>Zhang Yubin was the offspring of a rich entrepreneur, so he was not used to this kind of humiliation. He was about to say something filthy, but Ye Zhongjue had just turned and walked away with Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>He pounded the window of a car nearby in his rage, but it only made his hand hurt like hell. His face distorted with pain.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue saw what he had done in the rear-view mirror. He smirked contemptuously.</p>
 <p>Although the guy made him a little uncomfortable, he did not worry too much about a secondary character like him. Mo Suqing was his; no one should covet her.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue had not said anything after they got on the car.</p>
 <p>The atmosphere was extremely oppressive. Mo Suqing had considered coming clean with him about the Guan Zixuan incident in case he found out about it himself and had one more reason to be upset.</p>
 <p>Subconsciously, she found that she did not want him to&nbsp;misunderstand.</p>
 <p>However, after what had just happened and how he wouldn’t talk to her, she did not have the courage to bring it up.</p>
 <p>The two of them arrived at their building without a single word spoken along the way.</p>
 <p>After getting off the car, Ye Zhongjue went upstairs without looking at her. Mo Suqing knew he was angry, but she did not know what to say. The two of them still did not say anything to each other on the way up to their apartment.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue immediately went to his study after they got home.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing tossed her purse casually on the sofa. Staring at the closed door to the study, she had a lost expression on her face. It was difficult to read her mind.</p>
 <p>After a while, she shook her head and went to change into more casual clothes.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing walked into the clean and tidy kitchen, but did not know how to set about cooking.</p>
 <p>She picked up the scallion and furrowed her brow at the pot. What should she cook?</p>
 <p>Come to think of it, she was really bad at cooking. <em>What a clumsy woman I am</em>. <em>It’s all because I eat out too often, I guess.</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing contemplated for a while, still not knowing what she could possibly cook up that was delectable enough.</p>
 <p>She walked out of the kitchen and picked up her phone to order some takeout, but stopped herself when she remembered that Ye Zhongjue had said takeout food was not hygienic the other day.</p>
 <p>She could see that he was a very hygiene-conscious person and tried to avoid unhygienic things as much as possible</p>
 <p>So, she tossed her phone back on the sofa and walked back into the kitchen.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue had been staying in the study, all alone, smoking away. The whole room was filled with smoke.</p>
 <p>He sat on the couch in a trance, looking lazily dangerous.</p>
 <p>He had no idea when&nbsp;he had last&nbsp;felt like this. He knew he was just suppressing his fury, so he dared not go out to face Mo Suqing lest he should vent his anger on her.</p>
 <p>He was very unhappy. When he saw the newspaper this morning, the only thing in his mind had been how much he would like to cut off Guan Zixuan’s hand that was on Mo Suqing’s waist. It had seemed that the picture was stinging his eyes. No one knew how irritated he had been.</p>
 <p>He spent a great deal part of the day to neutralize his feelings, so that he would not get mad when he picked Mo Suqing up after work.</p>
 <p>But then,&nbsp;the moment&nbsp;he saw Zhang Yubin pulling Mo Suqing,all his efforts were ruined with a strong feeling of jealousy.</p>
 <p>It was always clear to him that he was but someone whom Mo Suqing agreed to marry only under the condition to apply for a divorce in three years; he was not important to her.</p>
 <p>Was that why she felt it&nbsp;was&nbsp;appropriate to get herself involved in a scandal with Guan Zixuan and flirt with anyone she saw fit without needing to give him an explanation?</p>
 <p>He was aware of his own dictatorship and fierce love for her, and he feared she would be scared.</p>
 <p>But, on the other hand, he was really uncomfortable. He knew she did not care about him as much as he cared about her,&nbsp;yet&nbsp;he could not help hoping that she might one day.</p>
 <p>These conflicting feelings drove him crazy.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing finally cooked up a table of dishes. Looking at the weird-looking lumps that was their dinner, she comforted herself that it was not that bad. It had to be better than the unhygienic takeout!</p>
 <p>She forced herself to smile and went to the study. She knocked on the door, but he didn’t answer it.</p>
 <p>She called out, “Ye Zhongjue, dinner is ready. Come out!”</p>
 <p>Still, there was no reply.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing went to fetch the key and opened the door.</p>
 <p>A wall of smoke hit her head-on. She could barely open her eyes. She covered her mouth and coughed a few times while opening the door even wider. Then, she quickly went over to the window and opened it as well.</p>
 <p>Watching the slumped figure on the couch, she said in a worried tone, “Ye Zhongjue, are you all right? Is it because of…”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue interrupted her in mid-sentence, “No it isn’t. It is&nbsp;work related!”</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong? What happened at work?”</p>
 <p>“Nothing important!” It was obvious Ye Zhongjue didn’t want to discuss it with Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing moved her mouth silently. “Well, let’s have dinner then,” she said.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue sat up, snuffed out the cigarette, and walked out of the room.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing stared at his desolate, cold figure, feeling frustrated. She knew what was wrong, but apparently Ye Zhongjue was not in a talkative mood.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing suddenly felt very tired.</p>
 <p>She walked out of the study and found that Ye Zhongjue was already having dinner.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing sat down and started to eat. She almost spat out the food. It was awfully salty! How much salt had she added?</p>
 <p>She tried another dish and another. Every one of them tasted horrible.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was banging her head in her mind. <em>What did I make? A table of disgusting, distasteful non-food?</em></p>
 <p>However, Ye Zhongjue was eating like he had no taste buds.</p>
 <p>She grabbed his hand which was about to take another mouthful of food. “No! I’ll throw it away and we can order some takeout.”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue finally raised his head and looked her in the eye.</p>
 <p>“You can have the takeout; I’ll have this.”</p>
 <p>Then, he freed his hand and picked up some food with the chopsticks.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing felt downcast. She shut her mouth and began to have her dinner that she forced down her throat valiantly even though it was very bad-tasting.</p>
 <p>The atmosphere of the meal was very oppressive and uneasy, at least for Mo Suqing. She knew the man across from her was fuming, but every time she tried to say or ask something, he would stop her resolutely, as if he hated the idea of speaking to her. Mo Suqing felt extremely frustrated and indescribably restless.</p>
 <p>After dinner, Ye Zhongjue stood up and walked into the bedroom.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing sat in front of the dining table, her mood heavy. She could hear splashing sounds coming from the bathroom.</p>
 <p>Eventually, she stood up and took the dirty dishes to the sink.</p>
 <p>After tidying up the kitchen, she felt exhausted both physically and mentally.</p>
 <p>She lay down on the sofa and did not want to move at all. She knew she was probably the reason behind Ye Zhongjue’s behavior, but she had no idea how to resolve the situation.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue emerged from the bathroom, his mind not much clearer.</p>
 <p>He walked over to Mo Suqing’s nightstand to get the hair-dryer.</p>
 <p>He didn’t find one. Instead, a bottle of contraceptives was lying there quietly.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s face darkened instantly.</p>
 <p>It was one thing he knew Mo Suqing viewed their marriage as an exchange of mutual interest; it was quite another when he saw the physical evidence. Hurt, anger and discomfort that were like nothing of his own surged through his body.</p>
 <p><em>She is afraid of getting pregnant. Because she doesn’t want to have anything to do with me three years later.</em></p>
 <p>A madness took him.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing noticed the sounds from the bathroom had quieted down. She got up dispiritedly and walked toward their room.</p>
 <p>She had barely opened the door when she was pulled very hard into the room.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing had no time to react when Ye Zhongjue kissed her hard on the mouth as if he was trying to suck away all the air in her lungs. He was so rough the kiss felt almost like biting.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue felt like shit. This was the only way he could release his anger and discontent.</p>
 <p>He did not want to say anything that could drive Mo Suqing away, but if he chose not&nbsp;to&nbsp;say anything at all, there was no way he could pretend everything was fine and ignore the negative emotions in his heart.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing felt her lips seem to be bleeding. She pushed Ye Zhongjue hard and protested, “My lips… They hurt!”</p>
 <p>However, it was as if Ye Zhongjue had gone deaf. His eye red, he hugged Mo Suqing tightly and kissed her mercilessly, like he was trying to merge their bodies together.</p>
 <p>At first, Mo Suqing struggled and resisted. Then, she could see that Ye Zhongjue was also struggling. There was hopelessness in his eyes like those of a cornered animal. Suddenly, she lost all her power.</p>
 <p>She remembered she herself carried the same look when her mother died.</p>
