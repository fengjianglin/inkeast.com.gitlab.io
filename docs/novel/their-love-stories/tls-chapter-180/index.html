<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Mo Suqing was exasperated. <em>He’s doing it on purpose! I don’t believe he doesn’t know what I’m talking about.</em></p>
 <p>She then tried to look more vicious as she spoke. “You had a gunshot wound, so you’re definitely no angel. Not afraid I’ll tell others about what happened?”</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng was tickled. He found her very amusing. If she had threatened ruffians like this, they would likely just stare at her in disbelief.</p>
 <p>“Fine. What do I need to do for you to keep it a secret?”</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng looked at her expectantly. After a moment of contemplation, Mo Suqing answered, “Just don’t tell anyone about what happened that night!”</p>
 <p>“Which night are you talking about? Why don’t I remember anything...” Su Jincheng playfully asked.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing was absolutely maddened now. She could murder this man. <em>He’s so bothersome!</em></p>
 <p>“Sure you won’t regret this?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing asked the question through gritted teeth, as if she was about to unleash her ultimate attack on him. Su Jincheng observed her, slightly puzzled at her tone.</p>
 <p>While he was still rather bemused, he felt a piercing pain in his left foot. His jaw clenched at the sudden pain. <em>This woman is really vicious! My foot!</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing gave him a smug look before she turned to leave.</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng scratched his nose, amused.<em>&nbsp;She’s really adorable and interesting!</em></p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was not happy that they were dancing so closely together, and he wanted to walk over to stop them when he saw Mo Suqing turn back gracefully and return to him.</p>
 <p>Seeing her return made the expression on Ye Zhongjue’s face a little less dreadful, but the stormy aura around him did not abate.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing sat beside him and took his arm teasingly.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be mad, dear. I did that to take revenge for you, and I’ve made Su Jincheng wish he was dead!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing threw her head back as she laughed, but she saw Su Jincheng approaching fast.</p>
 <p>The smile on her froze immediately and she started coughing, as if something was stuck in her throat.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue quickly patted her on the back, shooting a cold glare at Su Jincheng at the same time.</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng put on an innocent expression. He had just gotten stomped on, but he’s seen as the bad guy now!</p>
 <p><em>The world is a scary place!</em></p>
 <p>After Ye Zhongjue led Mo Suqing away from the sofa, Su Jincheng did not approach them again.</p>
 <p>On the way back, Ye Zhongjue still felt ticked off, so he decided to bring this up to Mo Suqing.</p>
 <p>“Why did you dance with Su Jincheng? Don’t you know that I hate him?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing shook her head innocently. “It was the first time I met him. I didn’t know you hated him!”</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue stepped on the brakes and looked at Mo Suqing with incredulity.</p>
 <p><em>Does she really want to agitate me like this?</em></p>
 <p>Mo Suqing knew he was upset, so she quickly coaxed him.</p>
 <p>“I’m at fault, dear!”</p>
 <p>“What did you do?”</p>
 <p>“I shouldn’t have danced with Su Jincheng!”</p>
 <p>“Do you dare to do it again?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t!”</p>
 <p>“Then tell me, why did you dance with him today?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing answered with excitement. “To get revenge for you!”</p>
 <p>“Revenge?” Ye Zhongjue looked at her questioningly, sure that she was just spouting nonsense again.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing then explained. “Didn’t he challenge you on purpose? So I stepped on his foot while we were dancing, and then… I ran away!”</p>
 <p>She looked expectantly at Ye Zhongjue. Her face was smug, as if she was waiting for him to shower her with compliments!</p>
 <p>Speechless, Ye Zhongjue glanced at her, tenderness in his eyes. <em>So silly!</em></p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan came over after Ye Zhongjue left for work the next day.</p>
 <p>Curious, Mo Suqing asked, “Don’t you have any work these days? You seem to have a lot of time!”</p>
 <p>What she did not know was that Guan Zixuan had either rejected the jobs or rescheduled them to be at night so that he could make time to keep her company.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan gestured with raised palms. “Well, that’s because I’m a top actor. Others have to take on a few jobs to get what I earn with just one!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing sneered at him. “I can’t believe you just said that with a straight face. You’re really the world number one narcissist!”</p>
 <p>“I can’t help being this good-looking!” Guan Zixuan answered playfully.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing laughed. “Let’s go downstairs and take a walk. I’m about to rot from staying at home all day!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan nodded and went to get a thick jacket for her.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing did not expect that she would meet Su Jincheng downstairs.</p>
 <p>She turned away immediately as she saw the man approach.</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng spoke mischievously. “Miss Mo, why are you running away like a timid mouse when you see me? Are you afraid of me?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing stiffened before turning to look at the man. “I’m just lamenting at the fact that I didn’t choose the right time of day to leave the house, and I’ve bumped into someone I don’t wish to see!”</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng sniggered. “Miss Mo, that someone must be me then!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing answered with impatience, “Obviously!”</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng twisted her words on purpose. “Why don’t you want to see me? Miss Mo, you’re my saviour and I’m elated to see you!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan could tell that something was amiss, so he tugged at Mo Suqing, asking, “Who’s that?”</p>
 <p>“Someone I don’t know!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan’s brows creased, but he remained silent.</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng, however, continued talking. “Miss Mo, why don’t you recognize me? You know that day...”</p>
 <p>Before he could say anymore, Mo Suqing rushed up and cupped his mouth with her hands, trying to stop him from saying anything else.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan went forward to support her quickly. “Suqing, be careful, the baby!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing then realized that she had acted too impulsively. She had to take proper care of the baby in her! Even though she had a tiny baby bump now, she seemed to forget the fact that she was pregnant rather often. Instead, it was Guan Zixuan and Ye Zhongjue who were always trying to keep her out of harm’s way.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing waved at him. “It’s fine. I have something I need to tell this man, so just wait for me there!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan glanced at her, but relented eventually as he walked away to give them some space.</p>
 <p>The two of them seemed to be in deep discussion, and he could not help but wonder what they were talking about.</p>
 <p>Once Mo Suqing was sure that Guan Zixuan was out of earshot, she glared at Su Jincheng angrily.</p>
 <p>“Su Jincheng, what on earth are you trying to do?”</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng chuckled. “Nothing. Is this your only question for me?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing frowned. “Then why are you here? It can’t possibly be a coincidence, can it!”</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng answered her seriously this time. “I think it’s time you know this too. I stay at Number 11 at Shallow Sea. Why else would I have left your place if I was so heavily injured!”</p>
 <p>Though he did not sound like he was making it up, Mo Suqing was still unsatisfied with his explanation. She thus said, “If that’s the case, then let’s not see each other again. Bye bye!”</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng grabbed her before she could leave. She shot him an angry glare. “What now?”</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng smiled. “I have a bad habit of always returning a favor. I’d feel that it isn’t right if I don’t repay the debt, and I’d start spouting nonsense...”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing fumed at this. <em>What does he want now!</em></p>
 <p>“Just tell me what you want, I can even address you as Master. Please stop pestering me like this, I can’t take it, Big Brother!”</p>
 <p>At a loss for words, Su Jincheng laughed. “Are you going to address me as Master or Big Brother? Just settle on one!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing stomped on his foot. “What do you want?”</p>
 <p>Seeing how infuriated she was, Su Jincheng decided to stop being so cheeky.</p>
 <p>“I’m telling the truth. As long as you allow me to repay the debt, I won’t pester or trouble you ever again, and I won’t tell anyone about that night either!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing frowned at him. <em>I think I’m the unluckiest person on earth. Why am I the one being threatened after helping this guy?</em></p>
 <p>“How do you wish to repay it?”</p>
 <p>Su Jincheng pointed at Guan Zixuan. “Divert his attention tomorrow, and I’ll teach you some self-defense. You’ll then be able to protect yourself and fight back! Once you’ve learnt the techniques, I promise I won’t ever bring that up again.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing nodded. “Okay, I’ll go look for you tomorrow. I’m leaving now!”</p>
 <p>After they had reached an agreement, he looked at her departing figure as she left. His expression darkened.</p>
 <p>She was really kind, and he was no angel, but he will try his best to repay his debt.</p>
 <p>Her doorbell rang shortly after Mo Suqing returned home.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan had just gone out to buy some duck for her, and since she was craving for spicy food recently, Ye Zhongjue would also bring her some food when he returned.</p>
 <p>Therefore, she thought it was Su Jincheng at the door.</p>
 <p>She opened the door and lashed out immediately. “What do you want!”</p>
 <p>To her surprise, it was An Huilin.</p>
 <p>After she realized who it was, she quickly slammed the door shut with a loud bang.</p>
 <p><em>What bad luck! Why do I keep meeting the people I don’t wish to see!</em></p>
 <p>“Mo Suqing, open the door please. I have something to tell you. Could you open the door first?”</p>
 <p>Irritated by her incessant knocking, Mo Suqing opened the door. “You have the cheek to come to me, An Huilin? Get lost. The sight of you disgusts me!”</p>
 <p>An Huilin was crossed, but her anger quickly subsided once she thought of Leng Haoyun.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s bark was worse than her bite, and she had not offended An Huilin either. Thus, An Huilin was able to control her temper rather well.</p>
 <p>“Mo Suqing, please help me out. I heard that Leng Haoyun came to you earlier. What did you tell him? Why is he acting like that now!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing did not wish to answer An Huilin, but she had indeed met Leng Haoyun yesterday. He looked pretty fine to her, so she had no idea what An Huilin was going on about.</p>
