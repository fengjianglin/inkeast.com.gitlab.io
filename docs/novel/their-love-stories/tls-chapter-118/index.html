<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Mo Zhenfeng quickly said, “Suqing, don’t be so impulsive! I’m just asking if you and Zhongjue have time to come home for&nbsp;a simple meal! Why&nbsp;are you this angry? If you don’t want to tell me, I’ll stop pressing, okay?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing listened coldly to her father trying desperately to placate her, so that she wouldn’t divorce Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing did not say a word, so Mo Zhenfeng asked tentatively, “Suqing, how are you two getting along recently?&nbsp;What they’re reporting on the news&nbsp;isn’t true,&nbsp;right?”</p>
 <p>At the mention of the news, Mo Suqing finally went berserk. <em>What kind of a father is he?</em></p>
 <p>He was always treating her like a pawn. If she and Ye Zhongjue were getting along, he could profit from it. But what if they weren’t? Was he going to send Mo Sulian to seduce Ye Zhongjue instead?</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing felt rage surging in her, but there was nowhere she could vent it.</p>
 <p>“I call you a father out of respect, so please don’t degrade yourself by doing something even your daughter feels contemptuous of! Plus…”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s tone became sarcastic, “You have no right to call him ‘Zhongjue’! He is the president of Mighty Empire, for crying out loud! You are just the president of a small company. He will not see you as an equal.”</p>
 <p>Mo Zhenfeng’s tone turned sour, too. “What? He is married to my daughter, but I can’t call him by his name? It’s not like he’ll lose anything!”</p>
 <p>“Daughter, you said?” Mo Suqing laughed harshly. “Am I still your daughter? Do you still see me as your daughter? What kind of father would use his daughter like you? Since mom passed away, you have never seen me as your daughter! All you can see is money. You are no longer the father I used to respect and love!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing hung up and then turned off the phone. She did not want to hear his voice again.</p>
 <p>She sat on the sofa sullenly, her chest heaving out of fury.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the doorbell rang.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing frowned. <em>Who&nbsp;</em><em>would</em><em>&nbsp;be at her door at such an hour?</em></p>
 <p>She walked over and peered through the peephole. <em>Didn’t he just leave? Why is he back?</em></p>
 <p>Yes, it was Guan Zixuan standing at her door.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing opened her door and looked at him quizzically. “Didn’t you just leave? Why are you back again?”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan’s eyes twinkled. He smiled and said, “You have to take me in tonight. I have nowhere to go.”</p>
 <p>He shrugged and spread his arms. Mo Suqing gave him a puzzled look. “Well, come inside first. What’s up? I thought you were going to stay in a hotel.”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan’s expression was hard to read. He replied, “There are paparazzi out there. I am sensitive to this kind of thing, and I immediately felt I was being watched when I went downstairs. Therefore, I came back! We have lived together before when you stayed in my villa, so you don’t have to worry I’ll do anything inappropriate.”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan teased.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing rolled her eyes at him. Since there were journalists right outside and he couldn’t go back to his house, she must let him stay. After all, he had taken her in when she was nowhere to go.</p>
 <p>“Alright! You go to sleep on the bed. I’ll sleep on the sofa.”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan arched his eyebrows. “Are you giving me a chance to play the role of a hard case? If I am invited to both your house and your bed, I would probably be invited into your panties, too!”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan smiled. Mo Suqing stared at him in exasperation. “The sofa is too small for you, okay? But if you want to sleep on it, I’m not going to stop you.”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan was still smiling at her. “Really? Great! I’ll sleep on the floor!”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing looked at him, startled.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan said, “What? Is it not okay? You don’t expect a gentleman like me to sleep on the bed while you, a woman, sleep on the floor, do you?”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing looked at him, defeated. <em>He cannot say more than three sentences in a row without joking and messing around!</em></p>
 <p>“Fine. Whatever. I don’t care.”</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing went to fetch the blanket and mattress in the closet and tossed them to Guan Zixuan, who was still standing on the&nbsp;side.</p>
 <p>“As you can see, my place is small. Sleep wherever you feel like, super star. I don’t care.”</p>
 <p>Then, she went to the bathroom to take a shower.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan watched her walk away. He knew he had played a rotten trick, but he couldn’t help it when he saw Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>There were no paparazzi downstairs. However, he did notice a man standing nearby and watching Mo Suqing’s apartment.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue was wearing black clothes and almost melted into the night. If it was not for the tiny flame from his cigarette, Guan Zixuan would never have seen him.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue had been leaning against the wall with one hand in his pocket and the other hand holding the cigarette and looking up at where Mo Suqing’s apartment was. He just watched it in silence, deep in thoughts.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan had concealed himself the moment he saw Ye Zhongjue.</p>
 <p>Then, after some deliberation, he decided to go back.</p>
 <p>He knew it was a little unethical, but he would rather give it his best shot than regret in the future, even if it meant being dishonest.</p>
 <p>After all, love was never obtained in a fair competition, was it?</p>
 <p>When Guan Zixuan came out of his reverie, Mo Suqing had taken a quick shower and emerged from the bathroom, her body wrapped tightly with a towel.</p>
 <p>She looked at the absent-minded Guan Zixuan with a weird expression on his face. “What are you thinking? I have already finished my shower and you are still standing here.”</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan chuckled. Then, he said to himself silently, <em>Suqing, I’m sorry, but I just really like you.</em></p>
 <p>He began to make his bed without replying.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing didn’t press. Somehow she felt Guan Zixuan was acting weird tonight.</p>
 <p>After Guan Zixuan took a shower, he found that Mo Suqing was already sound asleep with a book clutched in her hand.</p>
 <p>He walked over and gently drew the book out of it and then rearranged her blanket to cover her whole body before leaving the room.</p>
 <p>He knew Mo Suqing trusted him like a trustworthy friend, such as Leng Xiyao.</p>
 <p>She trusted he wouldn’t do anything untoward to her, so she agreed to take him in.</p>
 <p>True, he was not going to do anything untoward. However, he desperately wanted to know how he could turn himself from a mere friend of hers – even if he was the most trustworthy friend of hers – into her lover.</p>
 <p>He was not just fooling around, either.</p>
 <p>Guan Zixuan chuckled bitterly. Somehow, she had always thought he was fooling around or that he wasn’t being serious.</p>
 <p>The night went on.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue’s legs had gone numb, but Guan Zixuan still hadn’t appeared from the building.</p>
 <p>He waited the whole night.</p>
 <p>The next morning, he saw Guan Zixuan come out of Mo Suqing’s building. He didn’t know how to describe what he was feeling.</p>
 <p>Was it jealousy? Anger? Or resentment? He didn’t know. What he did know was that he felt his heart was riddled with holes, even though he was still hanging on.</p>
 <p>There was a dinner party in the evening.</p>
 <p>Lin Ran was supposed to go with Ye Zhongjue. However, he had some unexpected family affairs to address. Therefore, when Ye Zhongjue emerged from his office, it was Jian Jie who was waiting for him instead of Lin Ran.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue frowned.</p>
 <p>Jian Jie quickly said, “Mr. Lin has something he needs to take care of, so he can’t go tonight. As your chief secretary, I should accompany you. Moreover, if your parents see that we attend the party together, they will loosen their grip on you a bit. It’ll be a good thing to Miss Mo, too.”</p>
 <p>Watching her tender and earnest face, Ye Zhongjue nodded. The two of them went into the elevator.</p>
 <p>Ye Zhongjue kept thinking about the look on Guan Zixuan’s face when he emerged from Mo Suqing’s building. His heart hurt a lot, but he couldn’t help but think about it.</p>
 <p>He felt he was sick, very sick. However, he didn’t want to be cured.</p>
 <p>At the party, Ye Zhongjue was still out of sorts and preoccupied and not really paying attention to Jian Jie’s arm through his.</p>
 <p>Presidents from other companies surrounded him and kept flattering him, but he didn’t hear any of it.</p>
 <p>He knew he was just whiling away the time because he was afraid of being idle.</p>
 <p>When he was idle, all he could think of was Mo Suqing. Now, his head started to ache when he thought of their fight the previous day. In the end, he left the party after exchanging a few pleasantries.</p>
 <p>Jian Jie watched him&nbsp;walk&nbsp;away, her expression sullen.</p>
 <p>However,&nbsp;this&nbsp;was enough for her.</p>
 <p>For the next few days, Jian Jie was always by Ye Zhongjue’s side at all kinds of events and parties. Lin Ran’s family had some trouble that needed his attention for a few days.</p>
 <p>One day, soon after Lin Ran came in to work, he discovered that the media was talking about the divorce of the president of Mighty Empire and the news had already spread throughout the company.</p>
 <p>In the newspaper, there were pictures of Ye Zhongjue and Jian Jie appearing at various occasions and of Jian Jie having meals with Ming Jinhua and Ye Wentian.</p>
 <p>Reportedly, Ye Zhongjue had already divorced Mo Suqing. On the other hand, Jian Jie, who was close to Ye Zhongjue and had been seen showing up at different occasions with him recently, was the ideal daughter-in-law of his parents.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing felt her legs go rubbery when she saw the news.</p>
 <p>She wanted to find excuses for Ye Zhongjue. She really did. However, when she remembered that Jian Jie was his first love and that his parents liked her so much, Mo Suqing’s heart pained.</p>
 <p>If Jian Jie wasn’t his first love, Mo Suqing couldn’t think of any other reasons why she would accompany him to so many events.</p>
 <p>Mo Suqing’s sanity finally deserted her.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Mo Zhenfeng called. Mo Suqing refused to pick it up.</p>
 <p>She just held the newspaper in her hands, completely disheartened. Her colleagues were all eying her secretly.</p>
 <p>They were thinking, <em>In the face of such big news, she is acting impossibly calm!</em></p>
 <p>They saw no emotions on her face, but nobody knew how sad she was inside.</p>
