 <p>The Sidhe Queen’s situation could definitely be described as ‘gaining from misfortune’. It was precisely because of her kindness and heart of gold that she ended up paying the highest price, resulting in her current extremely weak state, which in turn allowed Zhou Weiqing to channel more Saint Energy into her, due to the extra space within her body.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Akin to a blood exchange transfusion, Zhou Weiqing had converted the Sidhe Queen’s initial massive Life Energy into pure Nebula Saint Energy.&nbsp;There was something right in the middle of the Sidhe Queen’s chest, called the Life Core. It was similar to a Heavenly Core Nucleus; the symbol of Sidhe Queens from previous generations.</p>
 <p>Not only could the Life Core bring great power, when the Sidhe Tribe was faced with the threat of extermination, the Sidhe Queen could use her life as a form of sacrifice and then use the Life Core as a seed to nurture the ancient tree of life again, while she provided it with the nutrients, thus continuing the Sidhe Tribe’s lineage.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hence, a Sidhe Queen who possessed both the Sidhe Heart and Life Core would definitely be the most supreme figure within the Sidhe Tribe. Even with the twelve elders combined, they could not be compared to her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this very moment, the outside of the Sidhe Queen’s Life Core was already completely wrapped in a layer of pure and unsophisticated Saint Energy. As the Saint Energy continued to get channeled inside, the Life Core kept secreting a tremendous amount of Life Energy. Not only did it replenish the Life Energy that the Sidhe Queen lost within a short period of time, it followed the trajectory that the Saint Energy took, and went back to Zhou Weiqing.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Life Core emitted layers of green halos that continued to spread outwards. At the same time, the green outer surface of the Life Core gradually started to peel off, similar to how layers of silkworm cocoons peeled off, and started changing into a shade of gold.</p>
 <p>Just like how the Sidhe Queen used her Sidhe Heart to treat Zhou Weiqing during actual combat but was not sure how its effect would ultimately be, similarly, while Zhou Weiqing also knew that channeling his Saint Energy into the Sidhe Queen’s body would help her recover and restore the Life Energy that she lost, he was unclear as to how big the benefits would exactly be.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Under the stimulation of Saint Energy, the Sidhe Queen’s Life Core developed some evolution-like changes. To a Heavenly God Stage powerhouse like her, this could be considered as a fundamental change.</p>
 <p>However, while things were going great for the Sidhe Queen, it somewhat became rather gloomy on Zhou Weiqing’s side. The Sidhe Queen’s body was like a bottomless pit. As his Saint Energy was very pure, he assumed that without the help of the Astral Feedback, just his Saint Energy alone should be sufficient to replenish the Life Energy that the Sidhe Queen lost in a short period of time.</p>
 <p>However in reality, this was not the case. Even though she absorbed the Astral Feedback and the huge amount of Saint Energy that Zhou Weiqing converted, the Sidhe Queen’s body still remained to be a bottomless abyss - regardless of how much Zhou Weiqing channeled into her body, it would easily accept it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>This won’t do! Is the Heavenly Energy at the Heavenly God Stage that terrifying? If she continues absorbing at this rate, I am going to die from extreme exhaustion of energy!</em></p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing thought to himself miserably, while increasing his absorption of the atmospheric energy.</p>
 <p>With the help of the nebula in the sky, he managed to replenish his Saint Energy relatively quickly. Particularly after he had completed the Dragon-Tiger Demon God Transformation, what shocked Zhou Weiqing was the fact that not only could he absorb atmospheric energy from the air, he could also absorb and convert the energy from beneath the ground, including some malevolent qi, demonic qi, etc. In the presence of his Nebula Saint Energy, all of them became nourishment instead. Due to such a support system, he was able to continue channeling more energy into the Sidhe Queen. Additionally, what put his mind at ease was the fact that he had full control over how much energy entered her body - if it took too much of a toll on him, he was be able to stop, preventing his energy from being fully exhausted.</p>
 <p>Since the Sidhe Queen had given him a lot, Zhou Weiqing was not going to stop that easily - he would try to persist till the very end. Only heaven knew the changes that the Sidhe Queen’s body was about to go through. Logically speaking, the Life Energy within her body seemed to be fully replenished a while ago, but why was she still unconscious?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing had a feeling that it was as though the Sidhe Queen had transformed into a cocoon - not only was she unconscious, she had fallen into deep slumber. That was probably because she had exhausted too much of her energy. Zhou Weiqing was not entirely sure, but for the sake of the Sidhe Queen’s safety, he could only channel his Saint Energy into her body continuously.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Time continued passing by, the extreme darkness at that part of the sky would naturally draw the attention of other people. However, fortunately, they were located at a desolate area outside the city. Hence, there were not much people who were able to notice the changes there. Even if there were cultivators amongst the people who noticed it, once they entered the sphere of Zhou Weiqing’s Nebula Celestial Territory, they would choose to flee immediately once their powers were substantially limited.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Basically, anyone who was entitled to experience the Nebula Celestial Territory should be able to recognize that it was a Heavenly God’s Celestial Territory. Nobody would dare to incur the wrath of a Heavenly God, unless he had a death wish!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, the Sidhe Tribe was the earliest to discover their problem at hand.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The other day, Zhou Weiqing had brought the Sidhe Queen with him and shuttled through space. They were gone for 3 days and 3 nights. Initially, the Sidhe Tribe did not have any huge reaction as they had faith in their queen’s powers. Hence, they silently waited.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, not long after Zhou Weiqing and the Sidhe Queen left, the leaves of the ancient Sidhe tree suddenly started falling in huge amounts.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>One must know that the Sidhe Queen resided in the ancient Sidhe tree and it was also the core of the entire Sidhe Tribe. It could be said that it was closely connected with the Sidhe Queen herself. Once anything happened to the Sidhe Queen, the ancient Sidhe tree would have some sort of reaction. Since the ancient Sidhe tree underwent such a huge change, it was clear that the Sidhe Queen was in serious trouble.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After the twelve Sidhe elders had a discussion, they managed to guess the fact that the Sidhe Queen had utilized the Sidhe Heart.</p>
 <p>How was this possible? How powerful exactly was that enemy, such that the Sidhe Queen was forced into using it! The Sidhe Tribe immediately panicked, yet they could not easily leave the sealed grounds. The seal of the sealed grounds was not only directed at the external world, but it was also directed internally as well - even the elders were not able to leave without the help of special magical weapons.</p>
 <p>The first thing they thought of was that something must have happened on Zhou Weiqing’s end. They had witnessed Zhou Weiqing’s strength and experienced the terrifying might of the Sword of the Demon God. In their eyes, Zhou Weiqing was at least on the same level as the Sidhe Queen. Zhou Weiqing must have done something to their queen, such that she had no choice but to use the Sidhe Heart.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Sidhe Tribe had always had a bad impression of the human beings, hence it was natural for them to think negatively out of habit. From their point of view, Zhou Weiqing was most likely in cahoots with the enemy. Therefore, Zhou Weiqing’s wives were treated with hostility by the Sidhe Tribe. If Shangguan Xue’er did not state that she was from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, the Sidhe Tribe would have directly taken offensive actions against her.</p>
 <p>After waiting for one more day, the Sidhe Queen was still nowhere to be seen. Hence, the Sidhe Tribe had no other option but to send two of the elders out to conduct a search by forcefully breaking the seal, in the hopes of finding the Sidhe Queen.</p>
 <p>The two elders had arrived on the periphery of Zhou Weiqing’s Nebula Celestial Territory, but they did not dare to step within it. Reason being, not only had they seen the Nebula Celestial Territory, they had also seen the powerful Demonic Dragon Lady and Hell’s Angel. Without a doubt, Her Majesty should be somewhere within the Celestial Territory, and the might of the Celestial Territory had completely surpassed their initial speculation.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>What could they do? They could only choose to return to the Sidhe Tribe.</p>
 <p>“What did you guys say? A Celestial Territory that turned day into night, and had a helix-shaped enormous nebula? Where exactly did that powerhouse come from?”</p>
 <p>The twelve elders of the Sidhe Tribe gathered. Their hearts were filled with anxiety - the Sidhe Princess had been abducted and now the Sidhe Queen was in trouble. To the Sidhe Tribe, their current situation was similar to facing the threat of extermination! If both the Sidhe Queen and Princess were in trouble at the same time, it would greatly affect the survival of the Sidhe Tribe.</p>
 <p>“Go ask those human beings, perhaps they know what is going on.” The First Elder immediately thought of Shangguan Xue’er, Tian’er and company.</p>
 <p>Therefore, the twelve elders appeared once again before the five women.</p>
 <p>Even though the Sidhe Tribe did not directly do anything to the five women after Shangguan Xue’er revealed her identity, nevertheless, they were put on house arrest. Even though they were not weak, since they were within the sealed grounds, without Zhou Weiqing’s guidance, they were unable to leave even if the Sidhe Tribe did not do anything to them. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What? Nebula Celestial Territory?” After hearing the elders’ description, the five women couldn’t help but stare at each other in dismay.</p>
 <p>“Do you guys know who the Celestial Territory belongs to?” the First Elder asked impatiently. The hostility in his eyes became more intense. In the elders’ opinion, if not for Zhou Weiqing ruining the peace within the sealed grounds, none of these things would have happened.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er nodded and said, “I think I might have a clue. While perhaps that isn’t a Celestial Territory, it is indeed Zhou Weiqing’s ability. I can guarantee that if her Majesty is currently with Zhou Weiqing, her safety is definitely not an issue.”</p>
 <p>“That is Zhou Weiqing’s ability?” After hearing what they said, the twelve elders immediately stared blankly for a few moments. Thereafter, their hostility towards them erupted further.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The First Elder said in a low voice, “No matter what, we want to see Her Majesty. Regardless of where you guys come from, we have no choice but to take action against you. Capture them first, before we look for Zhou Weiqing.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The twelve elders immediately surrounded Shangguan Xue’er and company. Amongst the five women, the calmest person was Shangguan Xue’er; the most gentle one was Shangguan Bing’er, and naturally, the person with the worst temper was Shangguan Fei’er. Particularly Shangguan Fei’er, since she was a child, she had never been put on house arrest by anyone. In the Heavenly Bow Empire, she occupied a very high status. The only person who was ranked above her was Zhou Weiqing. Even hundreds of thousands of army soldiers had to respectfully address her as ‘chief instructor’ whenever they saw her.&nbsp;</p>
