 <p>From the looks of it, the Sidhe Empress, who was within the Nature Celestial Territory, did not seem very powerful. She had once again taken the form of a hundred meter tall Mother Nature which was even smaller than Duo Si. However, her presence had significantly strengthened the entire Nature Celestial Territory.</p>
 <p>Even though Hui Yao and Duo Si had lost their will, their thousand years’ worth of combat experiences were still ingrained. As soon as they launched an attack, they would definitely be able to find the weakest area of the Nature Celestial Territory.</p>
 <p>The Sidhe Empress was hovering in mid-air as she continued to swing the Mother Nature Scepter. Rays of jade green light started spreading out, blocking them easily without much effort.</p>
 <p>If it was a one-on-one battle, even if the Sidhe Empress were to fight against Hui Yao, she would definitely be heavily injured. However, at this moment, it was not a one-on-one battle - she had the help of the twelve elders. Furthermore, due to some special reason, even if Hui Yao and Duo Si wanted to attack her, they would not be able to come within a hundred meters of the Sidhe Empress.</p>
 <p>Every time a ray of jade green light shone on the two enormous dragons, the dense Destruction Attribute on their bodies would be further suppressed - it would leave their bodies, bit by bit, before getting destroyed by the Nature Celestial Territory Formation.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After comprehending the gist of the Life Saint Energy, the Sidhe Empress could no longer be compared to how she used to be. Even though on the surface it might seem as though her cultivation base had only increased from the High Level Heavenly God Stage to the Max Level Heavenly God Stage, in truth, her power had been increased multifold.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing had mentioned previously before that the Sidhe Empress could very well be the most invincible figure in the world - if his own cultivation base had risen to the Heavenly God Stage, then perhaps he would be able to subdue the Sidhe Empress via the superiority of his attributes. However, this was under the circumstances that the Sidhe Empress and the Sidhe Ancient Tree did not merge as one.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After the Sidhe Ancient Tree had evolved, the entire Sidhe race had become a lot more powerful. It was also the reason why the four Sidhe elders could ascend to Heavenly Gods - without the evolution of the Ancient Tree, there was no way they could have made the breakthrough. At this moment, due to the Sidhe Empress’ constant obstruction, the Nature Celestial Territory Formation was extremely effective in restraining the attacks of the two enormous dragons. Even though they were not like Huang Xingyun and his wife, who could not entirely see what was going on in the external world, they were trapped even deeper. The Boundless Infinitum Formation could not be compared to the Sidhe Empress’ attacks at all. Every ray of light within the Nature’s Celestial Territory was merged with rich Life Saint Energy - as the light shone on both enormous dragons, it did not cause them any actual harm; however, it effectively dispelled the Destruction Energy within their bodies. Hence, it weakened the enormous dragons’ powers. Additionally, after a certain period of time, without needing Zhou Weiqing’s help, the Sidhe Empress’ Life Saint Energy alone might be sufficient to help them recover their consciousness.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even though the Sidhe Empress was calmly dealing with the situation at hand, she looked very worried. She constantly looked over to the other side of the battlefield with an anxious look on her face.</p>
 <p>Even though she had restrained Hui Yao and Duo Si at this moment, their powers had exceeded her expectations. They had to put in so much effort in restraining them, to the point that they were unable to lend Zhou Weiqing a helping hand at all. However, Zhou Weiqing was currently facing Fen Tian! Fen Tian was the leader of the enemy, how was it possible for the Sidhe Empress to not be worried?</p>
 <p>Ever since she shared a life connection with Zhou Weiqing, he had held a very important place in her heart. She absolutely did not wish for Zhou Weiqing to be put in any danger. Hence, she kept getting distracted, constantly glancing towards the area of battlefield where Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian were located at. Once Zhou Weiqing was in immediate danger, she would rush over to help him at once.</p>
 <p>However, did Zhou Weiqing truly require her help? After a short period of observation, astonishment and disbelief appeared on the face of the Mother Nature that the Sidhe Queen had metamorphosed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Amongst the five different battlefields, the battle with the greatest power disparity was not the chaotic battle on the ground - it was the battle between Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian.</p>
 <p>It was the battle between a Max Level Heavenly God, who was the Blood Red Hell’s Hell Lord, and a mere Max Level Heavenly Emperor. The difference between each rank above the Heavenly King Stage was extremely huge, and Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian were four full ranks apart.</p>
 <p>If his opponent was a different Max Level Heavenly Emperor, Fen Tian would definitely be confident of killing him in the time frame of a second. However, his current opponent was Zhou Weiqing, someone who he had to be cautious about.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After soaring into the sky, Fen Tian stared coldly at Zhou Weiqing; none of them took the initiative to make the first attack. In Fen Tian’s eyes, Zhou Weiqing’s unpredictability was his biggest threat. He did know what Zhou Weiqing’s most powerful ability was. From how he managed to defeat two Heavenly Emperors easily without much effort, he could tell that even though Zhou Weiqing was a Max Level Heavenly Emperor, he was not as simple as one.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Especially when the enormous pair of wings on Zhou Weiqing’s back spread open, and Zhou Weiqing’s eyes were filled with a demonic glow, Fen Tian became a lot more vigilant and guarded.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>On the surface, Fen Tian seemed to have a completely ruthless personality. In truth, he was an extremely cautious person. He would not lightly take any action unless he was absolutely confident. To put it simply, he was not one to gamble.</p>
 <p>The Astral Celestial Territory hovering above Zhou Weiqing’s head made his whitish golden Saint Energy look more dazzling and magnificent. “Fen Tian, for the sake of your aspiration, you were actually willing to sacrifice your ancestors. Today, I will deliver justice on behalf of the heavens.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fen Tian looked coldly at Zhou Weiqing, “Our ancestors were merely skeletons in their coffins. By giving them another chance at life, they should be extremely thankful to me instead. I admit that I had underestimated you. If I had face you head on earlier, and killed you before you became more powerful, it would not have been this troublesome. I really did not expect our stumbling block to be the so-called Peerless Sect, instead of the Heavenly Snow Mountain or the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. However, do you really think that you can go against me with just your power alone?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled and said, “Since you have already assumed that I am incapable of fighting against you, then why don’t you attack me first? What are you afraid of? I can tell, Fen Tian, that you are actually an indecisive person. If I were you, I would not have waited till this moment before I take action and would have done all I could to attack a Saint Land a long time ago. Instead, you took your chances and tried to subdue both the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and the Heavenly Snow Mountain using your strength to compromise. Perhaps, Huang Xingyun is your stumbling block, and maybe the person behind the scene will eventually become your target. It’s very possible for a mad dog like you to bite his own master after all.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Shut up.” Fen Tian’s facial expression changed, An ominous glint flickered in his eyes and pointed his dueling sword at Zhou Weiqing. The extremely terrifying and suppressive aura had rendered Zhou Weiqing speechless in an instant.</p>
 <p>The purplish black light rays rushed out of Fen Tian’s body in an instant. Similarly, behind him, an enormous devouring mouth soared. However, it was different from Shen Mo’s - within his devouring mouth, a huge black phantom image could be seen, albeit vaguely. This phantom image seemed to have taken the form of a black enormous crab.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The wave-like purplish black light that revolved around his dueling sword rushed out and the overbearing Destruction aura charged directly at Zhou Weiqing. At the same time, Fen Tian’s body had also become bigger, reaching to a thousand meters in height in a blink of an eye. The enormous devouring mouth, as well as the black phantom image, directly entered Fen Tian’s inflated body, while the crab phantom image left a mark on his chest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Sidhe Empress’ facial expression had changed because she had seen that.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This was the difference in cultivation base. What Fen Tian had released at this moment was the Destruction God; the overbearing Destruction aura seemed as though it was ripping the heaven and earth apart. Due to its appearance, even the Sidhe Empress’ Nature Celestial Territory had shrunk as a result of its suppression. One could well imagine how powerful Fen Tian was.</p>
 <p>Even though Shen Mo could release the Destruction Celestial Territory, he was like a child compared to Fen Tian.</p>
 <p>Upon reaching the Max Level Heavenly God Stage, it was akin to having one foot in a completely different realm. Amongst everyone present, only two individuals had reached this level - one was the Sidhe Empress, and the other was Fen Tian - even Hui Yao was still far away from reaching their level.</p>
 <p>This was power - a true powerhouse’s power.</p>
 <p>The dueling sword in Fen Tian’s hand had expanded as well, following the expansion of his body. The purplish black Destruction light on the enormous dueling sword had instantly sealed everything around Zhou Weiqing.Terrifying energy ripples seemed as though they could directly crush him into broken pieces.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As Fen Tian’s opponent, Zhou Weiqing could sense the impact the most. The Destruction Energy had almost broken his Astral Celestial Territory in an instant. Terrifying energy ripples in the sky moved rhythmically in a frenzy; Zhou Weiqing could not breathe at all.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fen Tian was enraged. The threat posed by Zhou Weiqing had already caused him to activate his most powerful ability. One could well imagine the power of the Destruction God within the Destruction Celestial Territory. The Nature Celestial Territory could not be compared to it at all. If the Sidhe Empress did not rely on the help of the Sidhe Ancient Tree, it would be impossible for her to fight against Fen Tian in his current condition.</p>
 <p>What could Zhou Weiqing do? The appearance of the Destruction God had caused the other battles on the ground to slow down. Countless gazes were looking towards the sky; the fierceness in the eyes of the Blood Red Hell and Passion Valley powerhouses became more intense - their morale was boosted. On the other hand, the powerhouses from the Peerless Sect, the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Heaven’s Expanse Palace were evidently stunned speechless. They clearly understood that once Zhou Weiqing got defeated, and once the Destruction God descended from the sky, everything was over.</p>
 <p>However, at this time, Zhou Weiqing’s eyes suddenly lit up. The demonic glow in his eyes immediately flickered; the Astral Celestial Territory swiftly shrank, transforming into a ball of light, heading towards Zhou Weiqing. When it had arrived before Zhou Weiqing, it was only the size of a palm. The Astral Celestial Territory quietly slid down and directly plastered itself on the Astral Saint Core Nucleus on Zhou Weiqing’s chest, before merging with it quietly. Immediately, Zhou Weiqing’s entire body lit up. Whitish golden starlight surged out, forcefully supporting its own Celestial Territory within the Destruction light rays.&nbsp;</p>
