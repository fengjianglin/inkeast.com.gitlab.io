 <p><b>Chapter 94 Triplets... (3)</b></p>
 <p>Soft… wet… fragrant… but wait… something was wrong? Zhou Weiqing was so lost in the kiss that his emotions were all in a mess, so much so that he almost did not sense something was wrong.</p>
 <p>The four white-clad guards behind ‘Shangguan Bing’er’ were totally shocked, the only thing in their minds was one single question. <em>Who … who is this? To even dare kiss this little devil girl of their Heaven’s Expanse Palace…</em></p>
 <p>Being kissed by Zhou Weiqing, this ‘Shangguan Bing’er’’s eyes widened, her body shuddering. The next moment, a strange scene occurred.</p>
 <p>‘Shangguan Bing’er’ started moving about in Zhou Weiqing’s arms, and in the next instant, her arms snaked out from between them like some flexible eels. Soon after, her left leg stomped hard on Zhou Weiqing’s right foot, causing him to look up in pained surprise.</p>
 <p>Next, she grabbed hold of his shoulder, using her own left shoulder to strike him in the chest, and Zhou Weiqing was sent flying back in the air.</p>
 <p>That was indeed an amazing feat. After all, Zhou Weiqing’s strength was unbelievably powerful, and even if he had no vigilance against Shangguan Bing’er, that basic strength was still there, as well as a considerable body weight. Yet, this ‘Shangguan Bing’er’ had thrown him away without even using a bit of Heavenly Energy, clearly her strength, flexibility, coordination, was at a stunning level.</p>
 <p>Seeing Zhou Weiqing getting thrown away, Lin TianAo was startled, quickly jumping in front to catch him. At the same time, that ‘Shangguan Bing’er’ charged forward in a leap, striking towards Zhou Weiqing in mid air, shouting: “Zhou Little Fatty, you’re asking for death!”</p>
 <p>“Second sis! Be lenient!” Right at point, a voice rang out, and another white figure dashed down from the fourth level of the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion.</p>
 <p>On hearing the voice, the ‘Shangguan Bing’er’ in midair hesitated, and her hands which had almost reached Zhou Weiqing drew back.</p>
 <p>Only then was Zhou Weiqing safely caught by Lin TianAo, but at that point he was both shocked and angry in his heart. Shock that Shangguan Bing’er would actually strike him, and that the area where he had been grabbed was exactly the Clavicle Acupuncture Point, and the instant it had been grabbed, he felt two swirling cones of Heavenly Energy invading his Acupuncture Point, and although a large portion of it was blocked off by his energy whirlpool, it still caused his entire shoulder to go numb, otherwise he wouldn’t have been thrown so easily.</p>
 <p>As Lin TianAo placed Zhou Weiqing back onto a ground, a figure flashed down, soaring through the air and right into his arms.</p>
 <p>“Little Fatty!” A cry, full of surprise, yearning, longing and love, and Shangguan Bing’er appeared right in front of Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>However, this time, Zhou Weiqing did not dare hug her. Subconsciously, he took a step back, his arms lifted warily in front of him. “You…”</p>
 <p>Just as Zhou Weiqing was about to ask why Shangguan Bing’er had treated him like that, he was cut off, staring blankly ahead as he suddenly saw that on the stairs, not far away, there was another ‘Shangguan Bing’er’ glaring at him angrily.</p>
 <p>“Wha… Heavens… Who can tell me what is going on?!” Zhou Weiqing looked helplessly between the two Shangguan Bing’ers, his face muscles twitching.</p>
 <p>The Shangguan Bing’er right in front of him cried out tearily: “Silly Little Fatty, I am your Bing’er! That is my second sister, Shangguan Fei’er!”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing stared, jaw agape: “You… you really are my Bing’er? How did your parents give birth to you all! You three sisters look so alike…”</p>
 <p>As he said that, both his arms which had been held up guardedly fell down, and Shangguan Bing’er leaped into his embrace, hugging him by the waist tightly.</p>
 <p>That familiar scent, that slightly quivering soft body in his arms, it finally seemed so real at last as Zhou Weiqing slowly tightened his arms around Shangguan Bing’er, muttering to himself: “Bing’er… my Bing’er…”</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, a cold voice rang out from beyond: “Why is it so noisy.” Another white figure appeared at the entrance of the fourth level stairway. Another similar feature, with an icy cold expression - it was Shangguan Xue’er.</p>
 <p>Xue’er, Fei’er, Bing’er. The three sisters looked exactly alike, and when the three triplets appeared right in front of them, even Lin TianAo had no choice but to stare in shock. In his heart, he muttered to himself: <i>Weiqing getting slapped previously and thrown this time, it was truly not his fault I guess! Perhaps if I were in his shoes, I would have done the same thing.</i></p>
 <p>Hearing Shangguan Xue’er’s voice, Shangguan Bing’er quickly looked up, a blush tinging her beautiful face, but she could not bear to let go of Zhou Weiqing, leaning into his embrace. Just like him, she had felt the torment of being parted, and having finally seen her Little Fatty once more, how could she bear to leave him so quickly again?</p>
 <p>Seeing Zhou Weiqing, Shangguan Xue’er started, her face growing even colder. Turning to Zhou Weiqing she said passively: “I once promised you that if your Fei Li Battle Team managed to enter the top four of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, I would let you see Bing’er. Now, you both have met… you can leave now.”</p>
 <p>“Big sis…” Shangguan Bing’er immediately cried out urgently.</p>
 <p>Looking at her, the cold on Shangguan Xue’er’s face actually thawed a little, growing gentler as she said: “Bing’er, you are at the critical moment. The Masters have been labouring hard for several days for your sake, in order to help you remould your Physical Jewels, you cannot waste everyone’s effort at this point. Come back in now, the Remoulding Scroll is almost complete now.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er held Zhou Weiqing’s hands, not wanting to leave.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er furrowed her brow slightly, saying: “Come on Bing’er, we have to go. How about this, let him wait here, and when you finish remoulding your Physical Jewels, you can come back out here and chat with him. Just be sure to return to the Palace at night.”</p>
 <p>Hearing her words, Shangguan bing’er was overjoyed, smiling happily as she said: “Thanks Big Sis. Little Fatty, you wait here for me okay, I’ll be right back here as soon as I’m done.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing held her hands stubbornly, saying: “No, I don’t want you to leave.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er started, but Shangguan Xue’er said coldly: “If you want the best for her, you better let go of her. The Remoulding Scroll can only be used on the instant it is created, and it will allow Bing’er’s Physical Jewels to be cleansed, remoulded and wiped to a clean slate, so she can Consolidate them again.</p>
 <p>Hearing Shangguan Xue’er’s words, although he was still in an emotional state, Zhou Weiqing was greatly surprised. <i>Remould Physical Jewels? Was that even possible? Weren’t Physical Jewels fixed forever once they had been Consolidated?!</i></p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er looked pleadingly at Zhou Weiqing, saying: “Little Fatty, we have troubled so many people and spent so much in order to help me Remould my Physical Jewels, I cannot waste all the effort of these Masters. Just wait for me a while, I will be back as soon as possible.”</p>
 <p>No matter how much he did not want her to leave, Zhou Weiqing could not allow Shangguan Bing’er to lose such an opportunity. Without question, with the Heaven’s Expanse Palace wealth, after Remoulding her Physical Jewels, Bing’er would be able to Consolidate top quality Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, likely God Tier ones, or even a Legendary Set! Shangguan Tianyue loved his daughters so much, and especially so for Shangguan Bing’er, who he felt he had let down for so many years, and he would definitely do all he could to give her the very best.</p>
 <p>Thinking about all that, he finally let go of his hands unwillingly.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er blushed as she tip toed closer to him, giving him a light kiss on his face before running lightly up the steps again.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er glared coldly at Zhou Weiqing before turning back inside again, and only Shangguan Fei’er remained outside.</p>
 <p>The white-clad guards who had stopped Zhou Weiqing and Lin TianAo were now looking upon him with a different look, mostly curiosity. They were all guessing who this youth was, who had kissed both Second and Third Miss!</p>
 <p>Seeing that her Big Sis and Little Sis had left, Shangguan Fei’er gritted her teeth as she glared at Zhou Weiqing. “Zhou Lttle Fatty, you dared to steal my first kiss, you’re dead now!”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said with a wronged look on his face: “Can I be blamed for that?! Besides my mum and dad, only Bing’er ever calls me Little Fatty. Who asked you all to look exactly alike, and you also called me by that name, how could I guess it wasn’t Bing’er? Furthermore, you already stomped on my foot and threw me back, we should be even now right.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er’s beautiful big eyes glared angrily at him, as she looked at him in surprise, saying: “Even?! You stole this young lady’s first kiss, and you think we’re even so easily? Dream on! Even if you are third sis’ boyfriend, I will still torture you until you are begging for death, if not I will not be called Shangguan Fei’er!”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily, saying: “That’s not a good thing, after all you are Bing’er’s sister, if we are playing around in bed until I’m begging to die, ahh… such an awesome feeling… but that would be letting Bin’er down! Even if Bing’er won’t blame me, I would feel terrible in my heart! After all, I am a gentleman! Do not think that just because you look like Bing’er, I will fall in love with you.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er was totally shocked into silence by Zhou Weiqing’s teasing. From young, she had been notorious as the mischievous young miss of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, and no one could do anything about her, as she became known as the Little Devil Girl. When she pranked any of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace disciples, how could they possibly dare retort or retaliate? Yet, this fellow in front of her had taken advantage of her, and still dared to retort back. All of a sudden, she felt a strange sense of freshness, a novel feeling that she had not experienced before, and she was surprised to find that some of her anger had dissipated.</p>
 <p>Her eyes swirling, a cunning plot came to her mind, and she pointed at Zhou Weiqing and said: “Fine, Zhou Weiqing, you just wait. Remember your words to me today, and you’ll live to regret it, I await the day you beg for my forgiveness.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said with a serious look on his face: “That’s no problem! As long as you say - ‘I want more’, I will likely be begging for forgiveness.”</p>
 <p>Just having to watch his Bing’er leave his side, Zhou Weiqing was already in a bad mood. Furthermore, he did not have any favourable impression of Shangguan Tianyue or Shangguan Xue’er, and with Shangguan Fei’er provoking him now, how could he possibly stay quiet and still be Zhou Weiqing? In terms of glibness, how could Shangguan Fei’er be a match for him?</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er was so angry that she was almost shivering: “Today Bing’er is nearby, and I won’t argue with you further. You just wait! Hmph!” As she said that, she turned and left.</p>
