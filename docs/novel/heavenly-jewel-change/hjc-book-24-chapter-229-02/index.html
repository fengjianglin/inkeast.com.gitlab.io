 <p><b>Chapter 229 To be confirmed! (2)</b></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing those words, surprise and shock flashed across Zhou Weiqing and the girls’ faces. “Rift?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mother dragon nodded, saying: “Yes, a rift… a pitch black rift like a tear in the skies. When it appeared, both my husband and I sensed a terrifying aura, one that was filled with destructive power, as if wanting to destroy the very heaven and earth. Such a horrifying aura and pressure, even we were not able to withstand it. After that… an evil sounding voice rang out.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The voice, it did not seem either male or female, but it was definitely very arrogant, laughing for a time before saying: ‘Finally, I have found it, to actually be hidden in such a deep corner. Now, let’s see how you will run now.’” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“As soon as he finished speaking, a monstrous power descended from the skies, filled with that same terrifying destructive power that you talked about… instantly falling upon both myself and my husband… just like two pitch black lights, but that was definitely not the Darkness Attribute. Even with my own, and my husband’s, cultivation of several tens of thousands of years, under the surge of energy, we were actually unable to move. We could actually feel our bodies being destroyed slowly.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“At that time, my husband somehow managed to drag himself in front of myself, using all his might to block that destructive attack… to protect me and my child! The terrifying destructive might lasted almost an hour before it vanished, and by that time he was already severely injured… even myself, protected by him, was also greatly influenced and injured, with my powers greatly reduced.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right at that moment, several dozen humans charged out from the black rift, launching attacks on us. Their attacks held the same destructive power as well, and all of them were at least what you humans call the Heavenly King stage, with the four leaders being at the Heavenly Emperor stage. Under any normal circumstances, neither I or my husband would have cared about those few of them. However, at this time, both of us were severely injured, and we were unable to fight against them properly. My husband used the last of his breath and we killed seven or eight of them… but he…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>As she spoke up to that point, tears were once again streaming down the mother dragon’s cheeks, causing the ground below Zhou Weiqing and the girls’ feet to become wet. Without question, the male dragon had fought to the death to protect his wife and children, but the critical key of the matter was the two bouts of destructive black light after the spatial rift had appeared. It was those two streaks of light that had severely injured the dragon couple and caused their strength to fall sufficiently that those human enemies had succeeded in their attacks. Furthermore, those dozens of humans were definitely above thirty years of age, especially the four Heavenly Emperor stage powerhouses… for them to join forces to attack the two dragons… did even the Heaven’s Expanse Palace have that many powerhouses?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My husband’s final blow also critically injured the four Heavenly Emperor powerhouses, but when he died, I went berserk. I would rather die and take these enemies with me, instead of letting them hurt my children. At that time, I also thought I would definitely die. However, I do not know why but right at that moment, the black rift in the sky began to slowly shrink, as if the energy was insufficient to hold it up. Alas, while we were still locked in frenzied battle, one of the powerhouses sneaked behind me and stole our children. At that time, I had already lost control of my emotions, and I did not realise it until it was too late. In the end, I killed another five or six of them, but the rest of them managed to make their escape.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The mother dragon’s body was trembling once more, this time with sheer rage. Her husband had been killed, her children stolen from her… any female from any species would never be able to accept that!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to take revenge, I want to find our children again. As such, I received the dragon spirit that was generated from my husband’s death, and began to attack the entire spatial realm in an attempt to break free. I had used two months of time to recover slightly from my wounds, before attempting to break free of this Lustre Spatial Realm. Only by first leaving this area will I be able to find those enemies of mine, and destroy them… taking back our children. I will never forget that black rift… those bastards managed to escape it because of that. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At last, Zhou Weiqing and the girls finally knew the entire happenings from the mother dragon’s description, but all five of them lapsed into deep thought. </span></p>
 <p><span style>One could imagine the shock they were in currently. What the mother dragon described was clearly a deliberate and planned action. Yet, let alone being able to gather so many Heavenly Emperor and Heavenly King stage powerhouses together, just the thought of the power needed to tear such a spatial rift alone caused their expressions to change. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It had to be known that this Lustre Spatial Realm was created by the combined efforts of four Heavenly God Tier stage powerhouses, and just like the mother dragon said, the power that tore open the rift and attacked the dragons was at a stage above them. Above the Heavenly God Tier… what kind of level was that? Could it be the legendary Heavenly Jewel Change?! Even so… why was this person targeting the dragons? With such a cultivation level, who in the world would be match for this person? All of them were filled with so many unanswered questions, so much puzzlement. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At last, Zhou Weiqing asked the mother dragon: “Is that destructive power still in your body as well?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The mother dragon shook her head, her eyes filled with sorrow. “In the last moment before my husband died, he forcefully drained all the destructive power from me, allowing me to regain some portion of my strength. Otherwise, I would have probably died before the enemies left. Alas, I was still unable to protect our children… it’s all my fault, all my fault! If I had been able to stay calm and in control, to protect our children… they might not have been able to steal them before the rift closed!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Once again, the mother dragon burst into tears, and sorrow lingered about the entire massive cavern, as if a tangible source even. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing looked at Tian’er and said: “Let us first take things step by step… no matter what, we should first try to save her husband before we decide on what to do next. Tian’er, what idea did you have, let us discuss it?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tian’er nodded her head and said: “As everyone knows, amongst the four Saint Attributes, our Heavenly Snow Mountain core bloodline has the Divine Attribute, which has the capability of Resurrection. Although the Resurrection Skill has not appeared in the world for a long time, it does truly exist. However, it only has a thirty percent chance, and cannot work on any life form that has passed away for more than two hours. At the same time, the Resurrection Skill itself does not have any healing capabilities. That means, we have to actually heal all the wounds of the corpse before it can work as well.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Tian’er’s words, Shangguan Xue’er couldn’t help but draw in a cold breath. “Tian’er, to Resurrect a dragon of such power, how much energy would be required?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tian’er said resolutely: “No matter what, we need to try.” She had truly been touched by the mother dragon’s story. Furthermore, their </span><span style>Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger Tribe had always had strong connections with the Dragon Tribe since ancient times. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “I understand what you mean… we have to first heal the dragon’s corpse before we can even begin to Resurrect him. However, he has already died for such a long period of time… will that really work?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tian’er gave a bitter smile and said: “In truth, I also do not know… but from what I can tell, his body still has vitality within it. Dragons are one of the strongest Heavenly Beasts in the world, and it isn’t so easy to kill them. Furthermore, this Lustre Spatial Realm was originally constructed by the Dragon Tribe, and here, their life force is maintained and supported to the maximum possibility. As such, we should still have a thin thread of chance. More importantly, we have the Saint Energy… that is the real reason why I have some hopes that it will succeed. With the Saint Energy’s creation powers supporting my Resurrection Skill, the chances of success might be much higher than normal.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing’s eyes flashed with resolution. “In that case, let us try. The problem of energy, I believe I can use the Devour Skill to solve.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tian’er nodded slightly, saying: “We can only do so then.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>After the simple discussion, they turned back to the mother dragon, and Zhou Weiqing said: “As you already know, Tian’er is of the </span><span style>Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger bloodline. Our only chance now is for her to use the Resurrection Skill of the Divine Attribute to bring your husband back to life… but there is no guarantee of success.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The mother dragon was overjoyed upon hearing that. “That’s right! </span><span style>Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger! She is a Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger with the Resurrection Skill! As long as you can Resurrect my husband, I can agree to any requests. He is already dead now, there can’t be any worse consequence. Please go ahead boldly and do what you need to do, even if it doesn’t succeed, I will not blame you. However, if that is the case, I can only continue to break free of the Lustre Spatial Realm to look for my children.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing’s brow furrowed and said: “If we can successfully revive your husband, can you two not break free of the Spatial Realm? If the realm is destroyed, the Heavenly Jewel Island will also be destroyed as well, and below the island there are more than tens of millions of humans living in a major city.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Humans?” A thick hatred showed in the mother dragon’s eyes. She really wanted to say that what do the lives of humans mean to me… however, these few in front of her who could possibly save her husband were also humans, and in the end she did not speak the words. “But… our children…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing saw the sorrow in her eyes, and sighed inwardly, saying: “Nevermind, no matter what, let us first try to revive your husband. Whether or not we succeed or fail, I hope that you can give us a chance to discuss the matter first, to see what else can be done. That is all we ask.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Facing such a wife and mother in such dire straits, Zhou Weiqing could not bring himself to ask for any conditions. She had suffered too much. In truth, it rang deep into his own soul as well, as he did not know whether his own parents were still alive or dead, and he could fully understand how she felt at this moment. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The mother dragon nodded rapidly. “Very well, I agree. Please revive my husband first, we can always discuss with you. What do you need me to do?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing thought for a moment before replying: “Reviving your husband is not something that can be accomplished in one simple strike, we need to do so step by step. When we need your help, I will definitely let you know. Earlier, your attack left me quite severely injured, so I need to first recover before we can begin.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>A hint of embarrassed shame flashed in the mother dragon’s eyes, but she did not say anything, just nodding towards Zhou Weiqing. Just like what Tian’er said, although her husband had already passed away, in this Lustre Spatial Realm, his corpse would not easily rot away like that, and they could not rush things in order to ensure the greatest success rate.</span></p>
