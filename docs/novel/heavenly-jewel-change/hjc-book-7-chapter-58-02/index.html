 <p><b>Chapter 58 Blood Rites - Seal of Darkness! (2)</b></p>
 <p>Listening to Zhou Weiqing’s words, Qin Feng also heaved a small sigh of relief. In his, and most others’, eyes, if a Consolidating Equipment Master became a Follower of another Consolidating Equipment Master, it was something rather inconceivable.</p>
 <p>The only thing that was in Yun Li’s mind now was a patch of sorrow: <em>So fake, so hypocritical! This guy is truly so fake! Sigh… I wonder how my future will be like under him...</em></p>
 <p>After replying Qin Feng’s question, Zhou Weiqing held Shangguan Bing'er’s hand, and they exchanged looks. Zhou Weiqing wriggled his brow at her in a joking manner. Shangguan Bing'er did not resist, smiling happily at her future husband, her heart full of pride. Right just now, Zhou Weiqing had already used Heavenly Energy and their secret code from the Heavenly Bow Unit to give her a summary of what had happened.</p>
 <p>As a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master, to be able to beat a High Level Consolidating Equipment Master, wasn’t that something to be proud of? An outstanding, talented man was definitely attractive to women.</p>
 <p>As the four descended the stairs, the sky had already darkened outside. However, the entire trading center was lit up during this time, as it was usually more crowded during the night. By now, there were more than a hundred onlookers surrounding the area.</p>
 <p>Seeing the four walk out of the shop, the crowd immediately burst forth with questions. Everyone was curious about the victor of this match; after all, it would determine the Following of this two talented Consolidating Equipment Masters!</p>
 <p>“Big bro Qin, you can announce it.” Zhou Weiqing was happy to be the good guy and let Qin Feng have the honour. At the same time, he whispered to Yun Li: “Stop giving that bitter expression, how could we let others believe we had a draw if you keep that up.”</p>
 <p>Yun Li glared at him, his mouth about to say something, but he finally managed to squeeze out a smile.</p>
 <p>Qin Feng said loudly: “Our shop 77 was very honoured to be able to host this competition between this two young and talented Consolidating Equipment Masters. After a long fight, we have finally proven that they are evenly matched, and both of them indeed admire each other a lot. The bet is over, and the final result is an overall draw. I believe that from the first competition, everyone has seen how talented both these Masters are. If any of you are interested in being their Followers, do hurry up! The opportunity will not last long!”</p>
 <p>Just as some of the Jewel Masters were rather interested, Yun Li suddenly interrupted: “That will not be necessary. I am very tired after the battle today. Furthermore, after the duel with Master Zhou, I have had some further understanding and fresh ideas, and I will be going through some close door cultivation for a while, and will not be taking on Followers for now.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed and said: “In that case, that’s all for today. When we are ready to accept Followers once more, we will come back here to inform everyone.” It was not good to be greedy, and his gains today was already unbelievably fortuitous. Furthermore, he still had a whole class of commoner students to support. With such a Follower like Yun Li, Zhou Weiqing was already very satisfied, and he didn’t need to rush into getting more Followers. After that battle with Yun Li, Zhou Weiqing had managed to think things through. When his cultivation level was higher, and his Consolidating Master rank higher, he would naturally be able to attract stronger Followers, and there was no need for him to rush into things.</p>
 <p>With that thought in mind, Zhou Weiqing decided not to continue.</p>
 <p>Sighs of regret sounded out from around the crowd, as they started to dissipate. Of course, whether or not the sighs were due to the lack of an actual victor, or because they were no longer accepting Followers, only they themselves knew.</p>
 <p>“Hello Master Zhou, I’m very pleased to meet you. My name is Zhou Changxi, we share a common ancestor! I’m the boss of the shop 76.” Seeing that both sides had drawn, Zhou Changxi also heaved a sigh of relief. After all, he was afraid that Yun Li might have lost.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: “Nice to meet you Boss Zhou.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Changxi then turned to Yun Li and said: “Bro Yun, if you want to go about closed door cultivation, you can head over to my place.”</p>
 <p>Yun Li shook his head and said: “That will not be necessary. I have become good friends with Weiqing, and we are prepared to exchange pointers and train together regarding Consolidating Equipment Scrolls.” He had already become Zhou Weiqing’s Followers, naturally he would be going together with Zhou Weiqing. Although he felt that Zhou Weiqing trying to hide the truth was extremely fake, in truth he also did not want it revealed to the world that he had lost. Especially, since he had lost to a person with lower cultivation level and Consolidating Equipment Master Ranking. That would be extremely humiliating.</p>
 <p>In fact, what was at the forefront of his mind was still that rose red Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Jewel. Just like what Zhou Weiqing said, there was indeed no shame in losing to that. He was also extremely glad that he has resisted his own thoughts to break his own word, as he knew that he would have had no chance against a Heavenly Jewel Master with the legendary Alexandrite Cat’s Eye.</p>
 <p>Hearing Yun Li’s words, Zhou Changxi was rather surprised, but he did not say anything. After all, he was friends with Yun Li, not his boss.</p>
 <p>Seeing Yun Li’s gloomy face, Zhou Weiqing grinned. Just as he was about to tell Qin Feng what he needed to buy, a rather strange voice sounded out all of a sudden.</p>
 <p>“Is it possible for me to also have a bet with the two Masters?” The reason why the voice was described as strange was because it had a very metallic feel. Thick, strong. Even before seeing the person speaking, the voice had already given them such an impression.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing and Yun Li immediately turned towards the direction of the voice, only to see a large man in front of them.</p>
 <p>This man was even taller than the 1.9m tall Zhou Weiqing, his shoulders broad to an almost exaggerated state. Zhou Weiqing was already considered very well built, but in comparison to this man in front of them, he seemed almost slender and thin. One could almost see the bulging muscles of his shoulders, almost as if there was a metal ball shoved in there.</p>
 <p>With round eyes and well-formed forehead [1. literally says face shaped like a leopard’s], and a full beard and whiskers which hid his actual age from them, and a head full of short red hair. All of that combined to give a fierce look. However, he had a pair of deep blue eyes, calm as the sea. Standing there, he seemed like an immovable mountain.</p>
 <p>Looking at this person, Zhou Weiqing, Yun Li, Shangguan Bing’er and Qin Feng all revealed uncertain, confused looks. Only Zhou Changxi had a rather surprised look in his eyes, his brow furrowing as a cold light flashed momentarily in his eyes, though it quickly vanished. However, nobody noticed the quick change of expression on his face.</p>
 <p>“Who are you?” Zhou Weiqing asked curiously.</p>
 <p>The bearded man said in his powerful voice: “My name is Lin TianAo. I am a Mid Level Zun Stage Heavenly Jewel Master with the Earth Elemental Attribute and Defense Physical Attribute, and I wish to have a bet with the two Masters.”</p>
 <p>Mid Level Zun Stage? A five-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master! Zhou Weiqing was no stranger to a pure defense Heavenly Jewel Master like that, as Ma Qun had the same combination. However, Ma Qun was only had a single set of Jewels, while the man in front had five. The difference between them would be like heaven and earth.</p>
 <p>Yun Li was about to say something, but Zhou Weiqing quickly said with an expressionless face: “What do you wish to bet with us?”</p>
 <p>Lin TianAo said in a serious tone: “I wish to bet in a similar bet like the two Masters had earlier. If I win, I want both of your Lifetime Following. If you win, I will lose my lifetime Following to both of you. With both your current cultivation levels, it is unlikely you will be able to get Followers of my level and calibre. Furthermore, I am an Ultimate type Heavenly Jewel Master.”</p>
 <p>An ‘Ultimate’ type Heavenly Jewel Master referred to having the Physical Jewel and Elemental Jewel were boosting a similar type, bringing it to the maximum possible. For example, Shangguan Bing’er would be considered a speed and agility Ultimate Type Heavenly Jewel Master, and this Lin TianAo would be an Ultimate Defense Heavenly Jewel Master.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed and said: “I guess that you will be wanting to bet in terms of combat prowess. However, we are both just a Upper Level Shi Heavenly Jewel Master, and a Lower Level Zun Stage Heavenly Jewel Master, why would we bet with a Mid Level Zun Stage Heavenly Jewel Master like yourself? Don’t you think your bet is too much of a joke?”</p>
 <p>Lin TianAo was not put off by Zhou Weiqing’s mocking words, his eyes remaining calm and solemn. “Since this is a bet, it naturally has to be fair. What you said is indeed correct, if it was just a normal fight, it will definitely not be fair. Even if both of you came at me together, you will not be able to take me down. However, my bet is as follows - I will stand there without returning blows, and both of you can attack me all you want in the time for an incense stick to burn. As long as you can cause me to move my feet at all, it will count as your win.”</p>
 <p>As soon as he said that, Zhou Weiqing was extremely surprised, and an anger rose in Yun Li’s eyes. Even Qin Feng and Shangguan Bing’er had a look of shock on their faces. Only Zhou Changxi had his brow furrowed, his expression changing.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s surprise naturally had a reason behind it. Without question, this Lin TianAo had given extremely favourable conditions for them, so much so that it would be difficult for them to refuse.</p>
 <p>For both of them to attack for the entire time of an incense stick to burn… to be able to give such a conditions for a bet, how much confidence did he have in his own defence! After all, both of them were Spatial Attribute Heavenly Jewel Masters, and the Spatial Attribute attacking skills were extremely damaging. Furthermore, his own Physical Jewel was that of the Strength Attribute. To say that they could defeat him was highly unlikely, but to not even be able to even make him move, that was something that both Zhou Weiqing and Yun Li could not believe.</p>
 <p>“Are you looking down on us?” Yun Li cried out angrily.</p>
 <p>Lin TianAo said passively: “This is just a bet, and it is up to both of you to accept it. No matter which one of you, to be able to get a Follower like me, in future when killing Heavenly Beasts to Store Skills, it will be of immense help. Furthermore, as my strength and cultivation level grows, my defense will keep growing. In future, I might even be able to block a dragon’s blow.”</p>
 <p>Hearing his words, Yun Li almost agreed rashly, but he was quickly stopped by a look from Zhou Weiqing. Only then did he remember that he was no longer a free man, and couldn’t help but feel a sense of dejection in his heart. However, the fighting spirit in his eyes did not falter, as he looked at Zhou Weiqing, hoping that he would agree with this bet. After all, Yun Li did not believe that he could possibly lose this fight.</p>
