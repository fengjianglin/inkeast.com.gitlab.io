Amongst all the Heavenly Kings from the Blood Red Hell, he was considered one of the top few. However, he did have one flaw. That was his arrogance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whenever he was facing an opponent that was weaker than he was, his favourite thing to do was to play around with the foe before killing them in a cruel fashion. Even in the Blood Red Hell, his personality was one that garnered hatred. Currently, facing a young man in his twenties like Zhou Weiqing, he truly could not imagine that he could possibly lose. Added on to the fact that he wanted to impress the four Grand Elders, he decided to battle with only one hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing's smile did not even waver in the slightest. However, it was Long Shiya who was standing behind Zhou Weiqing, whose fat cheeks began trembling as he had to focus all of his concentration not to break into a wide grin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, ever since Zhou Weiqing started to bargain with his opponents and arrange the bet, Long Shiya had wanted to burst out laughing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just yesterday, when Zhou Weiqing had met with the Demonic Emperor for the second time, he had invited his own teacher along to discuss how they could deal with the Blood Red Hell's attack. Without question, they were all clear that the Blood Red Hell’s goal here was to fully exterminate the Heavenly Demon Sect, with the secondary goal of wiping out the Heavenly Bow Empire as well. Under such a circumstance, the number of Blood Red Hell powerhouses here would definitely be a large number.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a direct head-on clash, their chances of victory was just too small.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yet, this fight was also unavoidable. Still, how exactly they could handle it, even the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue did not have any idea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As such, the leadership role fell into Zhou Weiqing’s hands, and the entire plan was constructed by him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without question, he was setting a trap for the Blood Red Hell. However, this trap was fully based on his own personal power. Anyone who had ever bet with Zhou Weiqing would have known what was the result of betting with him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was the reason why Long Shiya felt like laughing so much. Seeing his precious disciple blowing smoke and setting such an elaborate trap, and the opponents were just jumping headfirst into that.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing's strategy was actually very simple and straightforward; to gradually weaken their strength. He would continue doing so, weakening them bit by bit until both sides reached a similar power level, then... heh heh…&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, this type of betting system and tournament style fighting was the best method to weaken the enemy slowly and steadily. More importantly, the unlimited participation was exactly tailored for himself. With the Devour Skill, how could his sustained fighting capabilities be compared to any ordinary powerhouses?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at how this Tianlei was looking down upon his precious disciple, Long Shiya’s heart had already marked him with the death penalty in this fight.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, Wu Yunyue’s feeling was vastly different. He had heard many stories regarding Zhou Weiqing, but this was the first time he was actually working alongside this young man. Although he was still not too familiar with the heights Zhou Weiqing’s strengths had actually reached, at least he was able to stand there speaking so nonchalantly despite the disparity in strength between both sides, even manipulating their opponents to follow his thoughts… this was more than enough to deem him a talent. At least, Wu Yunyue had to admit that when he was still at the Heavenly King stage, he would not have been able to leave his ego aside and smile&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">obsequiously like that. It could be said that Zhou Weiqing did not seem to have self awareness as a top powerhouse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, people like that were often the most dangerous ones. After all, a top powerhouse who was willing to resort to all means in accomplishing tasks… they were definitely far trickier than any of their peers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A faint smile crossed Zhou Weiqing's lips. In contrast to Tian Lei's arrogance, he gave the impression that he was a little scared, even as he bowed slightly to his opponent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With Tianlei’s pride, he naturally would not launch an attack at Zhou Weiqing at such a time. If he did not even have this amount of judgement, Zhou Weiqing must have been screwing around all this time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tianlei said cockily: “Come on then.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before he had even finished his sentence, Zhou Weiqing disappeared from his sight. Even as he did so, he was still in the same slightly bowed position he had been in.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing loved it when his foes underestimated him. Facing such enemies, he did not feel any pressure at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tianlei was caught by surprise by Zhou Weiqing’s sudden disappearance, but he was after all a powerful Heavenly King powerhouse from the Blood Red Hell, and he managed to react as quickly as possible. A thick wave of Fire Attribute energies mixed with the Destruction Aura burst forth from his body, and his entire body seemed to become an exploding fireball. Such an explosive force caused his Heavenly Energy to have the effect of an indiscriminate attack all around. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone else from both sides had already retreated far away before the fight had begun. A clash between Heavenly Kings and above would affect a large area, and no one wanted to be caught up in the crossfire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the instant that Tian Lei flared out, his body had turned around. According to normal logic, when an opponent disappeared in front of him, they would most likely reappear behind him. Even at this point0, Tian Lei was still planning to fight with only a single arm. As such, when he turned around, his right hand moved with a swirl of a fiery dragon appearing, twisting and moving around his body. This fire dragon would protect his body in the meantime, and as soon as he spotted Zhou Weiqing, it could then be used to strike a fatal blow against Zhou Weiqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, Tianlei was pleasantly surprised to feel that he had indeed struck his young foe even in the midst of turning around.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The truth was indeed as such. The explosive Fire Attribute energies that burst forth from Tianlei’s body smashed savagely into Zhou Weiqing, who had appeared behind him. When Tianlei turned around to see, he even saw the shock on Zhou Weiqing’s face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without question, with Tianlei’s character, a smug expression instantly crossed his face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Subconsciously, Zhou Weiqing made an action to protect himself, his hands pushing forward. From the looks of things, it was as if he was half wanting to resist, half waiting to be hit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tianlei’s fire dragon had also smashed forward without holding back. Although they had called it a tournament style fighting, with the current relationship between both sides, killing their opponent was undoubtedly the simplest and most direct method, which would also serve to break the other side’s morale.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fire dragon slammed into Zhou Weiqing’s body without the slightest deviation, bursting into brilliant flames.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, the Demonic Emperor had closed his eyes. He had not imagined that Zhou Weiqing would be so weak. Wasn’t he supposed to be already at the Heavenly King Stage? How could he possibly be unable to dodge a mere subconscious strike from the opponent?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, in the moment he closed his eyes, he suddenly heard loud gasps in unison.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing’s hands seemed to land on Tianlei’s body in a gentle fashion. The shock on his face remained unchanged, but Tianlei’s body was now frozen in place, his eyes filled with utter disbelief.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What did Tian Lei see? He had seen Zhou Weiqing getting hit by both his attacks, totally without any Consolidated Equipment. Yet, he had then step out of the flames, and his palms had just landed on his own chest chest. Since his own flames had covered the incoming palms, Tian Lei did not even have enough time to react.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A terrifying suction force welled up from Zhou Weiqing’s palm, and Tianlei felt his Heavenly Core Nucleus shudder violently. Next, all of his Heavenly Energy seemed to pour out of his body in a flood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, Tianlei found his body totally unable to move, and he was unable to break free no matter how hard he tried. In that instant, nearly ten Fetters of Wind Skills landed on his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without even calculating the existence of the Saint Energy, Zhou Weiqing’s energy levels were already at the same level as Tianlei. In that instant, with ten of such Control Skills stacked upon each other, how could Tianlei possibly break free in a short period of time? As his Heavenly Energy flowed out of his body, the chances of breaking free with his own strength grew lower and lower.&nbsp;</span></p>

In the next moment, his body was sent flying back almost dozen metres like a cannonball, before slamming into the ground, clearly dead as a doornail.&nbsp;</span></p>
