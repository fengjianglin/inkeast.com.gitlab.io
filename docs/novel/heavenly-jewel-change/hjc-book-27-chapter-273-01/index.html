 <p>“Senior Uncle.” Zhou Weiqing stood outside Duan Tianlang’s door. He greeted him respectfully after knocking on the door lightly.</p>
 <p>“Come in.” Duan Tianlang’s voice could be heard from within the room. He sounded rather exhausted.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was in a daze for a moment. It was only a few months ago that Duan Tianlang was rejuvenated with his Saint Energy. Even though his body was not as strong now compared to his prime, he should still be full of vigor instead of his current weak state!</p>
 <p>Feeling puzzled, Zhou Weiqing entered the room.</p>
 <p>The moment he saw Duan Tianlang, Zhou Weiqing was shocked, “Senior Uncle, what happened to you?” As he said that, Zhou Weiqing ran over to Duan Tianlang and grabbed his hands in order to channel the purified reddish golden Saint Energy into his body.</p>
 <p>Duan Tianlang was in an extremely terrible condition at the moment - his face looked haggard and his originally black hair turned white. He even had a lot of wrinkles on his face. His eyes looked dull, without any radiance. He looked like an old man with one foot in the grave.</p>
 <p>With the support of Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy, Duan Tianlang’s body trembled slightly. His condition became a lot better, his vitality was boosted and via the cleansing done by the Saint Energy, his fatigue and the deterioration of his bodily functions slowly got better.</p>
 <p>As Zhou Weiqing was helping Duan Tianlang, he was overwhelmed with shock. He clearly felt that if his cultivation base was not raised to the Heavenly Emperor Stage and that if he only used the previous Astral Saint Energy, Senior Uncle would only have a few months left to live. Saint Energy was not omnipotent - there were some things that were impossible to reverse. Additionally, his reddish golden Saint Energy was a lot purer than it was before. He finally managed to pull Duan Tianlang back from the brink of death.</p>
 <p>The results of Saint Energy’s effectiveness were instantaneous. It could clearly be seen that Duan Tianlang was gradually recovering. His dull-looking eyes started to look surprised.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>After Zhou Weiqing gave his best effort for a full one hour, Duan Tianlang finally returned to the state Zhou Weiqing nursed him back a couple of months ago.</p>
 <p>“Weiqing, your cultivation has improved. I even thought that I was done for this time around. However, this time, I wasn’t planning on this happening. I feel so pissed! Haha, you are really my lucky star, haha!”</p>
 <p>Duan Tianlang laughed, but Zhou Weiqing on the other hand was mad. He looked angrily at his Senior Uncle and said, “Senior Uncle, what on earth have you been doing? I nursed you back to health with much difficulty, how can you not love and take care of yourself? What have you actually been doing, that your body would fall apart once more?”</p>
 <p>After hearing Zhou Weiqing’s reprimand, Duan Tianlang scratched his head in embarrassment, “Aye, old habits. Too bad, seems like I’ll never be able to change in this life. Whenever I dive into the research of Consolidating Equipment Scroll, I wouldn’t be able to stop. This time, I think I have not slept in more than a month, causing my body to break down.”</p>
 <p>“Ah? You went without rest for more than a month? No sleep or rest? You……” Zhou Weiqing was lost for words.</p>
 <p>One must know that when Duan Tianlang said he did not rest for more than a month, it was not as simple as not resting or sleeping. Instead, over the timespan of a month, he concentrated his attention entirely on researching the Consolidating Equipment Scroll for 24 hours every single day. Or else how would the previous recovery he made with the help of Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy completely vanish?</p>
 <p>Duan Tianlang said apologetically, “I’m at fault, but Weiqing, let’s not talk about this. Quick, take a look at what I did.”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, Duan Tianlang leapt up in high spirits, akin to a groom who’s about to marry his bride. He dragged Zhou Weiqing to his work station and opened up a square meter scroll right before him.</p>
 <p>After the scroll opened, the first thing Zhou Weiqing saw was countless gray lines crammed together. Those lines were drawn using a special pen. The scroll itself was made from a premium sheepskin - it definitely would not be easily damaged.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing originally wanted to have a good conversation with his Senior Uncle, but when he saw the scroll, he was completely dumbfounded.</p>
 <p>In the eyes of an ordinary person, upon seeing those gray lines, their eyes would not be able to adapt, causing them to feel giddy as a result. But Zhou Weiqing was different, he was not an ordinary person! Coupled with the fact that his cultivation base was raised to the Heavenly Emperor Stage, he could be considered a true blue God Tier Master. When it came to creating the Consolidating Equipment Scroll, in terms of control, relying on Astral Saint Energy, Zhou Weiqing definitely could be considered number one in the world - no one could be compared to him.</p>
 <p>As the image within the enormous scroll appeared before his eyes, he was in a complete state of shock.</p>
 <p>Indeed, there was a picture designed on the Consolidating Equipment Scroll - Zhou Weiqing had never seen anything so complicated before. Even though several parts looked somewhat messy, as Zhou Weiqing’s eyes followed the lines and continued scanning the scroll, he couldn’t help but constantly exclaim in surprise.</p>
 <p>Duan Tianlang, who was standing next to him, was also looking at it. The only difference is that unlike Zhou Weiqing, his eyes were filled with fascination, as though he was admiring the most beautiful woman in the world. Furthermore, he was lightly stroking the sheepskin scroll from time to time - his entire being was immersed within his own world.</p>
 <p>“Senior Uncle, Senior Uncle you actually did it. Oh my goodness! This is a miracle - you can only use the word ‘miracle’ to describe this.” Zhou Weiqing couldn’t hold himself back but exclaim in awe.</p>
 <p>He suddenly lifted his head and looked at Duan Tianlang. In the aspect of creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, not even Zhou Weiqing was as dedicated as Duan Tianlang, who was after all the first generation God Tier Master. How could he not be shocked or surprised when he saw such a miracle before his eyes? He could not imagine that such a scroll could be even be designed. It could be described as superlative craftsmanship.</p>
 <p>“Yes, I have succeeded. Even I didn’t think I could do it.” Duan Tianlang mumbled, “Perhaps it was because I was on the brink of death several times before - my heart was tranquil enough and at the same time I had the courage to give up on everything. Hence, the Heavens decided to bestow me with such a glorious achievement.”</p>
 <p>Even when he completed the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set, Duan Tianlang did not mention the word ‘achievement’. However at this moment, his face was full of pride.</p>
 <p>“Senior Uncle, you’ve succeeded, you really have succeeded. This, this is the design of the eleventh piece of the ‘Hate Ground No Handle’ Set! If this Consolidating Equipment Scroll could finally be completed, then our ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set would definitely surpass the Boundless Infinitum Set , and become the most powerful in the world.”</p>
 <p>Nodding his head slightly, Duan Tianlang’s eyes were brimming with tears of excitement, “The inspiration and one month’s worth of work done at once caused me to go without sleep and food. Despite knowing that it could possibly lead to death, I refused to stop. Weiqing, I beg of you, no matter what, while I’m still alive, you have to create this scroll. Even though I was able to design this scroll, I don’t have the ability to actually create it. You’re the only one; only you, via your control over the binding of time and space, can help complete this scroll. If I’m not wrong, you must have had a breakthrough to the Heavenly Emperor Stage right?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded his head vigorously and said in an overly excited voice, “Senior Uncle, don’t worry, I will definitely create it. Senior Uncle, I can say for sure that you are the most outstanding God Tier Master in the Legacy of Strength of all time - he might even have surpassed the elder that created the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set. At the same time. You are also the greatest and strongest God Tier Master in the world. Nobody could compare themselves to you and your achievements.”</p>
 <p>“Hahahaha. I think so too, hahahaha!” Duan Tianlang laughed out loud. A person with a gentle disposition like him actually revealed a wilder side of him.</p>
 <p>At that time, Duan Tianlang’s biggest wish was to be able to see the design of the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set. Zhou Weiqing had helped him fulfill it and he even personally created it, becoming the first God Tier Master in all of Legacy of Strength’s history to create both ‘Hate Sky no Handle’ and ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ sets. Additionally, he even took one step further and actually designed the eleventh piece of the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set. Designing them wasn’t solely dependent on capabilities - there was also the element of luck. Duan Tianlang was fully convinced that if he had to do it again, he would not be able to succeed even if it took him a hundred years.</p>
 <p>With the design of the eleventh piece of ‘Hate Ground no Handle’, even the three Heaven’s Expanse Palace three God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters on the Heavenly Jewel Island put together were not more accomplished than him. Grandmaster Xing Tianyi and the rest merely carried on the accomplishments of the predecessors, but Duan Tianlang brought about new creations. When the design was completed, he had already officially ascended to the apex of Consolidating Equipment Masters. Presently, no one else could surpass him.</p>
 <p>“Weiqing, next, there are some things that you have to complete.” Duan Tianlang smiled, “Even though this design is mainly completed, I still need to make some adjustments. However, I have already created the prescription of the Consolidating Ink based on the design, and I also have most of the materials - after all, you sent a lot of good stuff back from Heavenly Jewel Island the last time. Nonetheless, there is something I need to to personally get.”</p>
 <p>“Senior Uncle, what is it, that even Heavenly Jewel Island doesn’t have?” Zhou Weiqing asked out of curiosity.</p>
