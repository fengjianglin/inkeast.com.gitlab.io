 <p><b>Chapter 179 Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation! (2)</b></p>
 <p>Without question, this was not just an ordinary fight, but a fight for time. In such a manner, guerilla tactics was indeed a good option. As long as Zhou Weiqing could buy enough time, he could achieve final victory.</p>
 <p>However, how could the experienced Gu Site give Zhou Weiqing such a chance? As soon as he saw Zhou Weiqing flying back, a thick gold light sprang up around his body, and in a flash, gold-red flames spurted out of his back, actually pushing Gu Site’s body in a sudden terrifying burst of speed.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing had no idea what kind of Skills the Lion King had, nor did he have any interest in guessing. In truth, what he was actually doing now was not running away, but bringing forth all his power to maximum capacity. As he flew backwards, he did not hesitate to enter the Dragon-Tiger Transformation State, bringing his body to his strongest state.</p>
 <p>The wings behind his back spread out fully, his entire skin surface now purple, with the purple tattoo and scales. Even his eyes were now purple orbs, the powerful aura of his Dragon-Tiger Transformation bursting forth.</p>
 <p>Only when one truly faced Zhou Weiqing in that Dragon-Tiger Transformation State would he be able to understand how powerful that bloodline was.</p>
 <p>Even the Lion King Gu Site, with his pure Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit Lion bloodline… as soon as he sensed the shocking aura in front of him, he couldn’t help but skip a step.</p>
 <p><i>Such a powerful aura! I must not allow this brat to grow up, otherwise he might become the next Heavenly God Tier!</i></p>
 <p>In that instant, a powerful killing intent rose in the Lion King’s heart. He was no longer thinking about his son’s wedding, but the future of the WanShou Empire. Without question, Zhou Weiqing would never belong to the WanShou Empire, and in the future no matter if he was an independent Heavenly Jewel Master or belonged to a Great Saint Lands, it was not something that Gu Site wanted to see. All his life he had spent building up the WanShou Empire and all he thought of was its future, and his own ambitions. To have such an unbelievably outstanding talent in front of him, and not for his own use… then he would have to totally destroy him and not allow him to grow to reach his potential.</p>
 <p>Thinking up to this point, Gu Site had already made up his mind. As long as he gained any advantage, he would definitely try to find a chance to strike hard. Even if he did not manage to kill Zhou Weiqing, he would try to deal a serious injury, enough to leave lasting hidden damage that could not be easily healed. Although the Tiger King Xue Aoying was watching at the side, but Gu Site was not too worried about him. After all, Xue Aoying was not Xue AoTian, and the Lion King was confident that he was more powerful than Xue Aoying. As long as he was careful about things, making it appear like it had been an accident, he was confident in killing Zhou Weiqing before Xue Aoying could react. Once that was accomplished, even if Long Shiya was angry, so what? This was after all right in the depths of the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p>
 <p>Naturally, Zhou Weiqing did not know his opponent’s thoughts, but he could clearly sense a sudden thick killing intent from the Lion King. Upon releasing the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, Zhou Weiqing’s senses and judgement was raised up to a new max, even compared to his previous Demonic Change State it was more than double. As such, though Gu Site was using an eight-Jeweled cultivation level which was much stronger than him, Zhou Weiqing was still able to sense the various changes in the Lion King’s body, even any tiny reverberations of Heavenly Energy.</p>
 <p>This was a truly strange feeling, being able to grasp hold of the changes in his opponents, that was already a huge first-mover advantage to him.</p>
 <p>With the sudden burst of speed from the gold flames on his back, Gu Site almost caught up with Zhou Weiqing instantly. However, at that moment, Zhou Weiqing’s body suddenly executed a sudden turn that was totally against the laws of physics.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing had been flying backwards at high speeds, but all of a sudden his body flew up perpendicularly into the air. As compared to his backward movement, he had suddenly shot up an entire ninety degrees. Even with the Lion King Gu Site’s full powered strike, under such a circumstance, he was unable to react in time, passing by Zhou Weiqing’s feet. By the time he wanted to turn around, Zhou Weiqing was already in midair.</p>
 <p>The reason why Zhou Weiqing had been able to turn directions so abruptly was of course due to the wings behind his back. The power held within those wings were terrifying; not only could they be used to fly, they could be used for attack and defense. In fact, one could be said that even under a circumstance where Zhou Weiqing was unable to use Consolidated Equipment, this was another deadly weapon available to him, comparable to his Demonic Right Leg.</p>
 <p>With the power of the wings and the toughness and flexibility of his own body, Zhou Weiqing was able to force the abrupt change in his flying direction, buying time for himself.</p>
 <p>This time was far too important for Zhou Weiqing. As he flew high up into the air, his six Alexandrite Elemental Jewels flew off his wrist, sparkling with different colours.</p>
 <p>In this icy cavern, the Alexandrite Cat’s Eyes’ lights refracted into a rose red. Their brilliance glowing was obvious in the air of the caverns, drawing everyone’s attention. Even the Tiger King Xue Aoying could not help but exclaim in marvel and jealousy.</p>
 <p>Heavenly Jewels with multiple Elemental Jewels were already extremely rare, let alone someone like Zhou Weiqing with that many Elemental Attributes. Such a Heavenly Jewel Master, if he was able to truly grow, one could just imagine the combat power, it would be more than several times that of any normal cultivation level.</p>
 <p>Six Alexandrite Elemental Jewels flying out… what did that mean? All the powerhouses there knew that it meant Zhou Weiqing was about to unleash the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation!</p>
 <p>The Lion King Gu Site did not think he was able to stop Zhou Weiqing from unleashing the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation. As the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor’s greatest art, he definitely had many ways to unleash it no matter who tried to prevent it, and Gu Site was sure he would have passed them down to Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>As such, after missing the first strike, he did not rush to chase Zhou Weiqing up in the air, instead staying on the ground to gather energy slightly. An illusory image of a giant gold lion slowly rose up behind him, the original thick Heavenly Energy reverberations seeming to calm down. Gu Site’s eyes both turned gold, fully showing his bloodline as a Heavenly Divine Earth Spirit Lion. His right hand slowly raised up, and in that moment his entire right arm turned a golden yellow, chilling long claws extending, turning into that of his main form’s actual arm.</p>
 <p>Although it was just a single arm, but the aura that burst forth from Gu Site was far beyond any ordinary eight-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, yet he was still using the Heavenly Energy of one. This was the state that a powerhouse had attained, and no one could say he was cheating, even though his next attack just felt so terrifying.</p>
 <p>However, the next moment just overthrew everyone’s expectations, leaving them with shock on their faces.</p>
 <p>The Six Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Elemental Jewels in the air did not turn into a normal hexagon like Long Shiya’s formation to form the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation. Instead, the six Elemental Jewels seemed to shuttle back and forth, glowing in an eye-catching brilliance. Instantly, they had formed a strange star-shaped hexagon!</p>
 <p>In truth, this star-shaped hexagon was a simple ‘drawing’, just the stacking of two triangles. However, to those powerhouses watching, it was a whole different meaning.</p>
 <p>Although Long Shiya had invented the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation by himself, that did not mean it could be easily changed. The Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor had spent so many years, gone through so many trials and tribulations, to perfect his Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation to what it was today. The main profound secret behind it was balance - this was clear to all who saw it… but such a balance was just not so easily achieved! Even for Xue AoTian, he did not think he could easily achieve such balance even if he had six Elemental Attribute Jewels!</p>
 <p>Yet, right at this moment, Zhou Weiqing had proven that he had not only achieved it, but it was an almost miraculous change.</p>
 <p>If Zhou Weiqing had just set up a similar Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation, all the powerhouses would have just been marveling at his talent, but they would not think too much else. After all, Zhou Weiqing’s power and innate talent had already surprised them so many times today. However, actually changing the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation from ground up… that was a whole different meaning.</p>
 <p>How long has he even learned the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation? One year? Less than a year!</p>
 <p>That was because the previous time Gu Yingbing had met Zhou Weiqing, he was only at the five-Jeweled stage. And… training with the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation had the prerequisite of needing six Elemental Jewels!</p>
 <p>A time of less than a year… perhaps to be more accurate, it was barely two to three months! Not only had Zhou Weiqing learned the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation, he had even changed it totally to fit himself. That was just too shocking. Furthermore, it looked like the changes he had wrought made it even more balanced.</p>
 <p>A hexagon just meant a shape with six sides, but six obtuse angles and six acute angles were totally different. Each acute angle was like a shining point, and this star-shaped hexagon looked to be more offensive than Long Shiya’s original hexagon shaped Formation.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s six Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Elemental Jewels finally halted in their position within the Formation, and their colours also changed accordingly. However, it was again unlike Long Shiya’s Formation, where each took on the colour of a different Attribute.</p>
 <p>Instead, Zhou Weiqing’s six Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Jewels took their own position in an acute angle edge respectively, and they were somehow still in their Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Jewel form.</p>
 <p>A whole new, equally balanced yet different Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation. This had totally broken away from all the onlookers’ imaginations. This was the first time it had appeared on a battlefield, and it belonged to only one person - Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>Xue AoTian’s feeling was perhaps the strongest. Besides Long Shiya, he could be said to be the only person in the world who understood the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation the most. Only he had fought with Long Shiya so many times, and he had previously studied it in detail as well.</p>
 <p>Almost instantly, Xue AoTian discovered how different Zhou Weiqing’s Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation was, or perhaps its difference from Long Shiya’s one.</p>
 <p>Long Shiya’s Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation was like an art of nature, a harmonious and integrated whole, with the six Attributes each holding the fort in each corner, allowing the six Elemental Attributes to have a miraculous balance. Such balance allowed a major draw on environmental energy, also allowing them to easily transform between each other, or fuse. In that way, Long Shiya was able to use powerful Skills with minimal expenditure.</p>
