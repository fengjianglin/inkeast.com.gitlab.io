Let me see just how you will bathe my XuanTian Palace in blood. I’ll have you know that your wife has already been killed by me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These words had been blurted out in a fit of anger. However, they were like thunder in Zhou Weiqing’s ears. At that very moment, Zhou Weiqing was rooted on the spot with a blank expression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of the XuanTian Palace air force surrounding him in the sky, those facing him could clearly see Zhou Weiqing’s eyes rapidly take on a blood red color that made their hearts shiver with fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing’s entire body trembled as an extremely unstable energy fluctuation suddenly rippled from his body.</span></p>

It was boundless, deathly still and even had traces of grief. Densely packed creaking sounds could be heard from every bone in Zhou Weiqing’s body, while the originally slowly flowing Saint Energy within started to circulate at an astonishing speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An intense silver-white radiance swirled around Zhou Weiqing’s body. This radiance was akin to the light of the stars, making him look as if he was filled with an earth shaking aura of oppressiveness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bing’er was dead? This could no longer be described as a mere blow to Zhou Weiqing. At this time, Zhou Weiqing had really hit a brick wall.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No wonder Dongfang Hanyue did not dare to come out and see me. It turns out that they had actually killed Bing’er.</span></p>

He would perhaps no longer have any reason in such a state, nor the ability to think. However, this state would definitely evoke all the potential within him.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this very moment, all of Zhou Weiqing’s most terrifying power had been brought out. It wrapped around him, and the XuanTian Palace air force, that originally had no intentions of attacking, instantly fell from the sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A terrifying bloodline aura exploded from Zhou Weiqing’s body, filled with the scent of annihilation and destruction. How could these flying Heavenly Beasts that had not even reached the Heavenly King Stage possibly withstand it? The XuanTian air force never imagined that Zhou Weiqing would actually dare to attack them first, and were immediately caught off guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing did not even look at these people. Ray after ray of dark gold light continued to spring from his body. In the next instant, his right hand grasped the rhombus-shape object hanging on his neck and forcefully pulled it off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“XuanTian Palace, XuanTian Palace, this will not end until one of us is dead.”</span></p>

Let me see just how you will annihilate the XuanTian Palace.” A deep and powerful voice suddenly rang out from the abyss as an enormous black figure slowly rose from the darkness. Titanic wings abruptly lifted as a powerful force caught the XuanTian air force that were falling from the sky, allowing them to smoothly land on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">T</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">enebrous Demon Dragon, the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">T</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">enebrous Demon Dragon had actually appeared.</span></p>

However, the swift appearance of the T</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">enebrous Demon Dragon quickly made her feel relieved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was a mere brat that had not even reached the Heavenly King Stage. No matter how angry he became, just what would he be able to do alone? The current Dong Fang had already planned to detain Zhou Weiqing. Given how arrogant he was, if he was allowed to leave today, XuanTian Palace’s reputations would surely suffer a huge blow. No matter what, they had to catch him first. As for exactly how he would be dealt with, it was not urgent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The T</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">enebrous Demon Dragon’s appearance immediately suppressed and forced back the terrifying aura emanating from Zhou Weiqing’s body. However, the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">T</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">enebrous Demon Dragon was still secretly shocked. Like the Terror Sea Dragon, he also detected the Emperor Dragon Bloodline contained within the aura from Zhou Weiqing’s body. In addition, there was also another bloodline power, seeming to be even greater than the Emperor Dragon Bloodline, now fused together with the Emperor Dragon Bloodline.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although his senses told him what it was, all of his mind told him that such a thing could not possibly exist. Yet, the evidence was right before his eyes, and the Tenebrous Demon Dragon had no choice but to accept it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing’s Dark Demon God Tiger Bloodline was originally weaker than the Emperor Dragon Bloodline. However, ever since he had activated the pure Demon God Power within the bloodline, the Dark Demon God Tiger Bloodline had undergone a transformation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing’s expression remained unchanged even as he gazed at the Tenebrous Demon Dragon. Instead, the intense bloodshot color of his eyes grew even deeper. It now looked somewhat similar to the dark red eyes of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No one can stop me, not even you.” Zhou Weiqing’s ice-cold voice was emotionless. He lifted the right hand containing the Spatial Teleportation Gem, as Saint Energy that was as silver as the stars itself frantically surged towards it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was he going to do? This was the question in the minds of everyone who could clearly see Zhou Weiqing’s actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His words had been so bold and arrogant, how could he possibly be using the Spatial Teleportation Gem to leave this place?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Still, that should be the normal response. What chance would he have in the face of so many powerful experts?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Dong Fang did not plan on letting Zhou Weiqing leave. Once he left, he would surely become a mortal malady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Stop him Senior Demon Dragon, we cannot let him escape.” Dong Fang said in a somewhat anxious manner. Meanwhile, the four Grand Elders and her also rose into the sky and headed straight for Zhou Weiqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Terrifying energy undulations rippled in the sky. The simultaneous explosion of Heavenly Energy from five Heavenly Emperor Stage experts was a very terrible sight. Even a Heavenly God Tier expert would not dare to be careless in the face of such a lineup.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing silently hovered in mid-air as if he was oblivious to everything that was happening around him. Under the strong infusion of Saint Energy, the pendant in his hand shone with dazzling silver light. It was just like a silver sun, emitting incomparably intense rays that no one dared to look directly at.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Tenebrous Demon Dragon had been heavily injured after the battle with the Terror Sea Dragon. It was only logical that it had not recovered after a short few days. The reason why it had appeared was because it had been startled by Zhou Weiqing’s earliest shout. To think that someone actually dared to yell Dongfang Hanyue’s name at XianTian Citadel. Moreover, the rudeness of this person. How could the Tenebrous Demon Dragon not have been shocked? How powerful must one be to say such words!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thus, he had flew over immediately. What he found, was Zhou Weiqing. The Tenebrous Demon Dragon did not have any malice towards Zhou Weiqing. In contrast, it had a rather good impression of the latter. After all, Zhou Weiqing did save him back then. If not, it would not even be able to appear alive here today.</span></p>

Although the Tenebrous Demon Dragon did not know what had happened, it was better to capture him first. The members of XuanTian Palace would naturally handle the aftermath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Pitch-black light caused the color of the land to change as an enormous curtain of darkness silently descended. It covered the area within a thousand meter radius.</span></p>

That’s right. It was the Tenebrous Sealing Formation once more.</span></p>

Back then, it had needed to borrow the power of the Tenebrous Sealing Formation to deal with a powerful existence like the Terror Sea Dragon. As for Zhou Weiqing, although the Tenebrous Demon Dragon was gravely injured, once he used this technique it should be more than enough to take him down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon seeing the curtain of black light engulf Zhou Weiqing, Dongfang and the four Grand Elders breathed out in relief. If this brat was allowed to leave, there would surely be a calamity in future. It was so serious that it could even be said to be a ticking time bomb for Xuantian Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As long as the Tenebrous Demon Dragon was able to control the Tenebrous Sealing Formation and the cultivation level of the person activating the Spatial Teleportation Gem did not exceed it, it would be impossible to leave via teleportation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing’s gaze remained frosty as he continued to release his Saint Energy. He did not seem to care about anything that was happening in the outside world. The only things that mattered were the thick bloody light at the bottom of his eyes and the frightening will that seemed to lean towards dying together with his enemies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Tenebrous Demon Dragon said in a low voice, “Young man, I do not know what has happened, but you need to calm down. I will not tolerate your arrogance. Your cultivation level is already very good amongst the younger generation, but it is still impossible for you to teleport away inside my Tenebrous Sealing Formation. Surrender now. We can always discuss everything.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Surrender?” Zhou Weiqing’s heart had completely descended into a half-crazed state, “You do not have the power to make me surrender. Do you really believe that the Tenebrous Sealing Formation can affect me? It’s too late.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing his icy voice felt like falling into a snow pit, a feeling that made one tremble all over. It was as if that malicious killing intent was so strong that it was almost visible, making it seem as if a blood-coloured light was actually emitting from his body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For the sake of his wife, he had come here alone and challenged the entire XuanTian Palace. Such courage was already very admirable. Even in the face of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon, his presence and aura did not seem to be the slightest bit inferior to the former. All of this caused the watching XuanTian Palace experts to be dumbfounded.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was precisely at this moment that a clear cracking sound suddenly emerged from Zhou Weiqing’s hand. An intense silver light shot out and dashed into the skies.</span></p>

However, in the next moment, the silver light had already filled the entire space of the formation within a several thousand meter radius, pushing it to its limits.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A titanic and complicated symbol diagram emerged in the air. The powerful Spatial Attribute Energy fluctuations caused the surroundings to distort.</span></p>

With a sudden flap of its wings, powerful Tenebrous Attribute energies surged towards the silver light.</span></p>
