 <p><strong>Chapter 12 Physical Jewel Consolidated Equipment – Overlord Bow (3)</strong></p>
 <p>After less than an hour, the bathroom doors opened, and the next instance Zhou Weiqing felt his bindings loosened as the string was untied. When he looked up, he was absolutely stunned instantaneously.</p>
 <p>The Shangguan Bing’er in front of him had her blue hair wet around her head, the large Heavenly Jewel Master robe wrapped around her body; because she had just taken a bath, her beautiful face was blushing red like a ripe apple, her entire body also giving off an alluring scent after bathing. That incomparable attraction made Zhou Weiqing’s mind freeze in its tracks.</p>
 <p>“Little Hoodlum. Go take a bath.” Shangguan Bing’er suddenly blushed and turned around to the side. The reason was very simple, she accidentally saw that Little Fatty Zhou’s certain body part bulge out*. Earlier when that rascal was daydreaming, his body has gotten a … reaction.</p>
 <p>The speed that Zhou Weiqing took his bath was in no way faster than Shangguan Bing’er. Throughout the journey, Shangguan Bing’er had frequently cleaned her body in creeks or rivers while he prepared food during that time. As such, he was extremely dirty as you could imagine. Finally being able to take a bath, how could he not be happy and slowly enjoy it.</p>
 <p>When Zhou Weiqing came out from the bathroom, he saw in front of him that the quilt from the bed had been spread out on the ground. Obviously, this was the place that he would be sleeping tonight.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er also couldn’t help but take a second look at him when he walked out from the bathroom; although Zhou Weiqing was not particularly handsome, that he was the decent looking sort that was easy on the eye. Most particularly was his grandiose stature, after absorbing the black pearl, his height had reached nearly 1.75 metres, you definitely could not tell that he was less than 14 years old from his looks, especially from the nimble and resourceful black eyes he had. At this time after changing into a Heavenly Jewel Master robe, it was as if he looked like a totally different person.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go.” Shangguan Bing’er was not willing to show the chaos in her heart to be seen by him, and immediately set off again. The both of them wearing the Heavenly Jewel Master robe, although you couldn’t say they were a perfect match, but at least when they walked together there wasn’t that huge contrast like when they were entering the city.</p>
 <p>As they left the hotel, the hotel boss’ eyes nearly popped out of their sockets when he saw their Heavenly Jewel Master gowns. He had never expected that one day he would have two Heavenly Jewel Masters would be staying at his tiny little hotel.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing felt the obvious change when they once again walked onto the streets of Flying Hill City. The passer-bys on the street would obviously give way to both him and Shangguan Bing’er, their eyes showing much respect. This was the treatment towards Heavenly Jewel Masters, even in Fei Li Empire such a formidable empire, the status of Heavenly Jewel Masters was still incomparably lofty.</p>
 <p>“Battalion Commander, can we walk slowly?” Having just taken a long enjoyable bath, Zhou Weiqing felt his whole body being extremely comfortable and languid, yet as soon as Shangguan Bing’er had exited, she had moved at a high speed.</p>
 <p>After just a short while, Zhou Weiqing discovered with some amazement that Shangguan Bing’er had actually led him to return to near the Skill-Storing Palace again, but instead of entering it again, she walked towards a bunch of short houses opposite the Palace. These short houses did not look unique in anyway, and was composed of several small courtyards, and compared with the grand architecture of the Skill-Storing Palace, it looked very simple and ordinary. However, as they got closer, Zhou Weiqing actually discovered that the area was unexpectedly very quiet, and very few people actually approached it. In between the small courtyards there was an alley of about two meters width.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er walked familiarly deeper through the alleys, and as they walked along she told Zhou Weiqing: “If we are not wearing the Heavenly Jewel Master robes, once we approach this area, we will be stopped by the Jewel masters who are guarding this place. A Consolidating Equipment Master is staying in each courtyard, and they are all very honoured elders. Later, you better be carefully, if you speak rubbish at such a place, I cannot guarantee your safety. In any country, the status of Consolidating Equipment Master is absolute. There are even fewer of them than Heavenly Jewel Masters, in fact most of them are actually Heavenly Jewel Masters who have the spatial attribute.”</p>
 <p>“En.” Zhou Weiqing agreed, this time he did not trash talk again.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er brought him to one of the deeper small courtyards and stopped in front of the gate; she walked forward and knocked lightly on the gate, “Huyan Senior, are you at home?”</p>
 <p>A moment later, the gate opened, a middle-aged man walked out from within. He was very tall, about two meters, but not very well built and had a slim figure, looking around 40-years of age, with his face like an ancient moon, wearing simple grey cotton garments. He seemed very ordinary, except with a very cold face.</p>
 <p>The first thing Zhou Weiqing noted were his hands, both were very large, slender just like his stature, his ten fingers were clear like jade, as if his hands were the most important core of his body.</p>
 <p>When Shangguan Bing’er saw the middle-aged man, she immediately bowed in greeting, saying respectfully: “Wind Senior, Hello. Is Huyan Senior in?”</p>
 <p>On seeing her, the middle-aged man was somewhat surprised, “Oh it’s you, little girl! You’ve promoted so quickly? Huyan that old fellow is in, but you know he is famous for being stingy, he will not lift a finger to help. Do you have enough money prepared?”</p>
 <p>Hearing the description from the middle-aged man, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but to give out a quick laugh, saying to her in a low voice: “Battalion Commander, isn’t that Huyan Senior your teacher then?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er turned head and glared at him angrily, “Shut up! Quickly greet Wind Senior now.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing then saluted the middle-aged, “Hello senior, my name is Little Fatty Zhou.”</p>
 <p>The middle-aged man nodded, saying: “Comes in then.” As he said that, he entered the house.</p>
 <p>They entered the courtyard behind him. Inside, it seemed like a different world altogether, besides a small path that was paved with gravel which led to the main house, the entire courtyard was filled with various flowers and plants. Although there weren’t any huge trees, but it was a scene of abundant spring beauty, the air fresh, and the fragrance of the flowers gladdening the heart.</p>
 <p>As they walked along the path and entered the room right in the middle, the middle-aged man said loudly: “Huyan Old Man, guests have arrived.”</p>
 <p>The furnishings within the room were arranged elegantly, the innermost part of the room there was a screen of painted art, and in the front was a square table and a large round-backed wooden armchair, there weren’t actually any furnishing for entertaining guests.</p>
 <p>Before Zhou Weiqing had a chance to size up the room, he noticed a meatball walking in from a side room, when he focused his eyes, he realised it was an old man.</p>
 <p>This man looked to be around 60 to 70 years old, his beard and hair totally white, but was still glowing with health. His face did not have wrinkles, but his eyes had been squeezed by the fat on his face that only two slits remained, yet they still seemed to glow with vigor. He was dressed in the similar simple grey cotton garment, but his sleeves were particularly long, covering both hands. The most obvious characteristic was his stature, as he looked like a large round watermelon.</p>
