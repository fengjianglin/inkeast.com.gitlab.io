 <p>Silence enveloped the entire peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain momentarily; even both Xue AoTian and Shangguan Tianyang went silent as well. At this moment, everyone felt as though they were unable to read Zhou Weiqing at all. Nobody could tell what exactly his cultivation base was. There were also no Heavenly Jewels around both his wrists - it was not difficult for cultivators to conceal their Heavenly Jewels once they had reached the Heavenly Emperor Stage.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After Zhou Weiqing had killed off Tian Yu, he did not descend to the ground immediately. Instead, he hovered in the sky and calmly equipped himself with his Legendary Set.</p>
 <p>Piece by piece, dark golden light continued to light up all around his body. Due to the fact that the light halo was flashing too fast, it was hard to distinguish the number of pieces of Legendary Set he was equipped with. However, the final color that emerged was dark gold.</p>
 <p>The Legendary Set itself was originally hard to distinguish with the naked eye. Once the complete set was equipped, one would be able to tell how many pieces there were based on the aura it gave off. However, if the Legendary Set was not complete and there was only a shade of dark golden light, it would still be difficult to distinguish.</p>
 <p>That was exactly the case for Zhou Weiqing. After he had equipped himself with his Legendary Set, his massive Legendary Set had given off an overbearing aura. However, it was not complete!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Looking at Zhou Weiqing’s current condition, the anger within Fen Tian had simmered down a little. This fellow was too strange - nothing he did made any sense at all. As the Sect Leader of the Peerless Sect, he did not even have a complete Legendary Set. Even so, he still managed to kill off one of his Heavenly Emperors. What exactly was he doing?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Holding onto the Dual Legendary Hammers in his hands, Zhou Weiqing shouted in the sky, “Next! Come on up.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, the powerhouses on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain gradually woke up to their senses. Shangguan Tianyang said without hesitation, “We concede defeat for this fight.” The Heaven’s Expanse Palace’s Heavenly King got switched out and was replaced by another Heavenly King.</p>
 <p>Xue AoTian glared at Shangguan Tianyang and said, “We concede defeat too. We’ll send in another person.” As he spoke, he replaced the representative with another Heavenly King. The Lion King Gu SiTe whispered in Xue AoTian’s ear and the latter shook his head.</p>
 <p>Next, it was the Passion Valley’s turn. Huang Xingyun pondered for a moment before saying, “We concede defeat too.” The person he had sent in earlier on was a Heavenly King. Even a Heavenly Emperor was killed off that easily, what was the point of sending his Heavenly King into the battlefield?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everything happened too fast - the Blood Red Hell had not even sent in the next person into the battle line upon Tian Yu’s death.</p>
 <p>At this moment, everybody’s gaze fell on Fen Tian, waiting to see how he was going to react to the situation before him. The Grand Tournament had already entered the fifth cycle, but the Peerless Sect had only sent out three people thus far.</p>
 <p>In the eyes of everyone, it seemed as though the Peerless Sect only had those three strong powerhouses. However, Zhou Weiqing’s display of power had put Fen Tian in a difficult position. Naturally, he could tell that Zhou Weiqing was using the Saint Energy and the Destructive Attribute had no effect on him at all. However, both Fen Tian and Huang Xingyun had a major disadvantage - they could not comprehend Zhou Weiqing at all.</p>
 <p>It was inevitable. After all, Zhou Weiqing was way too young – all this time, he was not much of a threat in their eyes. When the Blood Red Hell had suffered losses because of him, catching Fen Tian’s attention, the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands had already begun. Even if Fen Tian was wary of Zhou Weiqing, deep down in his heart, he still felt that a mere Zhou Weiqing would not be able to be compared to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace or the Heavenly Snow Mountain.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, at this moment, Fen Tian had suddenly realized that he might have committed a huge mistake. With the Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya, the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue, as well as the mysterious Zhou Weiqing who he could not comprehend, the Peerless Sect was no less of a threat compared to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p>
 <p>Hence, at this juncture, dealing with the matter at hand had become the biggest problem. If Shen Mo had not gone against Long Shiya earlier, sending Shen Mo in would be the most ideal move. If that was the case, in the event that Shen Mo managed to kill off Zhou Weiqing, the Peerless Sect would be done for.</p>
 <p>A light flashed across Fen Tian’s eyes and he looked at Huang Xingyun, who was not far from him. This time, he did not try to hide his intentions. The light flashed within his eyes, seemingly hinting something to Huang Xingyun.</p>
 <p>Huang Xingyun furrowed his brows and gently shook his head.</p>
 <p>Fen Tian narrowed his eyes and said in a deep voice, “Shen Bu, it’s your turn.” Ultimately, he chose to continue to repress himself. However, even he himself had no idea how long his patience would last.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A woman with an enchanting figure, who looked as though she was in her thirties, walked out from behind. She looked extremely beautiful, every movement she made exuded all kinds of charms. Her eyes gave off seductive vibes. When she walked out elegantly, it seemed as though her slender waist would snap at any moment. She was practically like an enchanting Snake Woman.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Yes, Hell Lord.”</p>
 <p>Shen Bu did not rapidly soar to the sky. Instead, she walked up step by step towards the sky, as though there was a staircase built in it. With every step she took, her ‘S’-shaped figure could clearly be seen. She had a bashful look on her face; the charm she exuded could cause the hearts of any weaker cultivators to beat rapidly beyond their control.</p>
 <p>The impact made on Zhou Weiqing was the most direct. That was because Shen Bu’s gaze was fixated on him from the very beginning. Zhou Weiqing never knew that a woman’s gaze could express that many emotions.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There was grief, and excitement in the next moment, followed by bashfulness and anger with a tinge of flirtiness. Every single emotion seemed to have tugged on his heartstrings. Zhou Weiqing could not help but open his mouth by the sight of her, but at least he did not drool.</p>
 <p>However, nobody would mock him at this very moment. That was because there were quite a number of people on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain who actually drooled. Even a woman would blush when she looked at Shen Bu’s body and every movement.</p>
 <p>She was Shen Mo’s cousin. Within the Blood Red Hell, her status was lower than that of Shen Mo’s because of her cultivation base. However, she was the only person that Fen Tian did not dare to offend.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shen Bu had always been naturally charming since she was a child. Even as her cultivation base increased, she was not particularly outstanding in other areas. However, her charm merged with her personal Heavenly Energy to form a special mutated attribute, which the Blood Red Hell termed as the Charm Attribute. In the past, the people who she could seduce were limited to male cultivators with a lower cultivation base than her. However, after she had merged her Charm Attribute with the Destructive Attribute, the Charm Attribute was enhanced, becoming a unique ability of hers. She was only a Mid Level Heavenly Emperor, but when she had fully activated her Charm Attribute, even Fen Tian could not completely resist it. Furthermore, it affected both males and females.</p>
 <p>This time, Shen Bu was Fen Tian’s trump card in this Grand Tournament. Originally, he planned to use her against Shangguan Tianyang or Xue AoTian. However, with Zhou Weiqing’s strong powers, he had no choice but to send her out earlier in the tournament than expected.</p>
 <p>Even though Fen Tian looked extremely mad, his heart was very cool and collected. He had heard stories about Zhou Weiqing’s love affair. As a hot-blooded young man, it was only normal for him to fall for women. Hence, after much consideration, he had decided to send Shen Bu out to deal with Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>The main reason why he sent out his trump card, Shen Bu, that easily was because Fen Tian had finally taken Zhou Weiqing seriously. From this moment, Fen Tian saw him as a true leader of a Saint Land, and wanted to deal with him as one.</p>
 <p>Even though Fen Tian had exchanged blows with Zhou Weiqing earlier, he did not use his full force at that time. Although he had experienced Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy and Attribute, as well as his Heavenly Emperor powers, in Fen Tian’s heart, Zhou Weiqing was far from Xue AoTian or Shangguan Tianyang’s level. However, when Zhou Weiqing’s unprotected body took a direct hit from his Heavenly Emperor, he was clear that the young man before his eyes posed a threat to his plan - and it was a rather huge one. If he could take the opportunity to get rid of him during the Grand Tournament, it would clearly be of a great advantage to his future plans. Furthermore, Fen Tian wanted to see how strong Zhou Weiqing’s true power was. Of course, killing off Zhou Weiqing before he got to display his full power would be the most ideal scenario.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shen Bu looked at Zhou Weiqing with a gentle gaze, as she continued to ascend to the sky, step by step. Both parties did not use any abilities against each other, or mobilize the atmospheric energy. The bright and beautiful sunlight shone down on the both of them; under the golden light, they looked like a pair of long-lost lovers that were reunited, as they drew closer to one another.</p>
 <p>Shen Bu’s gaze did not intensify as she got closer to Zhou Weiqing. Instead, it became more gentle. If the initial gaze was seductive in nature, then her current gaze had gradually caused one to feel pity and sad, akin to a wife waiting for the return of her husband.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was in a daze; his gaze was clearly frozen, fixating on Shen Bu who was approaching. Even the Dual Legendary Hammers had fell out of his hands.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>All the members of the Peerless Sect began to panic - even Long Shiya and Wu Yunyue had stopped cultivating and focused their attention on what was happening in the sky.</p>
 <p>The Blood Red Hell did not let their guard down either, All the Blood Red Hell powerhouses stared intensely at the Peerless Sect. The moment anyone from the Peerless Sect had the intention to save Zhou Weiqing, they would attack them immediately.</p>
 <p>The three sisters, Shangguan Xue’er, Fei’er, and Bing’er, looked extremely worried. Little Witch, on the other hand, looked angry. Only Tian’er looked calm.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Aren’t you worried?” asked Ling Dang, the person who was fully decked in a cloak. She was the person that Zhou Weiqing sent out to fight earlier.</p>
 <p>Tian’er snorted and said, “What’s there to worry? Even if that bastard is completely enamored by her gentleness, that woman will not be able to break his defense. As for control over his mind? Hmph!”</p>
 <p>Naturally, the other women had overheard Tian’er’s words. They seemed to have experienced a sudden epiphany and the worry in their eyes started to fade.&nbsp;</p>
