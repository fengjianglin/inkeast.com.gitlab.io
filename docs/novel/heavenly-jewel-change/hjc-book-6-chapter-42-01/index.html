 <p><b>Chapter 42 The Power of Spatial Rend (1)</b></p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing did not pause after knocking back the five bald seniors, taking a few steps forward. The rest of the roommates, including Ma Qun, followed him out. No matter what they felt earlier, be it righteous anger or fear, they wanted to know what happened next.</p>
 <p>The five bald seniors had taken a huge knock, especially the leader who had been struck by Zhou Weiqing’s fist. Currently, their faces were filled with shock and disbelief. After all, as Physical Jewel Masters, most of them had some form of strength boost mixed about this, and they were confident in their physical ability. Alas, when Zhou Weiqing launched his simple attack, they were not even able to put up a smidgen of resistance.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing shouted loudly: “Commoner freshmen, come on out everyone, come and see, these are our seniors, they came here to collect protection fees from us. If any of you paid them earlier, you can come here and collect back your money.”</p>
 <p>The 3 Jeweled bald senior jumped up, still numb in the area where Zhou Weiqing had hit him just now. With a mix of anger and fear, he stared at Zhou Weiqing and cried out: “You little brat, are you asking for death? We won’t let you go so easily.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly, saying: “I never planned to let you go easily either! You are all Physical Jewel Masters, go ahead, use your Consolidated Equipment. I want to see the power of your Consolidated Equipment! Ehh, why aren’t you using it? Could it be, you don’t have any Consolidated Equipment? Or are you just scared of me?”</p>
 <p>In just a short instant, almost the entire commoner dormitory level, from freshmen to seniors, had heard the commotion and many had popped out to have a look. Looking at the five bald seniors, many of the students had discontented looks on their faces; not just the freshmen, but even some of the seniors as well.</p>
 <p>Seeing that there was a crowd, Zhou Weiqing cried out loudly: “I’m sure most of you know who these five people are. Earlier, they told me that the commoner dormitory has a rule, a rule that all rooms have to pay them 100 gold per month. I don’t know whether the rest of you are willing to pay or not, but I for sure am not going to pay that. Baldies, remember who I, Your Father, am. My name is Zhou Weiqing, and from today, your so-called rule is abolished. Get lost!”</p>
 <p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, many of the freshmen erupted in a loud cheer, but the strange thing was that all the seniors remained silent, most of them looking at Zhou Weiqing with a pitying look.</p>
 <p>The three Jeweled bald senior glared coldly at Zhou Weiqing. “Little brat, you are indeed strong. Every year, there are always a few people like you among the freshmen. However, you will regret it.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily: “I may not know whether or not I will regret this, but what I do know for sure is that if you do not get lost now, you will definitely regret it.”</p>
 <p>“Little brat, do not be so arrogant.” At that same moment, a deep, serious voice spoke from the direction of the seniors’ rooms. As soon as they heard the voice, joy appeared on the bald seniors’ faces. The onlooking seniors instantly parted to reveal a path, most of their faces showing a look of respect or fear.</p>
 <p>A male senior wearing the commoner uniform walked slowly through the path. He was also bald, and stood about 1.8 metres tall with broad muscular shoulders. Although he was walking slowly, he seemed to give a very oppressive aura. The most eye-catching thing about his appearance was a long knife scar on the right side of his face.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing could obviously feel a sense of danger emitting from this man, but the smile on his face did not change at all. “Brother Lang” The five bald seniors called out respectfully, quickly moving behind him as if he was their savior.</p>
 <p>The scar-faced man looked at Zhou Weiqing, his gaze as piercing as a sharp blade, and when he spoke, it was as if his voice a metallic, deadly tone. “My name is Zang Lang. Were you the one who said you were abolishing my rule of the protection fee?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly: “I do not care what Lang you are, as long as you don’t provoke me.”</p>
 <p>Zang Lang’s eyes narrowed and he nodded, saying: “Very good. You have to pay a toll for destroying public property, come with me.” As he said that, he walked past Zhou Weiqing and headed out.</p>
 <p>The other seniors looked at Zhou Weiqing like he was a dead person, while the other freshmen looked at him with hope in their faces. Zhou Weiqing laughed and patted himself on the chest, saying: “Don’t worry, don’t worry, everyone go back to your own business. Relax, even if I have to beat him up into a dead Lang, I won’t let him take the so-called protection fee.”</p>
 <p>As he said that, Zhou Weiqing headed out as well. Amongst his roommates, the first one to follow him out was Kou Rui. Ma Qun hesitated for a while before following as well, while the others exchanged looks and snuck back into the room.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing had his hands in his pockets, casually walking out of the dormitory behind Zang Lang and his five bald subordinates. They walked past the main school building right into the main square, where there was much open space, before they all finally stopped.</p>
 <p>As Zang Lang stopped, he turned to look at Zhou Weiqing, who had a nonchalant look on his face, and said coldly: “If you can defeat me, you can set the rules of the commoner dormitory. If you lose, you have to listen to me.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed out loud. “Are you having a fever? I’m not here to bet with you, if you defeat me you think you can control me?”</p>
 <p>Zang Lang said passively: “What do you want then?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s smile suddenly disappeared, as a red light flashed in his eyes. “I just want to beat you up until even your mother doesn’t recognize you.” As he said that, his left leg struck the ground and his body charged forward towards Zang Lang like a bolt of lightning, his right foot striking forth.</p>
 <p>Zang Lang’s eyes narrowed, and he raised his foot as well to meet Zhou Weiqing’s right foot. A huge explosion ensued, and as Zhou Weiqing landed gently on the ground, Zang Lang’s entire body was blown back several metres, but as he was flying in mid air, his body twisted in a strange movement, somehow defusing the inertia and he managed to somersault and land on the ground gently, although in doing so he staggered back 3 steps before regaining his balance.</p>
 <p>There were at least 50-60 of the commoner students who had followed them to watch the fight, and loud gasps of surprise came from the onlooking crowd upon the scene. Zang Lang’s face was no longer as calm and passive as before, and there was shock in his eyes as he looked at Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>Ma Qun, who was standing at the side, couldn’t help but feel a spasm in his stomach, as if remembering the pain that Zhou Weiqing’s kick had caused him the other day.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing did not launch a follow up attack, looking at Zang Lang disdainfully as he gave a cold humph. “An upper Shi Level Heavenly Jewel Master with the Coordination Physical Jewel. You better use your Elemental Jewels as well, or else you will not have a chance.”</p>
 <p>Indeed, there were three pure red Jade physical Jewels circulating Zang Lang’s right wrist, glowing brilliantly. His Heavenly Energy cultivation level seemed to be slightly higher than Zhou Weiqing’s, but it had been a terrible mistake to exchange a direct blow with the Strength based Zhou Weiqing, furthermore with his right leg! At that moment, Zang Lang’s leg was totally numb from the blow, and that was already with his Coordination boost managing to deflect much of the power from the blow. After all, Zhou Weiqing’s strength had almost matched the Mid Level Zun Stage Ming Yu who was also of the Strength Attribute - how could Zang Lang who was only of three sets of Heavenly Jewels, and with the Coordination Attribute match him in pure strength.</p>
 <p>Just as Zhou Weiqing finished speaking, Zang Lang took a deep breath and lifted his left hand, and a brilliant red light flashed out followed by a burst of hot air, and as he pointed toward Zhou Weiqing, five large fireballs flew towards him.</p>
 <p>This was a skill that Zhou Weiqing was familiar with. Previously, it was this very skill which Difuya had almost finished him off with. Of course, Zang Lang was not only a Heavenly Jewel Master, but also currently with three sets, and the strength of this skill was definitely much greater than what she had used. At the same time, Zang Lang launched himself towards Zhou Weiqing, one of his Physical Jewels morphing into a long dagger in his right hand, as his figure seemed to flicker and fade in the onlookers’ vision as he flew forward right behind the fireballs.</p>
 <p>In a fight between Jewel Masters, strength was not the only deciding factor. Having felt Zhou Weiqing’s strength to be way above his, Zang Lang finally burst forth with his full power.</p>
 <p>The fireball skill was only of a two Star Rating, and was one of the most common skills for a first Jewel amongst Fire Attribute Elemental and Heavenly Jewel Masters. However, one could ever underestimate any skill, especially when used by a Heavenly Jewel Master. Such a fireball, when used by Zang Lang, was like heaven and earth when compared to the one that Difuya had used on Zhou Weiqing in the Stars Forest, with a much greater power indeed.</p>
 <p>To everyone’s shock, Zhou Weiqing stood there without moving an inch, his mouth set in scornful look. As the five fireballs were about to strike him, his left hand swept forward.</p>
 <p>A strange, profound arc appeared from Zhou Weiqing’s left hand, and a loud, ear-piercing tearing sound sounded out as a 3 chi long black scar appeared in the air before Zhou Weiqing, following his hand’s movement. It was as if in that very instance, the air had been torn apart, warping the atmosphere around the area in a several yard radius.</p>
 <p>A strong suction force seemed to be suddenly released by the strange black tear in the air, and the five fireballs which had been rushing towards Zhou Weiqing suddenly turned around, vanishing deep into the black crack.</p>
 <p>That… what was that skill?! To the commoner students all around, none of them had even heard of such a skill, let alone seen it before. Everyone stared at it in shock, their jaws dropping to the ground.</p>
 <p>The one with the strongest feeling was Zang Lang himself; at that moment, he had been charging forward, and was right behind the five fireballs. However, when the air had twisted, the black line that had formed and the sudden suction force had caused him to stop, having to circulate all his Heavenly Energy just to stop himself from being sucked into it.</p>
 <p>Indeed, what Zhou Weiqing had used was the Spatial Skill which he had Stored from the Silver Emperor - the Spatial Rend! The effect of the Spatial Rend was highly dependant on the cultivation level of the user. If Zhou Weiqing only had a single set of Jewels, it would have been a 1 chi long tear in the air, lasting for only a second; now that he had three sets of Jewels, it was a 3 chi long tear lasting 3 seconds! This was not just simply being three times stronger, as its effect and usage was multiplied several-fold.</p>
