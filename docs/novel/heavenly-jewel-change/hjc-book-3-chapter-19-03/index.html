 <p><b>Chapter 19 Demonic Right Leg (3)</b></p>
 <p>“It looks like this is indeed a Demonic Right Leg. Wahaha!” Zhou Weiqing danced around with joy. Although it was currently difficult for him to control his right leg properly, and was rather problematic when moving right now, its sheer strength more than made up for that. After all, he could slowly train to control that great strength, but who else could have such an awesome right leg? This was absolutely in the territory of a secret weapon.</p>
 <p>During the following long and dreary travel, Zhou Weiqing actually became the busiest person. He followed close to the troop, but did actually join them, instead moving forward completely on foot, unceasing using his Demonic Right Leg to improve its coordination with the rest of his body, and to ensure that he could control its strength. After these ten days of hard work, he had basically adapted to it. Although it couldn’t be said that he could fully control it perfectly, he could at least move normally, and was whenever necessary he could still make use of its strength.</p>
 <p>After much experimentation, Zhou Weiqing found that the strength of his right leg was truly quite terrifying, when he injected Heavenly Energy into the leg, it was boosted more than five times that of any other body parts. What was even more fearful was that it did not feel any pain, which was by itself another formidable weapon. When he discovered that fact, he was a little frightened and quickly inspected his ‘third leg’ carefully [1. LOL, this little rascal does it again]; once he determined that it was not affected by the Demonic Right Leg, he breathed a sigh of relief and relaxed greatly. If his third leg no longer had any feeling, he would not want to live anymore...</p>
 <p>The army has marched constantly towards the south, and although the Heavenly Bow Empire was not very big, they had still taken 20 days to get close to the front lines.</p>
 <p>“We just need to go forward another 300 miles before we arrive at the camp on the frontlines.” Shangguan Bing’er said to Zhou Weiqing. As they travelled together, although she wasn’t exactly very amiable, but she was not malicious or harsh, just treating him like an ordinary subordinate.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing could obviously feel Shangguan Bing’er relaxing a little after she said those words. He knew from what Xiao Ru Se told him that this was Shangguan Bing’er’s first time carrying out such a task, and now that she was on the verge of completing it, it was natural for her to feel a little relieved.</p>
 <p>After all, Shangguan Bing’er was considered an important national treasure of the Heavenly Bow Empire, even if she was on the frontlines, the military command would not dare to put her in any danger, after all, a Heavenly Jewel Master who had not fully grown completely was still relatively vulnerable. If anything happened to her, it would be a huge loss to the entire Empire and their future plans.</p>
 <p>“Bing’er, I want to discuss a matter with you.” Zhou Weiqing said solemnly.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er shot a look at him and said: “Speak.”</p>
 <p>“When we reach the military camp, let me return to the Company, I want to go forth into the battlefield to fight and kill the enemy.” Zhou Weiqing was not joking, he knew that if he followed Shangguan Bing’er, he would likely not have any chance to actually enter combat.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er was a little surprised, “You don't want to follow me?”</p>
 <p>Just as Zhou Weiqing was about to explain himself, all of a sudden, his expression changed drastically; both his feet trod on the stirrup, as he used that as a pivot to throw his entire body sideways, leaping forth and hugging Shangguan Bing’er in his arms, his momentum knocking her off her horse.[2. #SpideySense makes its return!]</p>
 <p>*Peng* in the next split second, an arrow flew past their bodies, almost brushing them, before nailing deep onto the nearby road. If Zhou Weiqing had been just a little late in reacting, that arrow would have pierced right through Shangguan Bing’er.</p>
 <p>“Enemy attack!” Zhou Weiqing gave a loud shout as he held onto Shangguan Bing’er and vaulted away, hiding both of them at the underbelly of her horse.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er also awoke to the situation, and both of them suddenly simultaneously thought of something: <i>Silent Tracking Arrow</i>.</p>
 <p>That arrow, before it struck, it did not give out any sound, nor did it stir the air at all as it passed, otherwise with Shangguan Bing’er’s 8th Stage of Heavenly Energy, she could not have possibly missed it. Zhou Weiqing had only been able to dodge it because of a sudden sense of danger in his heart, and he had reacted subconsciously to save her. This was not the instinct of a human, but the instinct of a wild animal - that large black tiger.</p>
 <p>“It isn’t the Silent Tracking Arrow, it should be the Silent Arrow, otherwise I would already be hit by it. Let go of me.” Shangguan Bing’er said rather rapidly.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing had by now quickly taken off the Wind Hat from his head to use as a shield, but Shangguan Bing’er was still embraced in his arms. Of course, she was wearing her armor now, and it wasn’t exactly comfortable hugging her now.</p>
 <p>“We’ve almost reached our main campsite, how could there be an enemy ambush here?” Zhou Weiqing said as he began to circulate his Heavenly Energy. This was his first time actually facing a real enemy, and if he were to say that he wasn’t feeling anxious, that would be a lie.</p>
 <p>At this moment, that inexplicable sense of danger arrived once again; he had not let go of Shangguan Bing’er yet, so he just carried her and tumbled away once more. *Puff* blood spurted out from the position that they were just in, as Shangguan Bing’er’s horse was shot and pierced through with an arrow, as it savagely pierced through where they had been a moment ago.</p>
 <p>At this time, a disturbance arose in the troops, as the archers quickly nocked their bows and shot around into the surrounding areas, while the infantry troops quickly surrounded the area, trying to protect their commander.</p>
 <p>However, at this time, there were only the sounds of explosions as well as screams. Zhou Weiqing led Shangguan Bing’er weaving in and out of the crowd. She had Activated her Heavenly Jewels and leapt out of his embrace; although she was wearing armor, she still moved as swiftly as wind as she flew off.</p>
 <p>Only then did Zhou Weiqing see the enemy clearly. There weren’t many of them, only around ten or so, but they were moving at extremely astonishing speeds, especially the person who was charging in the forefront, both hands brandishing an exaggeratedly large warhammer, with each of the warhammers as large as a tabletop, with a seemingly evil aura. As the arrows shot towards him, they were all easily deflected, and none of the melee troops were able to even get close to him. In a short span of time, more than ten soldiers had died a tragic death to the huge warhammer.</p>
 <p>This person looked to be over 40 years old is, with a whiskered, scruffy face, his upper body was bare, revealing his tough body, swarthy flesh, and unbelievably inflated muscles. What drew Zhou Weiqing’s attention the most was his right wrist, where five Physical Jewels clearly encircled.</p>
 <p>His Physical Jewels each had two colors, half was Yellow Jade while the other half Ice Jade. Yellow Jade represented Toughness, and improved defense, while the Ice Jade represented strength.<em> No wonder he was so ferocious, this was clearly a Mid Level Zun Physical Jewel Master.</em> At this point, two out of his five Physical Jewels were glowing with a sparkling light; clearly the pair of warhammers were the Consolidated Equipment of that two Physical Jewels.</p>
 <p>Besides him, there were twelve other enemies, all of them were Physical Jewel Masters, each holding different weapons. There were four of them with Four Jewels each, and the rest of them had Three Jewels each. The twelve of them moved together, sweeping away the ordinary troops facing them. The rain of arrows pouring down on them simply did not have much effect on them, as they forged a path directly heading for Shangguan Bing’er.</p>
