<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>The Sidhe Queen furrowed her brows and said, “It’s just like the connection I have with the ancient tree of life. With such a connection, it can be said that the Life Energy between us has developed a kind of strange resonance. In a sense, we can be considered as a single entity. This allows us to easily sense the fluctuations of each other’s mind within a specific distance.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing heaved a soft sigh of relief -<em>&nbsp;luckily it was only within a specific distance. As long as we can’t sense it anytime we want, it’s all good. If that were the case, it would be too weird.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>The Sidhe Queen continued, “Our lives are not restricted by time, space and other forms - they are fused together as one. In other words, unless the both of us die at the same time, or our combined Life Energy has been fully exhausted, neither one of us will die.”</p>
 <p>Since their minds were connected, Zhou Weiqing naturally knew that the Sidhe Queen was not kidding. Looking at her exquisitely perfect face, he couldn’t help but opened his mouth in shock.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Sharing a life with the Sidhe Queen and having their minds connected - was it a good or bad thing? On the surface, it was clearly a good thing. The Sidhe had always been known for possessing strong Life Energy - massive Life Energy was the number one basic guarantee of their survival. Sharing a life with the Sidhe Queen, a Heavenly God Stage powerhouse, would mean that it would be very difficult for Zhou Weiqing to die, even if he wanted to.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, conversely, with such a connection, it was as good as binding Zhou Weiqing to the entire Sidhe. In the event that a crisis befell the Sidhe, he would be duty-bound to do his utmost to help them. Otherwise, once the Sidhe Queen exhausted all her Life Energy, Zhou Weiqing’s Life Energy would be exhausted next. Even though the chances of that happening were low, if it ever happened, it would be catastrophic.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Any thoughts that ran through Zhou Weiqing’s mind similarly appeared in the Sidhe Queen’s mind. Looking at Zhou Weiqing, she had a troubled look in her eyes. She had never imagined herself to develop such a complicated relationship with a human being in her life.</p>
 <p>After a long pause, Zhou Weiqing’s emotions had stabilized. He looked at the Sidhe Queen and mumbled, “Could the interaction of our energy have caused this phenomenon? When I absorbed your Life Energy, while you were absorbing my Saint Energy.”</p>
 <p>The Sidhe Queen looked at Zhou Weiqing and furrowed her brows, “You seem to be very against it.”</p>
 <p>“Eh…… no, it’s not that.” Zhou Weiqing immediately explained himself, “It was just too shocking. Your Majesty, what ability did you use to save me? Why did it weaken you so much? Actually, due to the self-healing ability of my Saint Energy, I wasn’t in danger back then.”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing his words, the Sidhe Queen’s eyes became dull. She let go of her hands that were embracing Zhou Weiqing and gently pushed him away.&nbsp;“Sorry, I was truly unaware of the fact that you were trying to save my child at that moment. I am truly sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you intentionally.”</p>
 <p>Even though it was over and the both of them were safe and sound, the Sidhe Queen was still guilt-ridden. At that time, Zhou Weiqing was nearly killed by the blow that she delivered out of rage! He risked his life trying to save her daughter. If it were anyone else, they would equally be guilt-ridden.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled carefreely and said, “To be honest, when I channeled my Saint Energy into your daughter’s body, I had already expected you to attack me out of anger. I was eighty percent sure that your attack would only leave me severely injured, but not fatal enough to be life-threatening. Well, I have a thick skin after all.”</p>
 <p>The Sidhe Queen stared blankly for a second - she could sense Zhou Weiqing’s feelings, hence she was able to tell that it truly did not bother him. She was moved by his magnanimous gesture, “Since you had guessed that I was probably going to attack you, why didn’t you give me any hint before you took action?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said helplessly, “That was not possible! At that moment, that fella was extremely anxious. Not to forget, he was a Heavenly Emperor - he would have been able to pick up even the slightest change in our facial expressions. Additionally, your beloved daughter, who was still in his hands, was too weak. I could not take any chances. Hence, my only option was to take the hit head-on. If I managed to deceive you, I would have been able to deceive that fella too. However, you should really thank me for saving your child. The Saint Energy that I channeled into her body was purer than the one I used to save you. I had used up the majority of my Saint Energy then, otherwise, I would not have been injured that badly if I had the protection of my Saint Energy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Thank you,” said the Sidhe Queen in a soft voice. For some reason, she did not dare to look Zhou Weiqing in the eye.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, Little Fatty Zhou had become a lot more well-behaved compared to the past - he did not take the opportunity to flirt with her. Instead, he consoled her, “It’s all in the past now, you shouldn’t worry too much about it. It is fate that allowed us to develop such a connection between us. I can sense that your body seems to have experienced some fundamental change. You should try to get a feel of these changes, now that you have just broken through, as this window is the most effective period for you to comprehend it. After this, we should head back to the sealed grounds. Although I’m not sure how long our cultivation took, I’m afraid your tribe must be worried sick, waiting for our return.”</p>
 <p>When Zhou Weiqing thought of his wives who were still stranded in the sealed grounds, he couldn’t help but feel anxious. A considerable amount of time must have passed when the both of them were cultivating. He was worried that the members of the Sidhe might have hurt his wives.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Sidhe Queen immediately sensed Zhou Weiqing’s concern. She shook her head gently at him and said, “Don’t worry. I’m sure they didn’t. My evolution is unprecedented. Frankly speaking, you’re not the only one that I am spiritually connected with, or share lives with.”</p>
 <p>“Hmm?” Zhou Weiqing could sense the Sidhe Queen’s thoughts. He looked at her in shock, “The ancient tree of life? You are sharing lives with the ancient tree of life as well?”</p>
 <p>The Sidhe Queen nodded and looked at Zhou Weiqing with immense gratefulness. “With your help, the ancient tree of life and I have evolved at the same time. My Nature Energy and the original Life Energy had evolved into Life Saint Energy, which was what I used to treat you. It is also the energy that the Life Core possesses. All the Sidhe Queens from the past generations could only release Life Saint Energy via the Life Heart once in their lifetime. However, my Life Core had already evolved into Life Saint Core. Even the ancient tree of life had followed suit and evolved as well. To the Sidhe, the benefits brought about by the evolution of the ancient tree of life could not be described. Within a short period of time, under the influence of the ancient tree of life, the power of the members of our tribe will only get stronger. All of this is because of you. On behalf of the Sidhe, I would like to thank you, Weiqing.”</p>
 <p>As she spoke, the Sidhe Queen carried out a squatting formality that was only used by the Sidhe for esteemed guests. Thereafter, she took a few steps forward and used her left pointy ear to touch Zhou Weiqing’s face.</p>
 <p>Even though it was only a touch, the Sidhe Queen’s ear immediately turned red. Her pointy ear looked exceptionally cute.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was unaware that their ears were the most sensitive parts of the sidhe’s body. By using their ears to touch the other party, it signified their willingness to give their lives to him or her. It could be considered as their most important formality. Furthermore, in Zhou Weiqing’s case, the one who carried out the formality was the ruler of the Sidhe, the Queen herself.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing hugged her gently. The Sidhe Queen lifted her head and extended her right hand in front of Zhou Weiqing, before opening it up. There was a small bottle containing her blood in the palm of her hand.</p>
 <p>“This is what you wanted. Take it.” The Sidhe Queen passed the small green bottle to Zhou Weiqing. There were more than three drops of the Sidhe Queen’s blood in the bottle.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing did not stand on ceremony - he simply took it and kept it in his Sumeru Ring.</p>
 <p>The Sidhe Queen sat down, cross-legged. Just like what Zhou Weiqing mentioned earlier, she needed to comprehend and adapt to the changes in her body. Furthermore, it was the best window for her to do so.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As the Sidhe Queen was in the process of doing so, Zhou Weiqing was also adapting to the changes in his body. After this period of secluded meditation, his newly evolved body had merged perfectly with his cultivation base. Nebulas were still orbiting in the sky; at this moment, Zhou Weiqing no longer felt as small as he used to. On the contrary, he felt that the heavens, the earth and the bright starry sky were all within his control.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He gently waved both hands and two light figures not far from them faded. With Zhou Weiqing keeping guard, the Demonic Dragon Lady and Hell’s Angel were no longer needed. At the same time, Zhou Weiqing’s Nebula Celestial Territory had also vanished. He was able to scout out everything within the sphere of a hundred kilometers with his will.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Previously, Zhou Weiqing had brought the Sidhe Queen hundreds of kilometers away from the Sidhe’s sealed grounds via the Spatial Shuttle. His current cultivation base did not allow him to sense that far.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Sidhe Queen’s cultivation did not take up too much time. Four hours later, she slowly opened her eyes. When she opened her eyes, her eyes were full of joy and surprise due to her cultivation base and state of mind.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Weiqing.” She looked up at Zhou Weiqing. He laughed and said, “If you want to thank me, you don’t have to. I know how you feel at this moment. Let’s hurry back.”</p>
 <p>“Alright.” The Sidhe Queen slowly stood up. At this moment, her heart was filled with a strange feeling. Although she was spiritually connected to the ancient tree of life and shared lives with it, it was not a living human being like Zhou Weiqing despite possessing some intellect!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Sharing an understanding of spiritual connection with a man felt fantastic - it was an indescribable feeling. She felt as though there was no more loneliness in her life, and that there was also a strange sense of satisfaction.</p>
