 <p>Zhou Weiqing stood still and muttered, “The Wan Shou Empire! As expected of the Wan Shou Empire. As in turns out, the hidden trump of the Heavenly Snow Mountain isn’t Heavenly Jewel Masters but Heavenly Beasts.”</p>
 <p>Tian’er glared at him, “You only guessed it now? There practically aren’t any humans living on the Heavenly Snow Mountain, just that some of us were able to take on the human form by cultivating, whereas the others could not. According to the rules established by our ancestors, the Heavenly Beasts that are unable to take on the human form are unqualified to be a part of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, but as long as their cultivation base is higher than the Heavenly King Stage, they will be allowed to leave the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens to enter the Heavenly Snow Mountain and henceforth receiving protection within the Heavenly Snow Mountain and cultivate here. Or else, the human poachers can easily enter the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens and kill them all. Only when the Heavenly Snow Mountain is faced with a life-and-death situation, these Heavenly Beasts will appear and aid us in our fight. They are the guardians of the Heavenly Snow Mountain - only the&nbsp;Mountain Lord is able to mobilize them.”</p>
 <p>Following the appearance of the Heavenly Snow Mountain’s guardians, the power scale of both parties that was originally tilted to one side had achieved equilibrium. Putting aside everything else, just the existence of that many Heavenly Emperor Stage Heavenly Beasts was enough to pose as a huge threat towards the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley. Even though they had four Heavenly God powerhouses on their side, the Boundless Infinitum Formation was not that weak either, not forgetting the presence of the two Heavenly Gods - Xue AoTian and Long Shiya.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fen Tian looked over at Xue AoTian and sighed, “Brother Xue, originally, I had no intention to fight with you. Indeed, both the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Heaven’s Expanse Palace have your own strong foundations. However, without absolute confidence, do you think that we will come here to fight against you?”</p>
 <p>A ray of black light shot out from within Fen Tian’s hand. Immediately, an enormous purplish black light condensed into a flower-shaped light that spread out right above the purplish black Destruction Celestial Territory.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Roar——, roar——” Two deep growls that were filled with hostility rang through the air from afar. Immediately after, two enormous figures, that were flashing with deep red light, charged right into the Destruction Celestial Territory, akin to two meteors, and made their way towards the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Apart from the four Heavenly Gods, the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley actually had another hidden trick? Both Xue AoTian and Shangguan Tianyang exchanged glances - it was apparent that they had a grave look in their eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The reason why either side did not take the initiative to launch the first attack was because of the fact that there were too many powerhouses gathered on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain at this moment. With that many powerhouses present, once the battle started, it would be impossible for them to stop. Furthermore, the situation would definitely be very chaotic. Apart from Zhou Weiqing and a few cultivators that were of the younger generation, the other people present were veterans with decades of experience. They knew clearly that during the chaotic warfare, morale was the most important thing. Under the circumstances where both sides were equally matched in power, the side with a higher morale could even attain victory at a low cost. Hence, what they had been doing was to continuously attempt to overwhelm their opponents by displaying their powers.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, both sides had underestimated each other - the preparations that were made on each end were a lot more frightening than they had expected. The terrifying energy contained within the two balls of dark red light were at least of the Heavenly God Stage.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Very quickly, the two enormous meteor-like light had reached the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain. However, they did not descend to the ground - instead, they hovered above the peak of the mountain. The moment they appeared, all the Heavenly Beast guardians on the Heavenly Snow Mountain went into uproar at the same time. The loftiness that they originally had immediately vanished and was replaced by fear within each and every one of their eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, the two balls of dark red light started to reveal their figures. When everybody had seen how they looked, they could not help but to gasp in shock. Zhou Weiqing’s facial expression had changed as well.</p>
 <p>The reason why they did not descend to the ground was because their bodies were too massive - they turned out to be two fiery red dragons that were over a hundred meters tall. However, at this moment, their fiery red bodies emitted a layer of black light, and their eyes were of an evil purplish black shade of color.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Hui Yao? Duo Si?” Zhou Weiqing cried out in surprise.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before he took part in the Grand Tournament, Zhou Weiqing had tried to summon them before. However, he had failed to do it. He had never expected that they would actually appear on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, and were even became their opponents. Clearly, Hui Yao and Duo Si were not in the right state of mind - they had already been corroded by the Destruction Energy, and had thoroughly been reduced to nothing but puppets.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, this did not mean that their powers were weakened. On the contrary, after merging with the Destruction Energy, the two dragons had clearly become stronger, especially Hui Yao, who could cause cracks to appear within the Destruction Celestial Territory with every slight movement he made. Furthermore, their appearance had immediately enhanced the loftiness of both the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley, which in turn suppressed the powerhouses from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Peerless Sect, making their faces turn pale.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The legendary enormous dragons had appeared on the battlefield. Furthermore, they were on the enemy’s side - anyone in that situation would feel horrified.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Additionally, Hui Yao and Duo Si were not the only ones who came - there were hundreds of figures on their backs. Every one of the figures was decked in black clothes and black headgears; only their jack-o-lantern-like eyes could be vaguely seen. However, without a doubt, they were at least of the Heavenly King Stage. Their total headcount had caused Zhou Weiqing and his comrades to be at a disadvantage.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Huang Xingyun could not hide his pride, “So, what do you think? Are you still going to try to resist us? By now, you should all have understood that your resistance is futile. Our offer is still valid - as long as you are willing to seal yourselves, you don’t have to die.” Despite saying those words, there was deep jealousy within his eyes. That was because the two enormous dragons were not obeying his commands, but Fen Tian’s. In Huang Xingyun’s eyes, his abilities were way above Fen Tian’s, because he possessed the Time Attribute. However, he had passed the authority to Fen Tian, and became the secondary party instead.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After a brief moment of shock, Zhou Weiqing had gradually snapped out of his thoughts. He looked at the two enormous dragons in the sky and felt his heart ache. Clearly, Hui Yao and his wife had fallen in the hands of the Blood Red Hell when they were trying to rescue their children. No matter what, he was going to do whatever it took to save them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Huang Xingyun, Fen Tian, there is no need to be complacent. Everyone has a hidden trump - do you think that the Peerless Sect doesn’t have one?” said Zhou Weiqing in a cold manner.</p>
 <p>Huang Xingyun laughed, “Ignorant child, all you have is your master, Fatty Long. Show me what kind of hidden trump do you have that can turn things around.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing smirked; he looked towards Ling Dang and said, “Your Empress, it’s time for you to make your grand entrance.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Huang Xingyun, you sent someone to kidnap my daughter. Be it personal or business wise, I will not let you off today.” After her melodious voice, that was full of anger, rang through the air, Ling Dang gradually took off the cloak on her head, revealing a remarkably beautiful face that could take a man’s breath away and make women envious.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Slowly, she raised both hands. Light flickered within the Sidhe Empress’ eyes; a layer of greenish lush brilliance rose up from her body. Immediately after, the twelve cloaked figures behind her had also started removing their cloaks. The twelve rays of jade green light soared to the sky at the same time and the thirteen rays of light merged together, transforming into a light beam that erupted in the sky. The dense life aura clashed violently with the Destruction Energy within the Destruction Celestial Territory.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Bang ——</p>
 <p>The heaven and earth shook - the Destruction Celestial Territory was forcefully struck open, creating a huge hole. Furthermore, the almost endless shade of green had spread itself, becoming on par with the Destruction Celestial Territory within a short period of time. The Nature Celestial Territory set up by the Sidhe Empress, with the support of the other twelve elders, was not inferior to the Destruction Celestial Territory set up by Fen Tian, Huang Xingyun and the other four Heavenly Gods.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Indeed, this was the Peerless Sect’s hidden trump. Earlier when Zhou Weiqing was still with the Sidhe, he had already discussed the matter with the Sidhe Empress. Even if they did not share the peculiar connection, the Sidhe Empress would still be willing to come over to help him, because of the man behind Huang Xingyun and Fen Tian. She was one of the people that sealed the Lord of the Nether - how could she allow the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley to behave unscrupulously, and bring the Lord of the Nether back into the human world?</p>
 <p>A Max Level Heavenly God. The moment the Sidhe Empress released her Nature Celestial Territory, everyone present could sense how strong her cultivation base was. Moreover, there were four other Heavenly Gods within the twelve elders, whose power erupted at the same time. The other eight elders were Max Level Heavenly Emperors.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Such a powerful force! They were actually on the Peerless Sect’s side.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Apart from the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley, the person who was most in shock was Shangguan Tianyang. The Heaven’s Expanse Palace had always maintained good relations with the sidhe. To a certain extent, they could be considered as allies. However, Shangguan Tianyang was very clear that it was impossible for him to invite the Sidhe Empress. More importantly, he had seen the Sidhe Empress in the past before, but she was far less powerful compared to her current state. Within the entire race, the Sidhe Queen was the only Heavenly God, but she was definitely not a Max Level Heavenly God.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It could be said that the appearance of the thirteen powerhouses from the sidhe had turned things around. That was because the suppressive power displayed by two enormous dragons had been reversed. Fen Tian and Huang Xingyun were unable to take the upper hand once again.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing stood next to the Sidhe Queen and said smilingly, “Your Empress, I will leave the two enormous dragons to you. They are my friends, except that they are under the control of the Destruction Attribute. Please do not hurt them. After I finish dealing with this, I believe that I might know of a way to free them.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Don’t worry, the dragons are friends of the sidhe race.” The Sidhe Empress nodded her head slightly. The look in her eyes as she glanced over at Zhou Weiqing was so gentle that it would make several men envious. However, at the same time, it made the leaders of the other Saint Lands more astonished instead as they were wondering what kind of relationship did Zhou Weiqing share with the Sidhe Empress, such that he could make the Sidhe Empress obey his commands.&nbsp;</p>
