 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing had already been put on the defensive. &nbsp;Now, he could do nothing but passively defend against Long Shiya’s overwhelming power. &nbsp;Long Shiya was also a Heavenly Emperor, but he gave Zhou Weiqing a far greater amount of pressure than Shangguan Tianyue had. &nbsp;It must be remembered that he had been given the title of the number one expert below the Heavenly God level!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing had no choice but to block with his two hands in front of his chest. &nbsp;Instantly, his palms transformed to become completely gray. &nbsp;A round gray vortex quietly formed in front of him. &nbsp;Once Long Shiya’s six-colored globe of light collided against that gray vortex, it was instantly melted down to a third of its original size, then collided against Zhou Weiqing’s palms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anyone else aside from Long Shiya, including other Heavenly Emperors, who didn’t use Consolidated Equipment or Stored Skills would’ve seen their attacks completely melted away by Zhou Weiqing’s Devour Skill. &nbsp;Long Shiya, however, was different. &nbsp;He had six different types of Heavenly Energy. &nbsp;Although the Devour Skill could still dissolve his attack, it wasn’t able to dissolve all of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A boom rang out, followed by the light around Zhou Weiqing’s body growing markedly stronger as he staggered ten steps back before just barely able to find his footing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master, what are you doing!?” &nbsp;Only now did Zhou Weiqing finally manage to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Shiya was briefly startled when he saw that gray vortex appear between Zhou Weiqing’s hands. &nbsp;He didn’t press the attack, but his face was still quite ugly to behold. &nbsp;“Speak! &nbsp;Who are you, that you dare to pretend to be my disciple?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing had a helpless look on his face. &nbsp;“I’m your darling disciple, Little Fatty! &nbsp;Why would anyone pretend to be me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Shiya said angrily, “Bullshit! &nbsp;Even if that brat Weiqing managed to increase his cultivation, he wouldn’t have been able to become a Heavenly King after just one year. &nbsp;Who do you think you are fooling? &nbsp;I’m going to rip that human-skin mask off your face!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Shiya had originally come because he had sensed the energy ripples of a Heavenly King. &nbsp;He was worried that the Peerless soldiers wouldn’t be able to handle it, which was why he came. &nbsp;And yet, as soon as he arrived he saw Zhou Weiqing. &nbsp;He had been so delighted that he forgot all about the reason why he had come.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But… as soon as he had swatted Zhou Weiqing, he felt that something was wrong. &nbsp;Zhou Weiqing’s body actually unleashed a counter-force, and it seemed as though even the atmospheric energies in the air had wanted to impede his slap. &nbsp;This was something only a Heavenly King could do! &nbsp;How old was Zhou Weiqing? &nbsp;No matter what, Long Shiya wouldn’t believe that this brat had been able to reach this level in such a short period of time. &nbsp;In addition, he actually wasn’t able to see through Zhou Weiqing’s aura of energy. &nbsp;This was why his face had suddenly changed and why he wanted to capture this ‘imitator’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Zhou Weiqing’s Demonic Attribute and his Devour Skill had confused Long Shiya even further. &nbsp;Although this Devour Skill was far more powerful than it had been in the past, it was still fundamentally the same thing. &nbsp;Long Shiya had never seen anyone save for his darling disciple who was capable to use this technique, the Devour Skill. &nbsp;This was why he had paused his attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing stared at Long Shiya. &nbsp;He didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry. &nbsp;“Master, you are being unreasonable! &nbsp;Others all hope for their disciples to grow stronger. &nbsp;Why do you hope for me to be weak?! &nbsp;Other things can be faked, but this can’t be, right? &nbsp;This is something which only I have.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he drew his hands in a circle before him, forming two triangles which intersected and unleashed the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Long Shiya saw the six dazzling streaks of light appear below Zhou Weiqing’s feet, Long Shiya’s ashen face instantly froze. &nbsp;Zhou Weiqing was right. &nbsp;Other techniques could be feigned, but the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation definitely could not!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing’s Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation was based on Long Shiya’s own&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">. &nbsp;This supreme technique required one to have six Attributes, and only Long Shiya and his disciple knew the method for training it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if someone could imitate Zhou Weiqing’s appearance, his Attributes couldn’t be mimicked. &nbsp;Zhou Weiqing’s six combination specific Attributes were unique to him. &nbsp;Combined with the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, it was enough to prove who he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you really Little Fatty?” &nbsp;Long Shiya asked, puzzled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing’s face twitched. &nbsp;“Master Big Fatty, I’m none other than your Little Fatty! &nbsp;It’s true that I’ve grown more powerful. &nbsp;You should at least give me the chance to tell you what’s happened!”:</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Shiya’s eyes flickered. &nbsp;“Wait a second. &nbsp;Tell me. &nbsp;When you fused the Dragon-Tiger Bloodline at the mouth of the volcano, who ended up being the sacrifice?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing was instantly speechless. &nbsp;He glanced sideways at Shangguan Bing’er, then said helplessly, “It was Little Witch, Wu Yuehan. &nbsp;You told me to be responsible for her afterwards.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon hearing this, Long Shiya was truly stunned. &nbsp;The thick murderous aura surrounding him dissipated. &nbsp;He stepped forward, staring at Zhou Weiqing with a look of disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You brat. &nbsp;You absolute brat! &nbsp;You actually became a Heavenly King? &nbsp;Goddamn the heavens, that’s so completely unfair! &nbsp;When I became a Heavenly King, I was in my fifties. &nbsp;How old are you?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing laughed bitterly. &nbsp;“Since when is a master jealous of his own disciple? &nbsp;Master, you are in the wrong here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Shiya startled to chortle, his laughter causing the meat on his face to bunch up around his eyes, making them nearly invisible. &nbsp;“Come here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing snorted. &nbsp;“I refuse. &nbsp;What if you hit me again?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Shiya cursed with a laugh, “Get the hell over here, brat! &nbsp;If I want to hit you, I will. &nbsp;I’m your teacher! &nbsp;Can’t a teacher discipline his disciple?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing helplessly walked back to Long Shiya, who glanced at him and then started to laugh again. &nbsp;“Very nice. &nbsp;As the saying goes, a heroic father will produce a manly son. &nbsp;You are indeed my disciple! &nbsp;Let’s see how that old bastard Xue Aotian is going to brag to me in the future. &nbsp;My disciple not only took away his daughter but also became a Heavenly King! &nbsp;Haha! &nbsp;Ahahahahah!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhou Weiqing saw his teacher roar with laughter in an absolutely shameless manner, he couldn’t help but feel awkward. &nbsp;What the hell! &nbsp;He had finally met his master again, but the first thing his master did was to suddenly attack him. &nbsp;Thankfully, he had just barely managed to defend. &nbsp;Otherwise, those two hits from his master would’ve been quite painful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing wasn’t the only one to feel awkward. &nbsp;All of the Peerless soldiers felt their hearts twitching as they stared at this, especially Kou Rui. &nbsp;However, Zhou Weiqing and Long Shiya joking around wasn’t that shocking. &nbsp;Long Shiya, however, had just stated that Zhou Weiqing was actually a Heavenly King! &nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boss is actually a Heavenly King!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the entire Heavenly Bow Army, only Long Shiya and Duan Tianlang were at or above the Heavenly King level. &nbsp;Technically, however, they didn’t really ‘belong’ to the Heavenly Bow Army; they were honored guests and allies. &nbsp;The greatest weakness of the Heavenly Bow Empire was that it didn’t have enough powerhouses of its own, especially at the highest level. &nbsp;Now that Zhou Weiqing had become a Heavenly King, things were completely different. &nbsp;The Heavenly Bow Empire finally had a Heavenly King of its own!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let’s go back to the base first. &nbsp;I need to show off in front of old Duan, haha! &nbsp;The best decision I made in my entire life was to accept you as my disciple.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m just glad you are back. &nbsp;The Heavenly Bow Empire really can’t be without you, its spiritual leader. &nbsp;The most important battle in the revival of the Heavenly Bow Empire is about to begin. &nbsp;You came back right in the nick of time. &nbsp;Uncle-Master has already completed the things you need.” &nbsp;While speaking, Duan Tianlang waved his hand. &nbsp;Three boxes appeared on the desk. &nbsp;Without question, they held God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scrolls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you, Uncle-Master. &nbsp;You must have exhausted yourself,” Zhou Weiqing said sincerely. &nbsp;The respect he felt towards Duan Tianlang was every bit as great as the respect he felt for his master. &nbsp;For the sake of the Legacy of Strength, Duan Tianlang had paid an enormous price. &nbsp;He had helped Zhou Weiqing out greatly in a completely selfless way.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite how arrogant Long Shiya was behaving, Duan Tianlang was indeed shocked. &nbsp;He stared dumbly at Zhou Weiqing. &nbsp;“Weiqing, you are a Heavenly King? &nbsp;Already?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing chuckled. &nbsp;“I was lucky.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he lifted up his right hand and produced two more wooden boxes on the table.</span></p>
