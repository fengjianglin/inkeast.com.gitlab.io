 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing had already been put on the defensive. &nbsp;Now, he could do nothing but passively defend against Long Shiya’s overwhelming power. &nbsp;Long Shiya was also a Heavenly Emperor, but he gave Zhou Weiqing a far greater amount of pressure than Shangguan Tianyue had. &nbsp;It must be remembered that he had been given the title of the number one expert below the Heavenly God level!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing had no choice but to block with his two hands in front of his chest. &nbsp;Instantly, his palms transformed to become completely gray. &nbsp;A round gray vortex quietly formed in front of him. &nbsp;Once Long Shiya’s six-colored globe of light collided against that gray vortex, it was instantly melted down to a third of its original size, then collided against Zhou Weiqing’s palms.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Anyone else aside from Long Shiya, including other Heavenly Emperors, who didn’t use Consolidated Equipment or Stored Skills would’ve seen their attacks completely melted away by Zhou Weiqing’s Devour Skill. &nbsp;Long Shiya, however, was different. &nbsp;He had six different types of Heavenly Energy. &nbsp;Although the Devour Skill could still dissolve his attack, it wasn’t able to dissolve all of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A boom rang out, followed by the light around Zhou Weiqing’s body growing markedly stronger as he staggered ten steps back before just barely able to find his footing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Master, what are you doing!?” &nbsp;Only now did Zhou Weiqing finally manage to speak.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Shiya was briefly startled when he saw that gray vortex appear between Zhou Weiqing’s hands. &nbsp;He didn’t press the attack, but his face was still quite ugly to behold. &nbsp;“Speak! &nbsp;Who are you, that you dare to pretend to be my disciple?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing had a helpless look on his face. &nbsp;“I’m your darling disciple, Little Fatty! &nbsp;Why would anyone pretend to be me?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Shiya said angrily, “Bullshit! &nbsp;Even if that brat Weiqing managed to increase his cultivation, he wouldn’t have been able to become a Heavenly King after just one year. &nbsp;Who do you think you are fooling? &nbsp;I’m going to rip that human-skin mask off your face!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Shiya had originally come because he had sensed the energy ripples of a Heavenly King. &nbsp;He was worried that the Peerless soldiers wouldn’t be able to handle it, which was why he came. &nbsp;And yet, as soon as he arrived he saw Zhou Weiqing. &nbsp;He had been so delighted that he forgot all about the reason why he had come.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But… as soon as he had swatted Zhou Weiqing, he felt that something was wrong. &nbsp;Zhou Weiqing’s body actually unleashed a counter-force, and it seemed as though even the atmospheric energies in the air had wanted to impede his slap. &nbsp;This was something only a Heavenly King could do! &nbsp;How old was Zhou Weiqing? &nbsp;No matter what, Long Shiya wouldn’t believe that this brat had been able to reach this level in such a short period of time. &nbsp;In addition, he actually wasn’t able to see through Zhou Weiqing’s aura of energy. &nbsp;This was why his face had suddenly changed and why he wanted to capture this ‘imitator’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Zhou Weiqing’s Demonic Attribute and his Devour Skill had confused Long Shiya even further. &nbsp;Although this Devour Skill was far more powerful than it had been in the past, it was still fundamentally the same thing. &nbsp;Long Shiya had never seen anyone save for his darling disciple who was capable to use this technique, the Devour Skill. &nbsp;This was why he had paused his attacks.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing stared at Long Shiya. &nbsp;He didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry. &nbsp;“Master, you are being unreasonable! &nbsp;Others all hope for their disciples to grow stronger. &nbsp;Why do you hope for me to be weak?! &nbsp;Other things can be faked, but this can’t be, right? &nbsp;This is something which only I have.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he drew his hands in a circle before him, forming two triangles which intersected and unleashed the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Long Shiya saw the six dazzling streaks of light appear below Zhou Weiqing’s feet, Long Shiya’s ashen face instantly froze. &nbsp;Zhou Weiqing was right. &nbsp;Other techniques could be feigned, but the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation definitely could not!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing’s Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation was based on Long Shiya’s own&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">. &nbsp;This supreme technique required one to have six Attributes, and only Long Shiya and his disciple knew the method for training it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even if someone could imitate Zhou Weiqing’s appearance, his Attributes couldn’t be mimicked. &nbsp;Zhou Weiqing’s six combination specific Attributes were unique to him. &nbsp;Combined with the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, it was enough to prove who he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you really Little Fatty?” &nbsp;Long Shiya asked, puzzled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing’s face twitched. &nbsp;“Master Big Fatty, I’m none other than your Little Fatty! &nbsp;It’s true that I’ve grown more powerful. &nbsp;You should at least give me the chance to tell you what’s happened!”:</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Shiya’s eyes flickered. &nbsp;“Wait a second. &nbsp;Tell me. &nbsp;When you fused the Dragon-Tiger Bloodline at the mouth of the volcano, who ended up being the sacrifice?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing was instantly speechless. &nbsp;He glanced sideways at Shangguan Bing’er, then said helplessly, “It was Little Witch, Wu Yuehan. &nbsp;You told me to be responsible for her afterwards.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Upon hearing this, Long Shiya was truly stunned. &nbsp;The thick murderous aura surrounding him dissipated. &nbsp;He stepped forward, staring at Zhou Weiqing with a look of disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You brat. &nbsp;You absolute brat! &nbsp;You actually became a Heavenly King? &nbsp;Goddamn the heavens, that’s so completely unfair! &nbsp;When I became a Heavenly King, I was in my fifties. &nbsp;How old are you?!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing laughed bitterly. &nbsp;“Since when is a master jealous of his own disciple? &nbsp;Master, you are in the wrong here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Shiya startled to chortle, his laughter causing the meat on his face to bunch up around his eyes, making them nearly invisible. &nbsp;“Come here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing snorted. &nbsp;“I refuse. &nbsp;What if you hit me again?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Shiya cursed with a laugh, “Get the hell over here, brat! &nbsp;If I want to hit you, I will. &nbsp;I’m your teacher! &nbsp;Can’t a teacher discipline his disciple?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing helplessly walked back to Long Shiya, who glanced at him and then started to laugh again. &nbsp;“Very nice. &nbsp;As the saying goes, a heroic father will produce a manly son. &nbsp;You are indeed my disciple! &nbsp;Let’s see how that old bastard Xue Aotian is going to brag to me in the future. &nbsp;My disciple not only took away his daughter but also became a Heavenly King! &nbsp;Haha! &nbsp;Ahahahahah!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhou Weiqing saw his teacher roar with laughter in an absolutely shameless manner, he couldn’t help but feel awkward. &nbsp;What the hell! &nbsp;He had finally met his master again, but the first thing his master did was to suddenly attack him. &nbsp;Thankfully, he had just barely managed to defend. &nbsp;Otherwise, those two hits from his master would’ve been quite painful.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing wasn’t the only one to feel awkward. &nbsp;All of the Peerless soldiers felt their hearts twitching as they stared at this, especially Kou Rui. &nbsp;However, Zhou Weiqing and Long Shiya joking around wasn’t that shocking. &nbsp;Long Shiya, however, had just stated that Zhou Weiqing was actually a Heavenly King! &nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boss is actually a Heavenly King!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the entire Heavenly Bow Army, only Long Shiya and Duan Tianlang were at or above the Heavenly King level. &nbsp;Technically, however, they didn’t really ‘belong’ to the Heavenly Bow Army; they were honored guests and allies. &nbsp;The greatest weakness of the Heavenly Bow Empire was that it didn’t have enough powerhouses of its own, especially at the highest level. &nbsp;Now that Zhou Weiqing had become a Heavenly King, things were completely different. &nbsp;The Heavenly Bow Empire finally had a Heavenly King of its own!</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Six Ultimates Emperor had always acted as he pleased. &nbsp;He was never one to hide his feelings. &nbsp;If he was happy, he was happy. &nbsp;Frankly speaking, the smug look on his face made even the Peerless soldiers feel that this Big Fatty needed a beating. &nbsp;But of course, no one dared to say anything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After these affairs, everyone returned to their respective camps. &nbsp;The first thing Kou Rui’s did was to report to the high level members of the Heavenly Bow Empire, while Long Shiya led Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er to go meet Duan Tianlang.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m just glad you are back. &nbsp;The Heavenly Bow Empire really can’t be without you, its spiritual leader. &nbsp;The most important battle in the revival of the Heavenly Bow Empire is about to begin. &nbsp;You came back right in the nick of time. &nbsp;Uncle-Master has already completed the things you need.” &nbsp;While speaking, Duan Tianlang waved his hand. &nbsp;Three boxes appeared on the desk. &nbsp;Without question, they held God Tier Consolidated Equipment Scrolls.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you, Uncle-Master. &nbsp;You must have exhausted yourself,” Zhou Weiqing said sincerely. &nbsp;The respect he felt towards Duan Tianlang was every bit as great as the respect he felt for his master. &nbsp;For the sake of the Legacy of Strength, Duan Tianlang had paid an enormous price. &nbsp;He had helped Zhou Weiqing out greatly in a completely selfless way.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Shiya lifted his hand up, then wagged a finger in an absolutely shameless manner. &nbsp;“Nine-Jeweled, nonsense! &nbsp;He’s the personal disciple of myself, the Six Ultimates Emperor. &nbsp;It’s been a full year. &nbsp;How could he still be at the nine-Jeweled stage? &nbsp;He’s at the ten-Jeweled stage!”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing chuckled. &nbsp;“I was lucky.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, he lifted up his right hand and produced two more wooden boxes on the table.</span></p>
