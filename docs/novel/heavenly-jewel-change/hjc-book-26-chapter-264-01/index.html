 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as he spoke, six rays of Destruction Attribute energies rose from all six directions, filled with insanity and a frenzied feeling. The thick destruction attribute aura actually beginning to suppress the six coloured lights of the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation, especially with the support of Meng Gui’s direct clash from the front. In an instant, Long Shiya was left at the disadvantage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Shiya’s expression changed slightly. Although he had heard Zhou Weiqing speak of the Destruction Attribute, he had not imagined that it would be that disgusting. If these bunch of people in front of him did not possess the Destruction Attribute, he would not have even begun to take them seriously. Alas, the current situation was obviously different.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A cold smirk crossed Meng Gui’s face. “Looks like you never expected this, Fatty Long. The Destruction Attribute is not only powerful, the more users of it there are wielding it simultaneously, the stronger it becomes. If we were just using our own powers and attributes against you, we will naturally be unable to hold you down here. However, with the Destruction Attribute, we now have common points to work together, and with its superimposing effects, you won’t even be able to dream of leaving this place. I have long heard that you accepted a disciple, so this formation here today is specially prepared for you. Today, I’ll let you come here, but not leave this place!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under the onslaught of a Heavenly Emperor and six Heavenly Kings unleashing the Destruction Attribute to suppress him, even Long Shiya’s&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation was pressured to a mere few metres radius around his body, and this boundary continued shrinking. Once the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation was unable to protect him, then he would receive the finishing blow from these seven powerhouses.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, to Meng Gui’s surprise, Long Shiya was actually able to laugh out loud, even with a hint of disdain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A pitch black figure appeared stealthily to the back of one of the Heavenly Kings at the back, and no one actually noticed its arrival.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even a Heavenly Emperor like Meng Gui did not notice that this person had appeared, let alone how.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A thick, powerful palm grasped onto the Blood Red Hell Heavenly King’s neck. To the Heavenly King, this happened just so suddenly. However, he was after all a Heavenly King powerhouse, and his Heavenly Energy exploded out as soon as he received the sneak attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, this Blood Red Hell Heavenly King was savage and ruthless enough. Without the slightest hesitation, he chose to self-detonate his Heavenly Core Nucleus instantly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To be grabbed from the back onto the neck without the slightest premonition. What did that mean? It proved that this person’s cultivation and power was far beyond his own, and the only thing that could possibly have any effect would be to self-detonate his Heavenly Core Nucleus, to launch this most powerful attack. If he could cause that unknown enemy to show some fear, perhaps he might just barely survive. When one reached the Heavenly King stage, even their intelligence would increase along with their cultivation. He had made the best decision possible in that situation without pause.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Alas, though the decision was indeed correct, the situation did not develop as he hoped.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A terrifying Devouring force caused the Blood Red Hell Heavenly King to instantly feel as if his body was in the ocean… in a whirlpool. His attempt at using his will to self-detonate his Heavenly Core Nucleus was instantly frozen, before his Heavenly Energy gushed out of his body. His Heavenly Core Nucleus seemed to be no longer under his control, that unbelievable suction force keeping it in place, unable to move.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With one ray of Destruction Attribute suppression energies suddenly disappearing, Long Shiya’s six-coloured lights naturally strengthened again. As for the rest of the Blood Red Hell party, it was only at that point when his power strengthened explosively that they realised something had gone wrong.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In unison, their gazes turned to the Heavenly King powerhouse that had been ambushed. However, by the time they reacted and wanted to jump to his aid, it was already too late.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the Heavenly King powerhouse’s body as cover, they could not actually see what he had encountered. The only thing they saw was his body flying back in retreat, disappearing into the distance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, all these Blood Red Hell powerhouses dared not act. After all, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor had his reputation there, and his power could not be underestimated at all. It took all of them joining forces to barely suppress him. Even if it was Meng Gui, he was only at the Mid Level Heavenly Emperor stage. If he were to fight alone against Long Shiya, he would not even last five minutes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor was famous for his sustained combat capabilities. After all, no matter what, having six Elemental Attributes alone was not something ordinary Heavenly Jewel Masters could compare with. The reputation of being the first below the Heavenly God stage was not given for nothing. Even any ordinary three or four Heavenly Emperors would not be a match for him, and the only reason he was being suppressed now was because of the Destruction Attribute.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, be careful.” Meng Gui shouted out loud. The relaxed expression on his face had vanished, and his heart was filled with worry and hesitation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly King powerhouse who had been ambushed had now disappeared, vanishing into the depths of the Heavenly Bow City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Gui’s hesitation was because he was wondering if they should launch their attacks against Long Shiya now, instead of just continuing this stalemate. The reason why he had originally chosen this method of continuous pressure on him was to ensure their losses would be at the minimum. Otherwise, if Long Shiya was allowed any small chance to counterattack, they would have to pay a heavy price. This was especially so for him, as he would be the first target of Long Shiya.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the constant suppression method using the Destruction Attribute, as long as they didn’t take action, if Long Shiya was the first to attack, he would only be led along by them, falling deeper and deeper under the pressure of their auras. Eventually, his energy expenditure would be far more than theirs, and in the end he would have no chance of any comebacks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Alas, who could have known that such a sudden ambush would appear just like that, instantly lowering the pressure on Long Shiya, increasing the time this Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor could hold out. Of course, if they continued with their method, they could still pressure him for the final result, besides taking a longer time. However, none of them knew how powerful this hidden enemy was, and he was still lurking about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, no matter how Meng Gui thought about it, he could not understand how the Heavenly Bow Empire had another powerhouse like that. Duan Lingtian was a powerhouse in his own right, but he was still just a Heavenly King. He did not have the strength to grab a powerhouse of the same level without alerting any of them! To be able to sneak behind a Heavenly King without being detected, even an ordinary Heavenly Emperor might not be able to do so.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A mocking look flashed across Long Shiya’s face. In truth, a large portion of the surprise and nervousness was all acting on his part. Naturally, these enemies in front of him were powerful, but he had purposely stepped right into this trap. WIthout this huge ‘magnet for trouble’ that he was playing, it would be extremely troublesome to finish off all of these enemies. However, in the current situation… would these fellows dare to lax off in their suppression of him?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, another Heavenly King powerhouse on the other side also gave a muffled grunt, as his body flew back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that moment, Meng Gui’s expression changed greatly. Without hesitation, he gave the order. “Attack!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The powerful Destruction Attribute suppression instantly turned into actual attacks. The greyish light mixed with intense flames burst forth from all four Heavenly Kings. At the same time, constantly glows of Consolidated Equipment appearing around their bodies appeared, as they began to unleash their full power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant, Meng Gui had already made the judgement. If the first Heavenly King being ambushed successfully could be explained away as them being careless, then the second Heavenly King being ambushed successfully was not just so simple as that. This hidden enemy was definitely extremely powerful. If they continued on like this, although their numbers were superior, but facing these powerful enemies on the front and back, it would be difficult to say who would be the final victor. Their best choice now was to finish off Long Shiya as quickly as possible before hunting down the hidden enemy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time as the four Blood Red Hell Heavenly Kings launched their attacks, Meng Gui disappeared in a flash, appearing right in front of Long Shiya. Covered with pitch black light, his hands were each covered with a Consolidated Equipment, a two chi long devil claw spike.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This devil claw spike was specially designed to break all kinds of protective Heavenly Energies. Added on to the berserk Destruction Attribute, this charge of his caused the air itself to be shredded, leaving a long black hole in his wake. Without question, he had also used his strongest attack.&nbsp;</span></p>

As long as this could injure Long Shiya severely, the following fight would be much easier. Meng Gui even had the confidence of killing Long Shiya on his own if that happened. When that happened, he could dispatch the four Heavenly Kings to surround them to defend against that hidden enemy, who they could turn their full attentions to after killing off Long Shiya. That would be a perfect victory.&nbsp;</span></p>

Their offensive power was undoubtedly overpowering, but could they really critically injure Long Shiya? In the next moment, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor gave them the answer.&nbsp;</span></p>

His hands gave a light circle at the sides of his body. The six-coloured lights actually withdrew back two metres, before bursting forth once more.&nbsp;</span></p>
