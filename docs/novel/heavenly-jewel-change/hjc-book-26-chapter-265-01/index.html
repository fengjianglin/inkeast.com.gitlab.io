 <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, Meng Gui had already recovered from the temporary debilitating pain. A Heavenly Emperor was after all a Heavenly Emperor, and he was able to forcefully suppress his injuries, sealing his blood flow. However, when he looked at Zhou Weiqing once more, at the three companions that he had placed his hopes in to hold the youth off… he could only see several hundred bright three-coloured lightning pearls covering those three ‘naked pigs’[1. TJSS is referring to how they have been stripped of all their Equipment and powers].&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A dark gold figure appeared once more in front of Meng Gui. Zhou Weiqing’s gaze was unbelievably cold, and in the same instant as he appeared, a massive explosion sounded at the other side.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There weren’t even screams, and the three Heavenly Kings had been vaporized into nothingness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Witnessing the sight before him, a chill ran down Meng Gui’s spine. If one were to describe his previous feelings regarding Zhou Weiqing’s arrogance as anger, now… there was only horror and terror left in his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The display of power Zhou Weiqing had shown was just too great… reaching a level that he could not even imagine. Was this really something a young man barely over the age of twenty could pull off? Meng Gui felt as if he would rather face the familiar Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor, Long Shiya, rather than this demonic youth in front of him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s your turn.” The wings behind Zhou Weiqing’s back spread, the giant grey figure behind his back suddenly rushing and merging into his body. Next, a demonic aura that was so powerful that it rose into the skies burst forth, turning Zhou Weiqing’s entire body grey.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, Zhou Weiqing was like a massive grey whirlpool, a terrifying suction force warping the air, Devouring all of the atmospheric energies around, leaving Meng Gui with nothing to draw on. At the same time, it also sealed off all his possible escape routes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without any atmospheric energies to rely on, even if he was a Heavenly Emperor, Meng Gui could not depend on his physical speed alone to escape Zhou Weiqing’s pursuit. All he could do now was to fight it out with Zhou Weiqing, to the death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Zhou Weiqing, Meng Gui’s face was pale and ashen. Ever since he had reached the Heavenly Emperor stage, this was the first time he had been forced into such a wretched and miserable state. He had never imagined he would ever fall to such a youthful foe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Zhou Weiqing was only a Heavenly King, the aura he was emitting was already fully suppressing Meng Gui totally, causing him to be unable to unleash his full power. Furthermore, when one reached the Heavenly Emperor stage, their body was already fused with their spirit and soul to form a powerful weapon. Now that Zhou Weiqing had taken off an arm from Meng Gui, it could be said to have broken his primordial qi and base power. Meng Gui was now only able to use around seventy percent of his normal power. In the current situation, it would be difficult for him to actually defeat Zhou Weiqing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Meng Gui quick recovered, displaying a psyche that none of the other Blood Red Hell Heavenly Kings could compare to. Facing Zhou Weiqing’s immense pressure, he slowly calmed down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Young man, don’t go too far. You have won today, but if you want to try to leave this old man here, you better be prepared to pay a hefty price.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Gui said in a bitter, sinister manner. The calm expression on his face was a stark contrast to the increasingly crazed frenzy in his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ohh?” Zhou Weiqing revealed an interested expression on his face. “I am rather interested… what kind of price would I have to pay to leave you here?” At this point, he did not seem to be in a rush to take action against Meng Gui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Gui said coldly: “This Heavenly Emperor is still a Heavenly Emperor after all. At this stage, our Heavenly Core Nucleus would undergo a qualitative change. Regarding this, you can ask Fatty Long. If I self-detonate my Heavenly Emperor Core Nucleus, perhaps you and Fatty Long can escape without any issues, but this entire city will definitely be destroyed. Not just the citizens, even your family and the Heavenly Bow Royal Family will also go up in smoke.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing’s expression changed, as he took an involuntary step back, looking at his Master hovering in midair.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Shiya nodded towards Zhou Weiqing. This Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor had not fully recovered from his sheer shock. He had been watching the entire process of Zhou Weiqing dealing with all the Blood Red Hell powerhouses, and the shock in his heart was already at the maximum. These were all Heavenly Kings with the Destruction Attribute! With the three of them joining forces, Long Shiya had to admit to himself that even if he wanted to take care of those fellows, it would take him some time. Furthermore, there was still that Heavenly Emperor Meng Gui at the side. However, Zhou Weiqing had forcefully used his own power to kill three enemies, with Meng Gui injured. Of course, some part of Meng Gui’s injuries could be attributed to his own mistakes and underestimation of Zhou Weiqing, but in the end this young disciple of his had to have the power to back it up and actually make use of those mistakes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The both had nine pieces of Legendary Set Equipment boosting their strength, but Long Shiya did not think he could compare with Zhou Weiqing’s physical strength any longer. Although his base cultivation was still higher than Zhou Weiqing by an entire Jewel, just in terms of physical strength he was no match for him. The Dragon-Tiger Transformation that held the two imposing bloodlines… this was something that Long Shiya could not match, let alone the existence of the Saint Energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His precious disciple had already reached such a power level. Long Shiya did not even dare guarantee that in a one versus one fight, he could actually defeat Zhou Weiqing. This was a mere year that they had been apart! This Little Fatty had already grown to such a degree. If he was given some more time, perhaps even the top powerhouse Xue AoTian would have to give up his seat as the strongest in the world right?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, this was clearly not the time to ruminate over such matters. The Heavenly Emperor Meng Gui’s words, Long Shiya had naturally heard them. Indeed, Meng Gui had not been lying. When one reached the Heavenly Emperor stage, their Heavenly Core Nucleus would undergo a qualitative transformation. If self-detonated, even Long Shiya would not dare to take it full on. Let alone this city below… one which the Heavenly Bow Empire could not afford to abandon and lose.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Getting the signal from his Master, Zhou Weiqing’s ferocious demonic aura began to slowly withdraw slightly, and Meng Gui breathed a sigh of relief. Of course, he could choose to self-detonate; in that case the Heavenly Bow City would be destroyed, and it would be a heavy blow to the entire Heavenly Bow Empire. At the same time, that would achieve the target of blocking the Heavenly Bow Empire’s path to the south. However, Meng Gui was also human, especially a top powerhouse like him, who would be willing to give up their life just to fulfil such a mission! Cultivating for over eighty years to reach the Heavenly Emperor stage; the higher level one has reached, the more they would treasure their lives. A Heavenly Emperor Heavenly Core Nucleus detonating was far more destructive indeed, however as compared to a Heavenly King self-detonating, where they still had a small chance of survival, the Heavenly Emperor would definitely perish together with their Heavenly Core Nucleus.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As such, if it was not a matter of last resort, he would never make such a choice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing’s expression was rather ugly, and he gave a short sigh before saying: “It looks like I have no choice but to let you off today. However, if I let you go, my powers will be revealed to the Blood Red Hell. That will be far too detrimental to the future of the Heavenly Bow Empire.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing that he had relented, Meng Gui’s heart was overjoyed. Hastily, he said: “In this regard, you do not have to worry. I can swear on my Heavenly Core that I will never reveal the powers that you displayed today. I am willing to leave the Blood Red Hell and live in seclusion, hidden from them. I will no longer interfere in the matters of the Boundless Mainland.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing pursed his lips, his brow furrowed deeply. After some thought, he finally nodded solemnly, saying: “Alright. Swear your oath then.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Only then did Meng Gui finally heave a sigh of relief, knowing that his threat had finally succeeded, secretly he was thinking to himself:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This little brat might be extremely powerful, but he is still too young and naive!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hastily, he said solemnly: “I, Meng Gui, swear upon my Heavenly Core Nucleus. Once I leave this place, I will leave the Blood Red Hell and resume my status as an independent cultivator. I will never reveal what happened today, if I break this oath… What are you doing?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As Meng Gui was speaking his oath, he suddenly saw Zhou Weiqing’s chest light up without warning. Although there was no energy fluctuations, just the abrupt lighting up of his chest was just too strange.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a ball of light about the size of a human fist. Around the ball of light, circles of strange lights revolved around it, just like tentacles writhing around. At the same time, Zhou Weiqing whose entire body had been giving off the demonic aura… suddenly gained a weird aura and quality about him that Meng Gui had never seen before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His skin turned a crystalline white, almost like pure jade, as his entire body seemed to become transparent, almost like a shining star in the skies, glowing dazzlingly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly, pointing into the skies. “Look above.” As he said that, he lifted up his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he could see the strange changes in the light Zhou Weiqing was giving off, the suppression and ‘locking-on’ sensation had long vanished. As such, Meng Gui subconsciously followed Zhou Weiqing’s gaze above. Alas, as soon as he did so, he was given a such a fright that shook him to the soul.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the pitch black skies, he did not know when but there were millions of shining, flickering stars. Wasn’t it a patch of brilliant stars? Yet, the form the stars took, it seemed exactly like the light glowing in front of Zhou Weiqing’s chest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You…” Even as he spoke that word, Meng Gui did not hesitate to circulate all his power, trying to hide into the shadows once more.&nbsp;</span></p>

Meng Gui did not have any chance to dodge before his entire body seized up, unable to move.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as his blood ran cold, rage returned to him and he was about to self-detonate his Heavenly Core Nucleus. Alas, he could only see the light at Zhou Weiqing’s chest abruptly glow resplendently. A ray of astral light fell perfectly on his chest, as if linking the two of them through this ray of light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His Heavenly Core stopped moving, and even Meng Gui’s heartbeat seemed to become the same as Zhou Weiqing’s.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing’s head had not looked down at all, still staring into the sudden beautiful night sky. Passively, he said: “Every Heavenly Core Nucleus is like a star, and what I own is the core of the stars… an Astral Core. Your unformed star… in front of a Astral Core, how could it self-detonate? I will return it to the skies. Good bye, Heavenly Emperor Meng Gui.” The brilliant illusory stars in the skies lit up in sudden blinding brilliance, as if merging with Zhou Weiqing as one. In the next instant, Meng Gui did not even have time to scream as he evaporated into thin air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The powerful astral light caused Long Shiya to close his eyes, not daring to stare at it. The astral light did not give off any powerful aura, but the entire world’s energies seemed to have vanished when this strange light appeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly Emperor Meng Gui had vanished totally, leaving only his Heavenly Core Nucleus there hovering in the air, glowing in gold. As Zhou Weiqing lifted up a hand, it flew into his grasp.</span></p>
