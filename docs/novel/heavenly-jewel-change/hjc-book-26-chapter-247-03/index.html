 <p><strong>Chapter 247 – Battling Dreamwake (3)</strong></p>
 <p>What was going on?&nbsp;Wasn’t she unable to use any techniques?&nbsp;Just as Zhou Weiqing was feeling rather puzzled, the Tenebrous energy around her suddenly retracted.&nbsp;When Zhou Weiqing saw her body, he couldn’t help but let out a startled cry: “Transformation?!”</p>
 <p>Yes.&nbsp;Dreamwake was now completely different from earlier.&nbsp;All of her clothes had vanished, and replacing them was a dense layer of black reptilian scales.&nbsp;The scales actually looked quite similar to her Legendary Set.&nbsp;The strangest thing was, her eyes had become a devilish, blood-red color.&nbsp;Zhou Weiqing felt as though he was staring into the eyes of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon once more.</p>
 <p>An enormous pair of wings had already spread out behind Dreamwake.&nbsp;Her entire body was filled with a sense of both beauty and power.&nbsp;She seemed to have become much taller, and her face was now covered with a mask that completely hid her features.&nbsp;All he could see was her devilish, blood-red eyes.</p>
 <p>One final arrow landed, and Dreamwake didn’t even move to dodge.&nbsp;Clank!&nbsp;The scales on her body were able to easily deflect the power of Zhou Weiqing’s arrow.</p>
 <p>“You bastard.&nbsp;There’s no way I’m going to spare you today.”&nbsp;Even Dreamwake’s voice seemed to have grown colder than before.&nbsp;She suddenly flashed forwards, moving twice as fast as she previously did as she instantly swooped over to Zhou Weiqing.&nbsp;Her two hands had already transformed into draconic claws as well, and they tore at his shoulders.</p>
 <p>The Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation was one of Dreamwake’s greatest secrets.&nbsp;Not even the Grand Elders had such a powerful ability as this.&nbsp;The Tenebrous Dragon Transformation doubled her speed and strength while quadrupling her defensive power.&nbsp;This was a supremely powerful transformation technique.&nbsp;Although she was currently unable to use any of her Stored Skills, this didn’t mean she was unable to use the power of her bloodline.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was completely dumbfounded.&nbsp;He punched out with twin fists, seeking to block Dreamwake’s claws, but the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation gave her power that was beyond what he could possibly withstand.&nbsp;A loud explosion rang out, followed by Zhou Weiqing being knocked backwards as though he had been shot out of a cannon.</p>
 <p>Dreamwake’s wings flapped hard, allowing her to speed up once again as she launched a rainstorm of powerful attacks while chasing after Zhou Weiqing, causing him to let out a series of miserable howls.&nbsp;Thankfully, Dreamwake wasn’t actually trying to kill him and she was holding back slightly.&nbsp;Although she made Zhou Weiqing feel agony, it wasn’t enough to injure him too badly.</p>
 <p>“Are you seriously trying to kill me?!”&nbsp;Zhou Weiqing said angrily.</p>
 <p>“Who told you to be so shameless and lecherous!&nbsp;Yes, I’m going to kill you!”&nbsp;Dreamwake replied, her icy voice echoing nonstop while she continued to launch attacks without any slowdown at all.</p>
 <p>“Fine, then I’ll go all-out as well!&nbsp;Do you really think you are the only one with a transformation?!”&nbsp;A tremendously cold aura suddenly burst out from Zhou Weiqing’s body as well, and all of a sudden he once more launched twin punches against Dreamwake’s claws.</p>
 <p>A loud explosion rang out once more… and this time, it was Dreamwake who was sent flying backwards.&nbsp;Dreamwake felt as though an utterly enormous surge of power had just slammed into her, sending her backwards.</p>
 <p><em>How did he suddenly become so powerful?&nbsp;My seal should still be active</em>.&nbsp;A heartbeat later, Dreamwake saw that Zhou Weiqing had changed as well.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s clothes had been torn to ribbons, and his body seemed to have actually swelled in size.&nbsp;A dazzling yet evil aura emanated from his body as the tiger tattoos began to pulse through his body as though they were alive.&nbsp;On his forehead, the symbol for ‘King’ appeared, emanating an aura of dominance.&nbsp;His eyes had become red, while a pair of enormous wings spread out behind his back.&nbsp;His entire body emanated a dense gray aura of energy.&nbsp;He slowly lifted up his right leg, which had actually transformed into the shape of a hook.</p>
 <p><em>What’s this?&nbsp;He can transform as well?</em> Dreamwake could vaguely make out the translucent image of a great tiger appearing behind Zhou Weiqing’s back.</p>
 <p>The Demonic Change State!&nbsp;That’s right.&nbsp;Zhou Weiqing used the Demonic Change State, not the Dragon-Tiger Transformation.</p>
 <p>When he saw her Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation, he was able to tell that within her veins flowed the blood of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Bloodline.&nbsp;He himself, however, definitely was not going to casually reveal his own draconic lineage, because his lineage stemmed from the Dragon Emperor Bloodline of Hui Yao.&nbsp;The Dragon Emperor Bloodline didn’t belong to this continent; it belonged to the Boundless Mainland.&nbsp;The Tenebrous Demon Dragon had mentioned this before.&nbsp;If he displayed the Dragon Emperor Bloodline, wouldn’t that be the same as telling everything that he wasn’t from the Xuantian Continent?&nbsp;And so, his only choice was to use the Demonic Change State.</p>
 <p>Thanks to the power of his Saint Energy, it wasn’t too hard for Zhou Weiqing to separate his transformation to use the Demonic Change State once more.&nbsp;This transformation focused on providing him with strength, allowing him to increase his power fourfold.&nbsp;His defenses would also be enhanced, but it wouldn’t be by as much as the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation provided.&nbsp;But of course, his Ice Cold Perception wasn’t something the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation could provide.</p>
 <p>On the whole, it looked as though the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation was slightly stronger than the Demonic Change State… but even so, its appearance gave Dreamwake quite the shock.&nbsp;The way in which she looked at Zhou Weiqing instantly changed as well.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing made Dreamwake feel as though she was staring at an enormous treasury.&nbsp;There was an endless number of secrets she could ‘excavate’ from him, and those treasures all whispered of tremendous power or genius talent.</p>
 <p>“What transformation is this?”&nbsp;Dreamwake stared at Zhou Weiqing, puzzled.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled. “Have you forgotten that I possess the Demonic Attribute? This is a first-generation Demonic Attribute at that. This transformation is naturally the Demonic Change State, a Controllable Demonic Change State. Ever heard of it? Do you perhaps feel tremendous awe towards me now?”</p>
 <p>Dreamwake smirked, but she had to admit that Zhou Weiqing had stunned her immensely.&nbsp;“Do you really think your Demonic Change State can withstand my Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation?”</p>
 <p>Neither side hesitated.&nbsp;At exactly the same moment, pillars of dark-golden light shot out into the air.&nbsp;Apparently, their various seals had been exhausted at the same time, and so they didn’t hesitate at all in releasing their Consolidated Equipment.</p>
 <p>Both were dressed in dark-gold Legendary Sets and had used their respective transformations.&nbsp;As far as Dreamwake could tell, both had unleashed the maximum amount of power they had access to.&nbsp;As soon as they donned their Consolidated Equipment, they simultaneously shot out at tremendous speed to charge at each other.&nbsp;They didn’t didn’t choose to use any techniques and instead chose to simply clash against each other in a furious head-long collision, neither having the advantage over the other.</p>
 <p>“Zhou Weiqing, you are very strong.&nbsp;A bit stronger than I had imagined.”&nbsp;Dreamwake panted slightly as she stared intently at Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>Both had used up an enormous amount of Heavenly Energy.&nbsp;Even though Dreamwake had a nearly inexhaustible supply of energy, Zhou Weiqing had unleashed one strange attack after another.&nbsp;After he had used the Demonic Change State, his power had increased fourfold… and that was after his equipment strengthened him by sixty-four times!&nbsp;Although she was able to rely on her innate flexibility and agility to dodge, his attacks were still tremendously dangerous to her.&nbsp;And so, in their latest clash she had used up far, far more Heavenly Energy than Zhou Weiqing had.</p>
 <p>His strength was simply incredible.&nbsp;She only had access to the six-Jeweled cultivation stage, while she had to deal with the strength of a Heavenly King.&nbsp;How was she supposed to fight him?&nbsp;The only way she could win was if Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy was depleted.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing chortled.&nbsp;“I could say the same about you!&nbsp;You are limiting the strength of your Heavenly Energy, after all.&nbsp;Dreamwake, why don’t we just call it a day and count this as a draw?&nbsp;We’ll just treat it as a sparring match.”</p>
 <p>Dreamwake let out a cold snort.&nbsp;“In your dreams.&nbsp;Do you think you won?”&nbsp;As she spoke, she slowly lifted her draconic claws up high, then sent an awesome burst of Heavenly Energy out from her body.&nbsp;It remained at the six-Jeweled level, but for some reason it seemed to be a bit different.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing could vaguely sense that her body seemed to have grown a bit larger… or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the Legendary Set she wore had actually fused together with her Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation.</p>
 <p><em>What type of ability is this?</em> Zhou Weiqing stared, wide-eyed. He had never before seen anyone who had the power to fuse their transformations with their Consolidated Equipment.</p>
 <p>Dreamwake stared at him coldly.&nbsp;“This is the second form of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation, the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s True Form.&nbsp;Feel proud.&nbsp;I won’t lose.&nbsp;Now that I’ve used the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s True Form, all my attributes and powers have been doubled.&nbsp;In this state, even if I merely use the six-Jeweled cultivation level, I can hold off even a Heavenly King powerhouse for a time. You might be very strong, but you are still nothing before my Tenebruous Demon Dragon’s True Form.&nbsp;The Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s True Form grants me the power of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon for a brief time.&nbsp;Of course, I’ll merely be a six-Jeweled Tenebrous Demon Dragon… but that will be more than enough to deal with you.”</p>
 <p>As she spoke, she quickly transformed to unleash a dense miasma of darkness energy from her body.&nbsp;She had actually transformed into an enormous dragon, except in a miniaturized form.</p>
 <p>If he hadn’t seen this with his very own eyes, he would never have believed this.&nbsp;Although he also had a second form of his Dragon-Tiger Transformation, ‘Like Dragon Equivalent Tiger’, it only transformed a part of his body.&nbsp;There was no way it could result in something like Dreamwake had just done, transforming into an actual dragon!</p>
 <p>Xuantian Palace had just become an even more mysterious place in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes.&nbsp;How many marvelous techniques did this mighty Saint Land possess?</p>
 <p>He couldn’t wait any longer.&nbsp;Zhou Weiqing didn’t want to wait, and he didn’t want to let his opponent maul and dominate him.&nbsp;Dreamwake probably hadn’t called him out simply to test him; there had to be another reason behind it.&nbsp;If he lost, not only would she look down upon him, he’d probably suffer a severe injury.</p>
 <p>Red light flashed through his eyes.&nbsp;Before Dreamwake had fully completed her Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation, Zhou Weiqing made his move.&nbsp;He instantly pounced towards her.</p>
 <p>Dreamwake stared at him, a disdainful look in her eyes. She snorted, “It’s useless. While I am transforming into the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s True Form, I’m in a completely invulnerable state. The only way to break it is if your cultivation level surpasses that of my original level, which means you have to at least be a Heavenly Emperor. Otherwise, there’s no way you can stop my, my… hey, w-what are you doing?!”</p>
