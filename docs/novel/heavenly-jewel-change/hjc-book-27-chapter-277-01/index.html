<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>After the five women expressed their desire to own an exclusive Parallel Space, subconsciously, their gazes fell upon Zhou Weiqing. He said shamelessly, “The idea of creating a space to call our own sounds pretty good. We can live there together as a family and adopt the simple lifestyle of our forefathers. For example, we don’t have to wear any clothes! The sky shall be our blanket, and the earth shall be our bed. No one else would be able to see us. We can all sleep together! That is my dream.”</p>
 <p>After hearing his words, the five women each had a different look on their faces. Tian’er was dumbfounded. “I really find it hard to believe that someone this shameless actually exists.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er on the other hand was bashful and did not utter a single word. Little Witch covered her mouth, giggling. Shangguan Xue’er glared angrily at Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>Ultimately, Shangguan Xue’er was the one who made the final call - she made eye contact with the other four women before smiling at Zhou Weiqing, “Kick his ass.”</p>
 <p>The five women seemed to have transformed into enraged felines as they pounced directly towards a certain someone.</p>
 <p>His reaction was very simple - he placed both hands behind his head and squatted down, cowering. He acted meek while crying out loud, “Do not hit my handsome face!”</p>
 <p>***</p>
 <p>Perhaps due to the fact that the power displayed by Zhou Weiqing was too shocking, even Shangguan Xue’er who had some reservations before eventually let go of her worries. Besides, given their cultivation bases, even if they failed to get hold of the Sidhe Queen’s blood, retreating would not be a problem for them. Moreover, Zhou Weiqing had agreed not to harm any of the sidhe.</p>
 <p>Just as the six of them were laughing and joking with each other, suddenly, a melodious voice could be heard.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Who are you people? Why have I not seen you before?”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing that voice, Zhou Weiqing and company were taken by surprise - they did not notice the presence of someone else there.</p>
 <p>The six of them turned around instinctively and looked in the direction of the voice. They saw a beautifully dressed young girl sitting on a huge tree not far from them.</p>
 <p>The little girl looked very young, probably around 6 or 7 years old - her small face looked rosy and delicate, so adorable that anyone who saw her would have the urge to squeeze or bite it. Her big eyes were filled with curiosity, her long powder blue hair cascaded over her shoulders, and her two small pointy ears were sticking out from her hair.</p>
 <p>What was most peculiar was that she had a pair of transparent wings on her back.</p>
 <p>Upon seeing her, even Zhou Weiqing felt the urge to hug and kiss her on the cheeks, to say nothing of his five wives. That little girl was way too adorable.</p>
 <p>“This is a sidhe?” Zhou Weiqing asked Shangguan Xue’er in a low voice.</p>
 <p>The cold look on Shangguan Xue’er’s face completely vanished at this moment. Looking at the little girl, her eyes softened. She nodded and said, “The sidhe are very kind. They are also very beautiful and have a long lifespan. She might look really young, but in reality, she might be older than us. The sidhe have to reach a hundred years old in order to step into adulthood, similar to human beings at the age of eighteen.”</p>
 <p>Seeing a sidhe for the first time, and such an adorable one at that, Zhou Weiqing naturally had a favorable impression of the sidhe. He grinned, “Little girl, we are also sidhe, just like you!”</p>
 <p>The little girl tilted her head, “You’re a liar, we sidhe have wings. You don’t.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed, “Who says I don’t? It’s just that I hid them. Watch this.” As he spoke, twisted his body slightly and immediately, a pair of enormous wings opened up. They were his Dragon-Tiger Transformation wings.</p>
 <p>Looking at the wings on Zhou Weiqing’s back, the little sidhe widened her eyes immediately, “Wow, your wings are huge! And they are more beautiful than mine. What are the purple patterns at the top?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing walked a few steps forward, flashing through the air before he then seated himself on the tree as well. The little sidhe was not afraid - she did not move to dodge. Zhou Weiqing spread his wings in front of her, “You can touch it.”</p>
 <p>Out of curiosity, the little sidhe pinched Zhou Weiqing’s wings twice. Thereafter, she turned her head and looked at Zhou Weiqing’s ears, “Your ears aren’t sharp!”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed. He pinched and pulled his ears, making them pointy. With his abilities, it was very easy for him to make slight body modifications.</p>
 <p>The little sidhe stared blankly at him, “Are you a mutant sidhe? But mom said that it has been many years since they last appeared.”</p>
 <p>Below the tree, Shangguan Fei’er was leaning against Tian’er’s shoulders. She said in a low voice, “Little Fatty’s such a bastard. Don’t tell me he’s going to go after such a little girl.”</p>
 <p>Tian’er laughed loudly, “He isn’t THAT bad, I think.”</p>
 <p>The five women burst out laughing immediately. At this time, Zhou Weiqing said to the little sidhe, “Little girl, you are so beautiful. When you’re older, will you marry my son? I will buy you candies.”</p>
 <p>The little sidhe’s eyes lit up immediately, “Candies? Candies made by humans? Yes! Yes!”</p>
 <p>The five women, who were in the midst of mocking Zhou Weiqing, immediately wore strange looks on their faces. The three Shangguan sisters and Little Witch looked at Tian’er’s belly in unison.</p>
 <p>Tian’er did not know whether to laugh or cry. She looked angrily at Zhou Weiqing, “You bastard, you don’t even know the gender of our child and yet you’ve already found a girlfriend for him. Do you want our son to become like you?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, “This is called saving for a rainy day. It is only right and proper for a father to look for a wife for his son. If I work really hard at it, having a few extra sons should be easy, right?”</p>
 <p>In truth, he really adored the little girl before his eyes. She made him feel as though she was one with nature. Additionally, she did not give off any negative vibes at all - she was an extremely pure little girl. Last but not least, she was already a beautiful child. When she grew up, she was going to be a ravishing beauty. One should keep the good opportunities for themselves - wouldn’t it be great for his own son to have such a beautiful wife?</p>
 <p>Just as Zhou Weiqing was joyfully teasing the little girl, suddenly, without any prior warning, a bizarre distorted halo appeared above her head.</p>
 <p>Immediately after, the little girl was sucked into it.</p>
 <p>Everything happened too fast, even Zhou Weiqing was caught off guard and could not respond at all.</p>
 <p>The moment the distorted light appeared, Zhou Weiqing assumed that it was the little girl’s energy ripples. When it started creating a suctioning force, Zhou Weiqing wasn’t able to react in time; he only managed to leave a trace of his will on the little girl’s body.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“What’s going on?” The five women, whose motherly instincts kicked in and were in the midst of going up the tree to get affectionate with the little girl, were in a daze. On the other hand, Zhou Weiqing’s face fell.</p>
 <p>He only managed to respond at all because of the energy ripples which had been generated.</p>
 <p>The sidhe specialized in elemental magic - Water, Fire, Earth, Wind, Light, Darkness. However, the distorted light was clearly of Time Attribute. Why would a Time Attribute ability appear within the sidhe’s sealed grounds? And it even took the little girl away. In the final moments before she was taken away, Zhou Weiqing clearly saw a shocked look on her face.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing flew down from the tree; he had a troubled look on his face. Someone was taken right before his eyes – it was only natural for him to feel gloomy. In addition, he did not want anything bad to happen to the girl.</p>
 <p>Just as Zhou Weiqing was about to search for the trace of his will that he left on her, suddenly, a bell rang.</p>
 <p>The sound of the bell was exceptionally pleasant, but at this moment, they could clearly sense violent nature elemental energy ripples erupting within this boundless space. Be it far away or nearby, there were at least hundreds of figures soaring into the sky at a high speed. Their target was their current location.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“What happened?” Shangguan Xue’er stared at Zhou Weiqing, who was in shock.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said gravely, “The little girl was taken away via some sort of Time Attribute ability. From the looks of it, the sidhe have already been alerted. Everybody stay calm. Even if the other party shows signs of hostility, do not take any action. Let us try to communicate first.”</p>
 <p>Just as they were speaking, hundreds of figures had already descended from the sky, while some of them were still hovering in the air, tightly surrounding the six of them, leaving no route to escape.</p>
 <p>All of them were sidhe; these sidhe were physically a lot bigger compared to the little sidhe from before, but they were slightly thinner than human beings. Upon further scrutiny, every single one of them had extremely beautiful features - the males were handsome and the females were beautiful. Unfortunately, they looked very furious at this moment. From the looks of it, they were eager to rip the six of them apart.</p>
 <p>An older looking male sidhe looked angrily at Zhou Weiqing and company, “Despicable intruders, hand Her Highness over.”</p>
 <p>“Her Highness?” Hearing the title, Zhou Weiqing and company immediately associated it with the little girl from before. Ugly looks instantly appeared on their faces. They truly had harbored no ill intentions on this visit to the sealed grounds. The little girl from before turned out to be the Sidhe Princess!? What depressed them the most was the fact that they had truly become the scapegoats of the person behind the abduction of the Sidhe Princess.</p>
 <p>“We did not kidnap the Sidhe Princess. The six of us are here - if we were the ones behind the attack, we wouldn’t stay behind to get captured by you guys, right?” Zhou Weiqing tried his best to keep his tone calm and gentle.</p>
 <p>The male sidhe replied furiously, “You’re telling me that you intruded our sealed grounds with kind intentions? Capture them.”</p>
 <p>After he finished his sentence, the hundreds of sidhe that surrounded Zhou Weiqing and gang took action.</p>
