 <p>Hui Yao looked at her.&nbsp;“Go ahead and sense the changes in our bodies.&nbsp;After being bathed by that astral light, our bodies seemed to have benefited from it.&nbsp;Not just that.&nbsp;Although that night sky only appeared for a brief period, I can sense that in reality a total of forty-nine days have gone past.”</p>
 <p>They were Heavenly Gods whose senses regarding the natural world were far more acute than the senses of ordinary humans, especially with regards to time.&nbsp;They often went into long periods of slumber, after all.&nbsp;If they couldn’t sense the passing of time, they wouldn’t even know how old they were!</p>
 <p>When Duo Si heard Hui Yao say this, Duo Si immediately unleashed its own senses.&nbsp;A moment later, Duo Si’s jaw dropped own in surprise.&nbsp;Hui Yao was right.&nbsp;Forty-nine days had gone past during that brief moment of astral light accelerating and disappearing.</p>
 <p>What was going on?&nbsp;They had no idea, but when they looked at Zhou Weiqing they no longer saw that simple, ordinary human youth.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing continued to float there, all the light having been completely withdrawn into his body.&nbsp;The only difference was that on his chest, a ball of light seemed to emanate ephemeral flickers.</p>
 <p>There weren’t any particularly powerful energy ripples.&nbsp;Zhou Weiqing looked like a very ordinary person, but the wings on his back had already vanished.&nbsp;He himself, however, continued to hover in the air.</p>
 <p>His skin had turned as pale as ivory, and it glowed with sleek, glossy light.&nbsp;His features were never particularly handsome, but right now they felt almost holy and sacred.&nbsp;He seemed to have become translucent.&nbsp;As he hung there in the sky, he was like part of the air itself rather than a human.&nbsp;If you closed your eyes, you wouldn’t be able to notice he was there.&nbsp;Not even the two Heavenly God dragons could sense his presence.</p>
 <p>Hui Yao let out a long breath, draconic eyes spread wide.&nbsp;If in the past he could easily sense how Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation was changing, even for a powerhouse like him Zhou Weiqing had now turned into an enigma.&nbsp;There was no point in using any type of senses to try and scan him.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing, still floating in the air, slowly opened his eyes.&nbsp;When they saw his eyes, the two great dragons and Shangguan Bing’er couldn’t help but stare.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s eyes weren’t glowing with dazzling light as they had imagined.&nbsp;In fact, it was just the opposite.&nbsp;His eyes looked a bit glossier than the eyes of others, but there was nothing particularly powerful to them.</p>
 <p>Heavenly Jewel Masters were different from ordinary people.&nbsp;The more powerful a Heavenly Jewel Master was, the more powerful their auras and their gazes would become.&nbsp;And yet… Zhou Weiqing seemed to have completely lost these Heavenly Jewel Master abilities.&nbsp;It was as though he was just an ordinary person… but could that really be true?&nbsp;How could an ordinary person float in the skies?</p>
 <p>As he opened his eyes, the dazzling ball of light in his chest grew dim.&nbsp;It was as though everything had gone back to normal.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing bowed down in midair, offering his respects to Hui Yao and Duo Si.&nbsp;“Thank you, seniors, for assisting me.&nbsp;Weiqing shall never forget your help.”</p>
 <p>His voice didn’t seem to have changed, but it now had a certain charisma that felt extremely comfortable.&nbsp;Hui Yao smiled and shook his head.&nbsp;“No, this was your destiny.&nbsp;You did good deeds and so reaped a good reward.&nbsp;In addition, we benefited from your ascendance as well.&nbsp;I really want to know what cultivation level you have reached.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled.&nbsp;“To be honest, I’m not sure either.&nbsp;I think I’m a Heavenly King, but I don’t know what stage.”</p>
 <p>The two great dragons were both rather shocked to hear him say he was a Heavenly King.&nbsp;As they saw it, no Heavenly King could’ve caused those phenomena which Zhou Weiqing had just displayed.&nbsp;Clearly, his Attributes had mutated somehow.</p>
 <p>However, Shangguan Bing’er had a different interpretation when she heard this.&nbsp;A twenty-three year old Heavenly King!&nbsp;This was a speed of cultivation which was unequalled in past, present, and future in the Boundless Mainland… and the man who did it was her man.</p>
 <p>A deep sense of pride pervaded Shangguan Bing’er’s heart.&nbsp;The feeling was quite marvelous.&nbsp;She spread her wings, discarding her embarrassment and throwing herself into Zhou Weiqing’s arms.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing held Shangguan Bing’er in his arms.&nbsp;He was every bit as excited as Shangguan Bing’er, but he didn’t reveal it.&nbsp;It seemed as though his mentality had transformed and grown just as much as his cultivation had.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er nestled herself into Zhou Weiqing’s arms.&nbsp;She felt that he smelled extremely good right now.&nbsp;She couldn’t explain what he smelled like, but she felt that it was refreshing and comfortable.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said to Hui Yao and Duo Si, “Seniors, I wasted quite some time.&nbsp;Let’s continue on our journey.”</p>
 <p>Hui Yao nodded.&nbsp;He exchanged a glance with his wife, then the two transformed into balls of fire that flew into the Spatial Teleportation Gem around Zhou Weiqing’s neck.</p>
 <p>Once they actually entered the Spatial Teleportation Gem, they discovered to their astonishment that the gem, which had teetering at the brink of collapse, had actually been fully repaired.&nbsp;Now only was it now extremely sturdy, its Spatial power had increased countless times over.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing hadn’t repaired it.&nbsp;Clearly, when Zhou Weiqing had made his breakthrough, the Spatial Teleportation Gem had been repaired by the energies he had emitted.&nbsp;One could simply imagine how marvelous Zhou Weiqing’s Attributes were!</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing himself had the deepest understanding as to what had happened.&nbsp;To put it simply, only Heavenly King-level Saint Energy was ‘real’ Saint Energy.</p>
 <p>The Sea Emperor Shuttle once more descended from the skies into the sea, with Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er hopping into it.&nbsp;They closed the lid, then Zhou Weiqing hugged Shangguan Bing’er and said with a smile, “Bing’er, I think we’ll arrive home a bit earlier.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er said, “Little Fatty, do you know how much time you used up after Devouring that thing and then breaking through?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head, puzzled.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er said, “Nearly two months.”</p>
 <p>“WHAT?!&nbsp;That long?”&nbsp;Zhou Weiqing had thought that it had been half a month at most.&nbsp;He didn’t imagine that two months would have gone by in the blink of an eye.</p>
 <p>“Then let’s hurry up and go back.&nbsp;The two seniors are waiting for us to return so they can rescue their children.”&nbsp;When he thought of coming back, Zhou Weiqing felt as though he needed to go home immediately.&nbsp;He had temporarily discarded everything else to come here, but in truth he needed to do many, many things.&nbsp;His most important task was to rescue his parents and the others, then re-establish the Heavenly Bow Empire!</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing didn’t use his hand to press the crystal into the indent.&nbsp;Instead, he just willed it and the Sea Emperor Shuttle instantly shot forward like a bolt of lightning, diving into the sea and disappearing.</p>
 <p>This sudden acceleration badly startled Shangguan Bing’er, even though her body didn’t suffer from it. Zhou Weiqing’s body glowed with a layer of faint golden light which captured her as well, sending the Sea Emperor Shuttle hurtling through the seas like an arrow.</p>
