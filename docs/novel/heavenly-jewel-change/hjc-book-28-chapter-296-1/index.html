<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>The enormous wings on Zhou Weiqing’s back spread wide open - he had completely unleashed his Dragon-Tiger Demon God Transformation. The hammer in his left hand pointed towards the sky. Suddenly, the wings on his back flapped and Zhou Weiqing had also soared up into the sky.</p>
 <p>The sky was the actual battlefield of the Heavenly Gods. Or else, if they were to constantly clash and collide on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, the other Heavenly Kings and Emperors would end up perishing within a short period of time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A while back, when Zhou Weiqing was still a Mid Level Heavenly Emperor, he had fought against the Sidhe Empress head-on. At this moment, he was already a Max Level Heavenly Emperor - why would he be afraid of Fen Tian? The Creation Energy and the Destruction Energy were polar opposites; additionally, Zhou Weiqing had cultivated the pure Saint Energy all by himself. On the other hand, Fen Tian’s Destruction Energy came from an external source. It was impossible for his Destruction Energy to match up to Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy, in terms of purity.</p>
 <p>Following both their ascents to the sky, the entire battlefield was partitioned into five areas. In the sky, there were the sidhe in the midst of suppressing the two enormous dragons, the heated battle between the Heavenly Gods Long Shiya and Shen Mo, as well as Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian’s battle that was about to begin.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>On the ground, there were the two High Level Heavenly Gods, Huang Xingyun and his wife, as well as several hundred of the Passion Valley powerhouses, going against the Heaven’s Expanse Palace’s Heavenly Dippers and Earthly Fiends Boundless Infinitum Formation. Last but not least, there were also the Blood Red Hell powerhouses surrounding Xue AoTian, who had the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Peerless Sect powerhouses under his command.</p>
 <p>In terms of power comparison, the sidhe in the sky had a slight upper hand over the dragons, but the dragons’ combat prowess was stronger than the sidhe’s, albeit being on the same level. Furthermore, the Sidhe Empress was instructed not to hurt them. It was impossible to determine victory or defeat within such a short period of time, as they were in a stalemate.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As for Long Shiya and Shen Mo, they were also evenly matched - it was also impossible to determine victory or defeat within a short period of time. On the other hand, the battle between Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian might have reached a crucial point, but it was also impossible to determine victory or defeat within a short period of time.</p>
 <p>In other words, the three battles in the sky required a prolonged period of time before victory and defeat could be determined.</p>
 <p>On the ground, even though the Heaven’s Expanse Palace’s Heavenly Dippers and Earthly Fiends Boundless Infinitum Formation was overbearing, Huang Xingyun and his wife had been a couple for a very long time, not forgetting the fact that they were currently both High Level Heavenly Gods. By joining forces, even if they could not break the Heavenly Dippers and Earthly Fiends Boundless Infinitum Formation, they could still subdue the Heaven’s Expanse Palace powerhouses.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hence, in other words, the four battles had reached a stalemate. The only battle with apparent power difference was the one with the largest number of powerhouses.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even though Xue AoTian was commanding over the Heavenly Snow Mountain, their enemy had four times as many people on their side. Furthermore, they possessed the Destruction Attribute. The moment the battle started, they were subdued almost immediately, and forced to be on the losing end. In the face of the frenzied attacks of the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley powerhouses, they could only adopt a defensive stance.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After all, the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley had more than 70 powerhouses who were at least of the Heavenly Emperor Stage, and the remaining 300 powerhouses were Heavenly Kings. By using the Destruction Attribute, they could even set up a powerful Destruction Celestial Territory. With only one attack, they had caused the Heavenly Snow Mountain to lose six or seven Heavenly Beast guardians.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Heavenly Snow Mountain had only a hundred odd Heavenly Beast guardians, whereas the Peerless Sect was in a worse position - they only had slightly more than ten people.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The situation on the battlefield was already very clear - the Passion Valley and the Blood Red Hell powerhouses had to first kill off the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Peerless Sect powerhouses before they could support Huang Xingyun and his wife. By then, the Heavenly Spirits and Earthly Fiends Boundless Infinitum Formation would be unable to resist against their joint attack. After the ground battles were over, the battles in the sky would no longer be a problem. The only tricky problem they had was the sidhe. However, if they were to surround them and attack from all sides, how would it be possible for the sidhe to defend against them?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even though Zhou Weiqing had invited many powerhouses from the sidhe race, on the whole, the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley had the upper hand.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing had not anticipated a situation as this. The sidhe were the key problem. Their kind natures as well as their resistance against killing had caused them to be unable to fully display their powers and strength. Furthermore, the appearance of Hui Yao and his wife was something that Zhou Weiqing had never expected. The situation on the battlefield had become a lot more complicated as a result.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xue AoTian constantly waved his God Spirit Staff, using the&nbsp;Heavenly Spirit Celestial Territory to resist against the Destruction Celestial Territory with much difficulty. Even though he was a Heavenly God, all he could currently do was defend against the Destruction Celestial Territory that his opponents had set up in unison. Or else, once the Destruction Energy enveloped them, his army would be completely defeated in a short period of time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As the former number one powerhouse in the world, Xue AoTian had never felt this depressed before, but he had no other choice. This was because he could only withstand the attack from the enemy with the help of Tian’er’s God Spirit Staff that was releasing Saint Energy. The combined Destruction Energy released by more than 400 powerhouses was not something that Xue AoTian alone could resist.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even though the Tiger King Xue AoYing and the Lion King Gu SiTe, who were riding on their Heavenly Beast guardians, managed to provide some support, the Blood Red Hell powerhouses had evidently trained together for a prolonged period of time, hence, their impeccable coordination did not give them a chance to break their defense. Their combined attacks managed to force them to retreat, little by little.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The individuals with the most number of kills amongst the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Peerless Sect powerhouses were in fact the ten odd powerhouses from the Peerless Sect - Shangguan Xue’er in particular.</p>
 <p>Equipped with the Boundless Infinitum Set, Shangguan Xue’er’s body itself was akin to an unsheathed sharp sword.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The crystal clear armor on her body was like a layer of gelatin, with mist circulating within in - it was not entirely solid. The only thing that remained unchanged was the Boundless Infinitum Sword within Shangguan Xue’er’s hand.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, the power of the eleven-piece Boundless Infinitum Set had been revealed on the battlefield.</p>
 <p>Just her alone with a sword in her hand, Shangguan Xue’er charged right into the enemy’s battle formation.</p>
 <p>The snow white sword light, akin to a legendary dragon coming out of the sea, struck the enemies in the most direct manner. At the same time, at least more than ten Blood Red Hell and Passion Valley powerhouses charged towards Shangguan Xue’er, attacking her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, the moment their attacks landed on Shangguan Xue’er’s body, all they could sense was vast mist, as though their attacks had struck a water body and vanished. On the other hand, Shangguan Xue’er’s terrifying swordsmanship had taken the lives of two Heavenly Kings in an instant.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Heavenly Core Nucleus that Shangguan Xue’er had condensed was the same as both her younger sister’s - it was a half Heavenly Core Nucleus. Hence, the Destruction Attribute had little impact on her. Since she was a child, she had diligently trained herself in swordsmanship. The sharp attacks from her powerful swordsmanship were invincible. Even the Heavenly Emperors who were directly across from Shangguan Xue’er, who was equipped with the complete Boundless Infinitum Set, had to dodge instead of facing her head on.</p>
 <p>Hence, Shangguan Xue’er was an anomaly who could easily maneuver through the enemy’s battle formation. While the Heavenly Emperors were able to counterattack or dodge her attacks, on the other hand, she killed off seven Heavenly Kings in just a short period of time - four of them even immediately transformed into skeletons upon death.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>How was it possible for the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley to nurture that many Heavenly Kings and Gods within such a short number of years? Just like the people who ambushed Zhou Weiqing previously, more than half of them were resurrected skeletons of ancestors, that were dug out of their graves, and were used to fight in these battles. Only a small number of them were able to recover their memories - the rest of them were mere killing machines.</p>
 <p>Earlier on, Xue AoTian had heard about this situation from Tian’er. However, upon seeing it for himself, it shocked him even more. Even though they were all from Saint Lands, the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley were actually willing to sacrifice their ancestors. This made the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord harbor implacable hatred towards them.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, with Shangguan Xue’er’s series of killings, the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Peerless Sect were in a more stable position - they had gathered together to form a closely packed formation and managed to resist the attacks of the enemy, albeit with much difficulty. The death toll on both sides continued to rise - the Heavenly Snow Mountain’s Heavenly Beast guardians had the most number of casualties.</p>
 <p><em>What should I do?&nbsp;</em>At this moment, Xue AoTian’s heart was filled with extreme hatred. He was so tempted to charge right into the enemy’s battle formation and detonate his Heavenly Core Nucleus, killing himself together with the enemy. This was his Heavenly Snow Mountain! Within such a short period of time, the battles had caused the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain to be in a complete mess - even the Heavenly Snow Castle had long been destroyed. How could the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord not be infuriated?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, he was very clear that it was not that easy for him to self-detonate. In the event he self-detonated, perhaps not every single enemy would die, but on the other hand, his comrades might be entirely wiped out. It might even affect the Heaven’s Expanse Palace that was not far from them. Of course, self-detonation was impossible, but if he continued getting drained like this, it would become more and more disadvantageous for them.</p>
 <p>The power difference between both sides was too big - even though the enemy did not have a Heavenly God, they were able to rely on their superior attribute to suppress the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Peerless Sect. A Heavenly God like Xue AoTian had to resist their attacks with all his might, to the point where he did not even have the chance to make an offensive attack. It could be said that they had reached the critical moment of life and death.</p>
 <p>From the looks of it, the other four battles were still temporarily in the state of stalemate. The sidhe still evidently had the upper hand, but in truth, once that battle was over, it would lead to a chain reaction!</p>
 <p>Just as the Wan Shou was in critical danger, suddenly, a deep and dignified dragon’s roar was heard. An enormous figure directly soared up from the precipice next to the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p>
 <p>The fierce winds blew wildly, a swift and powerful figure charged right into the middle of the battlefield, causing the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley powerhouses that were standing right in front to be dumbstruck. Their attacks were temporarily halted as well.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was an enormous black dragon. Its massive body constantly emitted dense Darkness aura. When Xue AoTian had sensed the Darkness Attribute erupting from its body, it gave him the chills.</p>
 <p><em>It’s over - the enemy actually has another black dragon that was of the Heavenly God Stage. With the addition of the black dragon, how can this battle continue? We will definitely be defeated, without a doubt.</em></p>
