Such a massive gathering of power, even if they were to take on the Terror Sea Dragon head-on, though they would never be able to win, they would be able to hold it off for some time. Furthermore, they had spent so much time and resources preparing for this moment, using many precious treasures… all of it for this instant, the chance to finish off the Terror Sea Dragon.&nbsp;</span></p>

Alas, as it dove deep into the waters, they were no longer the same as before.&nbsp;</span></p>

The pressure that gave it a suffocating feel was instantly pushing at it from all directions. Originally, the surroundings had been full of water attribute energies, but they had now vanished totally. Instead, the surrounding waters seemed to have totally become liquid formed from Tenebrous Attribute energies.&nbsp;</span></p>

The Terror Sea Dragon had finally fallen for their trap, the painstaking efforts they had gone through had indeed pain off.

As the saying goes, as one waxes, the other wanes. The original inferior position had been reversed to a vastly superior one now.&nbsp;</span></p>

In that instant, its entire body seemed to become transparent, somehow turning into a bluish crystalline state. This was its method of pushing its cultivation to the maximum. With its Heavenly God state of power, even without the aid of the ocean, its power was not to be underestimated. At the same time, a unparalleled loud and resonant dragon cry resounded from its throat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To the surprise of all the Xuantian powerhouses, although it was in a tight corner, the Terror Sea Dragon did not seem panicked at all.&nbsp;</span></p>

Quick, take action now, we need to kill him now! I’m afraid he has a companion!” Even hidden behind her mask, Dreamwake’s expression changed. With her intelligence, how could she not see through what was going on?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even when driven to such a tight corner, the Terror Sea Dragon did not seem worried or anxious, instead giving out such a resounding cry. The only explanation that made sense could only be that. Furthermore, its companion was definitely of high cultivation as well, otherwise it wouldn’t remain so calm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Tenebrous Demon Dragon and Dreamwake were emphatically connected, and with a thick mass of Tenebrous Attribute energies, they charged towards the Terror Sea Dragon like a flash of lightning.&nbsp;</span></p>

Their powerful bodies could even withstand some Heavenly God Tier Skills without too much issues. Only by using their Personal Fusion Skills to launch attacks could they actually deal serious injuries to their opponents.&nbsp;</span></p>

The&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tenebrous Dragon Slaying Spear in Dreamwake’s hands directly left a row of holes on its body.&nbsp;</span></p>

Despite its injuries, it gave off a furious roar before launching a flurry of crazed attacks at both the Tenebrous Demon Dragon and Dreamwake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Heavenly God Tier powerhouse was a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse after all! With the Terror Sea Dragon going berserk and going all out in a desperate fight, even though the Tenebrous Sealing Formation giving the two of them an absolute advantage, both Dreamwake and the Tenebrous Demon Dragon could not possibly kill it in such a short period of time. Naturally, with this advantage, given enough time they could easily drag it to death. Without replenishment from atmospheric energies, its berserk fighting style would never be able to last for a long period of time. Alas, since it had chosen this method of fighting, it definitely had no fear and was likely emboldened by its incoming companion! No matter Dreamwake, the Tenebrous Demon Dragon, or the other Xuantian powerhouses, they couldn’t help but feel a vague sense of unease.&nbsp;</span></p>

With the separation of the entire Tenebrous Sealing Formation, he was not even the slightest affected.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once again, he flew out from the ocean waters. At last, he had the feeling of watching two tigers fight from a hilltop.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although the Terror Sea Dragon was pitting its life in a desperate fight, it was clearly much weaker in the Tenebrous Sealing Formation. Zhou Weiqing could only watch on helplessly. It looked like it would not be able to last too long.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most critical issue was the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tenebrous Dragon Slaying Spear in Dreamwake’s hand. It was just too powerful, and every time it struck out, it would leave an injury on the Terror Sea Dragon’s body. What kind of level had its offensive power reached? Zhou Weiqing could not even begin to imagine it, but he knew that if this continued for much longer, the Terror Sea Dragon would definitely die. That was to say.. Perhaps he might not even get to see the Spatial Teleportation Gem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at that moment, Zhou Weiqing suddenly felt his soul pulse strongly in warning. Subconsciously, he looked into the distance, and as soon as he did so, he drew a cold breath as goosebumps appeared all over his body, his hair standing on end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Far in the distance at the horizon, a clear, eye-catching ‘shoreline’ was speeding towards their direction. When he looked closer, Zhou Weiqing realised that was not any shoreline, but an immense wave that seemed to reach the skies! Outside of the Tenebrous Sealing Formation, his senses were once again heightened to the max, and he could clearly feel a terrifying pressure appear once more. Although it was slightly weaker as compared to the first appearance of the Terror Sea Dragon, since there also wasn’t the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s aura to help counter it, Zhou Weiqing felt as if the new, powerful aura was pressuring so hard that he could barely breathe.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it were any other time, even if it was today before he witnessed the fight, perhaps Zhou Weiqing’s judgement would be slightly inaccurate. However, having just witnessed the clash between the Heavenly God Tier powerhouses, which had left such a deep impression on him, how could he forget?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heavenly God Tier! That pressure was actually from another Heavenly God Tier powerhouse! How… how could this be?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Alas, the facts spoke for themselves. In this world, never deem anything impossible. That massive wave that soared to the skies was indeed speeding towards them at a nearly impossible rate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since Zhou Weiqing had seen it, naturally those within the Tenebrous Sealing Formation had also seen it.&nbsp;</span></p>

What is going on?! How could there be another Terror Sea Dragon?” The Tenebrous Demon Dragon howled in both shock and anger. Another resounding explosion, as his huge tail flung out, slamming into the trapped Terror Sea Dragon once more, causing it to be slammed into the barrier of the Tenebrous Sealing Formation again.&nbsp;</span></p>

You all never imagined this right? Today will mark all of your death anniversaries. Did you really think I was so foolish to make the same mistakes as my father? Since he fell to you contemptible humans and your trickeries in the past, This Dragon has naturally made preparations. If not for the fact I was waiting for my little brother to also reach the Heavenly God Stage, would I have waited until now? Although he has only just reached this stage, and hasn’t properly stabilized it fully, it is more than enough to take care of you all. Your rubbish formation might be difficult to break out of, but if it is attacked from outside…? Hahaha, you are all dead!”&nbsp;</span></p>

Although it would sustain great injuries and hurt its primordial qi, as long as it could endure until the incoming Terror Sea Dragon reached them and destroyed the Tenebrous Sealing Formation, with the combined might of the two of them, none of those present, not even the Tenebrous Demon Dragon, would be able to survive.&nbsp;</span></p>

The Tenebrous Sealing Formation was targeted towards those trapped within, and even a Heavenly God powerhouse would not be able to break free so easily. However, if one attacked from outside… the situation would be vastly different.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In order to greatly increase the internal defenses, the majority of the power of the Tenebrous Sealing Formation was naturally focused within. Once an external attack came, it would be much easier to injure those who were made out the structure of the formation. If that other Terror Sea Dragon really reached them, all of them would definitely die. Without the Tenebrous Sealing Formation, the trapped one would even recover its full power; even though it was already injured, both Dreamwake and the Tenebrous Demon Dragon had expended a lot of energy to deal those injuries. The end result would be a single Heavenly God powerhouse against two… Naturally, let alone defeating them, even surviving would be an issue unless they made use of the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Spatial Teleportation Gem.</span></p>

This Terror Sea Dragon actually had its own cunning scheme! Despite all their preparations, the Xuantian powerhouses were now facing the awkward situation of their possible incoming deaths!</span></p>

Just like what the Terror Sea Dragon said earlier; if that really happened, even if they were Ocean Heavenly Beasts, they could still conquer the entire Xuantian Continent easily. After all, they were still Heavenly Gods!</span></p>

In just the short period of time, the Terror Sea Dragon in the distance had already closed half the gap. If not for the fact that it had been hiding its aura and not wanting the Tenebrous Demon Dragon and the other Xuantian Palace powerhouses to discover it, and if it chose to hide much closer, perhaps they would already be facing their deaths right now.&nbsp;</span></p>
