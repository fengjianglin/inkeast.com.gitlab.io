<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>The Destruction God’s purplish black eyes burst forth with swift flames. It pressed its huge and thick arms downwards with all its strength in a bid to slice across the Demon God’s body with the dueling sword in its hands.</p>
 <p>However, evidently, the Demon God was much stronger than the Destruction God. With both its palms placed together without budging a single bit, there was absolutely no chance for the Destruction dueling sword to leave its hands.</p>
 <p>This was the difference in power - one was an imitation of a god, the other was a projection of a god. In terms of the power of their gods, Fen Tian ultimately could not match up to Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>Additionally, because of the fact that Zhou Weiqing possessed the Demon God bloodline, to a certain degree, the Demon God projection that he summoned would manifest some of his characteristics.</p>
 <p>Hence, as a result, the Demon God was extremely powerful, as Zhou Weiqing’s ten-piece Hate Ground No Handle Set had increased his strength by 1024 times. One could well imagine how significant the boost in strength would be. Even without the Demon God, Fen Tian might still be unable to match up to Zhou Weiqing when it came to strength.</p>
 <p>The Demon God moved its right leg - it was Zhou Weiqing’s strongest body part. Its lightning-like leg headed straight for the side of the Destruction God’s body and kicked him hard.</p>
 <p>At this time, the Destruction God had two options - he could either abandon the sword or forcefully fight back.</p>
 <p>Of course, Fen Tian was unwilling to give up on the dueling sword - he had a weapon but the Demon God did not. In his eyes, that was the strongest advantage he had over them as of now. Hence, he chose to fight back forcefully. The Destruction God lifted his left leg, with his knee facing outwards, blocking the kick from the Demon God’s right leg.</p>
 <p>Boom——</p>
 <p>It was another violent boom. The Destruction God bellowed, causing the Destruction Celestial Territory in the sky to temporarily scatter. It could be clearly seen from below that apart from the ball of distorted light spreading out, the Destruction God’s right leg had also become somewhat distorted as well. Evidently, he suffered a big loss.</p>
 <p>The disdain within the Demon God’s eyes became more intense. However, at this moment, he let go of the Destruction dueling sword instead, because the Destruction Energy that was constantly being emitted from the Destruction dueling sword had caused the Demon God’s hands to give way. Nonetheless, it was good enough - the Destruction God was only left with one leg. It was extremely clear who had the upper hand.</p>
 <p>The Demon God’s actions were simple - as he released the Destruction dueling sword, his body suddenly became illusory. The Destruction dueling sword swung across the illusory thousand meter tall figure, slicing through the air.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing had thoroughly exhibited his dominance via Spatial Law. He controlled the Demon God and utilized the Spatial Law.</p>
 <p>As the battle progressed, Fen Tian began to reveal his experience. He immediately realized that something was amiss the moment the sword sliced through thin air. Hence, he had reacted instantly.</p>
 <p>He abandoned the sword. Ultimately, he had abandoned his dueling sword. Putting his palms together in front of his chest, he happened to block the Demon God’s thrust from its palm. A violent collision erupted in the sky in an instant; the two gods were actually engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Additionally, the Destruction God’s right leg had recovered at an alarming speed. After all, it was not its actual body - as long as there was enough Destruction Energy, he would not die.</p>
 <p>Fen Tian’s thousand meter long dueling sword descended directly onto the grounds of Ten Thousand Beast Heavens, creating an intense rumble just like an earthquake. As a result, a huge canyon was immediately formed within the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens. The ground split opened; terrifying Destruction Energy continued spreading for almost a hundred miles before it stopped, leaving a permanent mark within the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The battle between the Demon God and the Destruction God seemed as though it had just begun; the speed of the attacks from both sides was extremely fast. Even though their bodies were massive, if one were to watch from the ground below, only a purple and a gray figure could be seen flashing in the sky. Circles of distorted light started to spread out from the center of their collision, erupting powerful energy ripples.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the victor had finally emerged within one of the five ongoing battles.</p>
 <p>It was the battle between Long Shiya and Shen Mo.</p>
 <p>Shen Mo had constantly been on the offensive - his frenzied attacks had caused the enormous figure that Long Shiya had metamorphosed to continuously weaken, and its energy ripples had also constantly decreased. Shen Mo realized that the most important thing was that Long Shiya’s will was becoming weaker and weaker - to the point he somewhat could not control his body anymore.</p>
 <p>Apart from the fact that Shen Mo was overjoyed, it was clear that the Six Ultimate Heavenly God, who had just became a Heavenly God not long ago, had engaged his magical control power to perfectly exhibit his six attributes in a bid to contend against Shen Mo’s Destruction Energy earlier, and even hurt himself. He was manipulating countless amounts of energy the entire time! The amount of will drained must have been devastating. He should be done for now, right? He should be unable to keep up any longer.</p>
 <p>Even though launching continuous powerful attacks also consumed a significant amount of Shen Mo’s energy, he was still feeling rather good - physically. He thought that after killing Long Shiya, he would have at least approximately half of his Heavenly Energy left - all he needed to do was to make some adjustments before he could enter the battlefields on the ground.</p>
 <p>Shen Mo was not an idiot either - he was not going to face the Sidhe’s formation by himself as there were too many powerhouses there. Additionally, he had noticed that Dongfang Hanyue was the one who brought a lot of casualties to the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley. She had already killed off more than twenty Heavenly God powerhouses of both the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley all by herself. Currently, her killing rate had slowed down to a certain degree as she had consumed a great amount of energy. If Shen Mo were to retrain her himself, it would not be long before the battle ends in their favor. As for Huang Xingyun and his wife - he couldn't care less. It would be best if they were to perish together with the Heaven’s Expanse Palace.</p>
 <p>Even though the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley were working together, serving the same master, they had different interests. To Shen Mo, when faced with a life-and-death situation, Huang Xingyun had only one option, which was to self-detonate - the self-detonation of a Heavenly God. From the looks of it, it was likely that both parties would perish together. If that were to happen, it would only benefit the Blood Red Hell in terms of ruling over the entire Mainland in future.</p>
 <p>Looking at Long Shiya struggle so hard to the point he was about to cave in, Shen Mo had started to think of his next battle technique. He was not worried about Fen Tian and Zhou Weiqing’s battle. As an observer, as well as a Heavenly God powerhouse, he was even clearer about the situation than Fen Tian himself. This was because he constantly remembered the fact that Zhou Weiqing was a mere Max Level Heavenly Emperor, who was not even a Heavenly God. Even though he did not know what kind of method he used to summon the Demon God, how long could the Demon God last anyway? As long as Fen Tian was able to summon the Destruction God longer than he did, it was impossible for Zhou Weiqing to win.</p>
 <p>Just as Shen Mo was deep in thoughts planning his moves, all of a sudden, a huge force of impact appeared. The force of impact came from the Sidhe’s Nature Celestial Territory Formation. That was not to say that the Sidhe was directing it at him - instead, due to the fact that the energy erupted from the collision between the Demon God and the Destruction God was way too powerful, it forced the Nature Celestial Territory to shift once again, and naturally caused the force of impact to be diverted to them as a result.</p>
 <p>They had experienced such a situation earlier, hence Shen Mo was not anxious. His attack had only slightly slowed down as a result, it was not a big deal. He had already planned it out in his head - once the energy in the surroundings had stabilized, he would deliver a fatal blow to Long Shiya.</p>
 <p>However, Shen Mo had never expected that at this moment, Long Shiya had launched his very first offensive attack, in the two battles he fought with Shen Mo.</p>
 <p>Two unimpressive halos floated from Long Shiya’s body. Due to Shen Mo’s continuous attacks, Long Shiya had already revealed his actual body. Hence, the two six-colored halos only looked as though they were approximately one meter in diameter. They were each released from Long Shiya’s head, as well as the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Formation below his feet.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Was this his final struggle before death?</em> Shen Mo’s eyes were filled with disdain. He did not care much about Long Shiya’s attack. His devouring mouth was still as powerful as before - it opened up without any hesitation, and immediately tried to devour the attack.</p>
 <p>However, just as the enormous devouring mouth was about to close, the two unimpressive six-colored halos that were releasing ordinary energy ripples immediately increased their speed.</p>
 <p>The two halos did not directly shake up the devouring mouth - they merely swiftly moved towards each other. To put it more accurately, they had overlapped one another.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the devouring mouth had closed itself, devouring them.</p>
 <p>From the start of the battle, the Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya’s chubby face had a grave expression on it the entire time. However, at this current moment, there was finally a faint smile on his face.</p>
 <p>Shen Mo happened to see Long Shiya’s facial expression. <em>What is he smiling at?</em> This was Shen Mo’s first thought. Immediately after, a bout of gentle energy ripples erupted from within the devouring mouth.</p>
 <p>Indeed, the energy erupted in a very gentle manner. However, this gentle energy had caused the Destruction Attribute within his body to collapse at an extremely fast speed.</p>
 <p>Shen Mo’s enormous devouring mouth was created using his actual body together with his Celestial Territory. In a way, it was his actual body! The sudden collapse of his Destruction Energy had shocked him first. After snapping out of it, when he wanted to spit out the halos, he could no longer do it.</p>
 <p>A deep thud was heard and clouds of thick purplish black light mist erupted in the sky. The devouring mouth had vanished, and Shen Mo’s actual body appeared in mid-air.</p>
 <p>Except for the fact that the current him no longer had the joy of victory on his face. He looked at Long Shiya, with his right hand pointing at him and his left hand pressed against his chest, “You, you……”</p>
 <p>The Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya looked at Shen Mo with a smile on his face, “You’ve lost to yourself. If you were not as overconfident, this battle would have ended in mutual destruction instead. Alas, I’ve spent too much time with Little Fatty and ended up being led astray - learning how to deceive others.”</p>
 <p>Beneath Shen Mo’s palm was a small palm-sized six-colored halo that was embedded in his chest.</p>
