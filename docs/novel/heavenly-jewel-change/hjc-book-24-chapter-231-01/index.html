 <p><b>Chapter 231 Breakthrough! Breakthrough! (1)</b></p>
 <p>Perhaps, this was as the saying goes, good-heartedness often meets with unforeseen recompense. If they had been trying to train their Saint Energy by Devouring the Heavenly Energy of Heavenly Beasts, in order to gather three thousand drops of Saint Energy, who knows how long that would take. After all, even on the Heavenly Snow Mountain, the number of Heavenly King Stage Heavenly Beasts was still limited, and they could not just Devour recklessly and without a care in the world.</p>
 <p>However, the amount of destructive energies in front of them was just too massive. Both Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er could clearly sense that they were still barely beginning, and the large Saint Energy whirlpool between them was already growing larger and faster.</p>
 <p>Wax and Wane. This phrase was perhaps a good way to describe their current situation; as their Saint Energy rose, the amount of destructive energies they could Devour at one go also increase, as did their speed and efficiency of Devouring.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er had both entered a state of complete obliviousness and selflessness. The Heavenly Energy within their bodies was slowly being replaced by the purest Saint Energy, and as the Saint Energy nourished their bodies, they were slowly improving and evolving.</p>
 <p>The three Shangguan Sisters also gained many benefits, sitting behind them cultivating, and they could feel their cultivation level rising by leaps and bounds.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>In this Lustre Spatial Realm, time no longer seemed to be an issue to them. They did not know how much time had passed when all of a sudden, both Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er shuddered violently, and their eyes opened.</p>
 <p>Their sudden awakening gave both of them a surprise as well, but as they exchanged looks, the expression on their face was quickly replaced by joy. They suddenly realised that their entire bodies no longer had any Heavenly Energy at all. Instead, every single corner of their bodies was filled with Saint Energy, and it was continuously growing as well.</p>
 <p>By now, more than half of the destructive energies in Hui Yao’s massive body had already been Devoured by them. This was part of the reason why Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er were so overjoyed. At the same time, they couldn’t help but feel secretly shocked inwardly.</p>
 <p>After all, at this point, each of the two of them already had three thousand drops of pure Saint Energy! Under such a circumstance, there was still so much destructive energies that hadn’t been Devoured… one could just imagine how truly terrifying the energies were.</p>
 <p>However, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er also realised a new problem had cropped up… in that moment, they realised that their bodies could no longer hold any more Saint Energy!</p>
 <p>Indeed… unable to hold anymore! When they had passed three thousand drops of Saint Energy, they felt as if their bodies were filled to the brim, almost to bursting point. Although their Saint Energy was still increasing slowly, their bodies were starting to even feel pain. This was clearly not a good sign at all. Furthermore, the Saint Energy did not seem to be starting to form a Saint Nucleus Core even though they had reached the three thousand drops point, not even a sign of it happening at all.</p>
 <p>What was going on? Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er exchanged glances, both of them at a total loss. Alas, the Devour Skill was still ongoing, and their Saint Energy was still increasing. If this continued, they would soon surpass their limit to true bursting point… possibly self-imploding from within. No matter how tough their bodies were, in front of the Saint Energy, they could not withstand it.</p>
 <p>“Bing’er, quick, come here.” At this instant, Zhou Weiqing’s intelligence sparked an idea and he quickly called out.</p>
 <p>The three Shangguan Sisters who had been cultivating behind the duo were caught by surprise, jolted out of their cultivation and opening their eyes one after the other. Shangguan Bing’er’s trust in Zhou Weiqing was absolute, and she quickly rushed to his side, her face filled with surprise and worry. “Little Fatty, what is wrong?”</p>
 <p>“Kiss me, quick.” Zhou Weiqing said without hesitation.</p>
 <p>Looking at the anxious and urgent look on his face, Shangguan Bing’er could not care about her shyness. She knew that at this moment, Zhou Weiqing could not possibly be joking around or just simply trying to take advantage of her.</p>
 <p>Red lips moved forward, and their lips joined. Instantly, Shangguan Bing’er’s slim figure began to tremble, and her entire body was stained a silver-white colour as thick Saint Energy flowed right into her like a unstoppable stream, spreading throughout her body.</p>
 <p>Indeed, the idea that Zhou Weiqing had swiftly come up with was simple and straightforward. Since their bodies could no longer contain any more Saint Energy, they couldn’t possibly waste it right? As such, he had thought of a good way to ‘drain off’ the excess Saint Energy, transferring the Saint Energy to the three Shangguan Sisters was definitely a good thing.</p>
 <p>With Shangguan Bing’er joining in to share their ‘burden’, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er felt the stress on their bodies instantly dissipate. As more Saint Energy continued flowing in, they continued Devouring and transforming the destructive energies swiftly.</p>
 <p>As Zhou Weiqing was afraid that infusing Shangguan Bing’er with too much Saint Energy at one shot would have an adverse effect on her, after around five hundred drops, he stopped and called Shangguan Fei’er to his side.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er moved back, her face red in embarrassment. As Shangguan Fei’er stepped up, she was far more straightforward, actually taking the initiative to circle her arms around Zhou Weiqing’s neck comfortably as she kissed him. It was her turn to take in more Saint Energy.</p>
 <p>When Zhou Weiqing infused five hundred drops of Saint Energy to her as well and called upon Shangguan Xue’er, even the mother dragon Duo Si couldn’t help but stare at him curiously, thinking to herself: Although <i>this young human is very good, how could he have so many women!</i></p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er was more shy and bashful than her two younger sisters, but with Zhou Weiqing’s urgent calls, and with both Shangguan Bing’er and Shangguan Fei’er urging her on, she eventually moved right in front of Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>As their eyes met, Shangguan Xue’er subconsciously lowered her head shyly. Even so, she could see the gentle warmth in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes. Suddenly, she drew in a deep breath of air, closing her eyes as she clumsily followed Shangguan Fei’er’s example, arms encircling his neck as she placed her trembling lips onto his.</p>
 <p>The thick Saint Energy began flowing into her, and in that instant, Shangguan Xue’er just looked so beautiful. Her exquisite face was blushing red. Although she had kissed Zhou Weiqing before, that was when they were alone. Currently, they were right in front of Tian’er and her sisters, and it took so much courage for her to actually accept such a kiss!</p>
 <p>Their relatively cold lips were quickly warmed by the large amount of Saint Energy. All of a sudden, Shangguan Xue’er’s eyes widened in surprise, as a certain shameless fellow actually seized the opportunity as he was infusing Saint Energy to stick his tongue in as well, finding her little tongue to begin sucking on as well.</p>
 <p>This rascal! This terrible rascal! Fei’er, Bing’er… they all are still watching! Shangguan Xue’er wanted to struggle, but was afraid it would affect Zhou Weiqing absorbing the destructive energies. In that instant, her entire mind was in a blank as she totally lost the capacity for thought. However, a strange sense of bliss was also flowing into her heart.</p>
 <p>Having known Zhou Weiqing for so long, this was perhaps the first time Shangguan Xue’er had the awareness of being his woman. Since she could not avoid it, then she would enjoy it fully!</p>
 <p>Transferring Saint Energy mouth-to-mouth, to Zhou Weiqing, this was an enjoyable experience that he would never grow tired of. Once each girl had five hundred drops of Saint Energy, he began anew from the start.</p>
 <p>As the three Shangguan Sisters gained such a large amount of Saint Energy, they too began to have a totally new feeling. The warm Saint Energy did not clash at all with their Heavenly Energy, and they began to feel their bodies slowly go through an inexplicable and indescribable change.</p>
 <p>At last, after four rounds of infusion by Zhou Weiqing ended, all of the destructive energies in Hui Yao’s massive dragon body was finally Devoured. When the last thread of destructive energies was transformed into Saint Energy, the massive dragon body actually trrembled slightly.</p>
 <p>Naturally, this was not a sign of him coming back to life, but the body having a slight sign of life force returning. This was the powerful life force of the Dragon Tribe naturally.</p>
 <p>The reason why Tian’er had a certain amount of confidence in reviving Hui Yao previously was exactly because of that, the Dragons had the most powerful bodies amongst all of Heavenly Beasts. Even if they had passed away, their Dragon Bodies and Soul would not dissipate so easily, gathering in their Heavenly Core Nucleus. As for the life force and bloodline powers, it would take quite a long time before dissipating from their bodies as well.</p>
 <p>A silver glow immediately appeared around Zhou Weiqing and the girls. Having ended this round of Devouring, all of them could be said to have been given a massive gift.</p>
 <p>Within Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er’s bodies, they were still totally full of Saint Energy. As for the three Shangguan Sisters, they each had gained two thousand drops of Saint Energy!</p>
 <p>Besides the pleasant surprise and excitement, Zhou Weiqing also felt a secret shock and a tinge of fear. What kind of terrifying destructive energies that was! To be able to transform into twelve thousand drops of Saint Energy in total. No wonder the mother dragon Duo Si had said that the destructive energies were far beyond their Heavenly God Tier.</p>
 <p>If not for these destructive energies, with the power of the Heavenly God Tier dragon couple, how could they be injured or killed by the few attackers?</p>
 <p>“At last, we are done.” Zhou Weiqing let loose a breath of relief. On the other side, Duo Si slowly spread her wings once more. As compared to the human youths in front of her who were all filled with energy, currently she was extremely exhausted, the light in her eyes much dimmer than before.</p>
 <p>All this time while Zhou Weiqing and the others were gaining Saint Energy, Duo Si had to use all of her might to control the destructive energies. If not for the fact that Zhou Weiqing’s Devouring and grown faster and faster, she did not know if she could have continued all the way. However, in order to help her husband revive faster, she had forced herself to last through this massive exhaustion.</p>
 <p>Looking at Duo Si’s exhaustion, Zhou Weiqing said: “Let us all rest a while. At least, from the current situation, our chances seem to have increased substantially.”</p>
 <p>Duo Si nodded, the great sorrow in her eyes seemed to have lessened slightly. Her gaze landed back on her husband as she slowly lay down beside his body, slowly watching the gaping wounds close.</p>
 <p>Indeed, although he had already lost his life, Hui Yao’s massive dragon body had actually begun to heal slowly now that the destructive energies had all been drawn out. The regeneration was at a rather astonishing pace… This was truly the terrifying regeneration capabilities of the Dragon Tribe. If not for the fact that the entire ground was stained red with dragon blood, Zhou Weiqing might have thought this was a live dragon sleeping in front of him.</p>
 <p>“When can we begin reviving him?” Duo Si asked Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er anxiously.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “You are too exhausted now. When we begin the revival, we will still require your help. The power required to revive a powerful dragon like Hui Yao will likely take an unbelievable amount of Heavenly Energy, and even both Tian’er and myself added together will not have sufficient Heavenly Energy. When Tian’er and myself are unable to sustain it, we will need to make use of the Devour Skill on you to use your Heavenly Energy on the Resurrection Skill. As such, you need to recover to your best condition as quickly as possible. When you recover fully, we can begin the process.”</p>
