 <p><strong>Chapter 10 Physical Jewel Consolidated Equipment, Elemental Jewel Stored Skills (2)</strong></p>
 <p>“What is known as Physical Jewel Consolidated Equipment refers to our Physical Jewels being able to form into the shape of a weapon, armor piece, or even other shapes. Once it has set into a shape, it will also have the characteristics or attributes of your Physical Jewel, which can thus form a very unique weapon for us. This is what I meant previously by the external assistance. For myself, my Silent Tracking Arrow can attack any enemy from any angle in a 500 metre radius from myself, and its speed is three times that of any normal arrow, and also an additional armor piercing effect. So long as I have enough Heavenly Energy to support it, I can keep reusing it. However, with my currently eighth level of Heavenly Energy, I can at most support the release of 12 arrows.”</p>
 <p>The Dragonstone Jade Silent Tracking Arrow changed back to its original shape of its Physical Jewel and returned to circling Shangguan Bing’er’s wrist. At this moment, Zhou Weiqing had sucked in a breath of cold air. Although he had always known that Jewel Masters were extremely formidable, but he had not expected their strength to be of such extent. He was lucky that on that day, Shangguan Bing’er had not followed her impulses, otherwise ……</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er did not display pride after displaying her Silent Tracking Arrow, but instead seemed somewhat despondent, “Now you know the difference in power between a Power Jewel that has external assistance and one that does not. To carry out the Consolidation of Equipment for our Physical Jewel requires the purchase of corresponding Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. However, the cost of these Consolidating Equipment Scrolls are astronomical, furthermore, the success rate of Consolidating Equipment is very low. For a small country like our Heavenly Bow Empire, no one can support such an immense expense besides the Imperial Family, that’s why the number of Jewel Masters in our country is so low, as most Jewel Masters are unable to complete external assistance to their Power Jewels. I choose to be an archer because under the circumstance of being unable to complete external assistance, archers are still able to make some extra use their Power Jewels.”</p>
 <p>As she said that, Shang Gong Bing drew her Purple Dawn Bow once more, but this time an ordinary feathered arrow appeared on the bowstring instead, and as the Purple Dawn Bow was drawn to a full crescent, the two King Tourmaline Elemental Jewels on her left hand flashed in a brilliant red light, integrating into the Purple Dawn Bow as well as the feathered arrow instantaneously. A clear buzzing sound rang out, and the arrow flew out trailing with red light, and immediately the Stars Tree 50 meters away was shot through.</p>
 <p>“The Physical Jewel’s boost to speed allows me to shoot arrows at a speed way above an ordinary archer, while the Wind Attribute Elemental Jewel can increase the speed and penetrative power of the released arrow. When both effects are added together, the might increases exponentially. As such, choosing to be an archer allows me to better use the abilities of the Physical and Elemental Jewels.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded his head, saying: “What about the Elemental Jewel Stored Skills then?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er said: “If the Physical Jewel Consolidated Equipment gives us a weapon, then Elemental Jewel Stored Skills grants us great skills. Look at this.”</p>
 <p>Lifting her left hand, one of the King Tourmaline Jewels integrated into her palm quietly, Instantly, a thick green light jumped from her left hand, dancing around her fingertips. As she flicked her fingers, three sets of green wind blades – in the shape of crescent moon and having a diameter of about one yard each – floated before her. The next moment, the wind blades started to revolve around Zhou Weiqing and her. The very air itself seemed to be sliced apart, making a sharp sound that caused was hair raising for Zhou Weiqing to hear.</p>
 <p>“This is the stored skill of my first Elemental Jewel, Wind Blades. It is a relatively close combat skill, with an attack range of 30 meters. Generally speaking, the Weapon from Physical Jewels and Skills of Elemental Jewels are able to complement each other well, balancing offense and defense, short and long ranges. This also maximises the power of Heavenly Jewel Masters. Although ordinary Physical or Elemental Jewel Masters can also Consolidate Equipments or Store Skills, but the same skills in their hands compared to in the hands of a Heavenly Jewel Master, is completely different in terms of strength. For example, the Wind Blades I use, if a Wind Elemental Master uses the exact same skill, he can at most generate one Wind Blade.”</p>
 <p>“Physical Jewel Consolidated Equipments require the purchase of the Consolidating Equipment Scrolls from Consolidating Equipment Masters, and the price is considered very exorbitant. However, the Storing of Skills for the Elemental Jewel is even more troublesome, and it requires the Elemental Jewel to Store the skills from Heavenly Beasts. Furthermore, one Elemental Jewel can only store one skill, but Heavenly Beasts have many different skills. Without even mentioning the difficulty in dealing with Heavenly Beasts, if you managed to Store a Skill from a Heavenly Beast, but it does not suit your own abilities, then you have wasted one Jewel’s Skill, and that particular Elemental Jewel can be considered abandoned. Therefore, when attempting to Store Skills on their Elemental Jewels, all Jewel Masters are extremely careful, and they will generally spend an extremely high price to enter the Skill-Storing Palace, to at least guarantee they manage to get a useful skill.”</p>
 <p>By now, Zhou Weiqing finally understood how difficult it was to actually be a Heavenly Jewel Master. It was not just the difficulty in cultivation, but even the Consolidating Equipment Masters and Skill-Storing Palace, just listening to all that made him dizzy. However, Shangguan Bing’er’s words at least made him understand one thing, that is, a Heavenly Jewel Master who has not Consolidated Equipment or Stored Skills, was a lot weaker.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er looked at Zhou Weiqing’s thoughtful and pensive-looking appearance, and felt somewhat gratified in her heart. Although in the heart she was still unable to accept the matters of that day, but all that she had now could be said to be given by the Heavenly Bow Empire, and as such she was absolutely loyal to the empire, and was certainly willing to see the Heavenly Bow Empire to gain another strong Heavenly Jewel Master. If not for this, how could she have let Zhou Weiqing off the hook that night. At this point in time, seeing his rare solemn and serious self, her heart also felt slightly better.</p>
 <p>“Little Fatty Zhou, if I let you carry out Consolidate Equipment on your Physical Jewel, what would you prepare to Consolidate?” Shangguan Bing’er asked calmly.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing replied without hesitation: “Of course it would be armor, definitely the complete set including helmet. I must arm myself to the teeth, the best would be an invulnerable unbreakable armor. Wahaha!”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er turned green instantly, and once again landed a kick on Zhou Weiqing ass, “Can you be a little distinguished? Do you fear death so much?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing covered his ass, with a face as if he were suffering from much injustice, saying: “Humans who do not fear death will be condemned by heaven and earth. Our lifespan is only a few dozens years, I have not lived long enough!”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er said coldly: “You better limit your daydreaming as soon as possible. Your idea is quite impossible. The volume of the Consolidated Equipment for each Physical Jewel is limited, you can at most Consolidate the volume of a long sword or a longbow, to actually Consolidate a complete set of armor, is nearly impossible.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing blinked and said, “You can’t say it so absolutely like that. If for my first Physical Jewel I Consolidate the helmet, the second one a Heart-Protection Mirror*, I can eventually complete a whole set one day!”</p>
 <p><em>*TL: 护心镜 – ‘Heart-Protection Mirror’ is basically a small piece of protective metal covering the heart area, usually slotted at a breastplate of armour for additional protection since the heart is one of the vital points.</em></p>
 <p>“You ……” Shangguan Bing’er was angered til she was shaking all over, and looking at Zhou Weiqing’s laughing and playful appearance, the resentment and anger over the past few days, coupled with the sense of injustice erupted in her heart, and beads of tears started falling from her tender face. She tightly bit her lower lip, forcing herself not to make any noise by crying out loud.</p>
 <p>“Err……” Seeing that Shangguan Bing’er had started crying, Zhou Wei felt a stab of pain in his heart, and cautiously went to her side, “Don’t cry okay? If you cry some more you won’t be beautiful anymore.”</p>
