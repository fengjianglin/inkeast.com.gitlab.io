 <p><b>Chapter 17 Touch of Darkness (4)</b></p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing did not dodge, his face showing helplessness, “Ru Se Sis, I can’t be blamed for having an early good growth!” As he said that, he subtly shot a glance at Xiao Ru Se’s rather flat chest.</p>
 <p>“What are you staring at! If you continue looking, this old mother [1. like the female version of Your Father] will dig out your eyes! If you cannot produce any evidence supporting your claim, I will catch you and bring you back to the camp to handle according to military law.” At this time, Xiao Ru Se had become very flustered, almost forgetting that Zhou Weiqing was a Heavenly Jewel Master. Although her disposition was always very calm, but after just experiencing all these various shocks, added to the fact that Weiqing had kiss her face, how could she possibly maintain her calm?</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing lowered his head, and both his hands started to take off his belt.</p>
 <p>“What are you doing?” Xiao Ru Se’s long sword shot forward, arriving just in front of him.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing had an expression on as if he were suffering from injustice: “Didn’t you just ask me to produce some evidence? When we were younger, you led me to the riverside to play with water, and you’ve seen the red birthmark I have on my ***[2. The author literally puts ** there, 3rd one is mine =p He means ass here ;)], let me show you as proof.” As he said that, he did not wait for Xiao Ru Se to reject the plan, and that little rascal had turned around and pulled down his pants, revealing his big white ***.</p>
 <p>Indeed, on the left side of his ***, there was a bright red birthmark.</p>
 <p>Xiao Ru Se was clearly stunned for a moment, as she blushed deeply, then she quickly turned around as she said: “Quickly wear your pants, so ugly!”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing quickly put on his &nbsp;pants again, and said with a smile: “Ru Se Sis, now do you believe me.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Ru Se stole a quick glance back and saw that he had already worn back his pants, and sheathed her long sword while asking surprisedly: “Are you really Zhou Weiqing that snot nosed brat? That isn’t right! Weren’t your meridians blocked?” As she said up to here, she suddenly stopped talking.</p>
 <p>“I used to be a trash last time, that doesn’t mean I’ll always be a trash.” Zhou Weiqing said nonchalantly. “Ru Se Sis, when I was young and was discovered to have blocked meridians, none of the children of the same age would pay any attention to me, only you were willing to bring me around to play. After we separated, seven years have passed! At that time, I was always thinking of you, thinking how good it would be if you really were my real biological older sister.”</p>
 <p>As he said that, Zhou Weiqing’s eyes reddened with emotion. In his 14 years living, there were only two people who he was the closest to - one was his mother, and the other was Xiao Ru Se. It can be said that during Zhou Weiqing’s childhood, Xiao Ru Se occupied an enormous component.</p>
 <p>“Little snot nosed brat, you’re already too big to continue crying so much like that! You have really changed so much, even this elder sister did not recognize you. Zhou Little Fatty, Zhou Little Fatty, I should have known that it was you!” Xiao Ru Se stretched out her arms, and hugged the taller Zhou Weiqing, just like in the past when she protected him.</p>
 <p>In Xiao Ru Se’s arms, Zhou Weiqing only felt that her front was very hard, and did not know if she had padded it. Her body did not have a girl's effeminacy, only a clean light smell that felt especially comfortable.</p>
 <p>However, after hugging for few seconds, Xiao Ru Se suddenly awoke to reality and shoved Zhou Weiqing aside. “Little brat, you knew that it was me earlier right? Hmph, and you still dared to break my Purple Dawn Bow, and make fun of me? Is your skin itchy?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was given a scare: “Elder Sis, listen to my explanation. I had not recognized you at that time!”</p>
 <p>"I don’t believe you. I was so angered by you just now. Let me first vent my anger then we’ll speak.”</p>
 <p>“Ahhhhhhhh!!!”</p>
 <p>One hour later...</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing and Xiao Ru Se were sitting together under a large tree, as Zhou Weiqing told her about the recent events; him swallowing the black pearl, how he ran to to sign on in the army, as well as the events after that in detail. He regarded Xiao Ruse as one of his closest, most intimate friends, and naturally did not conceal anything from her, even telling her about Shangguan Bing’er’s relations with him.</p>
 <p>"No wonder she treats you so differently, I had not expected that, you actually did that to her…Hahaha…” Xiao Ru Se suddenly laughed out loud, startling Zhou Weiqing into jumping up.</p>
 <p>“Elder Sis, what are you laughing at?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Ru Se rubbed her belly which was aching from her excessive laughter, before saying: “This repays any enmity I have with her. Shangguan Bing’er snatched my position of Battalion Commander although she does not know anything about directing or commanding an army. I never expected that she’ll be taken advantage of by a brat like you. Oh well, rich waters should be kept in our own fields [3. 肥水不落外人田 literal translation, basically means that it’s better to keep any advantages within their circle, instead of letting outsiders get it], after all she is a Heavenly Jewel Master. Who knew that she would actually become the sacrificial offering to Awaken your Heavenly Jewels, little snot nosed brat, I hadn’t expected that your luck was so good.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said with a woebegone expression on his face: “Elder Sis, I have already enlisted in the military, can you not call me Little snot nosed brat anymore?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Ru Se gave a hmph as she said: “No matter how big you are, in my eyes you are still that little snot nosed brat. What are your future plans though? Why didn't you tell Uncle Zhou about you becoming a Heavenly Jewel Master? He has dreamed of this day for so long.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head and said: “I do not want to go back. When I was still a trash, I was tortured so much by that strict father, if he knows that I have became a Heavenly Jewel Master, how can I have a good life?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Ruse said with a faint smile: “Little Brat, I think it is more that you do not want to give up Shangguan Bing’er right.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing did not try to conceal the fact and nodded as he said: “Yes I do not want to give her up. Although it was a misunderstanding that day, I was the one who hurt her! If it had been Princess Difyua, she probably would have killed me then. Yet, Shangguan Bing’er not only did not kill me, but also taught me how to cultivate. Elder Sis, I really really like her.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Ru Se looked at Zhou Weiqing; she did not know why, but she suddenly felt a bitter and sour feeling in her heart. After an awkward silence, she finally said faintly: “If you like her, then go ahead and pursue her. With our Little Wei’s [4.&nbsp;小维 Xiao/Little Wei, she is using it as a nickname for Weiqing.] abilities, are you still afraid that you can’t successfully chase her? Although Shangguan Bing’er is not much of a military commander, but she is really a good person. In the future, Elder Sis will not oppose her.”</p>
 <p>“Elder Sis, are you alright?” Zhou Weiqing looked at her doubtingly.</p>
 <p>Xiao Ru Se was startled in her own heart. <i>Yes! What’s wrong with me? I am older than Weiqing by seven years!</i></p>
 <p>“Why wouldn’t I be alright. Let’s go, it’s time that we head back already. Otherwise, your beautiful Battalion Commander will be worried about you.”Xiao Ru Se made use of the chance to get up and prepare to move off, in order to cover the blush on her face.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing also stood up quickly, holding Xiao Ru Se’s hand and said with a grin: “Elder Sis, if I had known earlier that Xiao Se was Xiao Ru Se, then I would have wished that you were the one who ran over on the day that my Jewel Awakened.”</p>
 <p>"Bah! You even dare to tease your Elder Sis, do you think that I will not punch you!” Xiao Ru Se lifted her hand and thwapped Zhou Weiqing on the head, which he dodged with a large grin. As they ran towards the military compound, he said: “Does Elder Sis know? When I grew up, when father told me that my fiance is Princess Difyua, I told him that I did not want Princess Difuya, but I wanted Ru Se Elder Sis instead.”</p>
 <p>As he spoke those words, Zhou Weiqing ran off quickly, leaving Xiao Ru Se alone standing there for a while, before she followed. This time, she really felt the sense of disquiet in her heart.</p>
 <p>Initially, after she had parted with Zhou Weiqing, she had gone all out in training in an attempt to complete her father's wish. However, she had fallen just short at the age of 16, and had not succeeded in Awakening her Power Jewels. Ever since that time, she dressed up as a man to enter the military school to study. She had also trained hard in archery, and two years ago she had finally achieved something, managing to join the army with honours and had worked hard up till today. You could even say that there were only 2 men in her life who were most intimate to her, one was naturally her father, and the other was Zhou Weiqing.</p>
