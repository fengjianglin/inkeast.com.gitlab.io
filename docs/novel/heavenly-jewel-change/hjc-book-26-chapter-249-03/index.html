<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>This was just the type of person he was.&nbsp;He’d repay kindness and treachery in like coin.&nbsp;He wasn’t comfortable repaying kindness with treachery!</p>
 <p>And so, Zhou Weiqing was feeling rather conflicted.&nbsp;He knew that this was the best chance he would have, but he wouldn’t necessarily actually intervene.&nbsp;It would all have to be based on how the situation developed.&nbsp;He had even considered revealing his true identity.&nbsp;Would Xuantian Palace perhaps agree to loan him the Spatial Teleportation Gem?&nbsp;Probably not.&nbsp;The Grand Elders had already stated earlier that the Spatial Teleportation Gem didn’t have many uses left.&nbsp;To try and borrow it at a time like this was rather unlikely.</p>
 <p><em>Forget it.&nbsp;I’ll play it by the ear</em>.&nbsp;While considering his options, Zhou Weiqing carefully kept watch on the surrounding area.&nbsp;This entire place had been blanketed by the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s mighty Tenebrous energies and its spiritual power, making it so that Zhou Weiqing didn’t dare to fully unleash all of his own senses.&nbsp;If he did, if he was unlucky he might suffer a heavy wound.&nbsp;And so, all he could do was watch with his eyes.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was located a bit further back in the direction they had come from, with the Xuantian Continent behind him.&nbsp;The Terror Sea Dragon lived in the deep oceans, after all.&nbsp;If he waited here, it was unlikely that the Terror Sea Dragon would suddenly appear next to him.</p>
 <p>This entire time, the Tenebrous Demon Dragon had not halted its roar.&nbsp;Its proud, mighty draconic roar only grew louder and louder, while the aura bursting from its body only increased in dominating might.&nbsp;It wasn’t just summoning the natural Tenebrous atmospheric energies, it was also enhancing its own posture and aura.</p>
 <p>At the Heavenly God level, every single clash was filled with incredible danger.&nbsp;Even the slightest of mistakes could result in a battle being lost.</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, Zhou Weiqing suddenly narrowed his eyes.&nbsp;Far away, a surge of absolutely terrifying power had begun to manifest itself.&nbsp;Zhou Weiqing was actually able to see it clearly when it appeared, because the dark storm clouds which had covered the skies and blocked his vision had actually been swept away like the waves.&nbsp;They left behind not the azure-blue sky, but rather a vast, boundless killer wave that rose up to cover the heavens themselves.</p>
 <p>That’s right.&nbsp;It was a wave!&nbsp;This terrifying wave was nearly connected to the highest reaches of heaven itself, and it swept out with incomprehensible speed as a horrifying ocean tsunami which hurtled towards them.</p>
 <p>It really was the ruler of the seas.&nbsp;This was the power of the Terror Sea Dragon, right?&nbsp;Zhou Weiqing felt tremendously shocked, and he sent himself hurriedly backwards as well.</p>
 <p>He could vaguely see that in the exact center of that vast wave, there was an enormous draconic held formed out of ocean water that was bellow ferociously.&nbsp;It was like the roar of the sea itself, and it actually managed to forcibly overwhelm the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s roar.</p>
 <p>Such incredible power!&nbsp;The color of the sea almost instantly turned a clear blue color, as though all other colors had been pushed off to one side.&nbsp;The entire sea itself seemed to roil and shudder as the terrifying giant wave rose higher and higher.&nbsp;The dense Water Attribute atmospheric energies burst forth like a geyser, furiously driving away the Tenebrous energies nearby.</p>
 <p>This was the ocean, after all.&nbsp;The strongest, densest Attribute here remained Water!&nbsp;In addition, the Terror Sea Dragon’s cultivation base was above the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s to begin with.&nbsp;As their energies clashed against each other, the aura which the Tenebrous Demon Dragon had just established moments ago quickly began to weaken.</p>
 <p>However, the Tenebrous Demon Dragon didn’t back down in the slightest.&nbsp;Although it gradually halted its draconic roar, the storm clouds in the air above it solidified to become nearly physical.&nbsp;They continuously clashed against that distant, awesome tidal wave, with flickers of light being generated with each collision.&nbsp;All of the various elemental Attributes in the world were trembling violently.</p>
 <p>This was a battle between Heavenly Gods.&nbsp;The sea or the storm clouds… both represented the mighty power of nature.&nbsp;These Heavenly Gods were able to summon the mighty power of nature to do battle against each other.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing watched, his eyes shining excitedly.&nbsp;He probably wouldn’t have many chances to see battles like this in his life.&nbsp;Even the tiniest bit of energy or experience he managed to gain out of this would be of tremendous benefit to his future cultivation.</p>
 <p>The towering tidal wave suddenly came to a halt, roughly three thousand meters away.&nbsp;The tidal wave slowly parted, revealing to Zhou Weiqing an incomparably massive figure which appeared within the crystal-clear blue waters of the sea.</p>
 <p><em>Terror Sea Dragon.&nbsp;So this is a Terror Sea Dragon?</em> The Tenebrous Demon Dragon looked quite savage, but compared to the Terror Sea Dragon the Tenebrous Demon Dragon was definitely a ‘handsome lad’.</p>
 <p>The Terror Sea Dragon’s body was far larger than the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s.&nbsp;It was over a hundred meters long, but it had no wings.&nbsp;Its entire body was long and round, but it was covered with deep blue spikes.&nbsp;The spikes around its head in particular were very large, with each being at least half a meter wide.&nbsp;The spikes matched its open maw in ferocity and ugliness, but they also gave it a sense of limitless majesty.</p>
 <p>“You finally came?&nbsp;You are no longer going to hide away in that gorge of yours?”&nbsp;The Terror Sea Dragon’s voice sounded like that of a strong man’s, and its tone was full of disdain.</p>
 <p>The Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s gaze was extremely focused.&nbsp;As it had suspected, this Terror Sea Dragon had reached an even higher cultivation base than itself had… and it had yet to enter the Tenebrous Demon Sealing Formation’s reach.</p>
 <p>“You’ve been bringing storms and calamities to the seashore, bringing misery to the masses.&nbsp;Are you not afraid of divine punishment?&nbsp;You should know that our level, we need to be prepared for punishment from the heavens at all times,” the Tenebrous Demon Dragon said coldly.</p>
 <p>“Ahahaha…” The Terror Sea Dragon seemed to have heard the funniest joke in the world, and it laughed with abandon. “Divine punishment? You speak to me of bringing misery to the masses? By what right? And that human on your head… humans bring more misery to their fellows than anyone else! How much profit do you humans take from our vast oceans each year? How many sea-dwelling creatures do you slaughter? You speak to me of misery? Of divine punishment? Not even the heavens are necessarily able to subdue me! Tenebrous Demon Dragon, years ago my father was lured onto land and murdered by Xuantian Palace with your help. After all these years, I’ve finally achieved my cultivation goals. So long as I live, the people of Xuantian Palace can forget about making a living off of my seas.”</p>
 <p>The Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s eyes turned even colder.&nbsp;“Your father?&nbsp;It wouldn’t have died if it wasn’t so damn arrogant.&nbsp;Don’t forget what it did!&nbsp;It used sea beasts to lure in Heavenly Jewel Masters, then devoured them to strengthen itself.&nbsp;It actually devoured many Heavenly King-level Heavenly Core Nuclei!&nbsp;It aroused the wrath of all Jewel Masters, which is why Xuantian Palace intervened.&nbsp;In the end, we paid a great price to deal with it.&nbsp;Are you planning to follow in its footsteps?”</p>
 <p>The Terror Sea Dragon said disdainfully, “Don’t give me that nonsense.&nbsp;You should know that our world is one where the strongest rule as kings.&nbsp;Humans?&nbsp;Humans are nothing more than insects.&nbsp;If it wasn’t for the fact that they have an affinity for cultivation which far surpasses that of us Heavenly Beasts, they wouldn’t even be able to survive in this world.&nbsp;The ocean is mine!&nbsp;I am the lord of the entire ocean.&nbsp;For you humans to encroach upon the sea is the same as insulting me.&nbsp;Today, I’ll first wipe out the lot of you, then go deal with the humans on Xuantian Continent.&nbsp;If my cultivation base progresses one step further, it would be possible for me to overturn the entire Xuantian Continent.”</p>
 <p>The Tenebrous Demon Dragon coveted the Terror Sea Dragon’s Heavenly Core Nucleus, but the Terror Sea Dragon coveted the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s as well!&nbsp;This Terror Sea Dragon probably knew a great about the Xuantian Continent.&nbsp;The only one in the entire Xuantian Continent capable of withstanding it was this Heavenly God-level Tenebrous Demon Dragon.&nbsp;Once it killed the Tenebrous Demon Dragon, the entire Xuantian Continent would be ripe for the plucking.&nbsp;After that, it might even be in a position to lust after the distant Boundless Mainland.&nbsp;But of course, for now that was just a passing fancy.&nbsp;It would have to seriously consider all of its options before actually heading to the Boundless Mainland, as that was the place where the Dragon Emperor Lineage came from.</p>
 <p>The Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s wings slowly spread open as it stared at the wave-shrouded Terror Sea Dragon, then growled, “Since you are determined to persist in the error of your ways, today shall be the day of your death.&nbsp;You’ll share the same fate as your father.”</p>
 <p>After speaking, the Tenebrous Demon Dragon let out a furious roar, then sent its ponderous body shooting into the air.&nbsp;Moments later, the Tenebrous Demon Clouds in the air suddenly pulled back to instead surround the Tenebrous Demon Dragon.</p>
 <p>Just a blink of an eye later, an enormous streak of black light slammed right into the great wave on the opposite side.</p>
 <p>The black light was completely formed out of Tenebrous Demon Clouds.&nbsp;As it shot out, it began to reveal the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s form within it.&nbsp;The sky-blotting Tenebrous Demon Clouds suddenly and completely vanished, which meant that this strike had actually consolidated all of the power of those clouds.</p>
 <p>The Tenebrous Demon Dragon knew just how powerful the Terror Sea Dragon was in the ocean, and so it immediately attacked with maximum power.&nbsp;The enormous streak of black light completely solidified into the form of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon, but it was still a pure energy construct.&nbsp;This terrifying burst of energy flashed forwards, smashing thunderously into the great wave.</p>
 <p>The Terror Sea Dragon shook its great head within the wave.&nbsp;Instantly, an incomparably vast draconic head formed from the waves of the sea soared into the skies, clashing fiercely against the cloud-formed Tenebrous Demon Dragon.</p>
 <p>Boom!&nbsp;Zhou Weiqing felt as though his soul itself was shaking.&nbsp;He actually plummeted straight into the ocean as his soul seemed to explode.&nbsp;The pressure shockwave from that terrifying collision had actually blasted him into the ocean!</p>
 <p>If Zhou Weiqing had been any other six-Jeweled Heavenly Master, he probably would’ve been killed by that shockwave.&nbsp;Thankfully, he had an incredibly strong body and Saint Energy.</p>
 <p>A collision between Heavenly Gods was definitely enough to destroy the world around them!</p>
 <p>Moments later, the real energy shockwave from that collision completely exploded.&nbsp;The sea itself was thrown into turmoil.&nbsp;By the time Zhou Weiqing’s head popped up above the surface of the sea, he saw the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s vast body hurtle backwards.&nbsp;Clearly, it had come off somewhat the worse in that clash.</p>
 <p>A beam of blood-red light suddenly shot out from the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s head.&nbsp;That light had been unleashed from the dragon spear in Dreamwake’s hands.</p>
 <p>Something strange happened. That arrogant Terror Sea Dragon revealed a rather nervous look when it saw the blood-red light. It ceased its pursuit and instead sent its vast bulk diving deep into the ocean.</p>
