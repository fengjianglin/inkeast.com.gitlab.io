 <p><b>Chapter 211 Bribing Father-in-Law! (2)</b></p>
 <p>Moving to the front, Zhan LingTian looked at Zhou Weiqing with furrowed brows, saying solemnly: “Zhou Weiqing, you are here for the Heavenly Jewel Tournament right? Since that is the case, why did you come to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing started momentarily. “Did you not hear my shout just now? I am here to look for Bing’er.”</p>
 <p>A cold light flashed in Zhan LingTian’s eyes. “Just for Miss Bing’er?”</p>
 <p>Seeing his cold and aloof look, Zhou Weiqing was somewhat unhappy. “Bro Zhan, what do you mean? It seems like who I am looking for is none of your business. I have earned the plaque to come to the Heavenly Jewel Island, and I do not need to report to you why I have come here.”</p>
 <p>Zhan LingTian took a deep breath, calming himself down. Fixing Zhou Weiqing with a fiery gaze, he said: “Zhou Weiqing, I challenge you. If you lose, you are not allowed to provoke First Young Miss any longer.”</p>
 <p>Understanding dawned upon Zhou Weiqing. “You know about that?”</p>
 <p>Zhan LingTian said coldly: “Whatever your relationship is with Second Young Miss and Third Young Miss, I do not care. However, First Young Miss is the heir to our Heaven’s Expanse Palace, the next Heaven’s Expanse Palace Master. You will not be disrespectful to her.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly, saying: “Even if we discuss this matter, it should be the two Palace Masters discussing it with me. Can you make the decision for Xue’er?”</p>
 <p>“Very well, let me discuss with you then. Shall we discuss?!” All of a sudden, a clear voice rang out, with a hint of anger.</p>
 <p>The air in front of Zhou Weiqing warped slightly, and the next instant, a figure appeared.</p>
 <p>The figure was none other than the father of the three Shangguan Sisters, the Second Palace Master of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, Shangguan Tianyue.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyue’s expression was even uglier than Zhan LingTian. Looking at Zhou Weiqing as if he was some thief that had stolen his most precious possession.</p>
 <p>Seeing that it was his future father-in-law, Zhou Weiqing instantly turned honest and polite. He quickly bowed in greeting: “Greetings, Father-in-law.”</p>
 <p>“Who’s your father in law?!” Shangguan Tianyue waved his sleeve, and Zhou Weiqing felt as if the air tightened around him, forcefully making him straighten his waist.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyue said angrily: “Zhou Weiqing, you little brat. Let me ask you, how has my Heaven’s Expanse Palace treated you? How has my ZhongTian Empire treated you?!”</p>
 <p>Towards this father in law of his, naturally Zhou Weiqing could not treat him the same way as he did Zhan LingTian. Quickly, he said respectfully: “Both the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and ZhongTian Empire have treated me very well.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyue said: “You also know that we have treated you well? Not speaking of how Fei’er helped you trained those men of yours, even to the point of using our secret recipe and medicines to help them. Just the fact that we allowed you to bring away so many Jewel Masters, how much help is that to you? We even supported you financially in your efforts to revive your Empire… What about you? How have you repaid me?!”</p>
 <p>“You little bastard, not only did you take Bing’er’s virtue, and you even provoked Fei’er… fine. Now, you won’t even let Xue’er go. You little playboy brat! I just want to smack you dead with a single slap.” As he continued speaking, his anger grew, and a powerful aura burst forth from Shangguan Tianyue, causing the entire air around them to freeze.</p>
 <p>Of course, as the saying goes ‘Don’t wash one’s dirty linen in public’[1. The mandarin saying is family troubles should not be talked about in public]. Despite his anger, his voice could only be heard by Zhou Weiqing; even Zhan LingTian standing next to him could not hear anything else.</p>
 <p>Seeing Shangguan Tianyue’s rage, with a sudden thud, Zhou Weiqing just knelt down on the ground, kowtowing to Shangguan Tianyue three times. “Father in Law, I am wrong. I have no objections no matter how you wish to punish me.”</p>
 <p>Suddenly getting three kowtows from this fellow, Shangguan Tianyue was also stunned. Originally, he had already resolved to teach this brat a lesson. However, now that he was honestly kneeling in front of him, ready to take the punishment, it actually caused him to feel like he couldn’t take action.</p>
 <p>The reason why Zhou Weiqing acted like this was because he had suddenly thought things through. Simply put - if he had been in Shangguan Tianyue’s shoes, having a youth steal all three of his daughters’ hearts, he would probably be even angrier than Shangguan Tianyue. It was true that it was his fault for being such a playboy, so he had nothing else to say. Since it was his fault, he would accept the punishment.</p>
 <p>However, if it were Zhan LingTian who came pointing fingers, he would not be so polite; he had never been afraid of a fight. In his eyes, the difference was Zhan LingTian was just being envious and jealous, they were love rivals in this matter. Instead, Shangguan Tianyue was his future father in law, so Zhou Weiqing was extremely well behaved. No matter how Shangguan Tianyue dealt with him, as long as it did not cross the bottom line, he would take it. If he wanted to enjoy the marriage of these few girls, he had to pay the price first.</p>
 <p>“Get up!” Shangguan Tianyue said exasperatedly. Another flick of his sleeve, and the air around forced Zhou Weiqing up, not allowing him to kneel any longer.</p>
 <p>Looking at this Zhou Weiqing’s honest, well behaved, earnest and flattering look, Shangguan Tianyue almost burst out laughing. He could not understand how such a brat like this could actually steal the hearts of his three precious daughters. Although Xue’er did not admit it outright, as a father and a person who had experienced love before, how could he not see it?</p>
 <p>“Zhou Weiqing, let me ask you. If I force you to choose one of my three daughters, who would you choose?” Shangguan Tianyue said solemnly.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing asked tentatively: “Can’t I choose all?”</p>
 <p>“No!” The flames of rage that had just subsided rose up once more.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Heh heh, then I shall not choose at all. I’ll find a chance to steal them all away in the future.”</p>
 <p>“You must be daydreaming. This is the Heavenly Jewel Island, where my Heaven’s Expanse Palace is. With just you alone, you think you can steal my little girls away?” Shangguan Tianyue said disdainfully.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Of course I am not able to do so currently, but that doesn’t mean I won’t be able to do so in the future. Father in law, how about this, shall we place a bet? Within five years, if I am able to steal them away, you will no longer intervene in our matter, how about it? If I can do it, it will also prove my abilities.”</p>
 <p>“Bullshit, what do you take my daughters for? If you dare steal them, I’ll destroy your Heavenly Bow Empire.” Shangguan Tianyue wished he could just destroy this little brat with a single slap.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing gave an aggrieved look as he said: “Father in Law, I am wrong. But… I can’t control my heart like that! I will definitely treat them well. The relationship between me and Bing’er, well, I don’t need to speak more about that. For my sake, Fei’er almost died, how could I abandon her? As for Xue’er, you understand her the most. I was intimate with her unwittingly, and with her temper, she would never marry anyone else. Furthermore, she had made a bet to marry me. So, I really cannot let anyone go!”</p>
 <p>The more Shangguan Tianyue heard, the angrier he got. Taking a step forward, he kicked Zhou Weiqing on the chest, sending him flying off the Heavenly Jewel Island.</p>
 <p>“Bastard! Asshole!”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was also rather depressed. Shangguan Tianyue’s kick had not been light at all. Although he did not use any Heavenly Energy, it was still a kick from a Heavenly Emperor! That was a terrifying blow indeed!</p>
 <p>*Swoosh* The wings behind his back spread out instantly, stopping his fall in mid air. Looking at Shangguan Tianyue’s rage, he dared not fly back too quickly.</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, a sudden spark of inspiration struck Zhou Weiqing. In the air, he said to Shangguan Tianyue: “Father in law, please let me on the island first? I have a matter of utmost importance to report.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyue was still on the edge, in the midst of his fit of anger. Glaring at Zhou Weiqing, he snarled: “Stop talking rubbish. Get lost now, otherwise I’ll beat you up until you can’t even take care of yourself. We’ll see how you join the Heavenly Jewel Tournament then.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing gave a distressed expression as he said: “Father in law, just let me say a few words. If you still want me to leave, I will do so without any other protest, and I will promise never to bother Xue’er, Fei’er and Bing’er again. What do you say? What I am about to say is regarding the rise or fall of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace.”</p>
 <p>For Shangguan Tianyue to appear here, it was truly because as a father, he could not take it, and he really wanted to teach Zhou Weiqing a lesson. Of course, he was still very satisfied with Zhou Weiqing as a son in law.</p>
 <p>Ever since the first time he had seen Zhou Weiqing, right up to this point, his feelings had undergone an unbelievable transformation. The news sources of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace were far beyond Zhou Weiqing’s imagination. Furthermore, the Shangguan Sisters had pretty much each followed him all through his journey, accompanying him one after the other. As a result, Shangguan Tianyue could be said to be extremely familiar with all his experiences.</p>
 <p>What Zhou Weiqing had done in the north borders… even when the Shangguan brothers, Shangguan Tianyang and Shangguan Tianyue discussed it, they could only use the word ‘miracle’ to describe it. To form such an army troop by himself… one that actually had the power to turn the tides against a sure-loss scenario against the WanShou Empire. Of course, there was the support of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace which allowed it to happen, or even the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor’s financial support. However, if it were anyone else, could they even duplicate the feat even if they were given all the same resources?</p>
 <p>Perhaps the bigger surprise for Shangguan Tianyue was that Zhou Weiqing had actually dared to charge up the Heavenly Snow Mountain for Tian’er’s sake… to cause trouble! And that Master of his, he had actually accompanied him along on such a crazy quest. The craziest thing was that they had succeeded! Besides feeling that it was inconceivable and beyond their comprehension, the Shangguan Brothers could only feel good about it. After all, the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and Heavenly Snow Mountain had fought for such a long time. For the Heavenly Snow Mountain to suffer a loss, no matter how small, how could they not be happy?</p>
 <p>As such, even though Shangguan Tianyue was scolding Zhou Weiqing, wanting to teach him a lesson, deep in his heart he was still very satisfied with this son in law. Zhou Weiqing could truly live up to the saying ‘A Dragon or Phoenix amongst men’. However, he was afraid that in the future Fei’er or Bing’er would suffer in the future if they followed him, so he still wanted to teach him a lesson. As for Shangguan Xue’er, it was true that in his heart, he was really unwilling to let her marry Zhou Weiqing. After all, Shangguan Xue’er was the heir of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace!</p>
 <p>“Get down here and speak.” Shangguan Tianyue said coldly. At the same time, he waved his hands, motioning for the others to leave.</p>
 <p>Zhan LingTian hesitated a moment, but with the signal from Shangguan Tianyue’s eyes, he had no choice but to leave unwillingly.</p>
 <p>Towards Zhou Weiqing, Zhan LingTian actually had quite some understanding. In his eyes, Zhou Weiqing was unbelievably sneaky and cunning. Who knew if that fellow had some method to talk to and persuade Shangguan Tianyue. Alas, he did not have any choice, and he could not speak too much regarding it to Shangguan Tianyue, and could only turn and leave.</p>
 <p>Flapping his wings, Zhou Weiqing returned to the Heavenly Jewel Island in a flash, his face still with the aggrieved look.</p>
