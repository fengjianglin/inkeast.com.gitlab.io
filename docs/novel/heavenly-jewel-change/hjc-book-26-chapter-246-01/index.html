It was even more startling when the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tenebrous Demon Dragon gave that curious sound, causing his heart to jump and grip.&nbsp;</span></p>

That would be a feat that surpassed the difficulty of climbing up the heavens. Furthermore, even if he could escape, what would happen to Shangguan Bing’er, stuck in the XuanTian Citadel as she was?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Luckily, the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tenebrous Demon Dragon only gave out the curious ‘Ehh’, but did not continue with any actions.&nbsp;</span></p>

A new core disciple that you have groomed? From his body, it is as if I can sense a familiar and affectionate aura.” The&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tenebrous Demon Dragon said curiously.&nbsp;</span></p>

He had already prepared his excuses regarding that; attempting to run was not realistic at all, and even if he could, he still had his mission to consider. Even if his cultivation level was discovered, he still had a chance to talk his way out of things. After all, he was from another continent totally, and in this XuanTian Continent, no one could actually find any evidence that he had any plots against the XuanTian Palace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dreamwake looked at Zhou Weiqing in surprise, as she couldn’t help but repeat the words: “Familiar and affectionate aura? Could you have sensed wrongly? He is not a new disciple that we have groomed. After all, those who are able to come here into your presence are naturally only the most upper echelons of the XuanTian Palace. Let me introduce you, this young man is Zhou Weiqing, he is a Consecrate rank who has newly joined the XuanTian Palace as a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master?! A six-Jeweled God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master?!” Indeed, under the cover of the Saint Energy, not even this Heavenly God Tier&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tenebrous Demon Dragon was able to discover Zhou Weiqing’s true cultivation level.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dreamwake looked at Zhou Weiqing with much surprise: “You have broken through?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Heh, I’ve only just entered the six-Jeweled stage not long ago.” He had slightly raised his ‘cover’ cultivation stage, in order to better hide his true strength. This was especially so because he knew they might be going after the Terror Sea Dragon, and thus he had carefully adjusted his display of aura and power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dreamwake continued looking at him with some surprise before finally nodding to the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tenebrous Demon Dragon, saying: “He used his own power to prove that he truly is a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master. Consecrated Zhou’s spiritual energy is extremely outstanding, far beyond anyone of his level… almost reaching that of a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse. Furthermore, his Elemental Jewels include the Wind, Spatial and Time Attributes. These three are the perfect combination for a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, especially with a powerful Skill of the Time Attribute to help control the creation of God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, allowing him to reverse time in a very short period, preventing himself from making any mistakes. As such, he is barely able to create a true God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll, and we have deemed him to be a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master. Consecrated Zhou is barely twenty years of age, and his future is extremely promising and limitless.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tenebrous Demon Dragon did not let Zhou Weiqing because of Dreamwake’s words. Looking him once over with his strange red eyes, he said: “Young man, can you tell me… what is that strangely familiar and comforting feeling you give me… where does it come from?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he was still under Dreamwake’s protection, in that moment, under the dragon’s fixed stare, Zhou Weiqing could still sense an unparalleled pressure pushing down upon him. This was a pressure that came from the spirit itself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It looks like if he didn’t reveal some secrets this time, it would not be possible to get past this stage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing said respectfully: “Zhou Weiqing greets Senior. I believe I know why you can sense a familiar and comforting feeling from me. Perhaps, that is because my Elemental Jewel Attributes are in sync with yours.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tenebrous Demon Dragon said: “In sync with mine? My Attribute is the purest of the Tenebrous Attribute, but yours is the Wind, Time and Spatial Attributes… how could it be the same or be in sync?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing grinned. Whenever he faced such massive pressure, that was the time his brain was the clearest, his finest moments. He also had a unique quality about him, that was he would never back down from fear. In the past, when he was facing the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord, it was also the same, similar to this time. Long before he had even become a Heavenly Jewel Master, Mu En had taught him that the more danger you were in, the calmer you had to be. The more confidence and calmness you showed, the safer you would be.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, Consecrated Dreamwake only mentioned a portion of my Elemental Jewel Attributes. Originally, this is my greatest secret, but in front of Senior, I guess it is impossible to hide this secret any longer. This junior has a unique cultivation technique, I would like to invite Senior to please advice me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he said that, he took a grand step forward, actually moving out of Dreamwake’s protection.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as he left Dreamwake’s protective aura, Zhou Weiqing instantly felt the pressure on him increase dramatically, almost causing him to be unable to breathe. However, he still stood upright, back straightened, forcefully accepting the pressure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dreamwake’s expression was not too good at this point, and her gaze at Zhou Weiqing was slightly angered. Wasn’t this rascal so cowardly that he had to hug her because they jumped off the cliff? Yet, facing a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse like the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tenebrous Demon Dragon, he could actually dare to walk out of her protective aura in such a calm and unhurried manner… would he actually be afraid of jumping off a cliff? This… this naughty rascal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If not for it being such a unique circumstance now, perhaps Dreamwake would have given him a tight slap right now. However, she couldn’t help but admit that when Zhou Weiqing walked out of her protective aura with his head held high, to face the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tenebrous Demon Dragon alone, it was very manly indeed!</span></p>

When the Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Elemental Jewels appeared around his left wrist, the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s eyes clearly narrowed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a wave of his left hand, the six Alexandrite Elemental Jewels rose into the air. In that instant, they all changed colours instantly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wind, Lightning, Darkness, Spatial, Time, Demonic.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a flourish of both hands, two triangular formations seemed to form naturally, and under the shocked gazes of the onlookers, his six Elemental Jewels began to slowly join together.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">*WENG*</span></p>

The six different lights rose up into the skies, naturally forming a shield of light, enveloping Zhou Weiqing’s body. In that instant, the pressure he was enduring clearly dropped. As Zhou Weiqing’s hands swung down once more, the now six-sided star began to descend, stopping beneath his feet. The six lights began to rise once more, and in the pitch black darkness of the zone, they just seemed so brilliant and eye catching.&nbsp;</span></p>

All of them could easily see that such a talented Heavenly Jewel Master like Zhou Weiqing would never Store such low level Skills. Yet, he was able to unleash them… what did that mean?&nbsp;</span></p>

When I learned I had six Elemental Attributes, I had been thinking all along, how I could use the power of my six attributes and unleash them to maximum effect. As such, I went through various different experiments, trying out many things. At last, not long ago, when I broke through the six-Jeweled stage, through some coincidence and luck, I created this formation. The profound secret behind this Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation is in imitation and guiding. It is able to guide the atmospheric energies in the air to greatly increase my recovery speed of Heavenly Energy, allowing my fighting capabilities to be greatly extended and sustained. Furthermore, with this Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, I am able to imitate any Skills of my attributes which are at six-star rated and below. However, I have only just created it, so I will still need a lot more time to properly work it out and use it properly. However, I believe that as my cultivation increases, its power will only improve.&nbsp;</span></p>

Originally, they had all thought that Zhou Weiqing was just extremely talented in the Consolidating Equipment Master arts.

Six Attribute Elemental Jewels… and this&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation of his?

It has been years since I have seen such a pure Demonic Attribute. Very good, it looks like the future of the XuanTian Palace is truly bright indeed.
