 <p><b>Chapter 123 Groom or Doom! (3)</b></p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er flushed slightly, and after a moment of hesitation, she bit her lip and entered the tent as well. Sitting down opposite of Zhou Weiqing cross legged, she started cultivating; but making sure she kept as far as possible.</p>
 <p>The inside of the tent had been cleaned and aired by Zhou Weiqing, and though it was small, it was relatively clean and comfortable. However, with just the two of them in such a small area, they could even hear each other’s heartbeats. Shangguan Fei’er felt a light burning sensation on her face.</p>
 <p>Carefully peeling off the mask, starting from the neck area, Shangguan Fei’er finally revealed her own original face, showing the slightly blushing beauty below.</p>
 <p>Alas, the current Zhou Weiqing did not manage to witness that beautiful sight. He was seated cross-legged in a meditation state, cultivating his Immortal Deity Technique while pondering about the Ruffian Battalion.</p>
 <p>From Shen Bu’s description, the Ruffian Battalion was undoubtedly the best place for him to start. That was because it was very separate from the normal command structure, and would not be given much orders, perhaps not even considered part of the army in the others’ eyes. Furthermore, for those soldiers to be sent to the Ruffian Battalion, they should definitely have some power. After all, it was not easy to survive as a ruffian or scoundrel.</p>
 <p>Of course, just like what Shen Bu had said, this Ruffian Battalion was not so easily controlled, and he had to plan for the worst.</p>
 <p>Mu En had once taught Zhou Weiqing that no matter what happened, he had to think of all the worst case scenarios. If he felt that the first case scenario was barely acceptable, or survivable, then he should go ahead with it daringly. If not, he would have to consider again.</p>
 <p>Entering the Ruffian Battalion, the worst case scenario for him should be being chased out. Zhou Weiqing dismissed the possibility of being killed there; besides his confidence in his own power, he also had the two Icy Soul Heavenly Bears with him and the Silver Emperor Little Red Bean with him. That was not even counting Shangguan Fei’er together with him. Zhou Weiqing was confident that protecting themselves would not be an issue at all.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er looked at Zhou Weiqing quietly. That rascal actually started cultivating without looking at her. Was he shy or something? Hmph! If that rascal could be shy, there would not be any shy people in the entire world! “Hmph! That scoundrel!” She muttered to herself softly.</p>
 <p>Before entering the tent, she was still worried that Zhou Weiqing might try to do something untoward to her. However, seeing him so well behaved, she suddenly felt a slight sense of disappointment. This was truly the paradox of a woman, under some unique circumstances, they would have such a strange feeling.</p>
 <p>This night would prove to be a very well behaved night for Zhou Weiqing, and he cultivated through the whole night, until the sun had come up outside.</p>
 <p>The tent’s ‘protection’ against the sun rays were nothing to brag about. As soon as the morning came, the tent was bright and hot as well.</p>
 <p>The instant that Zhou Weiqing opened his eyes, he felt himself fall into a dazed trance. Just right in front of him was that unbelievably familiar face that he had longed for so much, causing his eyes to freeze on them.</p>
 <p>The light passing through the tent landed on her face, a gentle glow that accentuated that familiar countenance! Zhou Weiqing’s heart heated up, and he subconsciously leaned forward closing in on those beautiful lips.</p>
 <p>The closed eyes suddenly opened wide, blurry with sleep. However, when she saw that large face right in front of her, she instantly exclaimed in surprise, her body moving back and legs sweeping forth subconsciously.</p>
 <p>The leg struck out at Zhou Weiqing’s chest, and lost in the midst of his tender feelings, how could he have any preparation. With a tearing sound, he was sent flying out of the tent, breaking through the thin tent.</p>
 <p>*Swoosh* Shangguan Fei’er charged out after him. That earlier kick had not been a soft blow, but it did not have any Heavenly Energy imbued.</p>
 <p>“Zhou Little Fatty! What were you trying to do!?” Shangguan Fei’er glared at him angrily, as he clambered up from the ground, rubbing his chest.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled bitterly and said: “Uhhh… mistaken identity… I did not mean it.”</p>
 <p>Mistaken identity? Originally, Shangguan Fei’er was not that angry; after all she had not yet been kissed by him. Even if he actually did… well… it was not like it was the first time already… Alas, when Zhou Weiqing said the words ‘mistaken identity’, it was like igniting a barrel of gunpowder.</p>
 <p>Like a riled up little female tiger, Shangguan Fei’er pounced at him ferociously. “Scoundrel! Bastard! I’ll mistaken identity you…!”</p>
 <p>The sounds of our dear Little Fatty meeting the ground rang out, yet he did not dare cry out loud. At this moment, Shangguan Fei’er was not in disguise, and he did not want to draw attention; if anyone saw them like this, their entire act would be ruined.</p>
 <p>However, after persevering for a while, Zhou Weiqing could not take it anymore. Although Shangguan Fei’er did not use Heavenly Energy, in her anger, she was still quite savage, throwing him around until he was dazed.</p>
 <p>“Enough! Are you mad?! It’s just a mistake, I already said it was mistaken identity!”</p>
 <p>*PENG* “I’ll let you continue mistaking the wrong person!”</p>
 <p>“Heroine… have mercy… enough already!”</p>
 <p>*PENG*</p>
 <p>*PENG**PENG*</p>
 <p>“Hmph! If a tiger doesn’t show his power, you’ll think I’m a mere sick cat!” Zhou Weiqing couldn’t take it anymore and yelled out.</p>
 <p>Absolute Delay, Fetters of Wind, Touch of Darkness and the Lightning Suffering Skills. All four landed almost simultaneously on Shangguan Fei’er.</p>
 <p>In her anger, Shangguan Fei’er had totally forgotten that this was not the usual practice fight between her and Zhou Weiqing, where both were not allowed to use their Stored Skills. Although her cultivation level and power was much higher than Zhou Weiqing, caught by surprise, she was struck full on by Zhou Weiqing’s four powerful Skills, and her body froze in place.</p>
 <p>Seizing the chance, Zhou Weiqing grabbed hold of her, his left hand pushing down on the back of her neck, locking her in place. He then pushed her down to his legs, striking down with a palm to her pert buttocks.</p>
 <p>“Hmph! I’ll show you, hitting me for no reason, this is what you owe me, I’ll collect my debt right now myself!”</p>
 <p>At first, Shangguan Fei’er attempted to struggle. However, the vertebrae was main control center of the body, and once restricted, she was not able to use any strength. After a few slaps, she stopped struggling, lying down across Zhou Weiqing’s lap</p>
 <p>Actually, only Zhou Weiqing’s first three blows actually used some strength, and as the blows continued, they grew softer and softer. Towards beautiful ladies, his ‘resistance’ had always been extremely low, let alone this being Shangguan Fei’er, how could he possibly strike her hard for real.</p>
 <p>After about a dozen slaps, Shangguan Fei’er’s body was trembling slightly. Zhou Weiqing started, his hand frozen in the air, as he heard her sobbing cries.</p>
 <p>“Uhhm… why are you crying like this. You threw me around and punched me, I still didn’t cry…” Zhou Weiqing looked embarrassedly at Shangguan Fei’er, at a loss at what to do. He quickly released the hand on her vertebra holding her down.</p>
 <p>“Bastard… you bastard.” Shangguan Fei’er got up abruptly, kicking him down before running back into the tent.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing scratched his head, muttering to himself: “Wasn’t I the one who got beaten up more?! This Heaven’s Expanse Palace Little Demon Girl truly lives up to her name. What was that about?”</p>
 <p>Just as Zhou Weiqing was about to return to the tent as well, a troop of soldiers walked over. They were Shen Bu’s personal guards.</p>
 <p>The one right in the front was holding a set of armour, with the helmet on top with a red feather. The guard behind him was holding several sets of army uniforms as well as commander’s seals, plaques and the like.</p>
 <p>Seeing them, Zhou Weiqing did not return to the tent, instead standing there awaiting their arrival.</p>
 <p>The leading guard yesterday, who he had already seen yesterday, handed the armour to Zhou Weiqing before saying with a slight mocking lilt in his voice: “Congratulations, Battalion Commander Zhou. Today, you have been assigned as the Battalion Commander for the Ruffian Battalion. This are the uniforms for you and your follower, as well as the equipment for Battalion Commanders. Please change now, and we will escort you to the Ruffian Battalion.”</p>
 <p>What escort… this was clearly monitoring and supervising… to ensure he was sent to the Ruffian Battalion.</p>
 <p>Still, Zhou Weiqing did not burst their bubble. Smiling faintly, he picked up a few sets of army uniforms, throwing one into the tent for Shangguan Fei’er. As for himself, he just changed into a set out in the open, before wearing his armour. His stature was massive, and wearing that armour with the red feather in his helmet, he looked valiant and inspiring indeed.</p>
 <p>Besides the armour, there was a longsword and a plaque made out of an unknown metal. On the plaque were the words ‘Unique Battalion 1’, this was likely the actual formation name of the Ruffian Battalion.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing took the Commander’s Plaque and sheathed his sword. In his heart, he felt a twinge, a strange feeling. Battalion Commander. How things had changed so quickly. He was actually a Battalion Commander now, in charge of a thousand men!</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er came out of the tent, once again masked and disguised. Her figure was much more slender than Zhou Weiqing’s, and her equipment was much simpler as well. An army uniform over a light leather armor, and a plain knife.</p>
 <p>There were twenty of those personal guards in total, and they moved out very naturally in a formation around the two of them. The leader of the guards said: “Battalion Commander Zhou, the horses have already been prepared outside the main gates. Please, let’s head out.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “At least let us have breakfast before leaving right?”</p>
 <p>The guard said: “I’m sorry, as Battalion Commander is no longer part of our Sixteenth Regiment, we did not prepare your breakfasts.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “Very well, let’s go then.” He pulled Shangguan Fei’er away, who was clearly about to lose her temper. Under the ‘escort’ of the twenty guards, they moved out.</p>
 <p>Right outside the Sixteenth Regiment, twenty two fine horses had already been prepared. After all, it was quite some distance between here to the Ruffian Battalion on the front lines.</p>
 <p>Mounting the horses, the entire party started moving out in a cloud of dust, and before long they were galloping towards the north.</p>
 <p>The two sisters, Shen Bu and Shen Yi, were already dressed in their formal armour, standing at the main gates, watching Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er leave. Shen Yi’s brow was slightly furrowed, and she said softly: “Sis, are we going too far in doing this? After all, that Zhou Little Fatty is really strong, a talent indeed!”</p>
 <p>Shen Bu gave a cold humph and said: “So what if he is a talent? A talent who cannot listen to orders, what use is he in the army? Let him stew in the Ruffian Battalion for a short while; it shouldn’t take long for him to run back to beg me. At that time, hmph hmph.” Thinking about that Zhou Little Fatty’s hateful actions yesterday, she couldn’t help but feel the anger rise up in her again.</p>
