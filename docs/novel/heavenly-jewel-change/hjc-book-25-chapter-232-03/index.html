Even for the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord, if he wanted to use the Skill, he would have to be extremely careful. Of course, the amount of energy required for the Skill was also different depending on the revival target. For example, reviving a little ordinary mouse and a powerful dragon would definitely be extremely different in terms of the power required.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tian’er grasped the God Spirit Staff tight in her right hand, slowly brandishing it as she chanted, and the God Spirit Staff arced through the air in a mysterious profound manner, as the gold light of the God Tier Consolidated Equipment began to form a complicated gold symbol in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the symbols appeared, they began to rise in the air, floating above the body of the dragon Hui Yao. Every time an additional symbol appeared, it would join the others, and another ray of gold light would be emitted from the respective symbol into Hui Yao’s body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, although he had already established the large Saint Energy whirlpool with Tian’er, he did not have much other sensations. After all, Tian’er was still using her Heavenly Energy to begin the Resurrection Skill; unlike him she had not fully transformed her Heavenly Energy into Saint Energy and formed a full cycle of creation. As such, when she used her Skills, she would still first prioritise Heavenly Energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The usage of the Ressurection Skill was far longer than either of them had imagined… almost two hours had passed before the one hundred and eighth last gold symbol was formed, and all of the gold symbols began to rearrange themselves to form a large diagram of light in the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Tian’er paused for a moment, glancing at Zhou Weiqing. Instantly, Zhou Weiqing also grew nervous. He knew that it was time for the ‘real’ revival to begin; all of the preparatory work had finally ended.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Raising the God Spirit Staff up high, Tian’er’s chanting instantly became faster, as if agitated or excited. Her entire body could no longer be seen from the outside, all that could be seen was the bright gold of the pure Divine Attribute.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Floating above the dragon Hui Yao’s body, the one hundred and eight gold symbols seemed to be primed and activated, and a hundred and eight bright gold light rays instantly shot down from above into the Hui Yao’s body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, the atmospheric energy in the air began to fluctuate violently, and the God Spirit Staff also burst forth with a ray of brilliant gold light, shining up high into the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, the entire Lustre Spatial Realm began to shudder violently, as if due to that ray of gold light. Soon after, the one hundred and eight gold symbols began to flow towards the light, forming themselves around it as the central focal point.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant, Zhou Weiqing could sense the Heavenly Energy in Tian’er’s body surging out from her as if in torrents, being released crazily from the God Spirit Staff.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A layer of gold misty light surrounded the one hundred and eight symbols, slowly covering Hui Yao’s body entirely. Its originally crimson red body was now fully a brilliant gold.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Resurrection Skill was a Skill that could wrestle fortune from heaven and earth, and anyone who looked upon the Resurrection Skill as it appeared would have a different comprehension and understanding in their mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing slowly closed his eyes, his Immortal Deity Technique circulating fully again, and he turned into a gold coloured whirlpool once more. It wasn’t exactly a gold whirlpool, just that when Zhou Weiqing’s entire body turned gold, the atmospheric energy started to draw in a terrifying pace, forming the look of a giant whirlpool. Even the absorption rate of Tian’er’s God Spirit Staff was no match for him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t that the God Spirit Staff wasn’t powerful, but Zhou Weiqing’s completed Immortal Deity Technique was just too strong, especially since his cultivation now was above Tian’er by quite a substantial amount.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By this point, the light rays that the God Spirit Staff was emitting was now with a hint of silver white. Tian’er’s Heavenly Energy was almost drained dry in such a short period of time, and she was beginning to infuse Saint Energy into the Resurrection Skill. However, as she did so, her face relaxed slightly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As she switched the infusing Saint Energy into the Resurrection Skill, the drain lessened abruptly, a far cry from the previous massive drain on Heavenly Energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The mother dragon Duo Si was at the side, watching nervously. Her claw was already set in a stable position in front of Zhou Weiqing, ready to help at any moment’s notice. Her other claw was now digging deep into the tough granite, showing how nervous she truly was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three Shangguan Sisters stood at the back watching nervously, not even daring to breathe too loudly. The most nervous was naturally Shangguan Xue’er; after all whether or not they could succeed in reviving Hui Yao would also determine the future safety of the Lustre Spatial Realm, and more importantly, the safety of the entire ZhongTian City and the millions of ordinary citizens. How could she not be nervous?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gold light that shone upon Hui Yao’s body continued seeping into it, the body like a massive sponge as it absorbed the huge amount of Divine Attribute energy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even compared to Tian’er, the current Zhou Weiqing was actually the one who was working the hardest now. With the Immortal Deity Technique circulating at full power, the atmospheric energy was continually transformed into Saint Energy before being sent to Tian’er. Tian’er was more like a giant converter, infusing the Saint Energy that Zhou Weiqing sent her into the Ressurection Skill.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Tian’er’s face had a faint smile. She had never imagined that once she had successfully completed the Resurrection Skill, the drain upon them was far lower than expected. Of course, whether or not it finally succeeded in reviving the dragon Hui Yao would be up to the heavens.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An entire day passed just like that. At this point, Zhou Weiqing’s face was already very pale. Although he could recover his Saint Energy on his own, he could barely sustain the continued drain from the Resurrection Skill! Being able to last for an entire day, he had already gone all out with all his might, and it was already more than enough to prove how strong he was. Such a recovery speed, even a Heavenly King Stage powerhouse would not possess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Abruptly, Zhou Weiqing’s eyes snapped wide open, and he looked towards Duo Si.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Duo Si’s gaze was currently fixed on Hui Yao. As his wife, Duo Si’s senses towards Hui Yao was definitely the strongest, and she could clearly sense that her husband’s life force was slowly recovering under the Resurrection Skill. She could even hear a very faint, weak beating sound of his heart slowly growing stronger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at that moment, Duo Si’s body shuddered violently. Turning to look, she saw Zhou Weiqing place his palm on her claw, the grey swirl of the Devour Skill around his hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Duo Si nodded towards Zhou Weiqing, releasing her powerful Heavenly God Stage Heavenly Energy open without holding back, allowing Zhou Weiqing to Devour at will.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For Zhou Weiqing to persevere in sustaining the Resurrection Skill for an entire day was already far beyond her expectations, causing her to strongly admire the youth. She could clearly sense the terrifying amount of energy used thus far, yet this young human was able to last for so long. Even as a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse, she felt rather shocked and a little fear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Devour Skill began to do its work, and Zhou Weiqing’s expression began to recover. After the completion of his Immortal Deity Technique, the thirty six Death Acupuncture Points and all of his meridian channels were far stronger and more flexible than any ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master. As such, as he began Devouring, he did not have to hold back at all, and he began to regain Saint Energy at an unbelievable speed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Previously, Zhou Weiqing had Devoured Heavenly Energy from Heavenly King Stage Heavenly Beasts. However, if he compared those Heavenly Beasts to Duo Si, it could be likened to a difference between a frail ant and a powerful elephant. Duo Si’s pure Fire Attribute energy was as deep and vast as the oceans, and though it could not be compared to Saint Energy, the purity and sheer amount of it was as if a boundless horizon. Zhou Weiqing’s Devouring rate was already at an insane speed, but it felt like it was barely a drop in the ocean, not even affecting Duo Si slightly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With such a guarantee backing him up, Zhou Weiqing immediately increased his infusion of Saint Energy to Tian’er. Tian’er had once told him before that once the Ressurection Skill was used, the faster it took to complete it, the greater the chance of successful revival.Since he no longer had any worries about replenishing his Saint Energy, he naturally decided to increase the overall speed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slowly but surely, Hui Yao’s body began to undergo some strange changes. The massive body which had been stained gold by the Divine Attribute aura was now glowing, and they could see stars of gold light slowly rising up, and the giant body was also beginning to show signs of life force emitting.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having reached such a stage, the Resurrection Skill could be considered to have completed the first portion in terms of reviving the body. What would follow next would be to call back and awaken his Soul. Only by having the Soul of Hui Yao return to his freshly recovered body would the actual revival be considered a success.&nbsp;</span></p>

That was because this was the period in which the Soul has not dissipated from the body. Of course, the powerful dragons had their Heavenly Core Nucleus which could help maintain their Souls, preventing them from dissipating too quickly. However, in the history of the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Divine Heavenly Spirit Tigers, none had ever attempted to Resurrect a Dragon, so whether or not they could succeed was still unclear.&nbsp;</span></p>

As she began chanting in a low tone once more, the silver lines formed a rays of light, directly imprinting on Hui Yao’s large forehead.&nbsp;</span></p>

As the gold symbol imprinted on the forehead successfully, Hui Yao’s giant head suddenly raised up. Right in the center of his eyes, on the bone of the forehead, a ball of brilliant glowing gold light burst forth.&nbsp;</span></p>

Currently, her eyes were brightly lit as she stared at her husband’s reared head. The claw that Zhou Weiqing was holding was trembling uncontrollably… the Resurrection Skill was clearly at the last stage, and her heart was nervous and anxious.&nbsp;</span></p>

By now, her body had also began to tremble slightly. It was clear that she was reaching the limit of Saint Energy that she could endure.</span></p>

However, in the next instant, the gold light abruptly vanished into Hui Yao’s body as its giant head raised even higher.&nbsp;</span></p>
