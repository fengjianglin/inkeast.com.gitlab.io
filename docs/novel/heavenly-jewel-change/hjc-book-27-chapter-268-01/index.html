It was also exactly because of meeting the Demonic Emperor that Zhou Weiqing and Ming Yu had rushed back from the frontlines.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Witch’s crying slowed and finally stopped, but she still did not look at Zhou Weiqing, remaining seated silently at the side with her head lowered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing’s gaze would occasionally sweep over. Perhaps if not for Wu Yunyue’s presence, he would have already pulled her into his embrace to comfort her tenderly. Of course, with her father there, he would not do such a reckless thing no matter how much of a rogue he was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Yunyue looked at Zhou Weiqing again and sighed heavily, saying: “Weiqing, I believe you already know about what happened to our Heavenly Demon Sect. This time, I have come to discuss something with you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, please speak.” Zhou Weiqing dragged his gaze from Little Witch as he looked towards Wu Yunyue.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Yunyue continued: “My proposal is very simple. I hope that you can take over my position to become the Heavenly Demon Sect Master.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?!” The shocked exclamation came from Ming Yu, but Zhou Weiqing was also left stunned. Although he had several guesses regarding the reason why the Demonic Emperor would come here, he had never expected that this Demonic Emperor would actually speak such words so directly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the saying goes, a starving camel is still larger than a stout horse. Although the Heavenly Demon Sect had suffered such a calamity, they still had a third of their power. Especially since they still had this Demonic Emperor, a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, they were still a force to be reckoned with. As long as the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue still lived, who would dare say that the Heavenly Demon Sect had truly been exterminated? Yet, Wu Yunyue was currently wanting to gift away this entire influence, how could Zhou Weiqing and Ming Yu not be surprised?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Witch looked as though she had already known about her father’s decision beforehand, and she remained seated at the side, head down, silent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing drew a deep breath, saying: “Senior, why do you say that? Do you have any requests?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Yunyue shook his head, saying: “No, I do not have any difficult or awkward requests at all. All I hope is that once you inherit the position of Heavenly Demon Sect Master, you can lead the Heavenly Demon Sect to grow back to a position of power. At the same time, I hope that your future child with Hanyue will inherit the Heavenly Demon Sect in the future as well. Those are my two simple requests, and I do not need you to do anything else.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The two requests that Wu Yunyue had brought up were flawless and impeccable indeed, almost exactly the same as the conditions that Zhou Weiqing had proposed to Shangguan Tianyang previously in the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. The only difference was that Wu Yunyue actually wanted to pass the entire Great Saint Land to him, while on the Heaven’s Expanse Palace end, Zhou Weiqing had been forced into action. One could just imagine the sheer difference between the two.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing gave a bitter smile as he said: “Senior, you think too highly of me. Do you really think I am capable of controlling a Great Saint Lands?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Yunyue smiled faintly as he said: “Of course you can. In truth, before I actually met you, I was still very hesitant about this decision of mine. However, now I can set my resolve with ease. In the first place, you have the Demonic Attribute, and it is even the purest first generation Demonic Attribute. I believe that with the Heavenly Demon Sect in your hands, it can only grow stronger. At least, it will be far better than heading towards destructions in my hands. If you are willing to be the Heavenly Demon Sect Master, I am willing to be your assistant. At the same time, I can guarantee that all your orders will definitely be obeyed by everyone in the Heavenly Demon Sect, myself included. How does that sound?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Wu Yunyue, Zhou Weiqing eyes still showed some hesitation. At this point, Little Witch slowly raised her head, her eyes, still red from sobbing, subconsciously look at him… and he could clearly see the hope in them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If Zhou Weiqing really accepted the Heavenly Demon Sect, that would mean she truly had a chance. The past few years had not been kind to her at all. Ever since that time when Zhou Weiqing had taken her, she had been waiting for him to go look for her. Alas, she had not even seen a trace of him. Little Witch also understood that he definitely had many things to take care off, and thus even though she was so agitated that she cried upon seeing him, she did not truly blame him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having grown up in a Great Saint Lands, she naturally knew what was most important to a man like him. If not for this calamity that befell the Heavenly Demon Sect, perhaps she might not even meet him that soon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Yunyue sighed softly, saying: “Weiqing, although the remaining strength of the Heavenly Demon Sect is far from our peak, greatly weakened, but I believe that we can still be of great use to your Heavenly Bow Empire. As long as you are willing to be the Sect Master, that means the entire Heavenly Demon Sect will be fully joining the Heavenly Bow Empire. I am sure that this is of extreme importance to you as well. If you have any other requests, you can also bring it up now.” In truth, Wu Yunyue did not have any other choice. This was actually a very intelligent choice. On the surface, it might seem like he was just giving away the Heavenly Demon Sect, but this was the only way the Heavenly Demon Sect could truly survive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If he passed on the Heavenly Demon Sect to other Great Saint Lands, then it would not be days before even last traces of the entire Heavenly Demon Sect would vanish. However, Zhou Weiqing was different. He was just a single person, at most with his Master, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor. Even after handing the reins over to Zhou Weiqing, Wu Yunyue would still have some influence. Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing was definitely a young talent of limitless potential… a Heavenly King at twenty three years old! He had even heard from Ming Yu that he was able to fight against a Heavenly Emperor! Under his leadership, the Heavenly Demon Sect could only grow stronger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, there was the connection between Zhou Weiqing and Little Witch to consider, and if the child of his daughter and this young man were to inherit the Heavenly Demon Sect, then wouldn’t it still be eventually passing down to his own bloodline?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Yunyue did not hide his thoughts, and he had already stated things out explicitly. However, the more that was so, the more Zhou Weiqing had to think things through.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly Demon Sect might be a force to be considered, but never forget that the name of the Heavenly Demon Sect was not good at all, and they were even discriminated against by the other Great Saint Lands. Furthermore, should Zhou Weiqing chose to accept the Heavenly Demon Sect, his relationship with the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and the Heavenly Snow Mountain might turn tricky. Furthermore, it also meant he would now have to deal with the possibility of the Blood Red Hell turning their full attentions on them, with the possibility of being attacked at any time. All of these were pressures and burdens that would be extremely heavy for the current Zhou Weiqing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Taking a deep breath, Zhou Weiqing looked at Wu Yunyue and said: “Senior, I can agree to your terms, but only on one condition.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the side, Ming Yu couldn’t restrain himself as he said angrily: “The Sect Master is already giving you his position, what other conditions do you still want? Weiqing, you…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing raised his hand, giving him the signal to calm down as he said to Wu Yunyue: “Senior, that condition is very simple. I hope that the Heavenly Demon Sect will change its name.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Change names?” Wu Yunyue started momentarily. “Why? I cannot possibly agree to this condition.” Wouldn’t changing the name mean that the Heavenly Demon Sect would vanish from here on?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing said solemnly: “Senior, please do not rush to judge it first, please let me finish my explanation. The reason why I want the Heavenly Demon Sect to change its name is not because of any personal desires, but for the sake of the Sect’s future. Have you ever wondered why all these years, the Heavenly Demon Sect could be discriminated against by the other Great Saint Lands, and most of the Heavenly Jewel Masters would shun the Sect, just upon hearing the name?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That is because our name contains the word ‘Demon’, especially with the rumours of the Demonic Attribute which have been greatly exaggerated. All of this has resulted in the current situation. To be honest, even if I take over as the Heavenly Demon Sect Master, and I do not change this, then the Sect will still be heading towards destruction. The only way to change this will be to make major changes from the ground up, to first get the ordinary people to accept the existence of this Great Saint Land of ours… only then can we begin to flourish and grow once more.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, Wu Yunyue lapsed into silence. Although he was unwilling to admit it, Zhou Weiqing’s words rang with truth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing continued: “I can promise you that the future heir of the Great Saint Land will be the child of mine and Little Witch. However, if you really want me to take over the Heavenly Demon Sect, the name must definitely be changed.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he spoke about a child with Little Witch, she immediately lowered her head once more, a blush staining her beautiful cheeks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Yunyue said in a low, solemn tone: “Weiqing, this is a very serious matter, and the name of a Great Saint Land can’t just be changed so easily. I admit that what you said is very true. The reason why the Heavenly Demon Sect had become a Great Saint Land in the past was because the first Demonic Emperor and Sect Master was the strongest power during his time. However, if we were to change our name now, would the other Great Saint Lands even acknowledge our existence? Furthermore, I still have to account to all of the Sect members.”&nbsp;</span></p>

With the current situation of the Heavenly Demon Sect, even when the other Great Saint Lands gather once more, would they actually acknowledge the existence of the Heavenly Demon Sect?”&nbsp;</span></p>

This was actually something he was most worried about. Slowly, he stood up, his brow furrowed deeply as he said: “I will have to go back and discuss this matter in detail with everyone else before I can give you my answer. Yuehan, you stay here as our liaison.”&nbsp;</span></p>

Wu Yunyue stopped before saying: “Weiqing, please treat my daughter well. Whether or not you are willing to take over the Heavenly Demon Sect, I still hope that Yuehan can find her happiness with you. At least in that regard, I can feel at ease.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing nodded. “Do not worry, I have let her down, but from now on I will not let that happen anymore.”&nbsp;</span></p>

Go back, Ming Yu can send me off the rest of the way.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Slowly, he walked to her before standing firmly there. Lifting his arms, his hands paused momentarily in the air before landing on Little Witch’s shoulders.&nbsp;</span></p>
