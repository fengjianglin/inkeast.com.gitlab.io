 <p>However, in the next moment, Wu Yunyue clearly saw the ferocious look in the Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor’s eyes. The sword that was flickering with distorted light rays had suddenly become black without any prior indication. The moment the Blue Rain Hibiscus Mutabilis came in contact with the black light, it absolutely could not put up any resistance. It frantically faded away. The sword pierced the chest of the Demonic Emperor in almost an instant.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor did not try to hide the ferocious look in his eyes. The tyrannical Destruction aura accumulated within his sword. He had absolute confidence that there was absolutely no way that Wu Yunyue could block his attack. In reality, he had been pretending to be weaker than he actually was within the battle earlier. If Wu Yunyue had launched a simple attack, perhaps he would have drained Wu Yunyue to a certain point before admitting defeat. However, Wu Yunyue’s attack was filled with killing intent and thoroughly angered him. Hence, he had completely disregarded Huang Xingyun’s orders and took the opportunity to defeat the Demonic God before his eyes with one blow. Based on his Heavenly Emperor Stage cultivation base, as long as the sword, that was filled with highly concentrated Destruction Energy, pierced Wu Yunyue’s body, the Destruction Energy would explode within his body. It would not only cause Wu Yunyue’s body to be instantly destroyed, under the protection of the Time Attribute, it would not even leave a single trace.</p>
 <p>A loud exploding sound was heard and resonated through the entire area, to the extent that the entire Heavenly Snow Mountain could hear it clearly. Immediately after, blood red light appeared in the sky and two black figures descended to the ground. The initial distorted light had also scattered in an instant.</p>
 <p>Two thuds were heard - two parts of a body were thrown to the ground of the mountain peak, following the rain of blood.</p>
 <p>Everyone was dumbstruck. Immediately after, they could recognize that the corpse that fell onto the ground was that of the Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor.</p>
 <p>His body had been severed from his left hip all the way to his right shoulder. It was a clean and magnificent cut - the dense Heavenly Energy of the Evil Attribute could be seen wreaking havoc on the inside of the two halves of the body, further destroying the Heavenly Emperor’s tough body. Within the time frame of several blinks of an eye, they were completely destroyed beyond recognition.</p>
 <p><em>What happened?</em> Everyone asked themselves that question. Even though Wu Yunyue had the upper hand earlier, when the Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor used the Time Mirror Image to evade his fatal attack, he had already managed to turn things around and got the upper hand! Even if he could not win against Wu Yunyue, it was not possible for victory and defeat to be determined in such a short period of time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, Wu Yunyue had already descended to the ground. On the surface, he looked completely unharmed. However, the middle finger of his left hand, that was hiding in his sleeve, was completely swollen. At least within a short period of time, he was unable to use it during a battle.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even though the Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor was dead, his eyes were still wide open, with a look of disbelief in them. Wu Yunyue looked coldly at him - his powerful aura had become even denser.</p>
 <p>Only Wu Yunyue himself knew what exactly happened. The loud sound that resounded the air earlier was the sound of Wu Yunyue’s middle finger flicking the sharp end of the Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor’s sword that was filled with Destruction Energy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just like that, the Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor’s full-force attack got flicked away by Wu Yunyue. He had already fully focused his entire attention on that attack, channeling all his Heavenly Energy into that sword - how could he have expected his attack to fail that easily? Naturally, he was unable to dodge Wu Yunyue’s sword, and ended up getting his body severed into two.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Yunyue looked at Zhou Weiqing. Both of them momentarily exchanged glances and Zhou Weiqing could roughly guess what had happened. On the other hand, Huang Xingyun stared gloomily at Wu Yunyue, as though he was going to attack him at any moment.</p>
 <p>The Demonic Emperor shot him a disdainful look. Just as he was about to say something, Zhou Weiqing was already standing next to him with an apologetic look on his face and said, “Valley Master Huang, I am deeply sorry. Our Deputy Sect Leader had slipped up and was unable to show mercy. Alas, battles between Heavenly Emperors are indeed tragic and violent! Valley Master Huang, please do not take this personally. It is the Grand Tournament after all, injury and death cannot be avoided.”</p>
 <p>Huang Xingyun looked at Zhou Weiqing’s apologetic face and clenched his teeth in anger so hard that it almost crushed them to pieces. He replied, “Fine. Good on you, Peerless Sect. Wu Yunyue, I hope you can keep going like this.”</p>
 <p>Because of Zhou Weiqing’s arrival, Wu Yunyue appeared to be a lot more calm. He said indifferently, “If you are not convinced, you should step into the arena yourself. However, if you want to go against me, you still have to wait. Next.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“After you, Demonic Emperor.” After the Passion Valley was naturally the powerhouse from the Blood Red Hell. The next participant sent by Fen Tian was still a Heavenly Emperor. However, at this moment, Fen Tian was furrowing his brows. He looked pensively at the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue.</p>
 <p>Without a doubt, from the start of the Grand Tournament till now, the individual with the most eye-catching performance was the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue, the represent of the Peerless Sect. He was the only person who survived the first cycle of the first round. Even though this was directly related to Zhou Weiqing’s success in the earlier drawing of lots, Wu Yunyue had defeated two opponents in succession, and he was the only person who had won two battles. Particularly the last battle - he managed to emerge victorious against the Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor within a very short period of time and even ruthlessly killed him off, causing the atmosphere of the Grand Tournament to become very tense.</p>
 <p>Of course, even though Wu Yunyue’s performance was powerful, at least for now, everything was deemed acceptable in the eyes of the other four Saint Lands. After all, Wu Yunyue was the leader of one of the five Great Saint Lands. In the previous Grand Tournaments, he was the last to step into the arena. It was entirely normal for him to be more powerful than ordinary participants. Conversely, it was unexpected that Yun Ruoyu of the Passion Valley was easily defeated in the first round.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Two figures soared up into the sky once again. The powerhouses of all five Great Saint Lands were watching from below with a different attitude. The people who were paying the most attention were naturally Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian. Looking at the two powerhouses soaring up into the sky, Zhou Weiqing looked smilingly at Fen Tian and said, “I wonder when you will be stepping into the arena, Hell Lord! If you keep sending your subordinates out, I’m afraid the Blood Red Hell might not be able to stay in the Grand Tournament for long.”</p>
 <p>Fen Tian looked indifferently at Zhou Weiqing and replied, “The Grand Tournament has just begun, isn’t it too early for you to be making such statements, Sect Leader Zhou? Even though Wu Yunyue may be powerful, it is impossible him to stay in there for too long. Don’t tell me that you think he still stand a chance to win against me?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, “Of course not. It’s just that I have heard of your great name for a long time, Lord Fen Tian. I was only wondering if I will get the chance to fight against you in this Grand Tournament, and wanted to get some advice from you. How unfortunate.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“What is unfortunate?” Fen Tian looked at the regretful-looking Zhou Weiqing with curiosity.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled once again, “I am only saying that it is unfortunate that there are so many powerhouses in the Blood Red Hell. I wonder how many of them are able to leave this place alive!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“You are courting death.” Immediately, the powerhouses standing behind Fen Tian were furious, and were about to charge out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing looked frightened, “Eek, don’t tell me that because you can’t win us in Grand Tournament, you are going to go against the rules and attack us? I am terrified! Bring it on!”</p>
 <p>Even though Zhou Weiqing’s voice was not loud, but every single person on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain was a powerhouse. Naturally, they could hear what he said clearly. A majority of them stiffened up their faces. The Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord Xue AoTian and Shangguan Tianyue turned their heads, pretending they did not know who this jackass was.</p>
 <p>The battle in the sky had already begun. Compared to the last two battles, it was as though Wu Yunyue had gone wild from taking some medication. He kept the Demonic Transformation and the Demonic Emperor Set on. He had harbored strong hatred towards the Blood Red Hell for the longest time. The moment when both of them soared into the air, he had launched an attack that was equivalent to a raging storm on him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In mid-air, the shade of gray that was filled with the aura of the Evil Attribute covered the entire sky. The tyrannical Evil Attribute was suppressing his opponent, akin to Mountain Tai. It seemed as though Wu Yunyue had completely disregarded the consumption of his energy. The crazy attack rendered the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor powerless and unable to retaliate. The Blue Rain Hibiscus Mutabilis and the Sword of the Demonic Emperor caused the heaven and earth to change in color every time he attacked.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even though the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor was not weak, and the moment he soared into the sky he had already unleashed the Destruction Attribute, he was still of a lower cultivation base compared to Wu Yunyue. Most importantly, the Destruction Attribute that he released had absolutely no effect on Wu Yunyue’s Evil and Life Attributes. It was as though he was only relying on the Fire Attribute to fight against Wu Yunyue.</p>
 <p>Looking at the situation in the sky, Fen Tian furrowed his brows. However, from his eyes, it seemed as though he had a sudden realization and he casually glanced over at the Passion Valley. He happened to see the Valley Master Huang Xingyun looking over at him and the both of them felt the chills within each other’s eyes as they exchanged glances.</p>
 <p>It was momentary and only a few people managed to notice the changes in the eyes of the Saint Land leaders.</p>
 <p>Wu Yunyue’s attacks were absolutely too powerful. Under the Demonic Transformation, as a Max Level Heavenly Emperor, he had total control. Every attack of the Sword of the Demonic Emperor was at full power, showing absolutely no mercy at all. Furthermore, his Blue Rain Hibiscus Mutabilis continuously launched attacks at his opponent in all directions. Under such circumstances, the thought of using the Heavenly Skill Image was nothing but a dream.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The main reason why Wu Yunyue could kill off the Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor at the very last moment was because of the Saint Energy channeled into his body by Zhou Weiqing. Relying on the Saint Energy, he no longer had a restraining fear towards the Destruction Attribute. Otherwise, at the last moment, he could’ve only chosen to dodge the attack and would not have been able to successfully kill off his opponent.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, Fen Tian had clearly realized this. However, what could he possibly do with that information? It was not a secret that Zhou Weiqing possessed the Saint Energy. Right now, all he found out was that Zhou Weiqing could channel the Saint Energy to another person.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Go to hell.” The Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor was continuously being suppressed, and his eyes were already red with killing intent. Suddenly, his entire body became a shade of dense black and his weapon was a long saber. In that instant, the overbearing Destruction Attribute had completely vanished. His long saber swung, as though it was splitting heaven and earth apart, and a black crescent-shaped light passed through the saber, charging towards Wu Yunyue.&nbsp;</p>
