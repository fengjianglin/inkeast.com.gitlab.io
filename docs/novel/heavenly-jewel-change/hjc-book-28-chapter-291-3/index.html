 <p>Devil Shen did not try to avoid the topic at all. He said, “Regardless of what method entails, as long as it can help you make a breakthrough, it’s a good method. Brother Long, you have always been focused on your cultivation, don’t tell me that you don’t want to make a breakthrough to the Heavenly God Stage, and see what it’s like when you get there?”</p>
 <p>Long Shiya snorted, “You are just making empty promises - anybody can do that. Haven’t you also been trapped at the Max Level Heavenly Emperor Stage for several years too?”</p>
 <p>Devil Shen laughed and nodded, “Indeed, I’m afraid it’s hard to win you over with mere empty promises, Brother Long. Let me prove it to you with the truth then.”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, the aura on Devil Shen’s body became more powerful. An intense black light soared up to the sky from his body. In an instant, the entire sky darkened a lot - especially the vast area behind Devil Shen. An enormous purplish black shadow gradually appeared; it looked like an enormous skull with a huge mouth that was wide open, seemingly engulfing everything.</p>
 <p>Darkness, destruction, fear and countless other negative emotions erupted instantly. Even the other powerhouses on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain felt as though the huge mouth seemed like it was going to swallow the entire Heavenly Snow Mountain.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>All the powerhouses who were present were at least of the Heavenly King Stage - they were able to manipulate the atmospheric energy for their personal use and hence, they were able to sense it the deepest compared to other people. They had clearly noticed that all kinds of attribute elements in the air had been shattered to pieces when the sky became pitch black - they were frantically being engulfed by the endless darkness.</p>
 <p>A layer of a strange shade of black appeared around Devil Shen’s entire body; both his eyes had became dark purple. Rather than calling him a human being, calling him a devil would be more appropriate. Almost everyone present was affected by the terrifying aura.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“A Celestial Territory?” Countless alarmed voices were heard on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain. Everybody was knowledgeable enough, hence naturally, they were able to tell what kind of technique Devil Shen used. Apart from the Celestial Territory, there were probably no other technique that could elicit such powerful presence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xue AoTian, Shangguan Tianyang, Tianyue and the rest had a grave expression on their faces. They were very clear with regards to what a Heavenly God could do - even ten Heavenly Emperors combined might not be able to go against one Heavenly God. Furthermore, the presence of one Heavenly God would allow all his fellow comrades to benefit from his abilities. Otherwise, Xue AoTian would not be able to bring the Heavenly Snow Mountain to such an esteemed position within the Mainland.</p>
 <p>The Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord, the one and only Heavenly God and number one powerhouse in the world, wavered after Devil Shen had released his Destruction Celestial Territory. More importantly, everybody present was intelligent enough to make the connection that since the Deputy Hell Lord of the Blood Red Hell had already reached the Heavenly God Stage, Fen Tian, the Hell Lord of the Blood Red Hell would definitely be a Heavenly God too.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The release of the Destruction Celestial Territory, as well as the exchange between Devil Shen and Long Shiya, showed that he was trying to subdue the Six Ultimately Heavenly Emperor without putting up an actual physical fight. The Blood Red Hell had finally revealed its true colors at this moment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ominous glint within Devil Shen’s eyes that had turned purple radiated in all directions. As his opponent, Long Shiya was the most deeply affected by the Destruction Celestial Territory. Even though Devil Shen had not made any move, the terrifying Destruction will that came with the Destruction Celestial Territory seemed as though he was going to break his body apart. The six-colored light surrounding his body continued weakening - as though it was going to crumble anytime.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Long Shiya chuckled and said, “I did not expect you to make a breakthrough to the Heavenly God Stage. The destructiveness of your Destruction Celestial Territory is pretty awesome!”</p>
 <p>Devil Shen said in a deep voice, “Brother Long, this is your last chance. As long as you agree, given your ability and wisdom, you will be more powerful and outstanding than me in future. Otherwise, don’t blame me for hurting you.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Long Shiya continued smiling - even though he was dealing with such strong overbearing pressure from the Destruction Celestial Territory, he seemed as though he was not subjected to any pressure at all. “Devil Shen, I didn’t expect you to show me such a magnificent sight. In that case, I have something to show you in return.”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, the smile on Long Shiya’s face vanished instantly. His left hand pointed to the sky while his right hand pointed to the ground. Both his hands moved at the same time; the weakening six-colored light that was originally being subdued within the Destruction Celestial Territory instantly became extremely powerful. Immediately after, two hexagrams appeared - one above his head, and one below his feet.</p>
 <p>The bright six-colored light burst forth in an instant, soaring to the sky before forcefully breaking open the surrounding Destruction Energy. The huge area of darkness within the sky dispersed when the rays of the six-colored light shone on it. Sunlight shone onto the six-colored light and a huge six-colored light cloud was formed in the sky. The Destruction Celestial Territory could not destroy the light cloud that was condensed by the six attributes. Behind Long Shiya, a round plump figure appeared. The enormous figure was a hundred feet in height - it was the enlarged version of himself.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everyone on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain were dumbfounded by the sight of it.</p>
 <p>Xue AoTian muttered to himself, “He succeeded, he actually succeeded. It is the Six Ultimate Celestial Territory - he has already broken through to the Heavenly God Stage.” Disappointment and frustration appeared on Xue AoTian’s face. Amongst the people present, the person who understood Long Shiya the most was not Zhou Weiqing. It was Xue AoTian. They had fought with each other way too many times before, hence Xue AoTian knew deep down that when it came to innate gifts and talents, he could not compare to Long Shiya. Even though he possessed the Saint Attribute, he could not be compared to Long Shiya’s innate talent. The reason why he could make a breakthrough to the Heavenly God Stage was because he was the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord - he had the support of a Saint Land. On the other hand, Long Shiya’s achievements were solely due to himself.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Long Shiya had made a breakthrough. The Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor had become the Six Ultimate Heavenly God. Xue AoTian knew that if they were fighting based on individual’s abilities, he might not be able to match up to Long Shiya.</p>
 <p>Similarly, shock appeared on Fen Tian’s face. He had never expected Long Shiya to make a sudden breakthrough to the Heavenly God Stage.</p>
 <p>What did it mean when a Saint Land had a Heavenly God? The answer was clear, if one were to look at the Heavenly Snow Mountain. At this moment, nobody dared to question the status of the Peerless Sect. With just the two powerhouses - the Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya and the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue, who was a Max Level Heavenly Emperor, it was more than enough to support a powerful Saint Land. Moreover, when Zhou Weiqing did not lose to Fen Tian in their earlier fight. Even if Fen Tian did hold back earlier, it was still rather surprising that Zhou Weiqing managed to put up a fight against him.</p>
 <p>When Devil Shen saw the release of Long Shiya’s Celestial Territory, he was first stunned, but he reacted quickly after. A gloomy expression appeared on his face as well. Dense killing aura erupted from his body and the terrifying Destruction will, under the effect of the Destruction Celestial Territory, frantically attacked Long Shiya’s Six Ultimate Celestial Territory.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The property of the Destruction Celestial Territory was purely Destruction in nature, whereas Long Shiya’s Six Ultimate Celestial Territory was the balance of the six attributes. With the Six Ultimate Celestial Territory containing some Saint Energy aura, no matter how much Destruction aura was attacking it from the outside, it would not be broken. It would only counteract and destroy the attacks.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Congratulations, Brother Long. You managed to become a Heavenly God. From the looks of it, you are not planning to consider our offer,” said Devil Shen disdainfully.</p>
 <p>Long Shiya curled his lip and replied in disdain, “You only figured that out now? What a dumbfuck.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Fatty Long, since you are courting death, I will grant your wish.” A sinister look flashed across Devil Shen’s eyes and thrusted a palm in the air towards Long Shiya. At the same time, rays of dark purple light flowed rhythmically around his body in a frenzy. A full ten-piece Legendary Set was equipped on his body. Two battle axes that were entirely dark purple in color appeared - one on each hand. The demonic phantom image behind him opened his mouth and an ear-piercing shriek rang in the air. All the Destruction Energy immediately expanded and charged towards Long Shiya’s Six Ultimate Celestial Territory.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The ‘Hate Sky no Handle’ Set similarly appeared on Long Shiya’s body. The Silver Octagon Plum Blossom Hammers appeared on body sides of his body. The hundred feet tall shadow behind him moved and the plump figure rammed into the huge black mouth.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Crack ——</p>
 <p>The sky seemed to shatter as a result of their collision. Long Shiya’s phantom image was being ripped ruthlessly by the huge black mouth, but at the same time, the huge black mouth had also taken a hard blow from the hammer.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the black light, as well as the six-colored light, in the sky rippled violently. The two Celestial Territories were clashing head on.</p>
 <p>Long Shiya and Devil Shen did not wait in idle. Even though the two of them were a hundred meters apart in the sky, their battle had begun. Devil Shen’s swung his battle axes and black blade light, coupled with traces of space rupture, charged towards Long Shiya.</p>
 <p>Long Shiya’s hammers separated, and a loud rumbling sound was heard. Immediately, a huge black hole with a diameter of a hundred meters appeared between them.</p>
 <p>The battle between two Heavenly Gods was a different concept from the earlier battles between the Heavenly Emperors. Two simple collisions were enough to cause the powerhouses on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain to sense terrifying energy ripples that could seemingly destroy heaven and earth.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fortunately, both parties relatively had more self-restraint - as their battle continued, they continued ascending. Hence, the fallout caused by their collisions did not land on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain. Otherwise, the powerhouses of the five Great Saint Lands would be forced to take action.</p>
 <p>The enormous black hole temporarily separated Long Shiya and Devil Shen. Even though they were both Heavenly Gods, they did not dare to get absorbed into the black hole. This is because of the presence of a strong opponent. In the event they get absorbed into it, it might be very difficult for them to get out.</p>
 <p>Long Shiya’s figure flashed. As he retreated, his body entered the hundred foot phantom image created by his Celestial Territory. Immediately, the entire phantom image became a lot clearer, as though it was materialized. The six-colored light shone brightly, as though it had borrowed light from the sun itself. The light circulated, causing a huge amount of Destruction energy to be dissipated. Within a short period of time, the Six Ultimate Celestial Territory had won the upper hand.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Destruction Attribute was worthy to be the opposing force of the Saint Energy. After reaching the Heavenly God Stage, Devil Shen’s Destruction Celestial Territory was considered to be a lot stronger than most Celestial Territories. Fortunately, Long Shiya’s Six Ultimate Celestial Territory contained a certain degree of Saint Energy. Otherwise, under the attack of the Destruction Celestial Territory, even if he possessed the six attributes, he would not be able to match up to Devil Shen. However, he definitely did not condense a Saint Core Nucleus. Even though the Saint Energy that Zhou Weiqing channeled into him was pure, when it merged with his own cultivation base, the Saint Energy aura of the Six Ultimate Celestial Territory was ultimately limited.</p>

 <p>RWX: Looks like my sympathies for them were wasted. &nbsp;But then again... I'm pretty sure they are about to lose a Heavenly God, so perhaps the sympathies should continue.</p>
 <p>As noted previously, Stardu5t has been dealing with a number of issues later, ranging from family to personal to a nasty cold.&nbsp; However, I think we're at the tail end of things and we should be back to more regular updates as we finish this off soon... hopefully!</p>
