 <p></p>
 <p>Mu En laughed and said: “Also, didn’t you also acknowledge that Old Huyan Aobo as your teacher? That old fellow has a lot of good stuff, don’t be polite to him! … Go now! Shoo!”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing held Mu En’s hands tightly, taking a deep breath and holding up his head as if calming himself down: “Teacher, I can’t bear to leave you.”</p>
 <p>Mu En’s smile froze, and his expression slowly turned warm as well. “Little scoundrel, I also can’t bear for you to leave!”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing blinked and said: “Then… shall I just stay?”</p>
 <p>All of the members of the Heavenly Bow Unit cried out angrily in unison: “NO!”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er finally left the camp reluctantly, and as the members of the Heavenly Bow Unit returned to their rooms rather despondently, all of them found a letter on their tables, from Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>As Hua Feng opened his letter, he saw only 2 simple lines written on it. “Leader, I know you’ve always liked my dad, but I also know that with my dad’s temper, he would never reciprocate it. However, just to fulfil your wish, I’ll still call you little mother once. Bing’er and I are leaving, but, I’ll still cause one last time of trouble for you. I will prove that, it’s not just because of me that the Heavenly Bow Unit becomes so messy!”</p>
 <p>As Hua Feng read the letter, he found himself awkwardly between laughter and tears, when all of a sudden, a knock sounded on his door. “Come in.” he said.</p>
 <p>Little Grass entered from the outside, though she was blushing red as she said: “Brother Feng, if you want it, you’ll just have to tell me, how could I not give it to you?”</p>
 <p>Hua Feng was puzzled as he asked: “What did I want?”</p>
 <p>Little Grass held out the letter in her hands shyly, and when Hua Feng took it, he saw written on it: “Little Grass Elder Sis, actually Leader does like you a lot. Yesterday I saw him stealing your panties that you left out to dry and hide them under his pillow.”</p>
 <p>Hua Feng’s hands trembled as he looked at Little Grass, who was looking at him with tenderness and love in her eyes, and three black lines appeared above his head as he gritted his teeth and said: “Zhou… Wei… Qing…!!”</p>
 <p>As for the others’ letters, they were as follows.</p>
 <p>Gao Shen’s letter: “Brother Shen, did you know that Yi Shi that transvestite is actually in love with you? She actually stole your underwear! I’m not a person who easily stirs trouble, and I don’t know what your temper is like. However, if it were me, I wouldn’t easily stand for that sort of thing!”</p>
 <p>Han Mo’s letter: “Brother Mo, I’m a little embarrassed to say this, but since I’m leaving I really do have to tell you the truth. The hundred titanium alloy arrows you ordered custom made, I felt they were very good, so I borrowed them to use. I’ll just borrow them for a hundred years or so. Between us brothers, there’s no need for any thanks right. In truth, I know that you’ve always wanted to gift them to me, right?”</p>
 <p>Yi Shi’s letter: “Lord Vice Leader, actually I know your inner heart must be in pain. As a transvestite, and a beautiful one at that, you are so different from everyone! However, I must tell you the truth. My teacher has always liked you so much, but he was always embarrassed to say so. The reason why he’s always remained single is because of you! Did you know that he has kept a portrait of you, and deep in the night, he always stares at the portrait and ‘trains his hands’. Sigh… Even if you don’t like him, you must really let him know. He’s already so old, if he keeps ‘training his hands’ like that so much, it’s not good for his body!”</p>
 <p>Luo Ke Di’s letter: “Shi Shu, that day I unintentionally heard Leader talking to himself in his room. In our Heavenly Bow Unit, only you and he are suave enough, and he also said that my Dad is getting too old already, and that he shouldn’t keep dreaming of the impossible. As such, he has decided to change his target, I won’t say much more, you know what I mean. Leader is such a great person, with such grace and poise, you two are indeed a good match!”</p>
 <p>Mu En’s letter: “Teacher, I’ve left a portrait under your bed, but I accidently spilled porridge on it [1. LOL!!!! Well played!] Please help me pass it to Yi Shi.”</p>
 <p>An hour later, a mass of angry howls arose from the Heavenly Bow Unit. Strangely, all of them sounded very similar, and with gritted teeth! “Zhou---- Wei---- Qing!!!!!”</p>
 <p>At that time, Zhou Weiqing, who had already walked quite a distance away, suddenly stopped, turning back towards the Heavenly Bow Unit with a huge, wicked grin on his face, giving a small laugh as he muttered to himself: “I’m just afraid you all will forget me, I didn’t mean to prank you all! En… it’s not intentional… definitely not planned… nor was it premeditated. Heh heh.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er looked at him curiously and asked: “What’s going on? Little Fatty, what are you talking about?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing quickly reined himself in, saying: “Uh, nothing! Bing’er, don’t you think I’m already considered a real man, a grown up now?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er started, looking at the large and well built, honest but valiant looking Zhou Weiqing, and nodded sincerely while saying: “Indeed. Although you’re only 16 years old, but most adult men wouldn’t be as tall or muscular as you are. Of course you can be considered a real man now.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was filled with joy, winking to her and said: “In that case… can we do.. it already?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er asked puzzledly: “What’s ‘it’?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said abashedly: “You know… it! Since you already said I’m a real man, and you’re a beautiful grown lady, and we’re fiances… that… that…”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er finally understood what he meant, instantly flushing deeply and said: “Dream on! Why is your brain full of dirty thoughts. Hmph, walk further from me. Who’s your fiancee? Have you resolved the situation with Princess Difuya?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said helplessly: “I haven’t had the opportunity yet… We’re heading back to Heavenly Bow City now, and I’ll handle the matter when we return. I’ll go right to look for Godfather. Although Difuya is rather hateful, I shouldn’t delay it and let her waste her youth as well.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er rolled her eyes at him, but she clearly looked a lot happier. Zhou Weiqing was attempting to strike while the iron was hot, sidling closer to her to get intimate, but she quickly ran ahead like a Wind Elf, her tinkling laughter trailing her. Zhou Weiqing grinned and chased forward, and just like that, with one chasing the other, they sped through the Stars Forest towards the Heavenly Bow City.</p>
 <p>The two poor ‘little’ Icy Soul Heavenly Bears could only run with all their might, panting, as they tried to keep up. Their foolish and simple looking appearance was simply so adorable, while the little white tiger Fat Cat still lay on Zhou Weiqing’s shoulder lazily, as if it would never wake up.</p>
 <p>As they closed in on the edge of the Stars Forest, Zhou Weiqing beckoned to the two bears, saying: “Come here, Da Huang, Er Huang.”</p>
 <p>The two tired and panting bears came lumbering to Zhou Weiqing, nuzzling their heads on Zhou Weiqing’s body, with nary the look and pride of a Zong Stage Heavenly Beast. These two little fellows were raised together by Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er, but the one they feared most was Fat Cat. Often, if Fat Cat gave a low roar, the two of them would lie down on the ground with their hands covering their heads, looking extremely pitiful.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing raised his right hand, and a gold green Cat’s Eye ring on his finger flashed, causing two beams of yellow light to shine upon the two bears. As the light glittered, the two large fellows had disappeared.</p>
 <p>This Spatial ring was given to him by Hua Feng, and Zhou Weiqing had to give up all his cuts from the missions throughout these two years. Originally, he wasn’t supposed to get a cut of the salary from the missions, but as his power increased, his Control Skills started to play a larger role and be of critical help during the missions. As a result, the members of the Heavenly Bow Unit had agreed to give him a cut as well. Zhou Weiqing did not know how much it had amounted to after these two years, but for the sake of Da Huang and Er Huang these two large fellows, he had no choice but to give up on his cut and take the Spatial ring, which had about 20 square metres of space within.</p>
 <p>In truth, what Zhou Weiqing didn’t know was that he had been given a huge gift. Such a Spatial Ring, was worth at least 200,000 gold coins or more. That was mainly because it wasn’t an ordinary Spatial Ring, and it didn’t just store goods, but had a small and unique Spatial Realm created which could allow living creatures to stay within. That was its true value, and was considered a rather rare treasure.</p>
 <p>After keeping Da Huang and Er Huang into the ring’s space, Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er headed to the Heavenly Bow City. According to Hua Fen, they would be heading to the Fei Li Empire to undergo their next step of learning and training.</p>
 <p>Without question, Fei Li Empire was the only large empire which was on good relations with the Heavenly Bow Empire, and it was also a lot more developed on all fronts. This time, Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er were headed to the Fei Li Empire’s Fei Li Imperial Family’s Military Academy, to learn how to lead and direct armies. This was under the direction of Admiral Zhou, who wanted them to prepare to help out the Heavenly Bow Empire’s armies in the future.</p>
 <p>There was still 5 more months until the new semester of the Fei Li Imperial Family’s Military Academy began, but Hua Feng had them return to the Heavenly Bow City in advance. The main reason was for Zhou Weiqing to head to Fei Li Empire’s Flying Hill City first. After all, he was already sixteen years old, and it was time for him to study under Huyan Aobo as promised. Furthermore, he still hadn’t Consolidated Equipment or Stored Skills for his second set of Heavenly Jewels.</p>
 <p>“Bing’er, let’s stay at home for three days, and I’ll settle the betrothal with Princess Difuya. After three days, let’s head to Flying Hill City together, how about that?” Zhou Weiqing held onto her hands, rather unwilling to part. She had been gone for quite a while to complete Storing her 3rd Elemental Jewel’s Skill, and had finally just returned to his side, and he naturally couldn’t bear to part with her for another few days once again.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er hesitated and said: “Little Fatty, we’ve already spent two years together in the Heavenly Bow Unit, and during this period I haven’t spent any time with my mother. I want to seize this chance before we enter the Fei Li Imperial Family’s Military Academy to accompany her well. She’s my only kin, and this time, we will be spending another few years at the Academy, as it is so far and traveling to and fro will be extremely difficult. Why don’t you head to Flying Hill City first, and we’ll meet in the Fei Li Empire capital, Fei Li City in 5 months alright?”</p>
 <p>“Ah?” Hearing her say that, Zhou Weiqing’s face fell and he said dejectedly: “Doesn’t that mean we’ll be apart for 5 months?”</p>
