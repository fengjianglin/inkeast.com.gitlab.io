 <p><b>Chapter 117 “Evil Demonic Form” | Silver Emperor! (1)</b></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing had pretty much explored almost every inch of Shangguan Bing’er’s body, and her body was extremely soft, flexible, fragrant; like flowing warm water that could enrich the world, enveloping and cleansing his body and soul. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Shangguan Fei’er was different, her body was like a springy jelly, filled with immeasurable enticing springiness. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing’s hands were large, and filled with heat, and just like that the two of them stayed motionless in that position of him holding her legs in some strange tacit understanding. Zhou Weiqing had started because of the sudden feel of her legs, while Shangguan Fei’er had been too shocked, along with the rush of sudden heat. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With Shangguan Fei’er’s legs on Zhou Weiqing’s shoulders, even though she was wearing pants, it was still quite an unbecoming position. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After a moment of shock, the two of them suddenly looked at each other, once again with that strange understanding as if they were both on the same page. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shangguan Fei’er’s beautiful face immediately flushed full red, and Zhou Weiqing immediately took action according to his original plan. With a sudden pull, he exerted all his considerable might, dragging Shangguan Fei’er off the ground. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Isn’t your flexibility so good? Without any leverage, let’s see how you can react to my throw!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As he thought that, Zhou Weiqing had exerted strength to throw Shangguan Fei’er in revenge for earlier. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Alas, he had once again underestimated Shangguan Fei’er. Her right leg might be caught by his hands, but she still had her left leg. At the same time as her body was flung into the air, her left leg dipped forward swiftly in a small motion, the tip of her legs hooking onto Zhou Weiqing’s neck. Instantly, Zhou Weiqing’s throw was rendered useless, and in the end it was his neck suffered the immense pulling force, causing him to stumble, while Shangguan Fei’er’s flexible body twisted in midair, landing down safely. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph” Shangguan Fei’er gave a cold humph, her body flipping around again, totally ignoring the fact that one of her legs was still being held, and she instead grabbed Zhou Weiqing by the waist. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing did not dare to let her get a good grasp. This girl’s close combat techniques were plentiful, and terrifying to boot. If she got a good hold onto him, he would definitely be in trouble. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Switching quickly to a single-hand grasp, his other palm shoved out forward on Shangguan Fei’er’s back. She was after all his sister in law to be, and looked exactly the same as Shangguan Bing’er, and he could not strike savagely. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shangguan Fei’er did not seem to realise that Zhou Weiqing had used a hand to push her away. From appearance, her entire body had to flip all the way down, but Zhou Weiqing only had to push forward simply with his palm, and with such a difference in movement required, it was certain that Zhou Weiqing would be faster. As long as he managed to push her away, she would not be able to grab onto his waist. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at that moment, Shangguan Fei’er gave him a lesson on what was the extremes of flexibility. Under such a movement that already seemed to disregard the natural laws of a human body, she actually changed positions once more, twisting suddenly to the left, and Zhou Weiqing’s palm actually grazed her back, missing her by just a little. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Right at that moment, Zhou Weiqing felt his waist go numb, and his hand on Shangguan Fei’er’s leg loosened its grip involuntarily. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you finally convinced?” Shangguan Fei’er said airily. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing lay there unmoving, as if he had been thrown to his death. That was because Shangguan Fei’er’s thumbs were on his eyelids, and he dared not open his eyes, though he lay there silently, as if even if he were to die he wouldn’t admit defeat. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shangguan Fei’er gave a humph, saying: “Not bad, very stubborn eh, since you are unwilling to submit, I’ll sit until you die!” As she said that, her incomparably elastic little buttock moved about around Zhou Weiqing’s chest area. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing’s body was trembling slightly now, but he still did not make a sound. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was not that our dear Zhou Little Fatty was stubborn or unwilling to admit defeat. It was just that, in such a scenario, how could this young little rascal be willing to do so!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Such a beautiful young lady, sitting on his chest, that highly intriguingly springy buttocks rubbing along his chest, the faint fragrance of her entering his nose. Although it was a little difficult to breathe, but Zhou Weiqing was enjoying himself in an unprecedented fashion. It took all the control he had not to lift his hands to touch that bounty right in front of him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing him shivering, Shangguan Fei’er started momentarily. “Why are you shivering, I’m not using that much strength, are you really injured?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>As she said that, she lowered her head, rather uncharacteristically scatterbrained. She could not understand how her extremely low weight could injure him at all. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Could it be that when she threw him down on the ground, he had smashed down on some sharp rocks or something? Shangguan Fei’er turned her head to examine Zhou Weiqing’s body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She spotted something sticking up, a large bulge that was like a proud tent, propping up the material of his pants. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhh!” Shangguan Fei’er cried out loud. “Little Fatty, I did not mean to do that!” In a flip, she jumped up from his body. She was in truth still an untouched virgin, innocent and naive to the core in that manner, and with her preconceived idea earlier, she had already made the judgement. In her eyes, that large protrusion should be some sharp rock, piercing right through Zhou Weiqing’s body. In that moment, she was greatly and urgently worried in her heart, forgetting in that instance that with Zhou Weiqing’s toughness and physique, how could he be easily injured by a mere rock, and that there was no sign of any blood anywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She did not dare to pull out the object for fear of aggravating his wounds, and instead she quickly pulled down Zhou Weiqing’s pants to reveal the ‘critical and deadly’ protrusion. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The&nbsp;pinkish-purple, pigeon-egg sized little head reared out as it was freed from its confines, presenting itself to her. She had moved too quickly, and in her urgency, that thing that ‘bounced’ out actually struck her cheek once. </span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Stunned and dazed. That was Shangguan Fei’er. She had never seen such an ‘evil demonic object’ <a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, yet something that caused her heart to race. </span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Frozen stiff. That was Zhou Weiqing, who had never in his wildest dreams imagined that things would progress in such a way. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Naturally, earlier when Shangguan Fei’er’s soft, springy buttocks had been moving around on his chest, it would have been just too strange if he had not had a ‘reaction’. After all, he already had intimate relations with both Shangguan Bing’er and Tian’er, and at such a young virile age, his urge for such things were quite high. Furthermore, Shangguan Fei’er and Shangguan Bing’er looked exactly the same, and were top beauties to boot. How could he possibly not have any reaction?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Zhou Weiqing had not expected that this mischievous young lady, the Little Demon Girl of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, would actually be so innocent and naive regarding such matters. Even Shangguan Bing’er, when he first met her years ago, had known more than she did! She… had actually thought his ‘raised bump’ as an injury… !!! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Especially so when Shangguan Fei’er had actually looked upon his ‘state’ at such a close range, Zhou Weiqing was stunned, frozen and totally in shock. Such a circumstance was also something totally new to him, and although he was usually so shameless, he was totally left at a loss. After all, Shangguan Fei’er was not Shangguan Bing’er, and whether or not she was really here to supervise and monitor him was true or not, if she really ran back to Bing’er to complain about him, to say that he had molested her, what would happen?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he also liked Tian’er a lot, and had already had intimate relations with her… in truth, within Zhou Weiqing’s heart, Shangguan Bing’er’s place was irreplaceable, and no one could match her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>What Shangguan Bing’er had taken hold of… taken over… was the part of his heart that was the softest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhhhh!!!” A shrill, high-decibel shriek rang out, piercing the skies, as if even more powerful than any spirit based attacks. Zhou Weiqing was just beside her, and he suffered the effects of it the most. That sudden shrill cry causing him to almost lose his hearing, dazing him momentarily into silence. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shangguan Fei’er was in short momentarily, before finally reacting. This was not the first time she had thought about what was the difference between man and woman, and had even asked others about it. However, in the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, who would dare talk to her about such a thing? In that moment, she finally understood the difference between the two, and in her heart, a strange, indescribable fire was burning, causing her to scream out shrilly involuntarily. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The first thing Zhou Weiqing did was to quickly pull up his pants. If any of his companions saw this sight, he truly did not know what they would think. The second thing was to charge forward in a flash to cover her mouth, not allowing her shrill cry to spread out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shangguan Fei’er bit down on Zhou Weiqing’s hand savagely, causing him convulse in pain and cry out angrily: “What are you doing?!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shangguan Fei’er shoved his hand away, saying: “You… you… bast…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing said angrily: “Is it me? Is it me? If you didn’t sit down on me, would I have such a reaction? It was you who pulled down my pants, you scoundrel girl! I’m going to tell Bing’er that you molested me.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You…” Being accused with an unfounded blame by Zhou Weiqing before she could blame him, Shangguan Fei’er was enraged, and she leaped to her feet, about to beat him up. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Her shrill cry was just too too high, and in the camp, Lin TianAo and the others started heading out to their location, worried. At that moment, something happened abruptly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A shrill, ear piercing sound rang out, along with a bone chilling cold that caused Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Fei’er, who were in an excited state, to be given a shock. Abandoning their argument instantly, Zhou Weiqing grabbed onto Shangguan Fei’er, and the two dropped down to the ground. The next moment, a silver light passed through where their bodies had been a split second ago before disappearing into the sky. </span></p>
