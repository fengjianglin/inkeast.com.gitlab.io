Currently, his entire face was pale and ashen, his body actually trembling. Clearly his emotions were extremely agitated, almost to the point of losing control.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What is going on Ming Yu, don’t be anxious, speak slowly.” In a flash, Zhou Weiqing appeared beside him, supporting his body as he infused some Saint Energy into his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the support of Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy, Ming Yu managed to calm down slightly, but he was still panting heavily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Zhou Weiqing, Ming Yu’s eyes were filled with a confused, conflicted light. “Weiqing… Weiqing, our Heavenly Demon Sect… the Heavenly Demon Sect has been exterminated…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?!” Zhou Weiqing was caught by surprise, his eyes widened in utter shock.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly Demon Sect had been exterminated? What kind of notion was that? Even though the Heavenly Demon Sect was the weakest out of the five Great Saint Lands, it was still an existence of a Great Saint Land. In order to exterminate a Great Saint Land, especially to do so without news traveling… what kind of insane power was required to do so? Even the Heaven’s Expanse Palace might not be able to accomplish such a task right?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What happened? Speak clearly.” Zhou Weiqing grabbed onto Ming Yu’s shoulder, his heart filled with worry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, his heart instantly thought of Little Witch, her sweet smile appearing in his mind’s eye.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Can any eggs remain unbroken when the nest is totally ruined? If the Heavenly Demon Sect was totally exterminated, what would happen to Little Witch?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Yu’s expression was bitter as he said: “It is the Blood Red Hell, the Blood Red Hell members did it. I just received news… it was only just a few days ago. A large number of Blood Red Hell powerhouses launched a surprise attack on our Heavenly Demon Sect headquarters in the Bai Da Empire. Our entire headquarters was destroyed, and only very few managed to escape. Currently, I still do not know the exact situation there, but I can be sure that our Heavenly Demon Sect has taken severe casualties.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing’s brow furrowed deeply. The Blood Red Hell had actually chosen such a time to take action against the Heavenly Demon Sect; more so they had actually succeeded in exterminating the Heavenly Demon Sect. Does that mean they already had the power to match against the Heaven’s Expanse Palace?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Yu sighed and said: “Originally, our Heavenly Demon Sect had been planning to wait for our armies to invade the Bai Da Empire, to work in collusion internally to totally destroy the Bai Da Empire. Who would have known that before we could even take action, we would be attacked by the Blood Red Hell so suddenly.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing said: “What do you need me to do now?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Yu shook his head in confusion, totally at a loss. “I also don’t know. Currently, we aren’t even clear of the exact situations, and we can’t even do anything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing took a deep breath before saying: “Ming Yu, don’t be too anxious first. No matter what, our Heavenly Bow Empire will be behind your Heavenly Demon Sect. First, you need to try to contact all the survivors of the Heavenly Demon Sect to come over here, they can reorganize and regroup the sect here. This grudge, we will definitely take revenge.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Yu nodded, saying: “Very well, that’s the only thing we can do now. I hope that the Sect Master and the others can survive. Otherwise, the Heavenly Demon Sect is truly finished. Thank you Weiqing, I’ll head off first.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he said that, he bowed once more to Di Fengling and Admiral Zhou before leaving distractedly, as if his soul had been drained from him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Ming Yu’s retreating figure, Zhou Weiqing stood there without moving, his mind whirling at top speed as he continued thinking.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly Demon Sect had been exterminated, and this was definitely not good news at all to the Heavenly Bow Empire. One of the reasons why Zhou Weiqing had been confident of building up a Great Saint Land in the Heavenly Bow Empire was because of the promise he had with the Heavenly Demon Sect previously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the original plan, when the Heavenly Bow Empire grew stronger, the Heavenly Demon Sect could come over to assist them. With the presence of the Heavenly Demon Sect, Zhou Weiqing could begin developing his own Great Saint Land without worrying about their overall strength being insufficient. At least, before they fully developed, the high end powers of the Heavenly Bow Empire could be supported by the Heavenly Demon Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Alas, now that the Heavenly Demon Sect had been destroyed, this was definitely a bad thing for the Heavenly Bow Empire, but it could also be an opportunity for them. Perhaps, it might even allow them to have a Great Saint Lands of their own, raising their own power to a certain extent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Fengling did not mention Zhou Weiqing inheriting the throne anymore, as he realised that Zhou Weiqing had long since reached a height that he could no longer see. It could be said that the lands of the Heavenly Bow Empire would not hold much draw to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Heavenly Bow Empire’s lands had been fully reclaimed in the next half a month. They had achieved an absolute victory in the battle of the Heavenly Bow City, slaughtering almost seventy thousand enemies and capturing nearly a hundred thousand prisoners. Of them, a large portion had actually been recruited and incorporated into their own forces, while some of the more stubborn and inflexible ones were killed off. In this way, the Heavenly Bow Empire gained nearly hundred thousand troops.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, these troops still needed time to train and fully integrate together, scattered into the original formations of the Heavenly Bow Empire armies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had to be known that the entire landmass of the Heavenly Bow Empire was barely just the size of one of the provinces in the Fei Li Empire, but now they had an army of more than two hundred thousand strong, many of which are elites.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One month later, the Heavenly Bow Empire’s Emperor Di Fengling gave the official order for their armies to move out, heading directly to the Kalise Empire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The main force of the Kalise Empire had mostly been lost in the Heavenly Bow Empire, and the Bai Da Empire did not give them any other support. In just a month, the entire Kalise Empire had been destroyed, and the Heavenly Bow Empire had doubled in size.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the Kalise Empire destroyed, it also meant the rise of a new Empire. The Heavenly Bow Empire also stationed more than a hundred thousand troops at their new border, positioned to threaten the Bai Da Empire at any time. Of course, the truth of the matter was that at least in a short period of time they would not be able to attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having just invaded and occupied the Kalise Empire, the Heavenly Bow Empire now needed to recuperate and recover, to assimilate their new lands and also continue recruitment and training.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ZhongTian Empire and the Fei Li Empire supplies flowed continuously into the Heavenly Bow Empire, allowing them to rest assured about their supplies. However, in order to maintain such a large troop, they first needed to become self sufficient. According to Di Fengling, Zhou Weiqing and the others’ discussions and plans, in a short period of time they would not launch any large scale attacks. Of course, it was just a matter of time before they attacked the Bai Da Empire eventually.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In these two months, the rest of the mainland seemed peaceful, with no other wars happening in other places. However, even in the midst of the calm, Zhou Weiqing felt as if it was just the calm before the storm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Weiqing.” Ming Yu walked in from outside, his expression overjoyed. Currently, they were both in the Heavenly Bow City. Although the majority of the armies were stationed in the original borders of the Kalise Empire, Zhou Weiqing and some of the other leaders had returned. That was because there was an important matter that they needed to deal with.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How is it?” Zhou Weiqing asked Ming Yu. He had returned to Admiral Zhou’s mansion to stay, and so did his four paramours. However, to Zhou Weiqing’s depression, ever since their return this time, the four girls had seemed to come to an agreement. At night, their doors were all kept shut, none of them allowing him to enter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, if he really wanted to force his way in, it was not impossible. However, Zhou Weiqing was afraid the other girls would be jealous! Furthermore, during this period of time, there had truly been just too many things to deal with, and it was only recently that everything had gone on the right track. Even so, to the Heavenly Bow Empire, this was just the beginning, and they still needed a lot of time to integrate everything together and grow. It was a necessary process to grow into a powerful Empire, and could not be accomplished in a short period of time. Their main problem now was their current foundation was still quite shallow and unstable.&nbsp;</span></p>

Only two of them.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing said: “Quick, invite them in. Oh, nevermind, I will go out with you to receive them.”&nbsp;</span></p>

As soon as they exited the door, Zhou Weiqing halted in his tracks, his eyes staring to the front.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Witch was clearly much thinner than before. She had never been fat by any means, but now she was so thin and delicate, her face pale and ashen. By her side was a tall old man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old man looked to be around sixty years of age, with a commanding and dignified air, though there was a cold aura about him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as she saw Zhou Weiqing, Little Witch obviously started momentarily. In the next moment, her eyes reddened, but she gritted her teeth, not saying anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being fixed on with those sorrowful and bitter eyes, Zhou Weiqing’s heart gripped tightly. Originally, in the volcano, although his memory was not full, he had after all possessed this young girl in front of him now! After that, the Heavenly Demon Sect had not come after him or even said anything, let alone looking for trouble with him. In fact, these few years, Little Witch had not even come looking for him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sudden strong sense of guilt rose in his heart the moment he saw her, and he quickly took a few steps forward in front of them. Bowing slightly to the old man, he greeted: “This Junior, Zhou Weiqing, greets Heavenly Emperor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black clad old man looked at Zhou Weiqing, a faint smile flashing across his face. “In truth, I should have come to see you a long time ago, but never found an opportune time. I’ve heard many good things about you, and now that I am seeing you personally, you truly live up to your reputation. Even I am unable to see through your cultivation, it is no wonder that even one as proud as Ming Yu is willing to serve you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “You flatter me, serve is not the right term. We are friends, partners and comrade-in-arms.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After saying that, his gaze turned directly to Little Witch. After a slight pause, he said in a low tone: “Sorry, I… I should have gone to look for you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At last, Little Witch couldn’t help but cry, turning into the black clad old man’s embrace as she began to sob.&nbsp;</span></p>

He was most afraid of situations like this, and no matter his intelligence, he did not know how to deal with it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The black clad old man sighed and said: “Weiqing, aren’t you going to invite us in?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ohh, ohh, this Junior has been rude. Please come in, Senior.”&nbsp;</span></p>

He was also Little Witch’s father.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A few months ago, the Heavenly Demon Sect had been the target of a brutal sneak attack from the Blood Red Hell, one that had destroyed them. In that disaster, less than a third of the Heavenly Demon Sect had actually managed to escape.</span></p>
