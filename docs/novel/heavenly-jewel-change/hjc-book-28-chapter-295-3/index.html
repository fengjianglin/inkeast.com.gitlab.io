<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at Huang Xingyun and Fen Tian provocatively and said, “So? Do you still have any other hidden trumps? If you do, bring them all out. Let’s see if you’re stronger than us.”</p>
 <p>As Zhou Weiqing spoke, the Peerless Sect powerhouses started equipping themselves with their Consolidated Equipment Sets.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The people who attracted the most attention were the three Shangguan sisters and Tian’er. The four of them were Heavenly Emperors - even though they were only Low Level Heavenly Emperors, they managed to become one at such a young age.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Tian’er was wearing the exact same God Vanquishing Heavenly Spirit Set as her father. However, the golden light that was emitting from her body was a lot brighter. Golden starlight was also flickering around her body. The intense Saint Energy ripples emitting from her were of the same root as Zhou Weiqing’s.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Nonetheless, Shangguan Xue’er was the one who had astonished everyone the most. Even though she was a Heavenly Emperor, wearing the Boundless Infinitum Set, she did not come across as lofty as Shangguan Tianyang on the whole. However, it must not be forgotten that Shangguan Xue’er’s cultivation method was different from Shangguan Tianyang’s. In terms of offensive power, her sharp and swift swordsmanship had surpassed that of Shangguan Tianyang’s. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er was also equipped with an ten-piece Consolidated Equipment Set. It was slender and dazzling with a footlong sharp blade at every joint. Amongst the three sisters, her Duo Physical Jewels’ Legendary Set appeared to be the thickest and heaviest.</p>
 <p>Similarly, Shangguan Bing’er also had a ten-piece Legendary Set. It was flickering with greenish golden light, particularly the enormous pair of Wings of the Wind God on the back, which was extremely dazzling.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Peerless Sect’s power had been completely displayed. Even without the presence of the sidhe, the Peerless Sect currently had at least one Heavenly God and six Heavenly Emperors in their midst. Their power was sufficient to allow them to possess the glory and honor of a Saint Land, even without taking the Saint Energy into consideration.</p>
 <p>What other hidden trump did Fen Tian and Huang Xingyun have? Perhaps they still did, but it could be a hidden trump that they could not be easily shown.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Go.” Fen Tian shouted, lifting both hands towards the sky. The Destruction Celestial Territory in mid-air immediately rammed into the Nature Celestial Territory, akin to strong winds sweeping the clouds away.</p>
 <p>The Sidhe Empress remained calm - a jade green scepter appeared within her right hand. Pointing the scepter forward, the Nature Celestial Territory immediately covered the entire sky, transforming into an endless amount of Nature power, striking back.</p>
 <p>The two great Celestial Territories collided violently with each other. What astonished Fen Tian was the fact that his unfailing Destruction Celestial Territory actually could not manifest its Destruction effects against the Sidhe Empress’ Nature Celestial Territory, such as devouring it.</p>
 <p>It was definitely not any simple Nature Attribute energy - there was the presence of the Saint Energy. It was…the Life Saint Energy? One of the branches of the Creation Saint Energy.</p>
 <p>Perhaps, in terms of level of purity, the Life Saint Energy could not be compared to Fen Tian and Huang Xingyun’s Destruction Energy. However, in terms of overall power, the Sidhe Empress and the twelve sidhe elders were more powerful than them. Hence, during the collision of the Celestial Territories, none of them was able to gain the upper hand.</p>
 <p>As the collision occurred, the powerhouses from both sides began to take action as well.</p>
 <p>Xue AoTian sighed softly - he knew that the thousand-year foundation of the Heavenly Snow Mountain might not be able to survive today.</p>
 <p>Several powerhouses from the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley descended from the backs of Hui Yao and Duo Si, the enormous dragons. They coordinated with the powerhouses on the ground and charged towards the Peerless Sect, the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Heaven’s Expanse Palace frantically.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Due to the new addition of powerhouses, their total headcount of the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley had far exceeded that of their opponent’s. Coupled with the fact that they shared the same origin of the Destruction Attribute, with this attack, the Destruction Energy had instantly filled the entire sky and earth.</p>
 <p>Long Shiya went after Shen Mo - earlier on, they did not manage to finish their fight and hence victory was not determined. Naturally, this time, he was not going to hold back. None of them wanted their own attacks to affect their comrades, hence, sharing the same thoughts, the both of them soared up to the sky at the same time before looking for a battlefield in the sky.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Huang Xingyun and Yun Ruoyu led a group of powerhouses from the Passion Valley and headed straight for the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. The two enormous dragons in mid-air descended to the ground and charged towards the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p>
 <p>“Boundless Infinitum, Stars and Moon rotate,” shouted Shangguan Tianyang with widened eyes. All 108 powerhouses from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace reacted at the same time. White smoke spread out in an instant and boundless energy ripples collided violently with Huang Xingyun and his wife.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Heavenly Spirits and Earthly Fiends Boundless Infinitum Formation was much more powerful than the ordinary Boundless Infinitum Formation that he used against Xue AoTian in the past. It had forcefully blocked Huang Xingyun and his wife.</p>
 <p>The total number of powerhouses of both the Passion Valley and the Blood Red Hell had added up to more than 400, whereas there were only slightly over 200 powerhouses on the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, the Peerless Sect and the Heavenly Snow Mountain’s side, including the Heavenly Beast guardians.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The jade green light swept through the air - the Nature Celestial Territory forcefully charged towards Hui Yao and Duo Si, enveloping them within it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After all, Hui Yao was also a Max Level Heavenly God. Now that he had possessed the Destruction Attribute, his power was naturally a lot more overbearing than before. Additionally, Duo Si had also became a High Level Heavenly God, with a foot stepping into the realm of the Max Level Stage. In terms of power, they were not inferior to Fen Tian and Huang Xingyun.</p>
 <p>Roar ——</p>
 <p>Letting out a frenzied roar, the two enormous dragons erupted almost immediately, charging left and right within the Life Celestial Territory. Terrifying energy ripples had instantly destroyed the Heavenly Snow Castle, smashing it into smithereens.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Let’s go up,” said the Sidhe Empress in a low voice. She led the twelve Sidhe elders, soaring up into the sky at the same time. Using the Nature Celestial Territory, she maneuvered the two enormous dragons out of the battlefield temporarily.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s judgment of the present situation was extremely accurate - he was able to tell what was going on the moment Hui Yao and Dao Si had appeared. If the two enormous dragons were present on the battlefield, then the power of the Heavenly Beast guardians of the Heavenly Snow Mountain would be greatly weakened. In the face of the Dragon Emperor Bloodline’s might, they might not be able to display any prowess.</p>
 <p>Hence, he had sent the Sidhe Empress and the sidhe to deal with the two enormous dragons, Firstly, they were not at a disadvantage in terms of the bloodline, and hence they would not be affected by the pressure inflicted by the two dragons. At the same time, Zhou Weiqing did not wish to hurt Hui Yao and Duo Si! Only the sidhe’s power had the ability to suppress them without hurting them.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Zhou Weiqing took the needs of the Sidhe into consideration - the sidhe were kind and advocates of peace. They did not like to engage in killings of any sort. Furthermore, they did not possess as much actual combat experience. Hence, even though they had five Heavenly Gods on their side, the only individual who was powerful enough with combat abilities was none other than the Sidhe Empress. If they were to take part in a battle, they might be injured. If that were to happen, Zhou Weiqing would not be able to be accountable to the Sidhe Empress!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Of course, since the Sidhe were dealing with the two enormous dragons, the pressure on the battlefield was increased as a result. Zhou Weiqing had underestimated the number of powerhouses the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley had on their side.</p>
 <p>The sidhe and the two enormous dragons had risen to the sky. Fen Tian did not follow suit - he knew clearly that the battle on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain was the most important one, especially the fight against Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>At this very moment, Fen Tian had fully comprehended that key person within the three great Saint Lands was not Shangguan Tianyang or Xue AoTian - it was Zhou Weiqing, the young Sect Leader of the Peerless Sect. He was the leader. Clearly, everything was under his control. His status as a leader was naturally unquestionable, since Zhou Weiqing was able to mobilize the top powerhouses of the Sidhe. In truth, he did not know, and neither did the Heaven’s Expanse Palace nor the Heavenly Mountain, who just found out not long ago, that Zhou Weiqing had a hidden trump as such.</p>
 <p>Two rays of swift chilly light shot out from Fen Tian’s eyes and headed towards Zhou Weiqing.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing returned him with a provocative look - he was not intimidated at all. Even though he was still a Max Level Heavenly Emperor who had not broken through to the Heavenly God Stage, he was not timid when faced with a Max Level Heavenly God like Fen Tian.</p>
 <p>He held the two hammers in his hands and prepared himself - the hammer in his right hand pointed in the direction of Fen Tian. Bright starlight suddenly erupted from his body, a halo made of revolving nebula suspended above Zhou Weiqing’s head.</p>
 <p>This time, the diameter of the halo was approximately five meters. It merely enveloped Zhou Weiqing within it. However, Zhou Weiqing’s chest lit up, as he bathed himself within the nebula light - the Astral Saint Core Nucleus and the Astral Celestial Territory responded to each other from afar. The golden Nebula Saint Energy from before gradually became whitish gold instead.</p>
 <p>Pure and dense Saint Energy ripples immediately erupted from Zhou Weiqing’s body. The dense Saint Energy ripples had caused the Blood Red Hell powerhouses to stop advancing towards him immediately, with fright on their faces. They did not dare to approach him any further.</p>
 <p>Fen Tian had a horrified look on his face as well. Even though there were several hundred meters between the both of them, he could clearly sense the frightening pressure and threatening aura posed by Zhou Weiqing. The whitish golden Saint Energy aura, mixed with a little gold, that was emitting from Zhou Weiqing’s body had made him feel as though the Destruction Energy within his body was suppressed. Without a doubt, his Destruction Energy was inferior to Zhou Weiqing’s Creation Energy. This was the difference in the power of Attributes.</p>
 <p>Fen Tian placed his hands together above his head. With his entire body behind his Legendary Set, a huge scarlet sword had appeared within his hands. Without any flashy moves, it headed towards Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>The dark purple light transformed into an enormous light blade, directly striking Zhou Weiqing with the countless gigantic devouring mouths as the backdrop in the sky.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing snorted. The Dual Legendary Hammers within his hands completely became whitish golden under the influence of the Nebula Saint Energy, as he raised them upwards.</p>
 <p>A loud bang was heard, smashing a huge space in the surrounding. The dark purple light blade had shattered, while Zhou Weiqing had retreated two steps to stabilize himself with much difficulty.</p>
 <p>The corner of his mouth twitched in disdain - Zhou Weiqing understood that Fen Tian wanted to use strength to suppress him. However, with the level of purity of his Saint Energy, what was there to be afraid of?&nbsp;</p>
