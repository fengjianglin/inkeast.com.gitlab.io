 <p><strong>Chapter 16 Fresh Recruit Tournament (3)</strong></p>
 <p>Indeed that was true, after all, the arrows for this sort of tournament had to have their arrowheads removed, and their quantity was not high. As such, each of the recruits were only issued 25 arrows for this Fresh Recruit Tournament, and by now Zhou Weiqing’s quiver had been emptied, and he was also at a loss, and could only charge back and try to pick up some arrows in order to continue fighting.</p>
 <p>However, he is after all not a god, after he had picked up two arrows and used them to shoot down two opponents, the opposing team had already closed the distance to 150 yards, and such a distance allowed the enemies’ longbows to shoot out arrows quickly and with much power. Although he was flexible and agile, but in the situation and also being restricted from using his Heavenly Jewels’ abilities, he was also unable to do much, and could only look at more than 40 arrows flying towards him.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing realised he could not dodge this salvo anymore, and quickly squatted down, both his hands covering his chest, trying to reduce the body surface area exposed as much as possible as he lowered the head, covering most of himself with his Wind Hat.</p>
 <p>*Ping* *Ping* sounds resounded out constantly above Zhou Weiqing’s head, and his hat was covered with the lime as at least 7-8 arrows landed on top of his hat.</p>
 <p>Seeing that they had finally taken down their target, the remaining recruits from the opposing team started cheering out loud immediately.</p>
 <p>“Cheering? Cheer your head! If not for the fact that he ran out of arrows, he could have killed all of you slowly.” The Company Leader directing the team scolded them ill-humoredly. Although the First and Second Battalions had won the Third and Fourth Battalions in the end, but they had not actually won that extremely outstanding recruit. There was really no need to compete; Zhou Weiqing alone had taken down 25 opponents, how could anyone other recruits be more outstanding than him in this Fresh Recruit Tournament?</p>
 <p>Before the Company Leader had even finished speaking, a sudden *Ping* sounded out and an arrow hit his chest. The arrow was shot at an extremely high speed, and with an ooof sound, the Company Leader fell down with a look of disbelief on his face, his breath stuck in his chest causing a fierce pain and a stuffy feeling in his chest causing him to nearly faint.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on?” Just as the recruits from the First and Second Battalions were looking around in surprise, several more *Ping*s sounded out and several of them fell. Only then did they awaken from their surprise, and when they turned their head to look, they saw Little Fatty Zhou on the other side with his hat full of lime, shooting out arrows quickly and silently.</p>
 <p>Immediately, the recruits from the First and Second Battalions were enraged. <em>You might be very strong, but you still have to obey the tournament rules right? After being hit by us, how could you still continue shooting? Getting shot was after all still very painful.</em></p>
 <p>Before they could charge forward, Shangguan Bing’er shouted angrily, “Stop! Little Fatty Zhou, what are you doing?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Se said gloatingly: “Battalion Commander, you do not need to blame him, I think he was defiant and unconvinced by that loss. However, a Country has its Laws, Families have their family rules; this is a breach of military discipline. Soldiers who do not listen to orders should not be promoted easily!”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing heard Shangguan Bing’er shouting at him, and he stopped shooting to shoulder the Purple Dawn Bow onto his back, taking off his Wind Hat to brush off the lime, before running over.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er glared angrily at Zhou Weiqing, “Little Fatty Zhou, what were you doing? The fight had already ended, why did you continue shooting?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing blinked: “Did the fight end? No! I am still alive, why can’t I attack?”</p>
 <p>The Company Leader Li from the First Battalion knitted his brow and said: “Little Fatty Zhou, trying to outdo others is a good thing. However, this is the army, and everything must be according to rules. You were struck by at least seven arrows, your Wind Hat was full of lime, if this were a genuine battlefield, you would have already died. At that time, your correct choice should have been to escape immediately, instead of returning to the battlefield to pick up arrows. As Company Leader Xiao said a moment ago, you have breached military discipline. Although your performance was very outstanding, but I’m afraid you will not be able to be promoted to Squad Leader. Do you want to consider joining our First Battalion?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er had only just been promoted to Battalion Commander not long ago, and her prestige was still insufficient. The First Battalion was the strongest amongst the four archery units in the Regiment, and this veteran Company Leader was not afraid of recruiting her men right in front of her.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head immediately, turning towards Shangguan Bing’er with a stubborn look on his face: “No, Battalion Commander, I have not lost.” As he said those words, he was laughing deep in his heart, thinking to himself: <em>These people are really coordinating well to my script.</em></p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er frowned: “Little Fatty Zhou, do not deliberately cause trouble. You are dismissed.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said with his face looking like he had suffered from much injustice: “But, I really have not lost! Look!” As he said that, he removed his Wind Hat and handed it to Shangguan Bing’er.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er took the Wind Hat from him and was rather shocked. This was obviously much heavier than an ordinary Wind Hat, and pinching it with her hand, she immediately understood. Looking again at Zhou Weiqing with that that suffering expression on his face, she almost laughed out loud. This rascal really was afraid of death … …. These few days she had thought he had turned proper, but it seems like, it was not easy for a leopard to change his spots.</p>
 <p>Xiao Se looked at that the strange expression on Shangguan Bing’er’s face, and focused his gaze on the Wind Hat. “Hmmm, ehhh that Wind Hat seems rather big.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er passed the Wind Hat to her, and in an instance, Xiao Se’s expression also changed, looking at Zhou Weiqing with a rather solemn and sombre expression, making Zhou Weiqing feel very uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>The Wind Hat was passed around, and after a while, the expressions of all the Company Leaders had turned strange. The Company Leader Li of the First Battalion sighed and said: “Talented… damned you really are a talented person. You can even come up with such a method… This little hat is made out of titanium alloy right, otherwise it wouldn’t be so light with such mass. No wonder you said that you have not died, even a normal arrow probably will not be able to penetrate it! Battalion Commander Shang Gong, our First Battalion has lost this Fresh Recruit Tournament. Little Bro Little Fatty Zhou, this older brother has a favorable impression of you.”</p>
 <p>Very obviously, such a titanium alloy Wind Hat was impossible to be widely distributed in the army, after all its creation cost was way too expensive. However, who could say more in this Fresh Recruit Tournament. Did Zhou Weiqing violate any rule? He had spent his own money for his own equipment, how could that be considered violating a rule? Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing’s impressive archery had gotten the approval of all these Company Leaders.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er shot a look at Zhou Weiqing, then a look at Xiao Se at the side who was silent now, and the corners of her mouth went up slightly. “Let’s go then, it’s time for us to have a look at the situation of the Light and Heavy Infantry Companies.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing continued on his Personal Aide role, and moved to stand behind Shangguan Bing’er. As he passed her, he said in a very low, gentle tone that only the two of them could hear “Bing’er”.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er’s shoulder shook a little obviously, but she had to concede her gambling debt. Furthermore, she could not act out in front of so many people, lest Zhou Weiqing said anything aloud to embarrass her, instead she quickly hastened her steps to lead the other Company Leaders towards the other two tournament grounds.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was just about to follow them, but suddenly one of his arms was tightly gripped by someone. When he turned his head to look, he realised it was Xiao Se.</p>
 <p>Xiao Se’s expression was somewhat ugly, saying in a low tone: “Little Fatty Zhou, do you have the guts to compete with me?”</p>
