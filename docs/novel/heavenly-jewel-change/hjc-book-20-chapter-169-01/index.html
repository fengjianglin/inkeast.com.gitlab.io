 <p><b>Chapter 169 Sacrifice! Wu Yuehan! (1)</b></p>
 <p>Long Big Fatty’s purity had been questioned, so how could he not be enraged. With a wave of his right hand, two blades of light flew towards the two Heavenly King Stage powerhouses. Behind his back, an even larger illusory image of Long Big Fatty rose up behind… the Heavenly Skill Image of himself!</p>
 <p>The two blades of light looked very similar to an ordinary Wind Blade, but as soon as they flew out, the two Heavenly King Stage powerhouses’ faces changed… Because, the two blades of light were actually both glowing with six different colours!</p>
 <p>With simultaneous shouts, the two Heavenly King Stage powerhouses took a step back swiftly, their Heavenly Energy bursting forth immediately as all their Consolidated Equipment appeared on them. Both were geared in seven pieces of a Zong Stage Consolidating Equipment Set.</p>
 <p>Once someone reached the Heavenly King Stage cultivation level, things were very different. At that point, they could instantly complete wearing all their Consolidated Equipment at once. Both their weapons were swords, and simultaneously they slashed forward towards the blade of lights. One of them shouted out: “Yue Han, run!”</p>
 <p>The two blades of light were struck by the two Heavenly King Stage powerhouses’ Consolidated Swords. However, to their shock, none of the expectation clash of energies of explosions occurred.</p>
 <p>Wearing their full Consolidated Equipment Set, the two Heavenly King Stage powerhouses felt as if their eyes blurred, everything turning illusory around them. As for the black clad young lady behind them, all she saw was that they were now covered by a layer of six lights.</p>
 <p>One step, and Long Shiya seemed to descend down from the heavens. With a wave of his large hand, the black clad young lady felt as if the very air around her body consolidated, like an invisible huge hand was holding her body. A thick green light rose about them abruptly, and she had already left the ground, soaring high into the sky together with Long Big Fatty.</p>
 <p>*Poof**Poof* The six-coloured shield around the two Heavenly King Stage powerhouses disappeared instantly. When the two managed to break lose, all they managed to see was Long Shiya soar off into the sky with the black clad young lady in tow.</p>
 <p>Both of them howled angrily into the sky, soaring into the air as well. As Heavenly King Stage powerhouses, they could still manage flight for a short period of time, and the two of them circulated their Heavenly Energy to the max, and their eyes started turning bloodshot.</p>
 <p>“Don’t even try the Demonic Change State in front of me. Normally, with my temper, neither of you would have a chance to live.” Long Shiya’s disdainful voice rang out in the air. Next, a huge shield of light, six coloured once more, appeared in the skies. In a huge clashing sound, the two Heavenly King Stage powerhouses were knocked back down by the intense impact.</p>
 <p>Heavenly King Stage and Heavenly Emperor Stage. It might only seem to be the simple difference of just one stage, a difference of title or designation. However, in truth, these two Heavenly King Stage powerhouses were only at the Mid Level of the Heavenly King Stage, while Long Shiya had long since been at the High Level, probably Maximum level of the Heavenly Emperor Stage. Heavenly King High, Maximum, Heavenly Emperor Low, Mid, High, Maximum Levels… six whole levels!</p>
 <p>Once at the Heavenly King Stage and above, the gap between each level was massive, almost similar to the gap for every Jewel of a Heavenly Jewel Master. For them, facing Long Shiya was tantamount to a two Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master facing an eight Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master. They would not stand a chance.</p>
 <p>The reason why Long Shiya did not just kill them off and showed mercy was because he was still rather embarrassed in his heart. After all, he was about to snatch a young lady as a ‘sacrifice’ for his own precious disciple, and it was nothing to be proud of at all. After all, if it was just about the Heavenly Demon Sect, he was not afraid of them at all. Of the Five Great Saint Lands, besides the Heavenly Snow Mountain with the Heavenly God Tier Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord, Long Shiya did not respect the other four Great Saint Lands.</p>
 <p>Of course, that did not mean that he could take on an entire Great Saint Lands just by himself, but do not forget that he was just a lone person, and a maximum level Heavenly Emperor powerhouse to boot. As long as he was willing to do so, no one could surround him and attack him. Once he wanted to cause trouble to any side, even if it were a Great Saint Lands, they would not be able to handle it. This was one of the benefits of being a lone wolf. Of course, one had to be an extremely powerful lone wolf to be able to enjoy such benefits.</p>
 <p>The two Heavenly King Stage powerhouse slammed back down savagely onto the ground after knocking into the shield. Long Shiya’s voice came from all around them: “I’m taking this girl, I have something extremely important that I need her help with, and I will not harm her life. You two just wait here, it will take minimum one day, maximum three days of time. I will bring her back here when it is over.”</p>
 <p>As the two Heavenly King Stage powerhouses landed on the ground, the red in their eyes faded away. When they had smashed into that six-coloured shield of light, they felt as if their connection with the world’s atmospheric energy vanish in that instant, stealing their power to fly and also forcefully stop the Demonic Change occurring in their body and cutting it off.</p>
 <p>They had inherited the Demonic Change State that had been in their families for generations, and it was only when they reached the Heavenly King Stage that they had been able to maintain a clear mind when in the Demonic Change State. Even so, it would take them some time to fully enter the Demonic Change State, just like unleashing any powerful Skill. This was the difference between their Demonic Change State and a First Generation Demonic Change State like Zhou Weiqing’s… a gap that was nigh insurmountable.</p>
 <p>The two Heavenly King Stage powerhouses exchanged looks, seeing the helplessness in each others’ eyes. They had come here with Wu Yuehan in order to sneak into the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens to catch a few powerful Heavenly Beasts for the Heavenly Demon Sect to meet their Skill Storing needs.</p>
 <p>Who would have thought that before they even reached the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens, they would meet with such a person, and worse still, that Wu Yuehan would be taken by him.</p>
 <p>To both of them, it was currently too far from the Heavenly Demon Sect, and they had no way for calling for any reinforcements. The two of them were no match for Long Shiya by themselves, and even if they could get reinforcements, they wouldn’t be able to match up against him. As such, what else could they do but wait for him? After all, not only were they unable to catch up with Long Shiya, even if they did catch up, what could they do. If the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor really wanted to kill the two of them, it would not be difficult for him.</p>
 <p>Long Shiya looked at the black clad young lady being controlled by his powerful strength and sighed, thinking to himself: <i>Little Fatty, Little Fatty, you little brat, your luck is not bad huh! Such a beautiful little lady, and the daughter of the Heavenly Demon Sect Master to boot… well you can’t say I’m treating you badly for that. Originally, I was still thinking that worse case scenario I would have to catch some female Heavenly Beast sow or something for you… heh heh heh.</i></p>
 <p>Without question, this young lady that had been caught by Long Shiya was the Little Witch, Wu Yuehan, that Zhou Weiqing had met long ago… the daughter of the Heavenly Demon Sect Master. Although she was not able to move or speak, she could still listen and see everything that was going on around.</p>
 <p>She had never met a powerhouse quite like Long Shiya. After all, even her father could not dealt with the two Heavenly King Stage powerhouse elders of the Heavenly Demon Sect so easily like that! This was the first time she had ever heard of the name of the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor.</p>
 <p>Seeing Long Big Fatty’s eyes fixed upon her, Little Witch felt a chill run down her spine. The unknown was always the most terrifying, and she did not know what Long Shiya had snatched her up for. Terror gripped her heart, an uncontrollable terror causing her heart to tremble as rare tears threatened to well up.</p>
 <p>“Little young lady, do not be afraid. I have grabbed you because I need your help. Hmm.. that said, my little disciple has some sort of connection with your Heavenly Demon Sect after all. Although this time, you will lose something precious to you, I will also compensate you for it, and I promise that you will not be in any danger or have any threat to your life.”</p>
 <p>Seeing the sheer terror in Wu Yuehan’s eyes, Long Shiya felt rather embarrassed and guilty, even slightly unwilling. However, for the sake of his precious disciple, he had no choice, and he could only clumsily try to comfort the young lady.</p>
 <p>Naturally, Little Witch would not be so easily comforted by a few words. On the contrary, the terror in her heart increased several fold. Lose something precious to her? She was merely a six Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, at most about to break through to the seventh Jewel stage… in any ordinary person’s eyes, she might be someone high up above… but to a Heavenly Emperor like this man in front of her, what kind of precious thing could she have that could interest him…. unless….</p>
 <p><i>I’m doomed…</i> In that instant, Little Witch felt as if she was blacking out. However, at the same time, she suddenly thought of someone, a man who roused so many complicated feelings within her.</p>
 <p>Ever since she left the Heavenly Jewel Island and found out about what had happened to the Heavenly Bow Empire, especially since the Heavenly Demon Sect was hiding in the Bai Da Empire and supporting it… she knew that perhaps the Heavenly Demon Sect would never be able to gain that person’s support ever again. How could she and he then…</p>
 <p>She had tried her very best to forget him, but somehow all her efforts were to no avail, and she found herself thinking of him at the most random of times. At the same time, she could never forget what had happened in the Lustre Spatial Realm, what they had gone through, and how that shameless scoundrel had suddenly seemed so tall, grand and noble as he stood before the mother dragon protectively. However, after their parting in the Heavenly Jewel Island, she had lost all contact with him, and even all knowledge of where he was. She only knew that he had returned to the Fei Li City, and after that, no one knew where he went. The Heavenly Demon Sect had been looking for him ever since, especially after she had sent word back about all he had done in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. Her father, the current Heavenly Demon Sect Master, had already deemed this young man that had left such a lasting impression on her to be extremely important to the Heavenly Demon Sect.</p>
 <p>However, up until now, none of them knew anything about his whereabouts. Upon seeing that she was about to reach the seven-Jeweled stage, she had decided to come to the Ten Thousand Beast Heavens to catch some Heavenly Beasts for Skill Storing. Who knew that she would actually meet with something like this. If this Heavenly Emperor powerhouse actually took what was most precious to her, or his disciple did, then… she would no longer have face to meet with ‘him’.</p>
 <p>Tears started to stream down Little Witch’s eyes uncontrollably. <i>It’s the end… it’s all over… </i></p>
 <p>Long Shiya’s flying speed was extremely fast, and the distance from the place he met with the three from the Heavenly Demon Sect was not that far from the Fire Spirit Mountain. In a few moments, he had brought Little Witch back to the top of the volcano.</p>
 <p>Just as they rose up to the top of the Fire Spirit Mountain, a figure with a strange purple light about it flashed in front of them before leaping towards them. At the same time, it howled out with a wild abandon.</p>
 <p>The howl had the melodious roar of a dragon, the overbearing tyranny of a tiger’s howl, and a more basic, a wild berserker’s fury.</p>
 <p><i>His Heavenly Jewels have already finished Consolidating? Luckily I returned much earlier than expected. </i>Long Shiya instantly knew what that purple covered figure was, and that wild aura that he was emitting gave even Long Shiya a surprise. It was a terrifying burst of bloodline power that even he had not seen before.</p>
 <p>The six coloured shield of light rose forth from Long Shiya’s body, somehow enveloping the purple blur of the figure which was moving so quickly that it could not be followed by the ordinary naked eye. Instantly, it was fully wrapped in a glowing bubble of six coloured lights.</p>
 <p>The purple figure had clearly lost consciousness and was only moving on instinct, launching a series of crazed attacks at the six coloured shield of light covering and restricting him, causing constant ripples in the bubble.</p>
