Instead, the entire patch of ocean water instantly turned into a brilliant red, as if stained by fresh blood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, Zhou Weiqing was in the ocean water, rather far from the actual battle ground. However, in that instant, he felt as though the entire waters around him was turning cold; the terrifying energy fluctuations so strong that it felt as if his entire body was being torn apart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What kind of energy was this?&nbsp;</span></p>

Besides that, there was also a strange destructive power that seemed to bring a tearing sensation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Fusion Skill. This had to be a Fusion Skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing immediately made the judgement. Furthermore, this was a true Fusion Skill between the Darkness and Demonic Attributes. Zhou Weiqing had six-Attributes of his own, and more importantly, he was the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya’s disciple. In that short period of time, he had already accurately assessed this blow from Dreamwake and analysed it thoroughly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blow that Dreamwake’s Dragon Spear had released was indeed the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tenebrous Attribute, but it was not as simple as that. Instead, it was a subtle sublimation and evolving, tantamount to a true Fusion Skill of the Darkness and Demonic Attribute.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for what this Skill was exactly, he was not clear. However, he understood that if the target had been himself, when that spear pierced down, and he did not have proper preparation, even the Saint Energy would not be able to save him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dreamwake’s power was actually so strong to such a degree. Even that arrogant Terror Sea Dragon had been forced by the single blow to duck back into the ocean.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“ROAR---” A ferocious dragon howl rang out, filled with utter rage. At the same time, a dark blue ray of light soared out from the ocean waters abruptly, splitting into countless water arrows shooting out at lightning speeds.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, they shot towards the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tenebrous Demon Dragon and Dreamwake in midair.&nbsp;</span></p>

The water arrows all slammed into the whirlpool, vanishing into nothingness at once.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon Spear in Dreamwake’s hands pierced out once more. This time, a total of twelve streaks of blood-colored light shot forth one after the other, actually splitting up into different directions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without even another second of thought, Zhou Weiqing flew out from the ocean waters once more, flying back as quickly as he could in retreat. Previously, it was just a single spear strike, and it had already affected him despite the distance. This time, it was twelve spear strikes, and he could just imagine how terrifying the power behind those strikes added up would be. He did not want to become the misfortunate hapless one again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The alarming amount of energy in the air rose constantly, and a resplendent light abruptly rose from the oceans to meet it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a bright blue shield of light, forcefully blocking all twelve piercing streaks of blood-coloured light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, a strange sight occurred next. The seemingly solid blue shield of light was actually unable to fully block the piercing of the twelve streaks of blood-coloured light. Instead, twelve small holes were forcefully pierced in it, causing it to shatter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was no wonder the Terror Sea Dragon had been so afraid of the previous streak of blood-coloured light. Even when it released a Heavenly God Tier defensive Skill, it was still unable to block them. Was this the true power of Dreamwake’s full eleven-piece Legendary Set, fusing her own strength with that of the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tenebrous Demon Dragon? Eleven pieces of Legendary Set God Tier Consolidated Equipment! Their strength truly lived up to their name indeed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing’s heart was slightly envious. After all, although his ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set was also extremely powerful, it currently had the limit of being a ten-piece Legendary Set. Just thinking about the power boost he would gain from completing ten pieces of his own Legendary Set, Zhou Weiqing could vaguely guess the sheer terror that would be this eleven-piece Set, and what it granted to both Dreamwake and the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tenebrous Demon Dragon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The oceans water parted, almost as if split apart, and in a massive clashing sound, the Terror Sea Dragon rose from the ocean, soaring into the skies. Although it did not have wings, as a Heavenly God Tier powerhouse, how could it not be able to fly?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Horrifying energy reverberations exploded from its body instantly, its ferocious body pouncing directly at the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tenebrous Demon Dragon. At the same time, all of the spikes on the Terror Sea Dragon’s body turned a sapphire blue colour, and more than a thousand rays of blue light shot forth in all directions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The speed of the blue light was just too quick. Although Zhou Weiqing saw it extremely quickly, it was already too late to dodge it. That was because as soon as the blue light appeared, the water attribute in the atmosphere was actually frozen solid, causing his entire body to be freeze and harden in midair.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was not even the Terror Sea Dragon purposely targeting him, but the power of a Heavenly God Tier was just too great, and even a casual swipe could cause the entire world around to shake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not good!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Zhou Weiqing exclaimed in his heart. Left with no choice, he could no longer hide the Saint Energy, forced to use it to protect himself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as he was circulating his Saint Energy and preparing to protect himself, to break free of the Water Attribute Fetters.</span></p>

At the same time, tens of thousands of the blood-coloured lights sprayed forth from Dreamwake’s Dragon Spear.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Instantly, the world itself seemed to distort around them. However, to Zhou Weiqing’s surprise, all of the blue light that was in his direction were now blocked by a ray of blood light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She is doing this to save me!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing’s heart shook, as a strange warmth rose in his heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even as they were facing such a powerful foe like the Terror Sea Dragon, Dreamwake was still looking out for him at such a distance. Putting their power levels aside, just this sentiment alone had seared itself deeply into Zhou Weiqing’s heart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although this rascal Zhou Weiqing was definitely a perverted and wretched fellow, he placed much importance on feelings and emotions. When someone treated him well, he would pay back ten times in return. Dreamwake herself did not know that just this subconscious action of hers had caused Zhou Weiqing to have a sudden rise in approval and opinion of her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">*PENG*</span></p>

Its body was sent flying by the impact, and it was also struck by more than a hundred rays of the blue light, causing scales and blood to spray from the air.&nbsp;</span></p>

However, standing on the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s head, Dreamwake was actually posing a far greater threat than even the Tenebrous Demon Dragon itself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By this point, more than forty spikes on the Terror Sea Dragon had actually been vaporised from their attacks, and its injuries were no less than that of the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tenebrous Demon Dragon. Although with its powerful defense, it could still normally block Dreamwake’s attacks, when it seized the chance to injure the Tenebrous Demon Dragon, Dreamwake’s Dragon Spear had also reach the front of its face.&nbsp;</span></p>

After all, the Dragon Spear in Dreamwake’s hands was a fusion piece of the last two pieces of her Legendary Set. In any Legendary Set, the Consolidating Equipment Scrolls of the later pieces were definitely harder to create, and their power was correspondingly stronger. Furthermore, this was even a fusion of two pieces… that of an eleven-piece Legendary Set! Added on with the power of the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tenebrous Demon Dragon, one could just imagine the sheer power behind this spear.&nbsp;</span></p>

The power of this spear… even a Mid Level Heavenly God Tier powerhouse like itself would not be able to accept so easily.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The terrifying energy reverberations shook throughout the air around them. Zhou Weiqing did not know what the Terror Sea Dragon was thinking, but in that clash, it seemed like it did not gain any advantage.&nbsp;</span></p>

Previously, the successful blow they had landed caused its confidence to grow. It had been a long time since it had fought in unison with a companion with the full Tenebrous Demon Dragon Legendary Set. In fact, it had almost forgotten the true power of that Dragon Spear. Even it had not imagined that Dreamwake could wield that Tenebrous Dragon Slaying Spear to such a degree.&nbsp;</span></p>

This time, it was not just its body, even the ocean beneath it began to glow. A shocking amount of Water Attribute energies gathered instantly, forming a huge cage of atmospheric power, forcefully enclosing the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tenebrous Demon Dragon and Dreamwake in it.&nbsp;</span></p>

However, as soon as the attacks touched the icy blue cage, they actually disappeared just as swiftly. Even if it was damaged slightly, the constantly gushing water attribute flowing from below would quickly replenish and repair the damage done.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having unleashed this powerful skill, the Terror Sea Dragon clearly showed signs of fatigue, but its eyes were extremely excited.&nbsp;</span></p>

You will never be able to match the power of the entire oceans. Die, all of you… die! Hahahaha… once your Tenebrous Attribute energy is expended, that will be the time you will remain forever in my oceans.”&nbsp;</span></p>

She lifted the Dragon Spear high above her head, and a ball of blood-coloured light shone from the tip of the spear, forming the semblance of a petal. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The blood-red petal did not destroy this Ocean Cage that the Terror Sea Dragon had summoned. Instead, in the next moment, twelve pillars of pitch black light suddenly soared into the skies from all directions.&nbsp;</span></p>

To be able to fight it to a standstill and retreat fully intact would already be a feat in itself. However, they had come fully prepared for this! The Tenebrous Sealing Formation, this was a ‘gift’ they had prepared specially for this Terror Sea Dragon. It could be said that all of the previous fighting, all the changes and variances, while real, was all bait for the Terror Sea Dragon. The true reason was for it to enter the boundaries of the Tenebrous Sealing Formation. Once that happened, it would truly become the meat on their chopping board, easy pickings for them to slay.&nbsp;</span></p>

Soon, that surprise turned into alarm, even panic, as its massive body shot forward in a flash. A thousand metres was a distance that could be covered in a mere blink to a powerhouse like it, but alas as soon as it reached the borders of the formation, it smashed savagely into one of the pillars of light and was sent bouncing back.&nbsp;</span></p>
