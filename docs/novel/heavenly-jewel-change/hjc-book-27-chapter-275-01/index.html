 <p>After hearing his question, Little Witch’s delicate face became redder. She shook her head vehemently and said, “I, I don’t know.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said righteously, “You lied. You must be punished when you lie.”</p>
 <p>“Ah ——”</p>
 <p>As her mind was in a whirl, Little Witch had already been pressed against the bed by a certain someone who was very heavy. Looking at the smirking face that was getting closer and closer to her, Little Witch’s heart rate suddenly increased threefold. Her small hand clenched into a fist, keeping her eyes tightly closed as she was afraid to look at him. However at this moment, apart from anticipation and nervousness, she did not feel any desire to reject him.</p>
 <p>In another room.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er, Fei’er, Bing’er and Tian’er sat together.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er looked curiously at Bing’er and Tian’er. “If we sleep with him, can we really advance to the next cultivation base?”</p>
 <p>Tian’er glared at her and said, “You have already asked 21 times. Why don’t you try it for yourself? Then you’ll know!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er’s face went red, “I feel embarrassed, alright? It’s all stupid Little Fatty’s fault for suddenly mentioning out of the blue that he was going to go looking for the sidhe. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have decided to let him take advantage of us. The sidhe are incredibly dangerous; if we don’t increase our cultivation base, how are we going to help him? Tell me, do you think this is just a ruse he came up with?”</p>
 <p>Tian’er laughed out loud, “Oh, please. In my opinion, you have been wanting it for a long time. Since we sisters have known each other for so long, do you want me to teach you some tricks to make him docile and obedient?”</p>
 <p>As she spoke, she leaned in closer to Shangguan Fei’er’s ear and whispered something.</p>
 <p>Immediately, Shangguan Fei’er’s face became completely red, as though she had too much to drink, “You…you…you are so naughty. I’m not gonna talk to you. Sis, Tian’er is bullying me.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er’s face was not any less red compared to Shangguan Fei’er’s. Even though Tian’er whispered softly, based on their cultivation base, how could she possibly have been unable to hear what was said?</p>
 <p>Tian’er laughed cheekily and said, “You two might seem shy now, but eventually that bastard will make you two do naughty stuff. If you don’t trust me, you can ask Bing’er.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t…don’t ask me. I don’t know anything.” Shangguan Bing’er lowered her head in embarrassment. Judging from how she looked, Tian’er’s words were clearly validated.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er and Fei’er looked at each other. They couldn’t help but blush once again.</p>
 <p>They all secretly wanted to allow Little Fatty Zhou to take advantage of them. Apart from wanting to increase their cultivation base to help him deal with the sidhe, they naturally had other intentions as well!</p>
 <p>In their hearts, they had long considered Zhou Weiqing to be their man; by giving him something that was most precious to them, they would be able to further strengthen their hold over his heart. Furthermore, Bing’er and Little Witch had already done the deed with him. They did somewhat worry if they refused to let him get intimate with them, his feelings for them might fade. It seemed very unfair; but it was their own fault for falling for a bastard like him.</p>
 <p>If Zhou Weiqing found out about their true feelings, he would be overjoyed……&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Early next morning.</p>
 <p>A small delicate ‘lamb’ slowly woke up from her sweet slumber under the touch of a pair of warm hands. From her flushed face, it could be seen that last night’s “battle” was rather intense - it still had a pleasant lingering effect.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Indeed, Little Witch was not any less intelligent than his other women. Even though she looked fragile and delicate, she was currently a Seven Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master. Ordinary women could not be compared to her in terms of her physical qualities. His mellowness complementing her tenderness allowed Zhou Weiqing to thoroughly enjoy his luck in romance. He was glowing with vigor despite all the activities of the previous night.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hey, cut it out. I only slept for a bit before you started bothering me again.” Little Witch buried her head into his embrace - she did not dare to look directly at him.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing chucked and said, “You little alluring minx - you seduced me, how can you blame me?”</p>
 <p>“Who seduced you? Mmmph! ——” Little Witch looked up, feeling rather unhappy, but in the next moment her red lips were sealed with a kiss once again by Zhou Weiqing. However, her eyes were already wide open.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing sensed something amiss and let go of her, “What’s wrong, Yuehan?”</p>
 <p>Wu Yuehan looked at the brightly-lit room and said in shock, “It’s already morning. Oh no, they are still waiting for me to go back! What am I gonna do! It’s all your fault.”</p>
 <p>As she spoke, she threw a few punches onto his sturdy chest and flipped over before getting dressed, in preparation to leave.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You silly girl, it’s already daybreak. You think they will wait for you till daybreak?” Zhou Weiqing held her back - even if he did naughty things without sleep or rest for a month, his tough body would not be exhausted. He was still not fully satisfied.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Little Witch looked at him pitifully and said, “Let me go, dear husband. If I don’t go back, they will definitely get mad at me.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s heart itched the moment he heard her say ‘dear husband’, but ultimately he still let go of her. At this moment he started fantasizing -<em>&nbsp;in the future, I’m going to custom-make a huge bed where I can sleep with all of them together. Hehe, I wonder how would that feel?</em></p>
 <p>Little Witch ran back towards her room, but before she entered she ran into Tian’er.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Tian’er looked cheekily at her before laughing in a lowered voice, “Too busy indulging in pleasure and forgot to come back? We waited for you till really late, you know.”</p>
 <p>Little Witch felt rather embarrassed and said, “I…I am going to sleep, I’m sorry.” The current her no longer had any intention to compete against Tian’er. Tian’er already had Zhou Weiqing’s child, and both Zhou Weiqing and her were cultivating Saint Energy. &nbsp;She had inevitably become the highest ranking one among the five women.</p>
 <p>Tian’er laughed to herself, then pushed her into the room. “You wait here, I will call the others to come over.”</p>
 <p>In a bit, all three Shangguan sisters were called over.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er was rather restrained, but Shangguan Fei’er asked impatiently, “Little Witch, how was it? Was it effective?”</p>
 <p>Little Witch spaced out for a bit before responding with a blushed face, “I…I forgot all about that. Wait a moment.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Last night was too wild, she had truly forgotten to attune her senses to the whole experience of their deed. She had only felt as though she was in a small boat in a perilous situation, constantly being thrown around, going back and forth between the peaks and the valleys. She only recalled her mission pertaining to the experiment when she heard Shangguan Fei’er’s question.</p>
 <p>With but a thought, Little Witch caused her surroundings to immediately light up. A layer of faint reddish golden light emitted from her body.</p>
 <p>“Ah? What is this?” Little Witch was astonished to find her Heavenly Energy had became thicker and purer. The presence of the energy was so massive, she was completely caught off guard.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Following the release of the Heavenly Energy, her seven Personal Core Jewels were also released.</p>
 <p>“There are still seven!” Shangguan Fei’er was rather disappointed and regretful.</p>
 <p>However, in the next moment, Little Witch’s body underwent some changes. Under the infusion of the reddish golden Heavenly Energy, her seven Personal Core Jewels all became reddish gold in color. Immediately, Little Witch’s facial expression changed. She sat cross-legged on the ground, overwhelmed by panic as the reddish golden energy enveloping her body vigorously rippled. All her Personal Core Jewels were full of radiance, and their dense Life, Darkness and Evil auras were flashing alternately.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The other four women had a higher cultivation base compared to Little Witch - they could clearly see that Little Witch’s cultivation base was increasing rapidly.</p>
 <p>“It really works?” Shangguan Xue’er and Fei’er looked at each other. Shock could be seen on both their faces.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Nevertheless, Tian’er had the greatest understanding with regards to Zhou Weiqing’s abilities. She laughed out loud and said, “Of course it works. That bastard’s Astral Saint Energy has already evolved into Nebula Saint Energy. He would never be stingy when it comes to us. In truth, he didn’t need to do much; he only needed to change all of the Heavenly Energy within Yuehan’s body into the evolved Nebula Saint Energy. Given the pureness and density of his Saint Energy, Little Witch’s cultivation base would naturally undergo a change. This time, the increase in her cultivation base has been quite significant.”</p>
 <p>“Didn’t I already tell you guys yesterday? What he said was correct. If you were to unify physically with him, you would stand to benefit greatly by the confluence of yin and yang. It is really possible to make a direct break through to the Heavenly King Stage. To put it simply, our Little Fatty is the best tonic in the world. I have also thought things through now - if we want to stop him from picking up other women, we have to join forces and constantly keep him satisfied. Who’s going tonight?” After asking that question, Tian’er had a cheeky look on her face. She went next to Fei’er’s ear and chuckled softly, “Why don’t you two go together? Little Fatty is rather aggressive in this area. Since you both are inexperienced, I’m afraid you guys cannot handle it by yourself.”</p>
 <p>“Tian’er, you’re too naughty……”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Of course, Zhou Weiqing was unaware of what the five women were talking about. In fact, he did not intentionally do anything, but when someone engaged in physical intimacy with him, she would be naturally affected by his Nebula Saint Energy. All the trace amounts of Saint Energy in the world were constantly refining Zhou Weiqing’s body, even when he was doing nothing but breathing. And when he was passionately engaging in intimate activities with Little Witch, the Nebula Saint Energy would naturally enter Little Witch’s body as well, assimilating and converting the Heavenly Energy within her body. Additionally, last night, Little Witch had absorbed much of Zhou Weiqing’s ‘essence’. After a full night of activities, her whole body naturally became filled with Nebula Saint Energy.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, one must not forget that Little Witch and the three Shangguan sisters were different in the sense that she possessed the Saint Attribute. Even though her Evil Attribute was not complete, the foundation of the Saint Attribute still existed within it. Hence, accepting Zhou Weiqing’s Nebula Saint Energy was much easier.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After washing up, Zhou Weiqing went to look for the five women to have breakfast. Little did he expect to find an empty room - the five women were not there, and he had no idea where they went or what they were doing.</p>
