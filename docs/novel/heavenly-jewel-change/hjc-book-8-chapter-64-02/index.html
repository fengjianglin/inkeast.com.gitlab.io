 <p><b>Chapter 64 Fei Li Battle Team (2)</b></p>
 <p>The five of them were all dressed in a dark green, tight fitting outfit. Amongst them, the one right in the middle, ahead of the pack, had a gold lining around his clothes, while the others had a silver lining embroidered around. Around their left chest, there was a small gold symbol of the Cross Sword, about the size of an egg, and the entire attire gave them a valiant, inspiring look.</p>
 <p>Among the five, the most eye-catching one was the person right on the left. That person was almost two metres tall, wide shoulders and solid looking, with a pair of huge hands that was just so striking. The crux of the matter was that this huge person was actually a girl, the only girl among the five!</p>
 <p>If we were to talk about looks, this female student was definitely not ugly. In fact, the opposite was true. She had a pair of large eyes, and a soft, gentle well rounded face, with well defined and good looking features. However, when you took into account her immense body, that was rather shocking. That figure could not be called voluptuous, perhaps the word explosive would do it justice.</p>
 <p>Without question, this female student was the one which drew the most attention, however Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er’s gaze did not stay on her for long before they turned their gaze away, instantly landing on the leading person right in the middle. That was because, this was a person they actually recognized! It was Lin TianAo, the Five-Jeweled Ultimate Defense Heavenly Jewel Master with the five-Jeweled Assembly Set Consolidated Equipment who had bet with Zhou Weiqing and Yun Li… and lost!</p>
 <p>“Why is it him?” Shangguan Bing’er couldn’t help but cry out in surprise.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing quickly turned to her, motioning to her, and she immediately calmed down, keeping quiet.</p>
 <p>Ye Paopao looked at them curiously and said: “You recognize them? These five should be the main members of the our empire’s Heavenly Jewel Tournament battle team.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “I have seen the one in the middle once before, could it be he is the leader of the team?”</p>
 <p>By now, Lin TianAo had led the other four and walked to them. Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing'er had recognized him, and he had naturally also recognized them, and was currently staring a little dazedly at them. As both sides got closer, out of the other four members, only the female student looked at them interestedly, while the other three just looked bored and uncaring.</p>
 <p>As Lin TianAo stopped, Ye Paopao headed in front to greet him. “Hello, my name is Ye Paopao. The three of us are the representatives from the Fei Li Military Academy and will be joining you in attending the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. Please do take care of us.”</p>
 <p>Lin TianAo nodded and extended his right hand to Ye Paopao as he said: “Welcome.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned at him and said: “The Heavenly Jewel Tournament is the thing you mentioned you had to handle for three months?”</p>
 <p>Lin TianAo nodded and said: “You are actually a student of the Fei Li Military Academy?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: “Indeed, I’m the monitor of commoner class one, Zhou Weiqing. Hello everyone.”</p>
 <p>Lin TianAo’s mouth twitched a little as he thought to himself - <i>Not only is he from the Fei Li Military Academy, but only Year One? With that talent and cultivation level, why didn’t he join the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy instead! </i>Alas, no matter what, a loss was a loss, and he could do nothing about it.</p>
 <p>Another huge, well built student standing next to Lin TianAo said curiously: “Leader, you know him?”</p>
 <p>Lin TianAo nodded, and was about to open his mouth, but Zhou Weiqing quickly said: “I was lucky to meet Leader Lin briefly a few days back in the Trade Center.” As he said that, he quickly gave Lin TianAo a subtle signal.</p>
 <p>Although Lin TianAo did not know why Zhou Weiqing wanted to keep their connection hidden, he was more than happy to comply. After all, this Heavenly Jewel Tournament was extremely important to him, and he did not want anything to possibly affect it adversely.</p>
 <p>Giving Zhou Weiqing a deep meaningful look, Lin TianAo said: “Let me introduce everyone.” As he said that, he pointed to the ‘large beauty’, and said: “This is Crow, 21 years old, and also our only first year student in the team. She has only joined our academy this year, and has an extremely powerful Strength Attribute. Upper level Shi Heavenly Jewel Master, 3-Jewels.”</p>
 <p>Crow? For a girl to have such a name, Zhou Weiqing was rather surprised. Although he loved beauties, with her sheer size, she just wasn’t his type.</p>
 <p>Crow smiled and said: “Hello everyone.” Her voice was deeper than most girls, but had a unique quality about it.</p>
 <p>Next, Lin TianAo pointed to the person standing beside Crow, a skinny youth who had such a huge contrast in stature with her, only 1.5 metres tall. “We all call him Little Four, you can all call him that too. Lower Level Zun Stage Heavenly Jewel Master, Four-Jewels.”</p>
 <p>Little Four did not say anything, just grinning as he swept his gaze across the three of them, and instantly all three of them felt a chill, as if having been locked on by a venomous snake.</p>
 <p>Lin TianAo then pointed to the large fellow who had asked him the question earlier. “This is Ah Bao, we all call him Drunken Bao. Besides an over- strong love for his beers, he doesn’t have any other flaws. Mid Level Zun stage Heavenly Jewel Master, Five-Jewels.”</p>
 <p>Next was the last student, who did not have any particularly outstanding features, with an ordinary face, ordinary stature. His eyes seemed emotionless, and he stood there like a wooden block. “Xiao Yan [1. Little Fire], Mid Level Zun stage Heavenly Jewel Master, Five-Jewels.”</p>
 <p>Finally, he gave a self introduction. “My name is Lin TianAo, and I’ll be the team leader for this Tournament’s Fei Li Battle Team.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing listened to his introduction quietly, at the same time observing the five in front of him. He found that besides Lin TianAo, the person who gave him the most dangerous feeling was the one called Xiao Yan. Although he seemed emotionless, he gave Zhou Weiqing a feeling like he was melded with the surroundings. Such a person might seem very normal, but was usually one of the most dangerous sorts.</p>
 <p>Lin TianAo narrowed his eyes, a brilliant light shooting forth from them as he said solemnly: “Without any exaggeration, it can be said that this is possibly the strongest battle team ever fielded by our Academy. Our goal is simple, to enter the top four.”</p>
 <p>If previously Zhou Weiqing and Ye Paopao had some thoughts regarding the competency of the main team members, after seeing the five and listening to Lin TianAo’s introductions, they knew that these five were definitely extraordinary. There wasn’t much else to say about the five-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters, for someone of less than thirty years of age to reach such a cultivation level, that just showed their power and talent! As for that Four-Jeweled Little Four, just from his stature, he was probably an agility or speed type with an extremely talent in that area. As for Crow, being able to represent the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy at just a Three-Jeweled cultivation level, she must have something special to offer as well.</p>
 <p>As the leader of the Fei Li Military Academy team members, Ye Paopao quickly said: “Hello everyone, we are pleased to meet you all. We’re from the Fei Li Military Academy, and I’ll do a quick introduction as well. This is Zhou Weiqing, High Level Shi Heavenly Jewel Master, three Jewels. This is Shangguan Bing’er… uhh… Lady Bing’er, I’m afraid I do not know what your cultivation level is?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er smiled and said: “I also have three-Jewels, High Level Shi Heavenly Jewel Master.”</p>
 <p>Ye Paopao nodded and said: “As for myself, I’m Ye Paopao, four-Jewels, Lower Level Zun Stage Heavenly Jewel Master. For the next three months, we will be following you all to attend the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, please do take care of us.”</p>
 <p>The skinny student called Little Four twisted his mouth in scorn and said: “Do not need to speak such pretty words, you all are just substitutes, mostly here to watch the fights, and not to join in. Know your own positions, and do not cause trouble for us.”</p>
 <p>A cold light entered Ye Paopao’s eyes as his gaze hardened. He was after all the leader of the noble students, and was also the grandson of the Prime Minister of the Fei Li Empire, and he had never been looked down upon like that before. He had already been extremely polite and patient, but Little Four’s words were extremely provoking. If he continued holding back, he wouldn’t be Ye Paopao, the future leader of the Ye Family.</p>
 <p>“We know our own positions well enough, and we’re not here to try to fight with you or snatch any glory. However, do remember, we are also here to represent the Fei Li Military Empire. Perhaps our fighting capabilities might not be as strong as you all, but as a soldier, if you continue insulting us, then we will be mortal enemies.”</p>
 <p>Ye Paopao said the last few words resolutely, in a steely tone, as the aura of a noble used to being in charge extended out.</p>
 <p>This was also the first time that Zhou Weiqing had seen Ye Paopao like that, and he nodded inwardly to himself. This Ye Paopao was indeed not to be trifled with, just that pressure from his aura alone, that was not something any ordinary person could withstand.</p>
 <p>Little Four’s expression changed. “Hmph, mortal enemies, I’d like to see…” Just as he said, he was interrupted by Lin TianAo’s severe glare.</p>
 <p>Lin TianAo said solemnly: “No matter main team or substitute, from this moment onwards, we are now teammates and companions. We need to work together to reach our goal, and I will definitely not allow any infighting to cause any problems for us.”</p>
 <p>Little Four glanced at Ye Paopao once more, his eyes full of cold disdain.</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, Zhou Weiqing suddenly spoke out lazily. Yawning, he walked over to Ye Paopao’s side. At that point, his appearance was nothing to be praised about. Although he had washed up and changed to a fresh set of clothing, there was no hiding the gaunt look and dark circles around his eyes. He had not slept for the last few days, and his spirit and energy was extremely low.</p>
 <p>“Leader Lin, before leaving, I have a question to ask you.” Zhou Weiqing stretched lazily as he turned to Lin TianAo and asked.</p>
 <p>Lin TianAo’s gaze turned to him. After losing to Zhou Weiqing, he had been in a rather bad mood the last few days, but could do nothing about it. After all, he already had the seal, and there was no way of breaking it. Attending this Heavenly Jewel Tournament could be said to be his last wish before joining Zhou Weiqing and keeping his promise, who knew he would meet this rascal here again. Towards Zhou Weiqing’s scheming, he was rather afraid, especially afraid he would ruin their Tournament chances this time. Hearing his words, he immediately asked solemnly: “What question?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “I just wanted to ask, is the determining of main team members and substitute members a matter of power and strength? If a main team member is weaker than the substitute… should there be a swap of positions?”</p>
