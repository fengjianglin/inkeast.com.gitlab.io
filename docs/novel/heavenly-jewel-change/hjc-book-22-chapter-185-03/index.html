 <p><b>Chapter 185 If you lose, marry me! (3)</b></p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er was just too naive. In terms of interpersonal interaction, she was far worse than Shangguan Fei’er.</p>
 <p>“What do you say then?” She subconsciously thought that Zhou Weiqing’s words did make some sense, and she actually asked out loud.</p>
 <p>How could Zhou Weiqing not seize such a perfect opportunity? All this while, he had been talking nonsense to Shangguan Xue’er for a simple reason - to delay time. No one else knew how terrifying Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy recovery speed was. With just his Dragon-Tiger Transformation wings and his Immortal Deity Technique circulating at max speed, his recovery rate would truly shock the entire world. In just a matter of their short conversation so far, he had already recovered another ten percent of his energy. Naturally, he did not mind continuing speaking more. At the same time, Shangguan Xue’er was still dressed in her Boundless Infinitum Set Consolidated Equipment, and instead of recovering Heavenly Energy, it was still draining from her… or at the very least an equilibrium that did not allow her to recover. With such a contrast, Zhou Weiqing’s current severe disadvantage could possibly be reversed!</p>
 <p>“Hmmm…. This… Well....” Zhou Weiqing looked to be deep in thought, and after some musing, he finally said: “How about this? You three sisters are triplets, and your relationship is so strong between each other. In the future, if Bing’er and Fei’er both marry me, you will be left alone. I will feel really bad about that. If I defeat you, why don’t you just marry me as well? How about that? Betting your future against my life… that is a fair trade right?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er truly wanted to give him a piece of her mind! Fair trade my foot! However, at this point, her mind was not even in a fully clear state. All she wanted to do was to get Zhou Weiqing down as quickly as possible and give him a savage beating before talking about anything else. Furthermore, he did not even have his own Legendary Set any longer, how could he possibly defeat her?!</p>
 <p>Of course, this was also because Shangguan Xue’er did not know Zhou Weiqing well enough. If it were Shangguan Bing’er or Shangguan Fei’er here right now, they would never bet with him. That rascal, when had he ever lost out in a bet? Would he ever come up with a bet that he had no confidence in winning? The answer was clear - a huge no! Alas, Shangguan Xue’er had slowly fallen in Zhou Weiqing’s trap.</p>
 <p>“Fine. I agree. Come down here and accept your death then!” Shangguan Xue’er cried out angrily.</p>
 <p>It was actually Zhou Weiqing’s turn to be surprised. Originally, he had planned to give such an absurd terms of betting that Shangguan Xue’er would be enraged and argue with him further, letting him have more time to recover. He had not expected that it would actually backfire, and Shangguan Xue’er would just agree like that… not leaving him with any more time!</p>
 <p>“You really said it yourself? Will you really live up to your words?” Zhou Weiqing asked tentatively.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er was no fool, as she saw the cunning light in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, she instantly knew that this rascal was up to no good. At the same time, she quickly saw that Zhou Weiqing was doing his best to recover his Heavenly Energy, which was why she agreed so quickly. She planned to end this fight quickly, not giving him anymore time to recover.</p>
 <p>“I, Shangguan Xue’er, swear to the heavens. If today, Zhou Weiqing can defeat the Boundless Infinitum Sword in my hands, I will marry him. If I break my vow, may lightning descend from the heavens and destroy me body and soul, so that I will be cast out from the reincarnation cycle.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er’s vow was vicious indeed, but short and sweet. In barely a moment, she had finished it, and she turned a disdainful and provoking gaze to Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was after all a man. With Shangguan Xue’er already agreeing so quickly to his absurd terms, how could he possibly continue running away and stay in the sky? He knew that if he really continued to fly in the air to finish recovering his Heavenly Energy, Shangguan Xue’er would forever hold him in contempt, and who knows if she might even start using any secret arts to recover her own Heavenly Energy… and what the final result would be from that again.</p>
 <p>Gritting his teeth, Zhou Weiqing descended from the skies, landing not far from Shangguan Xue’er. His expression was grave, but he crooked his finger at her and said solemnly: “Come then.”</p>
 <p>Seeing that he was really back on the ground, Shangguan Xue’er did not hesitate any longer. In a flash, the Boundless Infinitum Sword in her hands had pierced out towards him. At this point, Zhou Weiqing no longer had his ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set, and it was without question that his fighting capabilities had dropped drastically, no longer with that terrifying physical strength. With her own powerful sword intent, though she had now swapped to her left hand, Shangguan Xue’er still had absolute confidence in defeating ZHou Weiqing quickly.</p>
 <p>In an instant, the Boundless Infinitum Sword had reached Zhou Weiqing, striking out at his right chest.</p>
 <p>Seeing the Boundless Infinitum Sword strike out at him, a faint smile appeared on Zhou Weiqing’s face. It was not a mocking one indeed, but one with a hint of appreciation and gratitude. No matter what her words were, even in such an angry state, Shangguan Xue’er’s actions showed that she was not truly trying to kill him. Otherwise, that sword would be aimed at his left chest, not the right.</p>
 <p>Taking a deep breath, Zhou Weiqing’s entire expression was grave and serious. However, to Shangguan Xue’er’s surprise, as her sword pierced right in front of Zhou Weiqing, he did not make any move to dodge at all.</p>
 <p>With a sickening thud, the Boundless Infinitum Sword pierced right into Zhou Weiqing’s body, shoving right through his chest. Yet, Zhou Weiqing’s only action was to suddenly raise both hands, grabbing onto the blade with his bare hands!</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er was totally caught by surprise. When her sword had pierced right through Zhou Weiqing, she had already been shocked and dazed. No matter what, she had not expected that he would not even make an attempt to dodge.</p>
 <p>It was not that she felt any heartache for Zhou Weiqing, after all she was still hating that fellow. However, just like what Zhou Weiqing said, no matter what he was still her future brother in law! It was concerning both her sisters’ future happiness. Both Shangguan Bing’er and Shangguan Fei’er loved Zhou Weiqing so much, and if she killed him with that single sword pierce, how could she account it to her sisters?!</p>
 <p>As such, when the sword in her hands pierced through Zhou Weiqing’s right chest, she was totally dumbfounded. She did not realise that as the sword pierced through, there was no blood at all. At this point, Zhou Weiqing’s hands suddenly grabbed onto her Boundless Infinitum Sword. Instantly, a terrifying suction force drew upon Shangguan Xue’er through the Boundless Infinitum Sword.</p>
 <p>Demonic Attribute - Devour Skill!</p>
 <p>Indeed, it was the Devour Skill that Zhou Weiqing had not had a chance to use all this while.</p>
 <p>When Zhou Weiqing reached the six-Jeweled cultivation level, his Devour Skill was already able to begin Devouring his opponent’s Heavenly Energy even with a small distance, instead of the previous requirement of having to touch his opponent. In fact, against a much weaker opponent, his suction force was strong enough to just drag it to his hands to Devour. Of course, it was without a question that a direct touch was still the most effective for Devouring. Furthermore, unless the opponent’s cultivation level was far above Zhou Weiqing’s, otherwise once he touched the opponent, then the Devour Skill was so strong that it could turn the tides of battle.</p>
 <p>As soon as Shangguan Xue’er felt the strong Devour Skill burst out abruptly at her, she instantly realised what Zhou Weiqing’s plan had been. However, she had not expected that he would be so savage to himself, actually using his own body to take a sword right through his chest just to gain an opportunity to activate such a Skill.</p>
 <p><i>What do I do? What do I do?</i> In Shangguan Xue’er’s eyes, as long as vibrated the Boundless Infinitum Sword with her power, she could easily cut through Zhou Weiqing’s hands and kill him off. However, if she really did that, that would also be killing off her sisters’ happiness!</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was gripping onto the Boundless Infinitum Sword so tightly that without cutting through his hands, or even slicing them off, she could not possibly free the sword. In terms of raw physical strength, Shangguan Xue’er was no match for Zhou Weiqing, and the only way she could end the fight on her own terms was to totally destroy Zhou Weiqing’s hands and possibly kill him. However, Shangguan Xue’er could not bring herself to do so!</p>
 <p>Without question, the rascal Zhou Weiqing was fully making use of Shangguan Xue’er’s kindness. As Mu En’s disciple, being so shameless was of extremely ease to our dear Zhou Little Fatty. With such a good method to use, why not use it? So what if it was shameless? Ordinarily speaking, beauties always fell for the bad boys after all, and the good guys would stay single! Shangguan Xue’er had already sworn such an oath, as long as he could gain this eldest sister as well, heh heh, the Heaven’s Expanse Palace would not be able to stop him in the future! More importantly, this was the only way he could see to get out of this current mess, and if he did not do so properly, how could he face up to Tian’er as well?</p>
 <p>Seeing that strange smile on Zhou Weiqing’s lips, Shangguan Xue’er snarled angrily: “Let go, otherwise I will cut off your hands!”</p>
 <p>As she said that, she gave a gentle vibration in the Boundless Infinitum Sword. However, Zhou Weiqing continued holding on tight, as if the Boundless Infinitum Sword was not cutting into his flesh.</p>
 <p>At that moment, only then did Shangguan Xue’er see blood starting to flow from Zhou Weiqing’s hands and chest. However, there was no hint of him slowing down or stopping the Devour Skill. In the series of fights, Shangguan Xue’er had already used quite a lot of Heavenly Energy, and currently as she was being Devoured by Zhou Weiqing, she felt a sense of weakness wash over her. She was clear that if this continued any longer, she would truly be losing.</p>
 <p>“You… despicable!” Shangguan Xue’er said hatefully.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “My Lady Xue’er, what is being shameless or despicable? In this world, the victor is the king, he is the one who writes the history books. Come on then, kill me! You only have two choices now… to kill me off or to marry me. Take your pick. Sigh… Bing’er, Fei’er, let us see how your big sister chooses. There is not much time left… I estimate about ten seconds more before I Devour enough Heavenly Energy to overcome you. Let me help you countdown. Ten… Nine…”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er almost fainted from sheer anger. This shameless… despicable… rascal!!! She glared angrily at Zhou Weiqing, and in that moment, she actually let go of the Boundless Infinitum Sword, breaking free from his Devour Skill.</p>
