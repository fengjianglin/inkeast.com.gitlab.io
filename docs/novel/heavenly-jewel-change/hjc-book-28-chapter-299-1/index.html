<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Zhou Weiqing furrowed his brows, “How much more can I raise my cultivation base?”</p>
 <p>The Sidhe Empress said, “Even though it is impossible for Fen Tian to raise his cultivation base up to the Lord of the Nether’s level, his Destruction Energy will definitely become a lot purer. The only thing that can restrain the Destruction Energy is your Saint Energy. Hence, you definitely have to cultivate your Saint Energy to reach a level of purity that is higher than that of his Destruction Energy. Or else, no one else would be able to go against him. Don’t worry, I will help you. I believe that the final victory belongs to us.”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing the Sidhe Empress’ words, Zhou Weiqing had calmed down a little. Rays of light flickered and the Astral Celestial Territory appeared once again, hovering in the sky above the Demon God’s head. The bright starlight illuminated, making the Demon God, that was initially full of demonic aura, appeared to be more divine.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Ah——” A mournful and high-pitched sound was heard from where the Destruction God was. Under the purplish black light, the Destruction God’s figure suddenly became more distorted. Immediately after, his massive body began trembling violently.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A large hand appeared from the void. A terrifying suction force had suddenly erupted in mid-air.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>What is Fen Tian trying to do?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing, who was preparing to take action, was shocked. What he was most worried about was that Fen Tian would launch an attack towards the members of the Peerless Sect in his current state. They were his comrades and loved ones!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Zhou Weiqing’s worries were unnecessary. Below, ten figures soared up into the sky at the same time due to the huge suction power. However, they were not from the Peerless Sect; neither were they from the Heavenly Snow Mountain or the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. They were the Blood Red Hell powerhouses.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Amongst the ten Blood Red Hell powerhouses, six of them did not have any consciousness - they only had combat abilities; the other four were sentient. The moment they soared into the sky, a layer of dark purple light had appeared around their bodies. However, as compared to the Destruction God, the light around them was a lot duller.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>What is Fen Tian trying to do?</em></p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing stared and scrutinized - he noticed that the Blood Red Hell powerhouses that were being absorbed into the sky had a shocked look on their faces. Clearly, this was not something that Fen Tian had planned beforehand.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the next moment, Zhou Weiqing was aware of Fen Tian’s objective.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pff pff pff pff pff pff pff…… A series of strange sounds was heard. The moment the Blood Red Hell powerhouses flew into the area covered by the purple light around the Destruction God, they exploded into clouds of bloody mist. At the same time, their Heavenly Core Nucleus had exploded as well, before transforming into balls of purplish black light merging with the enormous ball of light. Because of the merging of the small light balls, the Destruction Demon’s body to become more faded - only the huge palm continued to absorb the mist below it.</p>
 <p>He was absorbing the powerhouses who possessed the Destruction Attribute into his own body! Who would have expected Fen Tian to resort to such a vicious trick? It was no wonder that he wanted to wait till this moment to use it - making a choice as such when he was trapped in a situation where he had no other options. Furthermore, after absorbing these powerhouses that were at least of the Heavenly King Stage and possessed the Destruction Energy, his power would definitely increase significantly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, the Demon God’s body had also lit up. Just like what the Sidhe Empress had mentioned earlier, Zhou Weiqing could not wait any longer. Once Fen Tian was done merging with all the powerhouses, who would be able to stop him?</p>
 <p>A light ball, that was mixed with both whitish golden and yellowish golden light, orbited on the Demon God’s chest. The light of the Astral Celestial Territory above his head immediately became richer. The enormous nebula that was formed by countless starlight started rotating violently. The dazzling luster shone on the Demon God’s body, making it look exceptionally clear.</p>
 <p>The Demon God stretched out both arms and did a grabbing movement, in a bid to absorb things from below. Immediately after, balls of light below starting lighting up before flying towards the Demon God.</p>
 <p>The Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley powerhouses were in a state of panic. Fen Tian, who was in the sky, continued to absorb and within moments, dozens of powerhouses had turned into bloody mists, vanishing into the void. They did not die in the hands of the enemy - instead, they died in the hands of their own comrade. How was it possible for them not to panic? Amongst them, the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley powerhouses that were controlling the non-sentient ancestors made these ancestors rise to the sky and get absorbed by Fen Tian first. However, the Destruction God’s huge hand seemed like the most greedy and frightening of demons - it had no intention of stopping.</p>
 <p>Originally, both sides were already evenly matched on the battlefield. Such a sudden and unexpected situation ha caused the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley powerhouses to be in chaos.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>How could Xue AoTian, Shangguan Xue’er, Dongfang Hanyue, etc. let such an opportunity go? They tested waters first - once they had confirmed that the suction force of the Destruction God’s huge hand had no effect on them, they immediately launched an all-around counterattack. For a moment, the Blood Red Hell and the Passion Valley suffered a crushing defeat. At the start, they managed to somewhat defend themselves with much difficulty; after the Destruction huge hand continued to absorb them one by one, they ultimately were unable to resist any longer and immediately turned into birds and beasts, fleeing in all directions. Each of them soared to the sky, wanting to escape.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, they had forgotten something - the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain had already been enveloped by the Destruction Celestial Territory. If Fen Tian did not allow them to leave, was it even possible for them to leave?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The entire battlefield was in a state of chaos. Even though the sky might be calm, amidst the serenity, a crisis could happen any time, and that was even more terrifying in comparison.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>On Fen Tian’s side, he was merging with his subordinates that he had absorbed. Whereas for Zhou Weiqing’s Demon God, although it was doing something similar, he did not kill anyone. Instead, it was taking in the Heavenly Core Nuclei, channeling them into the Astral Celestial Territory. Indeed, it was the Astral Feedback.</p>
 <p>Earlier on, Zhou Weiqing had already killed off a few of the enemy’s powerhouses, and the number of powerhouses that had died on the battlefield was rather significant as well. Fen Tian needed to absorb powerhouses that were still alive, whereas Zhou Weiqing only needed to absorb the Nucleus Core.</p>
 <p>For a moment, the Demon God and the Destruction God had immersed themselves within their respective light at the same time - the Creation and Destruction light flickered symphonically, continuously releasing rays of dazzling radiance.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Weiqing, catch this.” The Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya swung his right hand and a ray of light flew up into the sky - it was the Heavenly Core Nucleus of Shen Mo, who he had killed earlier on.</p>
 <p>Before arriving there, Zhou Weiqing had informed his comrades to seize the Heavenly Core Nucleus of the enemies they had killed, and give it to him when it was needed. Right now he had already reached the Max Level Heavenly Emperor Stage; even so, it was not an easy feat for him to make a breakthrough to the Heavenly God Stage, even though he possessed the Saint Energy. However, as long as he was able to obtain sufficient Heavenly Core Nuclei and carried out the Astral Feedback, the chances for him to make a breakthrough were naturally a lot greater. The greatest advantage of possessing the Saint Energy was that he did not have to worry about the possibility of rebound, or that his foundation was unstable.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just as the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain was in chaos, and while Zhou Weiqing and Fen Tian were each building their power and strength, suddenly, intense energy ripples appeared within the Boundless Infinitum Formation.</p>
 <p>The dream-like white misty clouds seemed to have dispersed in an instant; a hundred odd figures had scattered all over, shooting in all directions at the fastest speed possible.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Brother Xue, let’s go. Quickly.” Shangguan Tianyang’s voice erupted in the air. The energy ripples, that were already quite intense, exploded even more as a result of the misty clouds being spread out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Huang Xingyun and Yun Ruoyu stood silently on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain. They held each other’s hands with a calm look in their eyes. However, on both their chests, a ball of bright purple light was slowly spreading out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The moment Xue AoTian heard Shangguan Tianyang’s voice, the first thing he did was to turn his head around and looked over. When he saw what happened, he was overwhelmed with shocked. He grabbed Tian’er with his right hand and fled in an instant.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They were about to self-detonate.</p>
 <p>Indeed, Huang Xingyun and Yun Ruoyu were about to self-detonate. They had absolutely no way to deal with the Boundless Infinitum Formation, especially after they had been severely injured by the collision between the the sidhe and the two dragons. They could not hold on any longer.</p>
 <p>The speed at which the Tenebrous Demon Dragon was going at, with Dongfang Hanyue on its back, was faster than that of Xue AoTian’s - the moment the&nbsp;Boundless Infinitum Formation had collapsed, it had immediately leapt up and escaped.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er grabbed both her sisters with each of her hand, activating her Wings of the Wind God with all her might. She was not any slower than the Tenebrous Demon Dragon.</p>
 <p>The only people that the Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya could take care of were naturally the Peerless Sect members. He had also swiftly escaped. Similarly, the powerhouses of the Heavenly Snow Mountain had displayed their respective remarkable abilities, escaping as fast as they could.</p>
 <p>Just as everyone was escaping in all directions, as though they had encountered the god of plague, the two individuals who were holding each other’s hands slowly turned around and faced each other.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Xingyun, why are you doing this?” Yun Ruoyu looked distressingly at her husband, while her right hand was gently caressing Huang Xingyun’s face. Earlier on, she had taken the initiative to detonate her Heavenly Core Nucleus, in order to give her husband a chance to live.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“You fool. We have been a couple for almost a hundred years - we have never left each other’s side. No matter how much I desire to rule over the world, without you by my side, what’s the point?” Huang Xingyun held his wife’s hand that was caressing his face.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the Passion Valley’s Valley Master no longer had any sinister or ruthless look in his eyes - only endless love for his wife.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Since we can’t lead a grand life, let us die magnificently. Ruoyu, we will still be together after death. In our next life, I still want to be with you.”</p>
 <p>Yun Ruoyu slowly closed her eyes. She could clearly sense that she could not control the Heavenly Core Nucleus within her body from detonating. If they did it for the sake of killing the enemy, they should not stop at all. However, at this time, they were full of reluctance. Not reluctance to leave this world, but reluctance to part with each other. They looked at each other for a moment more - even though they had spent a hundred years together, at this moment, they still could not get enough of each other. No matter how strongly their faces were imprinted within each other’s hearts, this was a fine ending!</p>
 <p>The peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain had become empty in almost an instant - everyone had fled as far as they could while Huang Xingyun and Yun Ruoyu were trying their best to restrain the energy within their bodies that was about to explode.</p>
 <p>Right here, there was nothing but their gazes that was full of deep love for each other. This was the end of their love story, but some might say that this was a new beginning.&nbsp;</p>
