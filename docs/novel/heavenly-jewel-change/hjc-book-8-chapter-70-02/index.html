 <p><b>Chapter 70 Let me be the mainstay (2)</b></p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “Come on then! My Physical Jewel is also the Strength Attribute. We’re both at the three-Jeweled cultivation level, why not compete?”</p>
 <p>Little Four laughed heartily and said: “Weiqing, you are asking for trouble? Isn’t it just a tournament? Crow’s legendary hammers… even boss will get a headache!”</p>
 <p>Right at point, Lin TianAo suddenly spoke out. “Crow, go ahead. Compete with him.”</p>
 <p>“Ahh?” Everyone looked at Lin TianAo with surprise.</p>
 <p>In truth, Zhou Weiqing’s analysis had really tempted Lin TianAo. Just like what Zhou Weiqing had thought, this Heavenly Jewel Tournament was extremely important to Lin TianAo, and could be said to be his goal these last few years. Three years ago, when he had attended the Tournament for the first time, he had been left with an extremely deep impression. The next three years he had spent working his heart out, all so that he could once again ascend the stage and bring honour to the Fei Li Empire.</p>
 <p>Crow stood up slowly, looking at Lin TianAo curiously: “Leader, are you sure? Although he has some meat on him, but… to compete in strength with me…”</p>
 <p>*Poooh* Ye Paopao had been drinking water at that time, and he spat out a whole mouthful in laughter, his mouth twitching. “What do you mean, has some meat on him…”</p>
 <p>Lin TianAo smiled faintly and said: “I have my reasons for doing so, just try for yourself and find out.”</p>
 <p>As they spoke, all of a sudden, Crow lifted her right hand, striking out towards Zhou Weiqing abruptly.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was close by to her, and with her height, she barely needed to take a step before reaching him.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing did not dodge, instead swiftly stepping to the left with his left foot, bending down in a slight crouch as he positioned himself. With a low grunt, he also lifted his right hand, fingers spread out as he received Crow’s hand with his own.</p>
 <p>Their palms struck together with a meaty slap, and their fingers interlocked tightly.</p>
 <p>Everyone’s gaze fell upon the two, as they silently watched the struggle.</p>
 <p>Crow had absolute confidence in her strength, and grabbing onto Zhou Weiqing’s hand, she pulled hard, thinking to fling his entire body up.</p>
 <p>“En?” As soon as she exerted strength, a look of surprise appeared on her face. Despite her pulling, Zhou Weiqing did not budge at all, his right hand steady as bedrock, with nary a motion.</p>
 <p>As a member of the Gold Crow Tribe, and an outstanding one, Crow had a terrifying strength. Although she had pulled rather casually, it was already more than several thousand jin of power. This was more because of her own estimation of Zhou Weiqing’s capabilities as a three-Jeweled Strength Heavenly Jewel Master.</p>
 <p>Regarding Crow’s surprise, Zhou Weiqing’s mouth twitched upwards in a small smile.</p>
 <p>Crow’s competitive spirit was aroused, and she shoved her right leg firmly on the ground as a pivot, shouting out: “Come here!” Her entire body rippled as she focused her strength, her right arm flexing as she pulled back hard in a burst of power.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing also gave a low shout, his eyes glittering as the muscles of his entire body tightened, his arm muscles taut as his entire power was focused on his right hand.</p>
 <p>*Bang* A small explosion rang out as the clothes on Zhou Weiqing’s right arm actually shredded into pieces, revealing a strong, robust arm. Currently, the muscles were rippling, full of power and beauty.</p>
 <p>Facing Crow’s sudden explosive pull, Zhou Weiqing only swayed a little, yet was not pulled back at all.</p>
 <p>At this point, shock was displayed on all the members of the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy, as well as Ye Paopao. If the first time could be explained by Crow underestimating Zhou Weiqing, the second pull was clearly already with a considerable amount of power, yet it had still been easily blocked by him. The members of the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy had all experienced Crow’s terrifying power first-hand; and just those two pulls alone was definitely beyond what any normal Strength Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master could withstand.</p>
 <p>Not only did Crow inherit the power of the Gold Crow Tribe, she had also inherited the power from her father’s side, the strength of the barbarian tribe. In this marriage of strength, her physique was one of the most outstanding in the tribe, yet she had still not managed to move Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>“Again!” Zhou Weiqing shouted out. Facing Crow’s power was also extremely strenuous for him; before the benefits he had gained during Fat Cat’s level up, he would definitely have been moved by Crow by now. However, this time, all of Zhou Weiqing’s potential had been drawn out, allowing the remaining power of the black pearl to be completely diffused into his body, fusing together with him. As such, Zhou Weiqing had finally completely inherited the powers of the black pearl. With the huge boost to his physique, his strength was no weaker than the top genius of the Gold Crow Tribe, Crow.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s shout also awoke Crow’s battle thirst. She had never lost in a contest of strength before, and with a shout, the sleeve of her right arm also shattered, as her entire arm was covered in a layer of gold light. Taking a huge gulp of air, her entire body seemed to expand a degree.</p>
 <p>The power of her pull increased yet again, and this time, both their hands gave a faint creaking sounds as their bones strained.</p>
 <p>Icy Mist glowed as their Physical Jewels both appeared around their wrists. Without question, their strength had been boosted to their max, all the way including their Physical Jewels.</p>
 <p>In truth, by this point, everyone had a clearer understanding of Zhou Weiqing’s true strength.</p>
 <p>However, Crow was still Crow after all, and under her full power, Zhou Weiqing’s body was slowly pulled forward, his upper body slowly moving towards her direction. Although it was just a little movement, but without question, in terms of pure physical strength, Zhou Weiqing was still inferior by a tiny margin. Just as everyone thought that she had won this match, all of a sudden, a blood red light shone forth from Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, and in the next moment, a clear black layer of tiger tattoos slowly enveloped his arms. His already huge, taut muscles grew even larger, and even his palms seemed bigger.</p>
 <p>Stamping his feet on the ground so hard that the ground seemed to reverberate, a terrifying strength exploded forth. At that moment, it seemed as if Zhou Weiqing was lifting an entire mountain, as he forcibly pulled Crow over to his side as his arms flexed in a push pull motion, then an abrupt upward swing, as he actually lifted up the over six hundred jin heavy Crow!</p>
 <p>Ye Paopao, Drunken Bao, Xiao Yan, Little Four, all four of them stared in disbelief at the scene in front of them, their mouths gaped open as they couldn’t trust their own eyes. In a while, Little Four muttered to himself: “A monster… is this a monster?”</p>
 <p>It was exactly because they knew Crow’s strength so well, having witnessed her immense unyielding power along with her legendary axes and that insane offensive power, that it caused such a visual impact on their senses to see Zhou Weiqing beat her in a strength contest!</p>
 <p>With a swipe of his right arm, Zhou Weiqing threw Crow over to the side, and as Crow landed heavily on her feet with a loud thud, only then were the shocked spectators jolted from their reverie.</p>
 <p>At the moment, Crow’s face was also a mask of disbelief as she stared at her hands, stunned. Looking at Zhou Weiqing, and then back at her hands, she was temporarily unable to process the situation.</p>
 <p>A Heavenly Jewel Master of the same cultivation level… she had lost in terms of strength?!</p>
 <p>As the tiger tattoos subsided and slowly disappeared from Zhou Weiqing’s arms, he shook his head. In truth, he did not know how they managed to appear in the last moment to provide him with the last burst of required explosive strength, as he normally had to fully enter the Demonic State to access such power. At that instance, he had felt as if his strength was sufficient to topple mountains and fill the seas.</p>
 <p>Shaking his arms to stretch his muscles, Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “How about that? Bro Little Four, if you had bet with me again just now, don’t you think you would lose again? Heh heh.”</p>
 <p>Indeed, in comparison to his first victory over Little Four, this victory of his over Crow in a feat of strength was even more unbelievable to the audience.</p>
 <p>Little Four struggled to defend himself: “This… this… Even if you have the strength, it still isn’t the same! Crow has her legendary axes, you have seen their power, it is that combination that destroys everything in their path!”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “I may not have axes, but I have my hammers! Look!” As he said that, he extended his arms, shrugging them in a swift motion, and a brilliant dark-gold protective shroud of the Legendary Equipment burst forth as his twin hammers appeared in his hands.</p>
 <p>As the twin hammers glowed brightly, the smiling and crying face enameled on them giving forth a powerful aura. Holding the huge hammers in hands, the 1.9m tall Zhou Weiqing looked like the bronze statue of a war god, standing proud and tall in front of them valiantly.</p>
 <p>Just in terms of looks alone, the twin legendary hammers were slightly smaller than the legendary axes, but were in terms of design, they looked better.</p>
 <p>Little Four muttered: “How can those compare with Crow’s Legendary Axes? Is it silverware which looks good but made out of wax, great to look at but useless?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan glanced at him and said passively: “It’s terrifying to be so uncultured. That light just now showed that those hammers are Consolidated Equipment created by God Tier Consolidating Masters. I agree to join the Heavenly Jewel Tournament.” After saying that, he closed his eyes, sitting back with a faint smile on his face for the first time since the battle in the forest.</p>
 <p>Drunken Bao said with a helpless look on his face: “These youngsters nowadays are absolutely terrifying. One pair of hammers, one pair of axes, if they stand at any entrance, they can be the guardian spirits, it will definitely be a good sight. I also agree to continue with the Tournament.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing hefted the hammers meaningfully as he grinned at Little Four: “Bro Little Four, do you want to try out the feel of my hammers?”</p>
 <p>Little Four quickly shook his head: “Don’t, don’t… I agree alright! Damnit, I’m tricked by you, this scoundrel, once again. Sinister and crafty! That’s you in a nutshell!”</p>
 <p>Just as Zhou Weiqing was grinning smugly to himself for getting the team’s approval, all of a sudden, Crow walked over to his side. The two metre tall, top beauty of the Gold Crow Tribe, looked at him exuding tenderness and feeling in her eyes as she said sweetly: “You… you hurt my arm just now [1. It’s a flirtatious/coquettish way that I really can’t translate the tone properly in english lol. Imagine!] Weiqing, come to our Gold Crow Tribe. Although I already have a fiance, there are still many unwed girls in the tribe! They love such strong men like you. It doesn’t matter, they will not ask you to take responsibility, you just need to leave your seed in the tribe. How about that?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s face muscles twitched as he looked at Crow. After a moment of silence, he finally said with a glum, woebegone look on his face: “Big sis, I’m terrified. Please let me go.”</p>
 <p>Hearing his reply, everyone burst out laughing, and even Shangguan Bing’er was giggling to herself. Little Four was laughing so hard he almost burst open his wounds again, hurting yet laughing until tears ran down his cheeks. However, in that moment, their battle spirit had been invoked once more. Heavenly Jewel Tournament… here we come!</p>
