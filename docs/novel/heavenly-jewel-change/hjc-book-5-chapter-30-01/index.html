 <p><b>Chapter 30 Paradise Strange (1)</b></p>
 <p>Since they were already here, they would definitely want to do their best. Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er nodded towards Hua Feng in agreement.</p>
 <p>“Wait, Little Wei, did you manage to solve your blocked meridian problem? I haven’t seen you for over a year, and you’ve already grown so much!” Mu En said with a surprised expression. He knew Zhou Weiqing’s actual age, and also the state of his body previously; as such, he did not expect that Zhou Weiqing would actually become a Heavenly Jewel Master.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said with some dissatisfaction: “Teacher, that time you left without saying a word! Your disciple hasn’t just solved the blocked meridians issue. Look!” As he said that, Zhou Weiqing lifted up his right hand, and as he circulated his Heavenly Energy, his Heavenly Jewels appeared. Around his right wrist, the Icy Jade glittered as it orbited the wrist, showing its purity in front of everyone.</p>
 <p>Mu En blinked his eyes; although he was the oldest in the group, but his eyesight and vision was incomparable, otherwise he wouldn’t have the nickname of God Eye Scoundrel. When the absolutely pure Icy Jade appeared in front of him, Mu En was immediately stunned.</p>
 <p>Luo Ke Di’s gaze immediately drifted to Zhou Weiqing’s left hands. Alas, Zhou Weiqing was already rather experienced, and his left hand was totally covered by his sleeve.</p>
 <p>Hua Feng’s eyes seemed to flash with an excited light, looking at Zhou Weiqing with a very gentle gaze. His eyes seemed to have a hint of bewilderment and recollection, as if he were trying to think of something.</p>
 <p>“That’s not possible! It’s only been slightly over a year since we’ve met, even if you solved your blocked meridian issues, it shouldn’t be possible for you to Awaken your Heavenly Jewels! You… little brat… are you a fake?” As he said that, Mu En took a step forward, his hands reaching for Zhou Weiqing’s face and pinching them.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said smugly: “If you’re jealous, then just say you’re jealous! I’m so suave, so handsome, who could possibly successfully masquerade as me! You know my dad’s temper, he would never resort to do anything for personal gain. If not for the fact that my Heavenly Jewel Awakened, how could he possibly let me come to the Heavenly Bow Unit together with Shangguan Bing’er? Teacher, let me introduce you, this is my wife, Shangguan Bing’er, our Heavenly Bow Empire’s top beauty! Heh heh.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er rolled her eyes at him, but did not refute it.. Perhaps it was because she had met the ‘Rogue’ and the ‘Scoundrel’, and did not feel safe, and needed Zhou Little Fatty to help her feel safe.</p>
 <p>Without a doubt, this little rascal’s smug look made them want to hit him, but the fact that his Heavenly Jewels actually Awakened definitely shook the three Heavenly Bow Unit members present. After all, before Zhou Weiqing, there were only the two Heavenly Jewel Masters in the entire Empire, one was Admiral Zhou, and the other was the young genius of the generation, Shangguan Bing’er. Perhaps an additional Heavenly Jewel Master wasn’t that important for a large Empire, but to such a small Empire like Heavenly Bow Empire, it could be something that totally changed the state of affairs in their entire Empire, something important that could totally change their fate in the next few dozen years. It can be said that if the Heavenly Bow Empire did not have the 8 - Jeweled Admiral Zhou to protect them, with the addition of the Heavenly Bow Unit, perhaps the Empire would have been exterminated by now.</p>
 <p>Luo Ke Di looked towards Mu En and said: “Old Scoundrel, his Physical Jewel is definitely real. When I was testing their strength earlier, he used a piece of Consolidated Equipment, a bow, on me. Its strength was rather impressive.</p>
 <p>Hua Feng said: “Let’s go, we should head to the official meeting hall to discuss more.”</p>
 <p>“Rogue, go over and call Arrow Tower and Cannon over as well.” As he said that, he walked over to Zhou Weiqing, patted him on the shoulder, and headed towards one of the largest wooden houses.</p>
 <p>The rest of them followed him into the wooden house; it was empty and only had a huge long table in the middle, surrounded by many round chairs. Obviously, this was where they normally held their meetings. Hua Feng sat down at the main seat, and Luo Ke Di brought the other 2 members in as well. “Boss.” Han Mo and Gao Shen greeted Hua Feng, who smiled faintly and said: “Everyone, sit please.” Everybody took their seats, and Zhou Weiqing sat together with Shangguan Bing’er.</p>
 <p>Hua Feng turned his gentle gaze towards Zhou Weiqing and said: “Let me introduce these two. This young lady is our Heavenly Bow Empire’s young generation’s greatest genius, Shangguan Bing’er; previously when Admiral Zhou came he had mentioned her, and that she will be joining us for two years for training. As for this young lad here, he is Admiral Zhou’s only son, Zhou Weiqing. Previously, he had studied under Mu En about survival for two years. Now that his Heavenly Jewel has Awakened, he has become our Empire’s third Heavenly Jewel Master, and will also join us together with SHangguan Bing’er for training. Miss Shangguan, you are a dual agility type Heavenly Jewel Master, while I am a Wind Attribute Elemental Jewel Master; are you willing to take me as your teacher?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er started a little, and an excited look came over her face. Towards the Heavenly Bow unit, she had heard many tales about them and had always yearned to join it. Earlier, she had witnessed Luo Ke Di’s amazing archery, and now that the Heavenly Bow Unit’s leader, who even had the same Elemental Jewel Attribute as her, wanted to take her in as a disciple, how could she not be willing? Furthermore, among the five members of the Heavenly Bow Unit they had seen so far, it seemed like only this leader was relatively normal...</p>
 <p>As such, Shangguan Bing’er stood up and walked up to Hua Feng. Kneeling down, she called out “Teacher.” As she said that, she bowed down three times.</p>
 <p>After she had finished bowing, Hua Feng helped her up. “You can follow me from now on, and I’ll pass on everything I know to you. You are a talented Heavenly Jewel Master, and I’m confident that you will surpass me before long.”</p>
 <p>After Shangguan Bing’er returned to her seat, Hua Feng turned to Zhou Weiqing and said: “Since your Heavenly Jewel Awakened, you should be of the Darkness Attribute like Admiral Zhou. Unfortunately, we do not have anyone with the same attribute as you, so I recommend that you continue learning from Mu En. In our Heavenly Bow Unit, Mu En might not be the strongest person, but his archery is definitely the top.”</p>
 <p>As soon as Hua Feng said that, instantly 3 soft humphs sounded out, naturally it was the other 3 members of the Heavenly Bow Unit.</p>
 <p>Luo Ke Di’s humph was filled with disdain, Gao Shen’s was filled with provocation, while Han Mo’s was rather fierce and forceful.</p>
 <p>“What are you guys humph-ing about! Any of you want to compete in archery? Within 100 yards, even if all 3 of you face me, I’ll still beat you.” Mu En said airily, slumping back in his chair comfortably.</p>
 <p>With the cool eye of the bystander, Zhou Weiqing saw that when Mu En said that, the other 3 eyes wandered and nobody met his gaze.</p>
 <p>Hua Feng laughed heartily, saying: “If we’re just talking about archery, I’m confident that in this world, in the 100 yard distance, Mu En is unbeatable. Little Wei, Bing’er, in the future I’ll just call you that alright, let me introduce the Heavenly Bow Unit to you.”</p>
 <p>“Our Heavenly Bow Unit has been set up for around 130 years, and it has acted 3 times previously when the Heavenly Bow Empire was on the verge of extinction, and turning the tides. As such, 86 years ago, our Heavenly Bow Empire changed name to honour our Heavenly Bow Unit, and from then on our Heavenly Bow Unit was considered the crack unit, known as the God Bow of the Empire, and this land is considered sacred land in the Empire. The first generation of the Heavenly Bow Unit as also 7 people, and from then on, it has always been maintained at 7 people. We are all considered the second generation of the Heavenly Bow Unit, and each of us have inherited a different type of archery, which I can hope you can carry on and improve.”</p>
 <p>“Our Heavenly Bow Unit had also once contained Heavenly Jewel Masters, though there haven’t been many. Admiral Zhou was actually supposed to to lead the Heavenly Bow Unit, but due to some other reasons, I had to take over instead. Currently, amongst the 7 of us, I’ll do a simple introduction of our attributes and unique points.”</p>
 <p>“I’m a 7 Jeweled Wind Attribute Elemental Jewel Master, and as the leader of the Heavenly Bow Unit, I’m mostly in charge of strategy and direction, as well assassinations. My nickname is called ‘Ultimate Assassin[1.绝杀 has many meanings, it can mean final blow, assassinate, just kill alone etc. While 绝 also has the connotation of ultimate/ final. Hence I chose the name Ultimate Assassin, though he is also likely using it with multiple meanings, as evidenced by the next paragraph.]’.”</p>
 <p>When Hua Feng said the two words, ‘Ultimate Assassin’, even though he was smiling, but both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er both felt a chill run down their spines.</p>
 <p>Hua Feng turned to Mu En and said: “Mu En, 6 Jeweled Physical Jewel Master, half agility and half strength, and he is mainly in charge of destruction and sneak attacks, able to killing and sniping enemies in any conditions or environments. He is also in charge of disguises and hiding identities. With the best vision in our entire unit, his nickname is called ‘God Eye Scoundrel’.</p>
 <p>“Luo Ke Di, 5 Jeweled Physical Jewel Master, half coordination and flexibility, and he is mainly in charge of scouting, survey, tricking enemies, and is the only scout of our unit. His nickname is Drunken Rogue, and partners with Mu En, which is what they call the Unparalleled Liu Duo.” At the side, Mu En gave a humph, saying: “Being in charge of scouting, that just means he is the weakest amongst us all.”</p>
 <p>Luo Ke Di said angrily: “What do you mean weakest? I have lived a dozen years less than the rest of you.” Although he said that, it was clear that he was only acting fierce. Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er exchanged looks, both of them couldn’t hide the shock in their hearts. Being the weakest in the unit, Luo Ke Di’s archery was already so impressive, they could barely imagine what the others’ could be like.</p>
 <p>Mu En curled his lip in disdain, but Hua Feng ignored him and continued: “Han Mo, 6 - Jewelled Physical Jewel Master, toughness and stamina, and he is extremely skilled in keeping up a constant barrage of strong attacks. In our unit, he is in charge of continuous attack and suppressing fire. His nickname is Arrow Tower, with the meaning that he is just like an arrow tower, firing unceasingly.”</p>
 <p>“Gao Shen, 6 Jeweled Elemental Jewel Master, Fire Attribute, and is just a master of destruction and attacking. His nickname is Cannon, and under a normal circumstance, the pair of Gao Shen and Han Mo working together can easily suppress a more than a thousand ordinary soldiers.”</p>
 <p>Hua Feng said: “There are two other members as well, but they are out in a mission right now. I’ll introduce them to you both when you meet them in the future.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but ask: “Leader, what do you mean by mission? Do we go on missions for the Empire?”</p>
