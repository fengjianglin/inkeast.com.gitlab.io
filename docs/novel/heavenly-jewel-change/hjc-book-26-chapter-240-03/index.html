<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Such control! The approval in both the old man and the lady’s eyes was not concealed at all. As God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters in their own right, they naturally had the Spatial Attribute as well, and they could easily tell that Zhou Weiqing was using the Spatial Rend Skill. However, for him to wield the Spatial Rend Skill to such a fine degree of control, with all subtleties within his grasp… not even wasting a single bit of materials. This was not something any ordinary person could accomplish. In that instant, they gained a much deeper understanding about Zhou Weiqing. This young man who claimed to be from this Legacy of Strength definitely had a powerful spiritual energy and soul; otherwise he could not possibly reach such a fine degree of control.</p>
 <p>Next, two blocks of ores appeared in Zhou Weiqing’s hands. One blue, one purple, both the size of a fist, each grasped in one of his hands.</p>
 <p>A low shout rang out from Zhou Weiqing, and the two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters were surprised to see his sleeves shatter apart and scatter to the sides, revealing his muscled arms. The clear lines of his muscles were filled with the manly yang qi that had its own ‘beauty’, causing even the lady to suddenly blush.</p>
 <p>His arm muscles clearly flexed as his hands gripped tight. In the next moment, the two tough ores in his hands actually gave out a cracking sound as they began to break apart quickly.</p>
 <p>The lady’s eyes widened in shock. What kind of strength was that?! Was this fellow really human? She naturally recognized the two ores; the blue was Kyanite, while the purple was Devil’s Amethyst. Both were considered extremely tough precious rocks. Yet, he had just used pure physical strength to shatter them… wasn’t that just too terrifying?</p>
 <p>At the same time, a one chi tall green whirlwind appeared right in front of Zhou Weiqing, silent and sudden. The entire whirlpool was an azure green, and though its surface area was small, all of them could see that it consisted of highly compressed powerful Wind Attribute energies. The azure green was so bright, almost as moving as the purest precious jade.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s hands moved above the whirlpool, dropping the crushed stones into it. With the terrifying piercing winds whipping and slicing, when they came out from the pointed end, they had been ground into fine dust.</p>
 <p>Standing to the side, Shangguan Bing’er was rather puzzled. Since the final result was to grind to such fine dust, why didn’t he just use the Spatial Rend again for the same effect? Why did Zhou Weiqing choose to use another, seemingly more complicated, method?</p>
 <p>She was not a Consolidating Equipment Master, and she naturally did not understand the profound secrets behind such a decision. However, for the two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters watching, the suspicion in their hearts had already been diminished by a large amount.</p>
 <p>The reason why Zhou Weiqing had chosen to do so was exactly because of his understanding of the materials. Previously, when cutting the plant, fruit and vine, he could safely use the Spatial Attribute without any problems as they were all previously alive. However, in terms of the two ores, it was totally different. If he had used the Spatial Attribute to undergo the cutting, the ores which were already inherently filled with Spatial Attribute energies would definitely undergo some subtle changes, losing their original effects. As a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, how could one make such a mistake?</p>
 <p>At the same time, since Zhou Weiqing’s arms were now bared, they could actually see his Heavenly Jewels for the first time.</p>
 <p>Naturally, there was nothing too surprising about the Strength Attribute Physical Jewel on his right wrist, but on his left wrist, the rose red glow of the Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Elemental Jewels caused even their hearts to grip in shock.</p>
 <p>Alexandrite Cat’s Eye.... that was the Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Jewel! This… this meant he had at least four Elemental Attributes! Such a Jewel would glow a brilliant bluish green under direct sunlight, but at night or where there wasn’t sunlight, it would glow a moving rose red. Though this room was lit by sunlight, it was only near the windows, and at the center where Zhou Weiqing was standing, the sunlight did not reach him directly. As a result, his Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Jewels were the rose red colour.</p>
 <p>Previously, these two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters felt that Zhou Weiqing was just too arrogant, but their expressions grew solemn. Putting aside the matter of whether or not he was really a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master, just with these Elemental Jewels and what he had shown so far, he definitely had the right to be arrogant. Furthermore, he looked to be only around twenty years old; even if he wasn’t really a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master yet, he was definitely one of the top geniuses and talents in the entire XuanTian Continent.</p>
 <p>His hands still glowing with the light from his Heavenly Jewels, he held the crystal vat which now held the five materials, the five colours slowly mixing together. Zhou Weiqing’s movements did not stop there, as one after the other, various precious materials were continuously taken out from the Spatial Ring.</p>
 <p>From the looks of it, his speed was extremely fast, but if one examined his actions closely, they would be able to discover that his actions contained a unique rhythm of their own. Every single material that appeared had its strict sequence and its own method of being prepared. All in all, forty two materials were used, and by that time, the crystal vat had already been filled halfway.</p>
 <p>After finishing this first step of his preparations, Zhou Weiqing slowly raised the crystal vat carefully with both hands, a thick Heavenly Energy clearly moving from both his palms, infusing into the crystal vat in a careful, well-distributed fashion. The forty two different powders or liquids formed by the materials began to slowly mix together, fusing as one under the activation of his Heavenly Energy.</p>
 <p>In this moment, Zhou Weiqing actually closed his eyes. This time, it was as if he had become a giant vat, a unique aura enveloping the crystal vat and the mixed materials within, not allowing any of the slightest scent to spread out.</p>
 <p>At this point, both God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters had their gazes fixed unblinkingly. Every God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master was different, with each having their own expertise, and even the God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scrolls they created would have some differences. Even the compounding ratio of each Consolidating Ink would be different. Previously, when Zhou Weiqing was concocting his Consolidated Ink, they had tried their best to record the sequence and process. To their knowledge, this was the first time they had seen this style of concocting Consolidating Ink, and without question it was a new type of Consolidating Ink as well. Since it required so many precious materials, one could imagine what type of Scrolls it would be used to create.</p>
 <p>As Zhou Weiqing infused more Heavenly Energy, his actions became more and more gentle. Slowly, the Consolidated Ink in the crystal vat began to swirl, forming a small cyclone in the vat. A faint glow began to emit from below, and in the continued process, the glow began to strengthen.</p>
 <p>This was a glow of silver light. It seemed as if silver mercury was being dissolved and solvent, the faint silver light filled with an overbearing feel. Although the aura was not being leaked out, the two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters could still sense the violent mania within.</p>
 <p>At last, Zhou Weiqing’s action stopped totally. The crystal vat had already been raised above his head. In that instant, his eyes snapped open and he gave a great shout.</p>
 <p>A thick silver light soared above from the crystal vat, warping into a silver flame as it burst through the confines of the roof and into the skies.</p>
 <p>A strong fragrance began to spread, and it wasn’t just the few of them in the room that could smell it, but even those powerhouses guarding outside began to smell the fragrance that seemed to refresh the mind.</p>
 <p>It was a fragrance that would even cause one’s soul to tremble, and all of those who smelled it instantly felt as though their pores had burst open. It was truly a strange feeling, and even the Heavenly Energy within their bodies seem to circulate faster than normal. Of course, this phenomenon only lasted for a split second, and as the silver flame extinguished, the fragrance also disappeared silently.</p>
 <p>Towards the strange happenings in the wooden cabin, the XuanTian Palace powerhouses outside did not do anything. After all, there were often such strange happenings in the cabin, and their duty was just to guard the area and not allow any outsiders to enter, and definitely not to disturb those within.</p>
 <p>As soon as the silver flame vanished from the silver vat, only then did the other three in the wooden cabin clearly see the situation. Originally, the half vat of liquid was now reduced to barely a thin layer at the bottom. A faint silver liquid, looking as moving as the silver galaxies above, drawing their attention as if they couldn’t bear to tear their eyes from it.</p>
 <p>As soon as the two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters saw that, they drew in a cold breath. They knew that Zhou Weiqing had indeed succeeded in creating Consolidating Ink that was used for the creation of God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. Furthermore, the entire process had barely taken an hour. Both of them were experienced God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters, especially the old man who had been one for almost forty years. However, even he had to admit that if it was up to him to use so many treasured materials in creating Consolidating Ink, he could not be as quick as Zhou Weiqing. After all, as long as any single step failed, the entire vat of precious materials would be destroyed and wasted. Those were not any ordinary materials, all precious treasures! Just that small vat of liquid had cost an estimated minimum of several million gold coins, and many of those treasures could not even be purchased even if you had the money.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing also breathed a sigh of relief inwardly. Naturally, he wasn’t a real God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master yet. At least, not before today. However, he had the Saint Energy to aid him, and possessing it meant possessing an unparalleled tool for cheating.</p>
 <p>He always had the knowledge on how to create God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, but when he was still in the Boundless Mainland, he never had the time to delve deeper into it without practice and research. Even so, as the greatest hope of the Legacy of Strength, Duan Tianlang would still find some time to teach and guide him, especially in the creation of his ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set. After all, Duan Tianlang did not know when he would actually pass away.</p>
 <p>However, this was Zhou Weiqing’s actual first attempt in creating a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll. Although it seemed like he had such perfect rhythm in merging all of those materials earlier, in truth he had made so many mistakes. If the two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters actually tried following his methods, they would never be able to learn it.</p>
 <p>In the end, the only reason why the treasured materials could actually succeed in merging together perfectly was solely the merit of the Saint Energy. In the final step when Zhou Weiqing was infusing his Heavenly Energy, causing the contents of the silver vat to turn silver, within his transformed Heavenly Energy he had hidden some Saint Energy.</p>
