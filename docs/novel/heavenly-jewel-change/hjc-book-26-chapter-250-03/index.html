 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dreamwake was feeling extremely conflicted. &nbsp;So long as the core components of the Spatial Teleportation Gem remained undamaged, it could at most teleport away a total of ten living beings at once. &nbsp;The choice of the ten had to be made within a certain range, which meant that not only would they have to sacrifice several of the Elders, even the distant Zhou Weiqing would be doomed. &nbsp;He wasn’t within the range of the Spatial Teleportation Gem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once the Tenebrous Sealing Formation was broken… unless Dreamwake and the Tenebrous Demon Dragon immediately flew over to him and ensured he was in range, he would without a question perish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However… if she did this, what would happen to the powerhouses of Xuantian Palace? &nbsp;Even though they had five Heavenly Emperors, it was virtually guaranteed that they would die when facing a pair of Heavenly God Terror Sea Dragons!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The distant Terror Sea Dragon was drawing closer and closer. &nbsp;Although the one within the Tenebrous Sealing Formation was suffering more and more wounds, there wasn’t enough time for the Tenebrous Demon Dragon and Dreamwake to deal a truly lethal injury to it. &nbsp;Looks of terror appeared simultaneously upon the faces of the Xuantian Palace powerhouses who had set up this formation. &nbsp;The Grand Elders weren’t as worried, as they knew that they wouldn’t be abandoned once the Spatial Teleportation Gem was activated... but that wasn’t the case for the six ordinary Elders. &nbsp;If a few people had to be abandoned, it would definitely be some of them! &nbsp;Their trembling hearts and minds even caused the Tenebrous Sealing Formation which they were maintaining to grow a bit unsteady.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dreamwake was agonizing over what to do, but she had no idea that someone outside was even more agonized than her. &nbsp;Dreamwake needed to consider whether or not she would rescue Zhou Weiqing, but Zhou Weiqing needed to consider far, far more things.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was already able to clearly see their distant new visitor. &nbsp;Yet another Terror Sea Dragon had appeared within his field of vision, ensconced by the awesome tidal wave. &nbsp;Compared to the previous Terror Sea Dragon, it was noticeably smaller and weaker. &nbsp;It was only eighty meters long… but even so, it was already at the Heavenly God level! &nbsp;Even though it was just a new Heavenly God, there was no way a Heavenly Emperor could be a match for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What to do? &nbsp;Zhou Weiqing was already beginning to panic. &nbsp;Yet another Terror Sea Dragon had appeared. &nbsp;Without question, it was his chance to seize the Spatial Teleportation Gem… but would he really be able to survive, even if he did manage to acquire it? &nbsp;Even if he did survive, Dreamwake and the others would probably all die here!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing’s heart was filled with many contradictory impulses. &nbsp;The worst part of it was, he didn’t have any time to really think things over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He took a deep breath, finally making a decision. &nbsp;Even though he knew this decision was perhaps rather unwise, he also knew that this was the only choice he wouldn’t regret later on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His enormous wings flapped. &nbsp;Moments later, six dark-golden beams of light simultaneously emanated from different parts of his body. &nbsp;The wings propelled him forward like a streak of dark-golden light, and he headed straight towards that awesome, heaven-covering wave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at this moment, Zhou Weiqing’s voice rang out within the Tenebrous Sealing Formation. &nbsp;“Dreamwake, kill that Terror Sea Dragon as soon as possible. &nbsp;I’ll help you hold off the other one for a while.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing’s voice was fairly calm and not many emotions could be detected within it, but when the experts of Xuantian Palace heard this voice, all of their eyes turned red. &nbsp;Dreamwake was no exception.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As the saying goes, true friendship is revealed through adversity. &nbsp;As far as they knew, Zhou Weiqing was nothing more than a six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master! &nbsp;They were now facing great danger, but instead of being scared silly or fleeing for his life, he stepped up and moved into the path of danger for the sake of buying them what would probably be just a fleeting moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Prior to this day, the Elders respected Zhou Weiqing, but only for his Consolidating skills. &nbsp;His voice wasn’t that loud, but when the Elders heard it they gained a completely different view of him. &nbsp;No matter what his real cultivation base was and regardless of if he would be able to actually block the Terror Sea Dragon for even an instant, for him to be able to say something like that at a time like this instantly ignited the fighting spirit of all the Xuantian Palace powerhouses.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Several of the Elders had been filled with nervous fear, but their spirits instantly blazed up. &nbsp;Even a weak little six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master was able to view death with such aplomb, to have the courage to face the other Terror Sea Dragon by himself. &nbsp;What did the rest of them have to fear?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dreamwake gritted her teeth so hard, they sank deep into her lips. &nbsp;She had always been calm and noble, but in this instant she let out a throat-rending scream. &nbsp;“BASTARD!!! &nbsp;YOU BETTER STAY ALIVE…!” &nbsp;Her voice was extremely loud and shrill, but anyone who heard it would sense the powerlessness within it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could a six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master possibly survive an encounter against a Heavenly God Terror Sea Dragon?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tears uncontrollably fell down Dreamwake’s face. &nbsp;Regret like she had never felt before had completely suffused her heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She regretted having gone back on her oath. &nbsp;She still clearly remembered what she had sworn on that day, and if she was given another chance she would’ve given herself unhesitatingly to this man. &nbsp;She knew she liked him. &nbsp;Why did she have to be so conservative and keep herself at a distance? &nbsp;Why?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was everything which was now happening due to the heavens punishing her for breaking her oath?</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The terrifying darkness instantly transformed into a bloody crimson. &nbsp;Starting from Dreamwake’s position, the blood color began to stretch downwards across the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s body, almost instantly reaching out to cover every inch of it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An incomparably terrifying aura caused the Tenebrous energies within the Tenebrous Sealing Formation to wildly pour into the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s body. &nbsp;So much energy was being drained out of the powerful formation that it actually grew weaker and brittle.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing had a solemn look in his eyes. &nbsp;This was probably going to be the most difficult fight he would ever have in his life. &nbsp;He wasn’t sure how long he would be able to last, but he was going to try and buy the people within the Tenebrous Sealing Formation as much time as he could. &nbsp;Of course, he wasn’t going to gamble his life away on this. &nbsp;If he truly felt that he could no longer hold on, he would immediately flee from this place at maximum speed. &nbsp;However, he absolutely could not do that just yet. &nbsp;No matter what, he had to at least try his best.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">For some reason, when he made the choice to charge at the second Terror Sea Dragon, his mind and his will became incomparably pristine and clear. &nbsp;Suddenly, his mental strength seemed to have broken through to a new level. &nbsp;This feeling of his spirit being so clear throughout his entire body was indescribably comfortable. &nbsp;It was as though perhaps facing off against an incredibly powerful Heavenly God wasn’t all that frightening after all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Terror Sea Dragon was startled by Zhou Weiqing attempting to block it, and it couldn’t help but briefly pause its charge. &nbsp;The power of Saint Energy caused it to feel a sense of tremendous danger. &nbsp;It discovered, to its astonishment, that part of the dense Water Attribute atmospheric energies in the range of Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy was no longer obeying its commands.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How was this possible? &nbsp;We Terror Sea Dragons are the lords of the oceans! &nbsp;How could this human actually possess a power which is capable of influencing Water energies to the point of preventing me from using them?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had no idea that it was Saint Energy, which transcended all other Attributes. &nbsp;Saint Energy’s might was capable of assimilating any other Attribute. &nbsp;After Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation broke through to the Heavenly Dao Energy level, his Saint Energy’s effectiveness was finally put on true display. &nbsp;Zhou Weiqing was merely in the ocean, which was filled with Water Attribute energies. &nbsp;Even if Zhou Weiqing was within the Tenebrous Sealing Formation, he still would’ve been able to convert the Tenebrous Attribute energies and make use of it himself. &nbsp;This was what made Saint Energy so marvelous. &nbsp;It was suitable for any battlefield, and it allowed him to unleash 100% of his power no matter where he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even Heavenly God powerhouses wouldn’t dare to be overconfident when they faced an Attribute disadvantage. &nbsp;The amazed Terror Sea Dragon didn’t know what Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation base was. &nbsp;He was a human and had clearly come alongside the other powerhouses of Xuantian Palace. &nbsp;For this human to suddenly appear by himself and challenge the Terror Sea Dragon meant that he clearly wouldn’t be easy to deal with.</span></p>
