 <p><b>Chapter 21 Stealing the heart, Surprise Attack [1. The title was a play on words actually, the direct translation being 'Stealing Heart, Stealing Camp'](1)</b></p>
 <p>In that instance when Shangguan Bing’er lifted both arms and embraced him, Zhou Weiqing felt a warm fuzzy feeling swell up in his heart. Though he was usually a little perverted and rascally, at this moment his brain was unexpectedly in a blank.</p>
 <p>To Zhou Weiqing, this hug was like a sign of approval. Yes, approval. Since he was young, up until now, he had always been a trash in others’ eyes. Even after he had become a Heavenly Jewel Master, the shadow and darkness of the past had not faded from his heart, and deep inside he felt a sense of inferiority. This was why he had always had a mask in place, using his cynicism and teasing to hide his feelings of inferiority. Previously, whenever he had spent time with Shangguan Bing’er, this was the main reason for why he acted like that.</p>
 <p><i>She hugged me. She actually hugged me of her own accord. </i>The feel of being hugged in a warm embrace was an amazing, beautiful feeling, that warmed his jaded heart. <i>Finally, there is a girl, such a beautiful wonderful girl, who really thinks that I am someone is is worth something, someone who is reliable. At least, at this moment.</i> A hitherto unknown feeling of pride and satisfaction welled up his his rapidly beating heart.</p>
 <p>After Shangguan Bing’er had embraced him, her beautiful face had also flushed a deep red. In the instance when she hugged him, she had been in a state of agitation and been touched deeply, and now she awoke a little, and felt a sense of nervousness welling up. <i>That rascal was always so bad, will he seize this chance to...</i></p>
 <p>However, very quickly, surprise quickly entered Shangguan Bing’er’s feelings. She realised that Zhou Weiqing was just standing there in her embrace, without playing any tricks or trying anything funny, without a sign that he was going to try to do anything further. Slowly, the sense of nervousness vanished, and a sense of peace and security filled her heart.</p>
 <p><i>Although he took away my first time, but today he also saved my life. With that, let’s wipe the slate clean.</i> Shangguan Bing’er thought to herself in her heart.</p>
 <p>When a woman hates a man, no matter what he does for her, how much effort or how many things he does, that hatred will not diminish a whit. However, the reverse is also true, when a woman has acknowledged a man, even if he does not do anything, she will still think the better of him.</p>
 <p>The two of them just stood there silently. They were after all still very young; one was a boy with an inferiority complex after being called trash all these years, and the other was a girl who was shouldering too much responsibility and was unable to take it. At this point in time, their two hearts seem to be close together. Even without speaking, their auras seemed to be comforting each other.</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Little Fatty, I feel much better now.” After some time had passed, Shangguan Bing’er spoke first. She let go of Zhou Weiqing and looked up at him, only to see him staring blankly and foolishly at her, and she couldn’t help but let out a peal of laughter.</p>
 <p>“Bing’er, you look so beautiful when you smile.” Zhou Weiqing said in a rather foolishly sounding tone. At this time, his mind was a little short circuited, but the shadow of darkness in his heart had been eased a lot by Shangguan Bing’er’s embrace.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er could feel the hot breath from him, and she blushed even more, biting her lower lip. Such a look, made her look unbelievably cute.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing felt blood rush into his head, and almost subconsciously, he lowered his head towards her. His movement was very slow, at this time he did not want to ever violate this girl who had saved him. If she showed any sign of resisting, he would immediately stop.</p>
 <p>As their faces got closer, Shangguan Bing’er’s blush grew even deeper, but she did not try to dodge. Just a moment ago, their hearts had met and melded together, and her anger towards him had faded away.</p>
 <p>Just as their faces were barely an inch away from each other, all of a sudden, the tent flap was shoved upwards and an urgent sounding voice sounded out: “Little Wei, Shangguan Bing’er actually resigned from the post of Battalion Commander… Ehhh…” [2. Nooooooo]</p>
 <p>Xiao Ru Se charged in from outside, giving Shangguan Bing’er a scare as she jumped away like a startled little bird.</p>
 <p>“I… went to the wrong tent. You guys continue...” Xiao Ru Se had a strange expression on her face as she quickly gave a weird excuse and fled the tent.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was speechless, and sweatdropped. He had just been about to get his first real kiss. <i>Elder sis… you really came at a wrong time.</i></p>
 <p>Her ears burning red with embarrassment, Shangguan Bing’er gave him a quick glare and said: “It’s all your fault. I’m going back now.” After which, she quickly tried to move off.</p>
 <p>“Bing’er, wait a while.” Zhou Weiqing took a step forward and held onto her.</p>
 <p>“You… what are you trying to do?” That gentle atmosphere earlier had vanished as soon as Xiao Ru Se barged in, and Shangguan Bing’er couldn’t help but ask in alarm as she lowered her head.</p>
 <p>“Bing’er, don’t leave yet. Don’t you want to take revenge for our men who died today?” Zhou Weiqing said softly.</p>
 <p>“En?” Only then did Shangguan Bing’er realise that she had mistaken his actions, and she raised her head to look at him. “Revenge? How?”</p>
 <p>A cold look flashed in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, and he said softly: “This is a war between two countries. Since they killed and injured over a hundred of our men, then we should also do the same to them. Wouldn’t that would be a temporary revenge for those of our men who had lost their lives? How far is the closest Kalise Military Camp from here?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er said: “It is about 300 li away, though this 300 li is filled with complicated terrain, and is considered a demilitarized zone for both sides. What, are you thinking of doing a sneak attack on the enemy stronghold?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded his head and said: “Yes. Didn’t you want to know what Skills I had stored in my Elemental Jewel? Let me tell you tonight. Indeed, you are correct; in terms of commanding and leading troops, we are definitely unable to compare with Company Leader Xiao. However, we are Heavenly Jewel Masters. Our purpose on the battlefield can be easily described with just three words. Sheer destructive power. That is the true value of us Heavenly Jewel Masters. Since the enemy can cross over to our borders to assassinate you, why can't we do the same and teach them a lesson?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing'er took a deep breath, and in her beautiful eyes, a resolute look appeared. She said: “Alright. Let’s do that. I will go back to restore my Heavenly Energy first. After dinner, I’ll look for you, and we can discuss a plan of action.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing escorted her out of his tent, then returned to his own bed and continued cultivating. A young bull does not fear the tiger [3. Direct translation of a chinese idiom, 初生牛犊不怕虎], the young always easily give in to impulse as they do not fear consequences as much. For him, the only thought was that wanted to make Shangguan Bing'er feel better, and be happy. On her part, Shangguan Bing'er wanted revenge for her slain men, and so the two easily agreed on such a wild plan.</p>
 <p>As smoke started rising over the military compound, the red glow of the setting sun reflected across the horizon. The military cooks were busy preparing food as dinner time neared.</p>
 <p>In the Heavenly Bow Empire army, there was a rule that clearly stipulated that all military officers, no matter what rank, had to dine together with the soldiers, unless any peculiar circumstances arose. This stipulation was set by Zhou Weiqing’s father, Admiral Zhou. As such, this was always the time when the men of the Third Battalion were the most excited, as it was at this time that they could see the beautiful female Battalion Commander, who was also known as the most beautiful woman in the Empire.</p>
