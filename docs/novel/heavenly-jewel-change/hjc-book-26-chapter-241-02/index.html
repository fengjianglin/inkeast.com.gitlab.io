 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The answer… was yes! &nbsp;Of course!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yes. &nbsp;Just after Zhou Weiqing’s pen had completed two arcs, before he had finished even a single complete part of the sketch, a few mistakes appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As had already been explained earlier, even the tiniest of mistakes made during the creation of a Consolidating Scroll would result in immediate failure. &nbsp;Every single stroke of this God Tier Consolidating Scroll sketch was finer than a human hair. &nbsp;The entire scroll would only be completed after hundreds on thousands of sketched lines.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He failed. &nbsp;He failed already. &nbsp;I knew he was no God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master!</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; The two stared wide-eyed in surprise at the quick failure… but for some reason, they also felt a sense of relief in their hearts. &nbsp;Perhaps they subconsciously were unwilling to believe that there really was an incredible genius who was just at the five-Jeweled level and twenty-something years of age, yet capable of becoming a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But… just as they were about to let out sighs of relief, they suddenly stopped breathing entirely, and their relaxed bodies tensed up once more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as Zhou Weiqing’s pen had made that tiny mistake, something marvelous happened. &nbsp;The illusory figure of an odd-looking meaty bug suddenly began to slowly appear behind his back. &nbsp;A strange type of energy rippled out from it, causing everything within the entire wood cabin to twist and distort.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The strangest thing was, once the big translucent bug appeared, it gave a bizarre wiggle and caused a stream of silver light to be released from Zhou Weiqing’s body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everything began to happen in reverse. &nbsp;Although only a few seconds were reversed, it was enough to go back to the moment before Zhou Weiqing had made the mistake.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Time Attribute!” &nbsp;This time, the old man was completely unable to hold himself back. &nbsp;He almost instantly blurted these two words out, jumping to his feet in sheer astonishment, no longer able to maintain the slightest bit of calm. &nbsp;As for the woman next to him, she had been completely stunned as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Given their cultivation levels, they were naturally able to tell what Zhou Weiqing had just done. &nbsp;Time Attribute! &nbsp;Only the Time Attribute could’ve produced such an effect! &nbsp;Although they didn’t know what technique or Skill Zhou Weiqing had used, just now he had clearly used it to reverse time and cause his pen to return back to the moment just before he had made that mistake, allowing him to continue sketching.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Is this for real?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; Suddenly, the two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters felt as though everything they thought they knew about how the creation of Consolidating Scrolls worked had been completely overturned. &nbsp;Not just them – even Shangguan Bing’er, who had come here alongside Zhou Weiqing, stared wide-eyed at the sight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they had first arrived, Shangguan Bing’er had actually felt extremely nervous. &nbsp;She understood Zhou Weiqing very well and knew that in recent years, he had almost spent no time on creating Consolidating Scrolls. &nbsp;How could he possibly be God Tier? &nbsp;She wasn’t able to accurately judge just how strong the two people in front of them were, but she could sense that they were at a level beyond what she and Zhou Weiqing could handle. &nbsp;If Zhou Weiqing wasn’t able to pass the test, it would be hard for them to leave this place, much less acquire the Spatial Teleportation Gem.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it wasn’t for the fact that Zhou Weiqing had repeatedly assured her that he would pass this test, Shangguan Bing’er probably wouldn’t have even permitted him to come here.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Shangguan Bing’er had only grown increasingly astonished by what she saw here today. &nbsp;That state of becoming ‘one with the world’ didn’t matter, as she knew the mysteries involved. &nbsp;But when Zhou Weiqing first began to create the Consolidating Ink, she immediately realized that she didn’t know nearly enough about her Little Fatty.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing had a completely focused look on his face. &nbsp;Even though he wasn’t all that handsome, but a woman would always be captivated by the look of her man when he was completely absorbed in his work.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When she saw this, Shangguan Bing’er finally understood why Zhou Weiqing said that he would be able to produce a God Tier Consolidating Scroll. &nbsp;It might look as though he was relying upon the Time Attribute, but Shangguang Bing’er knew that the key of the matter was actually the Time Attribute Skills being infused with his Saint Energy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the journey over to the XuanTian Continent, Shangguan Bing’er had gained a clear understanding of all the many techniques and Stored Skills which Zhou Weiqing had available to him. &nbsp;This Stored Skill he had used just now was actually his highest-class Time Attribute Skill, the ‘Time Reversal’.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This technique had once saved Shangguan Fei’er’s life, which was why Shangguan Bing’er remembered it so clearly. &nbsp;However, normally speaking a technique like Time Reversal would cause time to go backwards by a full hour. &nbsp;Even if Zhou Weiqing improved his cultivation level, he would at most be able to gain enough control to extend it to a day or perhaps even longer, not shorter. &nbsp;More importantly, once used the Time Reversal technique started the user would be unable to stop the process, much less change midway through the process. As such, despite its great power, its practical effects were less so.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However… Zhou Weiqing had somehow succeeded in controlling it. &nbsp;Without question, he must have relied on his Saint Energy to cast the Time Reversal, causing this relatively useless Heavenly God Tier Skill to suddenly become truly monstrous in power.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing was no God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master in practice, but he had the knowledge. Now, thanks to this ‘Time Reversal’ technique, he was able to slowly complete a God Tier Consolidating Scroll one step at a time. &nbsp;So what if he made mistakes? &nbsp;He’d just reverse time and fix it! &nbsp;So long as he could successfully complete one stroke at a time, he’d eventually succeed in finishing the entire thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for the expenditure in Saint Energy? &nbsp;To Zhou Weiqing, he only needed to use a tiny amount to keep the effect active. &nbsp;The energy expenditure was virtually negligible. &nbsp;He was after all a nine-Jeweled cultivator. However, even if he really was just a five-Jeweled cultivator, the low energy expenditure meant that he should still be able to sustain this process.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Fatty, you really are brilliant.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; The only thing which Shangguan Bing’er felt was approval. &nbsp;Her Little Fatty was simply too brilliant. &nbsp;Clearly, he had already come up with this plan when he first proclaimed himself a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master. &nbsp;He had prepared everything.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing continued with his manufacturing process. &nbsp;By now, the two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters were completely stupefied. Yes, his manufacturing technique was absolute ‘cheating’; they could see this right away. &nbsp;But… he had the Time Attribute! &nbsp;This was an innate gift, an absolutely extraordinary innate gift!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The attributes which Zhou Weiqing had already demonstrated included wind, space, and time. &nbsp;When you combined these three mighty attributes together, they allowed an incredibly powerful and incredibly talented God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master to arise.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Zhou Weiqing had first learned of Consolidating Scrolls and had been learning from Huyan Aobo, Huyan Aobo had been absolutely overwhelmed with joy to discover that he had all three of these attributes. &nbsp;Now, Zhou Weiqing had transformed this ‘overwhelming joy’ into ‘overwhelming shock’ and delivered it to the two God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters of XuanTian Palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most importantly of all, they didn’t even recognize the Time Reversal technique which Zhou Weiqing was using. &nbsp;Even if they did, they wouldn’t believe that it was the same ‘Time Reversal’ technique, as Zhou Weiqing’s version allowed him to fully control time within a specific duration. &nbsp;If this technique wasn’t used for creating a Consolidating Scroll and was instead used in battle… how terrifying would that be?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What they didn’t know was that even when activated via Saint Energy, Zhou Weiqing was only able to reverse time by five seconds while maintaining ‘absolute control’ over it. &nbsp;In addition, it wasn’t quite as easy as Shangguan Bing’er had thought it to be. &nbsp;Although it was true that this process took up very little Saint Energy, it consumed an enormous amount of mental energy. &nbsp;Zhou Weiqing himself hadn’t expected this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thankfully, he wasn’t actually a five-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, but a nine-Jeweled one. &nbsp;In addition, his mental energy far surpassed that of an ordinary person’s! &nbsp;Given the above, Zhou Weiqing was able to continue with the manufacturing process despite the intensity of it.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As for Heavenly Emperor powerhouses? &nbsp;He didn’t even want to think about them, nor did he want to test them out.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">By now, he had reached the very final stages of creating this Consolidating Scroll. &nbsp;Not much of the Saint Energy in Zhou Weiqing’s body had been used up, but he could feel that his mind and spirit had been all-but drained empty. &nbsp;Maintaining this process was causing him to feel an ear-splitting headache. &nbsp;If it wasn’t for the fact that his willpower, tested repeatedly by the Immortal Deity Technique, was incredibly strong… he probably would’ve collapsed long ago.</span></p>
