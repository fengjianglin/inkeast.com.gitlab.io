 <p><b>Chapter 222 Demon God Finger! (3)</b></p>
 <p>On the other hand, Ma Qun’s look at Zhou Weiqing was a totally different matter. It was definitely a type of worship, a fiery, flattering and worshipful look that caused a chill to run down Zhou Weiqing’s spine.</p>
 <p>“Crow! You have to keep an eye on your husband, be careful of his sexual preferences, in case any trouble happens.”</p>
 <p>Crow giggled, saying: “No, it should be him having to keep an eye on me. Boss, if you keep presenting yourself like that, I am afraid I will fall for you instead.”</p>
 <p>Looking at her sweet smile and laughter, and the contrasting massive body, Zhou Weiqing was struck speechless. At last, he said: “Please give me a break, you two. Today, this round we have already guaranteed our victory. The Dan Dun Battle Team should have their spirits broken by now, and without morale or fighting spirit, the rest of the fights should be in the bag. Crow, the fourth fight is yours. Tian’er, you shouldn’t need to, but the fifth fight is yours just in case.”</p>
 <p>Tian’er nodded as she smiled.</p>
 <p>Although the fight today was alarmingly dangerous, with the Destruction Attribute Skill that the brothers TianFeng and TianMa had unleashed far beyond Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er’s expectations. However, they had at least proven one thing - comparing the Saint Energy and the Destruction Attribute, there was still a gap in their levels. Today, even if they had used a weaker Skill and not summoned the Demon God, any other powerful Skill powered by the Saint Energy should still have ensured their victory.</p>
 <p>This gave them further confidence in the Saint Energy, and the future of their cultivation, as well as the path they were taking.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Just as Zhou Weiqing had said, after the top three of the Dan Dun Battle Team, TianFeng, TianMa and Shen Little Demon, had already lost, the morale of the entire Dan Dun Battle Team was at a record low. For the fourth fight, Crow used her powerful strength to easily defeat a six-Jeweled member of the Dan Dun Battle Team. In the end, the round today ended with the Heavenly Bow Battle Team’s victory with a 3-1 score, and they became the last team to advance to the top eight of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament.</p>
 <p>After the massive battle between the Heavenly Bow Battle Team and the Dan Dun Battle Team, the rest of the fights were pretty much nothing in comparison, especially since there was nothing left to fight for. At last, when Shangguan Longyin proclaimed the end of the preliminary round, the Heavenly Bow Battle Team had become the focus of the entire plaza.</p>
 <p>The entire ZhongTian battle Team, led by Shangguan Xue’er and Shangguan Fei’er, headed over to the Heavenly Bow Battle Team. There were no longer any Rest Houses, so everyone was standing around.</p>
 <p>As Shangguan Xue’er and Shangguan Fei’er walked to the front of Zhou Weiqing, a barrier of faint Heavenly Energy covered them, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er.</p>
 <p>“Is that the power of the Saint Energy?” Shangguan Fei’er asked eagerly.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “Xue’er should have seen it for herself previously, when I summoned the Hell’s Angel. Of course, this time, it was truly an unintentional mistake… the Demon God that I summoned was just too powerful. I believe that even if we consolidate the Saint Core Nucleus, such a summoning is still beyond our abilities. Luckily, the Saint Energy has a inlying self-protection of sorts, otherwise both of us would have been drained to death today.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er took a deep breath and said: “It is truly impressive and shocking. In truth, the previous time, I did not really see you summon the Hell’s Angel. After all, I was fighting at another wall. I could only sense the energy fluctuations of the Hell’s Angel, and see the end results of the Skill. However, today, you have truly let me witness something shocking.”</p>
 <p>At the side, Tian’er burst into giggles as she said: “This time, even your father will no longer have any reason to stop Little Fatty from ‘shooting three birds with one arrow’ right? They have truly witnessed the power of the Saint Energy.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er furrowed her brow slightly and said: “Weiqing, if we knew beforehand that the Dan Dun Battle Team was so strong, to force you to use such a Skill of your own, I would rather you not attend the Heavenly Jewel Tournament.”</p>
 <p>Naturally, Zhou Weiqing knew what she meant, and he smiled faintly as he said: “We cannot hide it forever, and it will eventually be known. So what if the power is known, even if they know about it, trying to sense the Saint Energy or its underlying meaning is not so easy, let alone gaining it for themselves.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er nodded, saying: “That is true, but in the future, you will need to be very careful of the Blood Red Hell. This time, for them to be able to use this Destruction Attribute… it gives me a truly uncomfortable feeling. This matter has also stirred up our entire Heaven’s Expanse Palace, as they are attaching much importance on it. Of course, we cannot see the future, but the recent developments and actions of the Blood Red Hell are extremely suspect, and both we and the Passion Valley are rather unsettled by it all. The entire situation in the south is also so chaotic… at the Heavenly Bow Empire side, you will need to be extremely careful as well.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “When the tournament is over here, I will be heading to the Heavenly Snow Mountain with Tian’er for a while. Do you all want to come with me? As I promised previously, I will help you three consolidate the Saint Core Nucleus.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er sighed gently, shaking her head as she said: “Unfortunately, I do not think it is possible for us to consolidate the Saint Core Nucleus.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing started momentarily. “What? Why?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er said: “The little Saint Energy whirlpool in my body has already dissipated, and only the pure Saint Energy is left.”</p>
 <p>Hearing her words, Zhou Weiqing’s brow furrowed instantly. With Shangguan Xue’er’s talents in cultivation being at the genius level, and how hard she worked, it was not possible that her little Saint Energy whirlpool had dissipated due to her not cultivating. That meant it was definitely a totally different reason.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er continued: “I have thought about it in detail… it should be because I do not have any Saint Attribute. The Saint Energy originates from the gathering and fusion of the four Saint Attributes, and now I believe that only those who have at least a Saint Attribute will be able to maintain a perfect cycle. However, even just this bit of Saint Energy has given me countless benefits, improving my cultivation quality and speed. Even after breaking through to the Heavenly King Stage in the future, if we have some Saint Energy to assist us, it will make things a lot easier.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing thought for a moment before saying: “In that case, it is even more important that you all come with us to the Heavenly Snow Mountain. Towards the Saint Energy, we just do not have sufficiently deep understanding. Only through constant testing and experimentation can we fully unearth more profound secrets. Even if you are unable to form the Saint Core Nucleus, being able to infuse more Saint Energy for you all can only be a good benefit.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er saw Zhou Weiqing’s unreconciled look, and her face broke out in a rare smile. “Wait until you win before we discuss this again, don’t forget we won’t go easy on you!” After saying that, she released the barrier of Heavenly Energy, nodding towards Tian’er before she turned and walked away.</p>
 <p>Before Shangguan Fei’er left, she made a face at Zhou Weiqing, her lips moving in a ‘mouth’ shape.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing could tell that she was telling him ‘Sis is just being outwardly stubborn.’[1. The literal words of that is ‘Mouth’’Hard’, hence the symbolism]</p>
 <p>After the ZhongTian Battle Team left, the BaoPo Battle Team approached them.</p>
 <p>As the BaoPo Battle Team members looked at Zhou Weiqing, their expressions were rather complicated. The leader XiHua and his wife Butterfly Orchid stepped to the front.</p>
 <p>XiHua sighed and said: “Team Leader Zhou, I never expected that after the last tournament where you rose to fame after being the dark horse of the tournament, you would once again repeat the feat this year. Team Leader Zhou, just tell me the truth please. If you are able to repeat what you did today in the upcoming top eight fight, using that Skill, we will surrender directly.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “How can Secret Arts be used so easily? This time, it has taken a huge toll on us as well. As for the top eight fight, it is hard to say who will advance. I can say that the same Skill we used today, we will definitely not be able to use it then. I look forward to have a good spar with your BaoPo Battle Team.”</p>
 <p>XiHua looked deeply at Zhou Weiqing and said: “In that case, when the time comes, please show mercy.”</p>
 <p>After the BaoPo Battle Team left, the WanShou Battle Team were also about to approach and greet them. However, they were stopped by Tian’er, who motioned them to move away. Seizing the opportunity, Zhou Weiqing quickly led the team away, otherwise who knew how long they would be surrounded for.</p>
 <p>If in the previous days, the Heavenly Bow Battle Team was considered a dark horse in the tournament, one that wasn’t considered too strong, then after today’s fights, they had risen to become one of the favourites to seize the championship.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>In order to quickly recover their Saint Energy, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er once again ascended the Heavenly Jewel Island.</p>
 <p>This time, as soon as they reached the top of the island, they ran into a familiar face. Zhan LingTian looked at them coldly, saying passively: “Come with me, the two Palace Masters wish to see the two of you.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing had already anticipated something like this would happen, and he ignored the enmity in Zhan LingTian’s eyes as they followed him. After all, matters of the heart was not something that one could yield easily. Although he did not have any enmity towards Zhan LingTian, being a love rival was something that can’t be helped.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Heaven’s Expanse Palace.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyang and Shangguan Tianyue stood there, looking at the two youths in front of them, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er. At this moment, their hearts were definitely unsettled. The Demon God Projection and the shock it had brought was still there. The higher one’s cultivation was, the greater their impression and sense of the Demon God Projection.</p>
 <p>“Speak then, how did you two do this.” Shangguan Tianyue was direct, asking as he pinned Zhou Weiqing with his gaze.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Honestly speaking, it is not considered ‘difficult’, just infusing Saint Energy into a Skill. I have tested it before, and it seems like any Heavenly King Stage Skill and above, once infused with Saint Energy, there is a chance to ‘revive’ it.”</p>
 <p>He had already told the secret of the Saint Energy to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace Masters, and towards this point, there was no need for him to hide it.</p>
 <p>A flash of surprise appeared in Shangguan Tianyang’s eyes. “What about this Demon God that you summoned today? Where did it come from? What kind of Heavenly Beast did you Store such a Skill from?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing replied: “It is actually an innate Skill, a power that belongs to my bloodline. Perhaps, my bloodline has a trace of the Demon God’s power, which is the reason all of this happened today. In truth, I never expected that we would be able to summon the Demon God Projection.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyang’s eyes were filled with surprise and amazement. At last, after a time, he said slowly: “This Saint Energy truly lives up to its name of being top of everything. It looks like the legend of it being the key to breaking past the Heavenly God Stage to reach a higher state is not impossible! I believe Xue’er should have told you about her Saint Energy whirlpool and how she was unable to sustain it. What do you think about it?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “It is currently impossible for us to know for sure yet, and we can only continue experimenting. After all, we have barely uncovered the uses of the Saint Energy yet. As such, after this Heavenly Jewel Tournament ends, I want to bring them with me. Only by continued testing can we find the problem and any possible solution. Of course, it might be that since Xue’er does not have any Saint Attribute, she is not able to to maintain the Saint Energy whirlpool of her own. Even so, infusing Saint Energy into her will still be a great benefit to her cultivation.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyang’s brow furrowed slightly, as he looked towards Shangguan Tianyue.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyue’s gaze was somewhat unfriendly as he glared at Zhou Weiqing. With a humph, he said: “Wait until you gain the Heavenly Jewel Tournament championship before we speak. This year’s championship is not that easy to achieve, not just something luck can bring you.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Father in Law, do you still not believe in my power?”</p>
