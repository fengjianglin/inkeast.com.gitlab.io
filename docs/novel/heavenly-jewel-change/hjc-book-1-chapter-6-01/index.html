 <p><strong>Chapter 6 – Tourmaline Sacrifice, Alexandrite Cat’s Eye (1)</strong></p>
 <p>What sort of eyes were those? When Shangguan Bing’er stared into the pair of bloodshot eyes, she was suddenly dazed, and a sense of cold ten times stronger than outside the tent assaulted her.</p>
 <p>In the pair of bloodshot eyes lay many negative emotions, ice cold, evil, violence, demonic, and many others she couldn’t identify. Even though her Heavenly Energy Level was not very high, but she was after all a Heavenly Jewel Master. Even so, when she saw the pair of eyes, she felt the world spinning around her, as if her soul was being sucked away by those evil orbs.</p>
 <p>During that moment of being stunned, a great strength was applied onto her, and Shang Gong Bin Er felt her body instantly enveloped in an unyielding embrace. A lady’s inborn protection of her body caused her to clear her mind a little, and as she opened her eyes, she realised that the owner of the pair of bloodshot eyes was indeed Little Fatty Zhou.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing’s body seemed to have grown larger by a full size, all his muscles had expanded considerably, and the surface of skin was glowing with a demonic black-grey tattoo. He seemed to be giving off an unruly and wild aura. The army fatigues he had been wearing had long since been vaporized, only the shiny inner armor was left, supported by his tough muscles. Luckily, the snake sinew was extremely tough and flexible, and the inner armor had not been destroyed by his enlarged body.</p>
 <p>“Let go of me.” Shangguan Bing’er said angrily, trying to make use of her Heavenly Energy to break free of Zhou Weiqing’s embrace. However, at that instance, an evil light flashed in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, and he lowered his head and kissed her on her lips.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er felt a surge of icy cold energy invade her body, and the Heavenly Energy she had been gathering seemed to freeze up and she was unable to manipulate it. What caused her to sink into fear and despair was that within that ice cold, there was a unique animal desire within, that made her whole body to go limp and aching. As her body turned colder, her inner heart suddenly started feeling hotter, the base human desires were sparked by the energy breathed within her.</p>
 <p><em>Sacrificial Offering.</em> In that instance, although Shangguan Bing’er’s consciousness was not very clear anymore, but she subconsciously thought of the 2 words.</p>
 <p>It was a legend; which said that there were a bunch of unique Heavenly Jewel Masters. Though their numbers were few, but they were among the strongest of all the Heavenly Jewel Masters. However, they were the very embodiment of evil. When their Heavenly Jewel Awakened, they would generate a unique attribute alignment which was above other Elemental Attributes. This attribute was called the Evil Attribute, and this Evil Attribute would ignite their own body, causing them to be overcome with bloodlust during their Jewel’s Awakening. At this moment, they required a sacrificial offering to appease the Evil Attribute and stop it from destroying their bodies. The sacrificial offering would usually be the person closest to them – which was likely their closest kin, friends or even lovers. As such, once they had gone through the sacrificial offering and successfully Awakened their Heavenly Jewels, they would have the Evil attribute added to their elemental attributes, becoming a Heavenly Jewel Master who was way above average.</p>
 <p>However, in doing so, the one close to them who was used as the sacrificial offering had no other outcome but death, sometimes even being raped brutally before being killed. This was not under the control of the Awakening Heavenly Jewel Master. In fact, many of these Heavenly Jewel Masters had committed suicide after Awakening and realising what they had done. Even those who did not commit suicide would experience a serious change in personality, becoming a deviant in the Heavenly Jewel Masters’ ranks. Such a group were considered the most terrifying, definitely not people to be trifled with. Shangguan Bing’er had never in her wildest dreams ever imagined that one day this would happen to her.</p>
 <p>Actually, this was because she had not been careful, after all she was only 15 years old. Although she had felt the large energy fluctuation inside the tent earlier, but she had naturally assumed that Little Fatty Zhou who was just Awakening his Jewels could not compare with herself who already had 2 Heavenly Jewels. As such, she did not even activate her Jewels before entering the tent, and had been caught by surprised and subdued by Zhou Weiqing instantly.</p>
 <p><em>This is it, this is the end. Am I just going to die like this? Mommy… mommy… </em>Shangguan Bing’er’s last moments of lucidity was to think of her mother, and 2 rows of tears streamed down her cheeks. The next moment, her body, as well as that of Zhou Weiqing who was embracing her, were both enveloped in a bout of crazed desire.</p>
 <p>The black-grey air-stream emitted out crazily from Zhou Weiqing’s body, and seemed to form a huge cocoon, surrounding and covering his and Shangguan Bing’er’s body.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er’s clothes were torn into shreds and tossed out of the cocoon one by one, and loud, heavy gasps and pants, as well as pained yet happy moans resounded from within the cocoon.</p>
 <p>Creaks and groans issued from Zhou Weiqing’s bones unceasingly, and his internal vital organs were wriggling around, the blood flow in his body was almost five times the usual speed while his body was being remoulded by the evil yet miraculous power. The black tattoos on his skin were now more dense, and green, blue, silver lights were now interlacing the black cocoon.</p>
 <p>After an unknown amount of time, everything settled down, and the red bloodlust in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes seemed to be even stronger. At that moment, he was overwhelmed with the desire to devour the innocent lamb in his arms. It was as if the black pearl wanted to swallow the King Tourmaline. However, just at that point, he saw the 2 gentle, beautiful blue eyes of Shangguan Bing’er.</p>
 <p><em>No, No, I can’t devour her.</em> That was Zhou Weiqing’s last thought, and the next instance he was holding her body tight, and both their bodies started trembling strongly. Zhou Weiqing then fainted from the pleasure of his Jewels Awakening, and everything seemed to fade away as the Jewels formed around his wrists.</p>
 <p>When Shangguan Bing’er came to, the first thing she noticed was a queer smell, then as she started to regain full consciousness, the pain in her body caused her to moan out loud.</p>
 <p><em>What happened to me?</em> Her memories were vague from the time where her consciousness had been fading, and as she opened her eyes dazedly, she realised she was lying on a solid chest. In the next instance, she started to shudder uncontrollably as she realised that both she and the body below were totally naked, and pain was also coming in waves in her lower body.</p>
 <p>As she struggled to support herself in climbing away from Zhou Weiqing, her memory started to return slowly.</p>
