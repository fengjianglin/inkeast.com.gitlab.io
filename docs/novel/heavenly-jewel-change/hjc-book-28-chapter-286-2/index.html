 <p>No. 1 let out a cold snort, “I used to be a Heavenly Emperor, unfortunately, I’ve lost my physical body when I was revived. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been that easy for you to block our attack. Fen Tian will not let you go that easily. Await your impending doom.”</p>
 <p>After he finished his words, two loud bangs were heard. No. 1 and 2 had choose to self-destruct by exploding. The extremely overwhelming destructive black flames erupted in an instant, heading towards Long Shiya.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Because of the shock that no. 1 and 2 gave him, he had let his guard down momentarily. Otherwise, he would never have allowed them to self-destruct that easily.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The six-colored light around Long Shiya formed an enormous vortex, obstructing the black flames with no difficulty. Just like that, no. 1 and 2 vanished without a trace.</p>
 <p>Long Shiya stood there for a moment looking pensive. <em>Heavenly King skeletons? With destructive attributes. Lord Fen Tian is indeed a ruthless person</em>! Very clearly, these skeletons came from the ancestors of the Blood Red Hell. Putting aside how Fen Tian did it, just by virtue of the fact that he dug the remains of the ancestors out from the grave itself was intolerable.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Long Shiya did not waste too much time by staying there for long, as he had no idea how many people Fen Tian sent over. Protecting his precious disciple was his utmost priority.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing, who was in mid-air, seemed to be completely unaffected by everything that was going on. He continued the process of consolidating without experiencing a single feeling from the external world.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With more and more green patterns appearing in the sky, that also gradually brought out its magnificent colors, the jade dragon started shrinking slowly. However, judging from its size, the process of consolidating in the void had just begun.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was hovering in the air, without any facial expression on his face. His eyes looked focused and his hands were moving rhythmically, gradually increasing its speed, speeding up the consolidation process.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the three Shangguan sisters were on the ground. They were certainly affected by the destructive energy from before because it was a lot purer and more powerful than what they had encountered in the past. However, they had consolidated the Saint Core Nucleus before. Even though it was not the actual Saint Core Nucleus, the Saint Energy was not weak. After dispelling the destructive energy for a period of time, they had gradually recovered.</p>
 <p>The duration of consolidation was considered to be very lengthy in the eyes of the outside world. Very quickly, three days had passed. In mid-air, Zhou Weiqing’s eyes were still as focused as before; his body was also as stable as before - it looked as though he had just started consolidating.</p>
 <p>However, anybody with a discerning eye could tell that Zhou Weiqing’ five meter-tall body of energy looked more faded and illusion-like, as compared to how it was like at the start of the process. Clearly, this phenomenon was because of the constant consumption of his energy. However, the jade dragon had already shrunken to two thirds of what it used to be. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Since the consolidating process was very long, none of the powerhouses of the Peerless Sect dared to be careless. Under the mobilization of Long Shiya, they took turns to rest. At the same time, he mobilized a huge number of soldiers within the Heavenly Bow City to guard every corner of it; every single business was temporarily closed. For the sake of Zhou Weiqing’s safety, the Heavenly Bow Empire had spared no pains or effort.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, four days had passed. It had been full seven days but Zhou Weiqing had yet to complete the consolidating process. When the jade dragon had reduced to half its size, Zhou Weiqing speed of consolidation had clearly slowed down. Even though nobody knew what his considerations were, the decrease in speed meant that the whole process would take an even longer time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s energy body had clearly become more faded and illusion-like, to the extent that one could vaguely see his actual body within it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, the only thing that did not change were Zhou Weiqing’s eyes - from the start till the end, they were as focused as ever.</p>
 <p>What shocked everyone was the scroll that was being consolidated in the void. After seven days worth of time, it had more or less taken shape.</p>
 <p>The emerald green light seemed to have formed a huge web in the sky with several strange patterns on it. Every single pattern was complicated yet magnificent.</p>
 <p>If it was an ordinary Consolidating Equipment Scroll, one would be able to see what it was consolidating into from the image on it. However, the one that Zhou Weiqing was currently consolidating was unidentifiable. The patterns appeared to be very consistent, but nobody could tell what kind of Consolidated Equipment it was. It could not possibly be a mere web. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Only Duan Tianlang was aware of the secret behind it as he was the one who designed it. Even Zhou Weiqing, who was crafting it, had no idea what the completed scroll would do for his ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set.</p>
 <p>Duan Tianlang had been observing from down below, not missing a single detail. Even when Long Shiya personally advised him to rest, he had rejected with no hesitation - or rather, his gaze had never left Zhou Weiqing. He had completely ignored Fatty Long.</p>
 <p>Long Shiya felt very helpless - he could only carefully help Duan Tianlang maintain his physical condition using his Heavenly Energy. Fortunately, Zhou Weiqing had done a thorough job fixing Duan Tianlang’s dire physical condition earlier. Even though it greatly drained his body, the impact on his body was not as great as before. It was not life-threatening.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Old Duan, how long more before Weiqing finishes?” asked Long Shiya impatiently.</p>
 <p>Duan Tianlang looked at the sky and gently shook his head, “I have no idea either. This design is harder to complete towards the end as it gets more complicated. As it closely correlated to the start of the process, Zhou Weiqing reduced his speed. However, you don’t have to worry. If Zhou Weiqing is unable to withstand it any longer, no God Tier master in this world will be able to withstand the process of crafting this particular scroll. I have absolute confidence in him. Under the Astral Celestial Territory, a miracle is bound to happen.”</p>
 <p>Another seven days had passed. When 21 days were up, Zhou Weiqing’s wives got very impatient. Even the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya was the same.</p>
 <p>In mid-air, the jade dragon had already lost its dragon form. All that was left was a ball of emerald green light. Zhou Weiqing’s appearance was the main reason why they could not maintain their cool. His original energy body had vanished; even the Astral Celestial Territory had dimmed down a lot. The starlight looked indistinct as well. From the looks of it, it was apparent that he could collapse at any moment. Under such circumstances, nobody was able to tell how much more Zhou Weiqing was able to withstand.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Having revealed his physical body, Zhou Weiqing’s eyes were still full of vigor. However, his face looked pale. As both his hands were moving, his body would tremble slightly from time to time. It was apparent that the whole process was taking a huge toll on his body. Judging from his current speed, he still needed quite a number of days before he could complete consolidating! Hence, everyone was panicking. However, up to this point, Zhou Weiqing had already put in a lot of effort and sacrificed way too much. Nobody dared to advise him to stop.</p>
 <p>Days passed and in the blink of an eye, three days had passed. Zhou Weiqing’s body had started trembling continuously in the sky - only his hands and eyes looked steady and focused.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the sky directly above the Heavenly Bow City, Zhou Weiqing’s figure looked extremely tiny, while the massive emerald green light could be seen radiating all around.</p>
 <p>The Astral Celestial Territory had completely vanished since yesterday. The emerald green scroll that was consolidating in the void seemed like a brand new sky, reflecting a beautiful shade of emerald green above the Heavenly Bow City.</p>
 <p>The consolidation process had came down to its final moment. However, Zhou Weiqing’s speed had reduced to the speed of a snail inching forward.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Tian’er, Shangguan Xue’er, Fei’er, Bing’er and Little Witch were not guarding Zhou Weiqing in the sky. Instead, Long Shiya had taken over. The five women were kneeling before Duan Tianlang. Even though they did not say anything, everyone knew what they were begging for. &nbsp;Even Duan Tianlang could not help but be moved.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Duan Tianlang clenched his teeth and did not make a sound. To him, the scroll was way too important, especially since the consolidation process was in its final stage. Even though Zhou Weiqing’s movements were extremely slow, he was still advancing after all. On Zhou Weiqing’s back, both wings were spread open. At this moment, he was consuming his Life Energy. He was completely supporting himself in one breath with his mind.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this time, Duan Tianlang was not just thinking about himself but Zhou Weiqing as well. In the event that Zhou Weiqing failed, one could imagine the impact on him - he might never be able to make a breakthrough to the Heavenly God Stage. If he succeeded, then the door to the Heavenly God Stage would be wide open for him. Even if he was unable to make a breakthrough immediately, it was only a matter of time, which would not be long.</p>
 <p>As the five women could sense the draining of Zhou Weiqing’s life, they knelt down before Duan Tianlang. They were very clear that the only person within the Heavenly Bow City who could stop him was his Senior Uncle. Not even his father, Admiral Zhou, or his master, the Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya, could stop him.</p>
 <p>The five women continued kneeling night and day, while Zhou Weiqing was on the verge of collapsing in mid-air. It was too difficult for him to complete the consolidation process alone. It was way too difficult. Indeed, Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation base was sufficient. In fact it was more than enough. However, it must not be forgotten that in a way, he was not considered a true God Tier Master! He could only complete such a task, that only God Tier Masters could perform, was because he relied on Time Reversal. When he started crafting the Consolidation Equipment Scroll, the consumption of his Saint Energy was too great, to the extent that the external world could not replenish it. The jade dragon was much more difficult to deal with than expected. Hence, even Duan Tianlang did not expect the difficulty level of this piece of Consolidation Equipment Scroll to be that high.&nbsp;</p>
