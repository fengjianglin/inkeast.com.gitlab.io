 <p><strong>Chapter 251 – Heavenly God Self-Detonation (1)</strong></p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing could see how the Terror Sea Dragon in front of him had actually slowed down due to the Saint Energy he had unleashed. He knew that he had startled the creature… and in truth, all he could was to do his best to scare and deter it, preventing it from daring to act too rashly. Once the battle actually began… given his cultivation base, he couldn’t possibly resist a Heavenly God powerhouse even if he did have Saint Energy reinforcing him.</p>
 <p>And so, Zhou Weiqing didn’t hesitate at all. He immediately unleashed a technique. An enormous Image of an angel of darkness appeared above his head. As soon as it appeared, this pitch-black, six-winged Hell’s Angel completely unleashed a terrifying aura of power from its body.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing poured his Saint Energy into it, holding nothing back. The Hell’s Angel quickly began to materialize, almost instantaneously transforming to become violet-black in color. Now, half of the sea which had been controlled by the Terror Sea Dragon had turned black.</p>
 <p>At this moment in time, Zhou Weiqing was emanating an aura of power that was just as strong as any Heavenly God’s. Even the people who were battling within the Tenebrous Sealing Formation could sense the changes.</p>
 <p>Xuantian Palace Lord Dong Fang and the other Elders all turned to stare, their mouths hanging open. Good heavens! What type of power was this? Had it come from Zhou Weiqing? How did he have such incredible power?</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s actions had completely upended their view of the world… but right now, the only emotion the Xuantian Palace experts felt in response was unmitigated joy. Zhou Weiqing choosing to reveal his true power at such a dangerous moment was like the coming of a savior!</p>
 <p>The only ones who didn’t realize what had just happened were the Tenebrous Demon Dragon and Dreamwake. Both had become completely consumed with this battle, and they were pouring everything they had into assaulting the Terror Sea Dragon within the Tenebrous Sealing Formation.</p>
 <p>The Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s entire body was blood-red, and it was at least twice as strong as it had been earlier. This was the result of its own strength being combined with the vast majority of the Tenebrous Sealing Formation’s strength. It could be said that it had absorbed the majority of the energy from the twelve Xuantian Palace powerhouses as well.</p>
 <p>The Tenebrous Demon Dragon had already enhanced its combat power to an incredible level, especially when combined with Dreamwake’s overwhelming might. The two caused the Terror Sea Dragon to suffer one grievous wound after another. It wasn’t no longer a match for the Tenebrous Demon Dragon, even in a raw physical fight.</p>
 <p>As for the oceans outside the formation? Judging from Zhou Weiqing’s aura, it seemed as though he had completely stopped the enemy Terror Sea Dragon. However, he himself knew that he was nothing more than a paper tiger that could be torn apart at any moment.</p>
 <p>It had to be said that Zhou Weiqing was an extraordinarily lucky person. Right now, his luck was on full display as the Terror Sea Dragon he was facing had just recently reached the Heavenly God stage. It didn’t have a full grasp of what a Heavenly God’s abilities were, and its father had died in the hands of Xuantian Palace. Thus, it felt a great sense of dread towards Xuantian Palace’s powerhouses.</p>
 <p>As a result, as soon as it sensed how Zhou Weiqing was unleashing such a terrifying ripple of energy, it no longer dared to act rashly. Instead, it completely unleashed its own powerful Heavenly Energy and engaged in a stare-down with Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>The fully materialized Hell’s Angel slowly drifted in front of Zhou Weiqing, taking up position there. Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy was now far stronger than it had been in the past. He could maintain the Hell’s Angel Revival with ease.</p>
 <p>“My lord, I am willing to do battle on your behalf.” The voice of the Hell’s Angel boomed out within Zhou Weiqing’s mind. Even he himself felt a bit bedazzled by the mighty power pulsing through it. Originally, he had only wanted to borrow the mighty aura of the Hell’s Angel, but he never would’ve imagined that the Hell’s Angel he summoned would actually be this powerful.</p>
 <p>Due to his mental connection to the angel, Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense that the Hell’s Angel he had just summoned had the power of a true Heavenly Emperor. Perhaps it wouldn’t be able to last too long in battle, but for Zhou Weiqing it represented his combat power increasing several times over.</p>
 <p>This was all due to the Saint Energy! Zhou Weiqing was overjoyed, and he locked his gaze on the distant Terror Sea Dragon. He naturally wasn’t in a rush to send his Hell’s Angel out to attack; so long as he could maintain this deadlock, this battle of auras, that meant the Terror Sea Dragon would be unable to disrupt the Tenebrous Seal Formation. That was Zhou Weiqing’s goal. He definitely didn’t believe he could rely on his Saint Energy to battle against an actual Heavenly Emperor.</p>
 <p>The opposing Terror Sea Dragon’s waves came to a halt as well. It stared at the distant Hell’s Angel, rather hesitant. The aura emanating from the Hell’s Angel was tremendously powerful… but what was even more worrisome was the human who had summoned it.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was now completely covered in silvery-white light, making it impossible for the Terror Sea Dragon to see him clearly. The Saint Energy barrier made it impossible for the dragon to determine exactly what Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation base was, but it could clearly sense that the silvery-white light definitely had the power to annihilate it. Its very soul shuddered at the Attribute of that light.</p>
 <p><em>What type of energy was this</em>? The Terror Sea Dragon had resided in the oceans for countless years, but this was the first time it had ever seen Saint Energy.</p>
 <p>Over ten seconds passed as it hesitated. It could be said that Zhou Weiqing had already managed to buy the Tenebrous Demon Dragon and Dreamwake, who continued to battle within the Tenebrous Sealing Formation, some absolutely precious time.</p>
 <p>A desolate, aggrieved roar suddenly rang out from within the Tenebrous Sealing Formation. The enormous Terror Sea Dragon’s body suddenly slammed hard against the formation as a streak of blood-red light shot out through its tail. A powerful energy shockwave exploded within the formation. The only reason why the Terror Sea Dragon had managed to avoid being destroyed by this attack was because it had used some of its own core essence as well.</p>
 <p>“Gwaaaaaawr!” The Terror Sea Dragon in front of Zhou Weiqing could hold back no longer. If it didn’t go help out, its brother was going to perish within that Tenebrous Sealing Formation. After that happened, what if the humans all turned to focus on it? What could it do?</p>
 <p>The enormous, thousand-meter tidal wave swept forwards once more, spinning through the air to transform into an enormous image of a Terror Sea Dragon which was completely formed by seawater. It reached out, claws bared, to attack Zhou Weiqing and the Hell’s Angel which he had revived.</p>
 <p>This attack was one of the most powerful techniques the Terror Sea Dragon was capable of it. This ‘dragon’ it had created wasn’t simply made out of ocean water; rather, it was completely comprised of pure Water Attribute energies. Only Heavenly Gods were capable of creating such enormous bodies out of energy.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s face instantly grew ugly to behold. Unfortunately, he had no other options; the Terror Sea Dragon had already launched the attack.</p>
 <p>The Hell’s Angel shot forwards like a black streak of light, moving a thousand meters past Zhou Weiqing in an instant. It pointed down with its two hands, causing the black stormclouds to instantly press downwards from the skies. Dense Tenebrous Attribute energies exploded forth as a series of enormous Tenebrous balls of light that were tens of meters in diameter began to fall out of the skies like rainwater towards the head of the enormous water dragon.</p>
 <p>Enormous explosions rang out. Every single enormous dark-violet globe of light kicked up an enormous spray of water as it exploded across the giant water dragon’s body, corroding and destroying small parts of it. Unfortunately, the water dragon was simply far too vast. Even though many balls of violet-black light were smashing against it, they remained unable to damage its true body.</p>
 <p>It reached the Hell’s Angel in the blink of an eye… and it was at this moment that the Hell’s Angel which Zhou Weiqing had summoned revealed its true, terrifying power.</p>
 <p>Its enormous airborne body suddenly began to glow as dense, violet-black demonic clouds began to rise up and swirl around it. It emanated no sounds, but its body suddenly swelled up in size, transforming to become a black globe that was hundreds of meters in diameter which smashed directly against the water dragon.</p>
 <p>Chiiii! An ear-piercing screech rang out, causing Zhou Weiqing to grow dizzy. He could clearly see how the distant water dragon caused that terrifying dark-violet energy to melt away as though it had never been. The Hell’s Angel had used its own body and life to block this attack for Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>It looked as though it should’ve been an even clash, but the end result was clearly not the case. Zhou Weiqing’s Hell’s Angel had used all of its power just now, while the Terror Sea Dragon’s water dragon had merely been a probing attack. The Terror Sea Dragon’s greatest power lay in its body.</p>
 <p>When the Terror Sea Dragon saw how the summoned Hell’s Angel had just been wiped out with ease, it was briefly startled. Finally, it began to understand that this human didn’t seem to be quite as tough as it had imagined!</p>
 <p>It instantly began to move its giant body forwards. To powerhouses like the Terror Sea Dragon, a distance of thousands of meters could be traversed almost instantly. However, just as it began to unleash its full power to destroy Zhou Weiqing and then assault the Tenebrous Sealing Formation, it suddenly felt a strange sensation that caused its entire body to shiver.</p>
 <p>Once again, the terrifying energy radiated from Zhou Weiqing. It was something which rejected the vast heavens themselves, a powerful aura which was ready to annihilate the entire world.</p>
 <p>An enormous figure that was many hundreds of meters tall stood up. This figure was pure gray in color. It looked illusory and insubstantial, but as soon as it appeared the world itself changed.</p>
 <p>The surface of the entire ocean had turned completely gray. Even the heavens had turned gray. Gray… nothing but endless gray, and incomparably evil and cold energies.</p>
 <p>As soon as the vast gray image appeared, the formerly unruly waves instantly turned as calm as the surface of a giant mirror. Not even the slightest ripple could be seen.</p>
 <p>The airborne Terror Sea Dragon which had been floating above the waves instantly dove down towards the ocean. Its very soul was quivering, and all of its courage had been completely frozen and dissipated.</p>
