 <p><b>Chapter 227 Mine, All Mine! (2)</b></p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing sucked in a cold breath. Although he had already guessed that the Lustre Spatial Realm would have an adverse effect on the Heavenly Jewel Island, he had not expected the effects to be so serious.</p>
 <p>“Have you all discovered the root problem that caused the current situation? Also… is there any way to solve it?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er gave a bitter smile as she said: “In truth, the entire Heavenly Jewel Tournament finals entering the Lustre Spatial Realm was a major cover… the true goal was for one person to enter.”</p>
 <p>Comprehension dawned upon Zhou Weiqing as he said: “You mean… me?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er nodded, saying: “Indeed, it is you. Currently, the problems that the entire Lustre Spatial Realm had gone into is a top level secret in our Heaven’s Expanse Palace, and only the absolute core few know about it. Before entering, even Fei’er and Bing’er did not know the true situation. In order to maintain stability, we did not even let the Elders know that the Heavenly Jewel Island is actually facing such a potential major disaster and danger, otherwise undue panic might ensue. After much analysis, Father and Uncle think that you might be the only one who could possibly have a chance to solve the current problem.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded slowly. “I understand now… it is because of the connection between the dragons and myself right?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er nodded, saying: “Yes, exactly. With the current problem and situation the Lustre Spatial Realm is facing, there can only be one explanation… the Dragons. As Heavenly God Tier Heavenly Beasts, perhaps even peak level of such, their strength is without question. It could even be said that the entire existence of the Lustre Spatial Realm is actually to protect the last bloodline of the Dragons. The Dragons living here are definitely the strongest of all Heavenly Beasts in the world. In the past, they always lived peacefully in the Lustre Spatial Realm, and for this to happen now, it can only mean that the Dragons are trying to break free of the Lustre Spatial Realm. Such searing flames, such terrifying Fire Attribute power… only the Dragons are able to release or manipulate it. They are using the powerful Fire Attribute to burn up the entire Lustre Spatial Realm, to destroy it and allow them to break free of the confines.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing gave a bitter smile and said: “Do you really think I will be able to speak to the Dragons, let alone convince them?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er shook her head and said: “Perhaps not convince, but at least a chance to succeed… or just to buy time even.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “I understand, it is to make use of the connection between the Dragons and myself, to at least gain a chance to speak to the Dragons and find out the core problem. After all, the Lustre Spatial Realm has existed for such a long time, but they have never shown any signs of wanting to break free of the realm. There has to be an underlying reason for the sudden change, and you all want to borrow our connection to undergo negotiations, to see if we can help them solve the issues and stop them from the efforts… Right?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er nodded. They were all intelligent people, and there was no need to speak further, as it was clear that was the Heaven’s Expanse Palace’s goal. Looking at Zhou Weiqing, there was a hint of apology in her beautiful eyes. It was because the Heaven’s Expanse Palace could not afford to allow the other members of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace to know about the sheer danger of the Lustre Spatial Realm that they had used such a method of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament to get Zhou Weiqing into the realm, perhaps even using his feelings for the Shangguan Sisters.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er knew it was so, but as the future heir of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, she had no choice but to help it achieve its goals. As such, she now looked at Zhou Weiqing with such apology in her eyes. However, though she wanted to say sorry, this was not a matter that could be solved by a simple apology. As for her clarification that both Shangguan Bing’er and Fei’er did not know about the situation earlier, it was because she was afraid it would affect Zhou Weiqing’s feelings for her two sisters.</p>
 <p>As for herself, Shangguan Xue’er tried not to think too much about it. In her heart, she would eventually have to remain in the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. After all, she was the heir of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace! Furthermore, as the elder sister, she still felt some resistance in stealing the loves of her two little sisters, even if both Shangguan Fei’er and Shangguan Bing’er were willing, as an older sister she was willing that Zhou Weiqing give more love to her sisters.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “Since things have already progressed to such a degree, there is nothing else to be said. No matter what, I am the son in law of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, how could I possibly sit back and watch the Heaven’s Expanse Palace be destroyed like that? Furthermore, the Dragons have helped me in the past… This matter, I will definitely do my best.”</p>
 <p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, Shangguan Xue’er started momentarily, her eyes reddening slightly. “You… you don’t blame me?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at her in surprise, saying: “Blame you? Blame you for what? Why should I blame you, did you do anything wrong?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er looked at him and said: “But… I did not tell you the truth of the situation, and tricked you to enter such a dangerous place…”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Don’t use the word tricked… it isn’t that serious. I am a man after all, I’m not so petty. Furthermore, you are still the heir to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, there is no wrong in thinking about the Heaven’s Expanse Palace right? Since I am going to be your man, naturally I have to think for you on your behalf, and also as your future husband, naturally I also have to help you solve your problems as well right? More so, I treat the Dragon Family as friends… since they might be in trouble, even if you did not ask me to come, I would also do so. You do not have to think so much…”</p>
 <p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, at the side, Shangguan Fei’er and Shangguan Bing’er breathed a sigh of relief. It was indeed true that they only knew the truth about the Lustre Spatial Realm after entering it, but they were extremely worried that Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Xue’er’s relationship would be affected. They knew that because of their relationships, Zhou Weiqing would definitely help the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, but they did not want this to cause any cracks in Zhou Weiqing’s heart and affect the future feelings between the two. Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words now, they were at least more relieved.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er looked at Zhou Weiqing, tears hazy in her eyes. If not for the fact there were so many people around, she really felt like jumping into Zhou Weiqing’s arms and have a good cry. At this point, the way she looked at Zhou Weiqing seemed to be somewhat different than usual.</p>
 <p>Although in the past she liked Zhou Weiqing, due to the responsibilities of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, she had always tried to keep a certain distance from Zhou Weiqing. Even when she had lost that bet, in her thinking, as soon as Zhou Weiqing met Bing’er again, it would all be fine. She had never really thought that she would really end up together with Zhou Weiqing, after all the responsibilities on her were just too heavy.</p>
 <p>From the time she was born, she had been raised and trained as the future heir of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. All these years, it could be said that almost everything she had done was for the Heaven’s Expanse Palace.</p>
 <p>This time, her heart had really been in despair, thinking that this would be the event that tore them apart… and she would never leave the Heaven’s Expanse Palace again, continuing to be her heir.</p>
 <p>However, she had never expected that when she was enduring all her sorrow and telling Zhou Weiqing the truth of the matter, all she got was just so simple and direct, an answer that caused her heart to shudder.</p>
 <p>He had not tried to shirk the responsibilities, there was no anger, not even an admonishing look, but a full on support without questions. In that instant, Shangguan Xue’er felt like her heart was fully given, totally to Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>What did a person truly need? Especially someone like Shangguan Xue’er who was bearing such a heavy responsibility. What she needed was understanding. Those words by Zhou Weiqing were not tender words of love, but the understanding in them had touched her to the core.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing stepped up to her, hugging her tight abruptly. “Silly girl, what is there to cry about. If you are really touched by me, when we get out of the Lustre Spatial Realm, you can marry me then. I won’t mind at all, heh heh.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er lifted her head to look at Zhou Weiqing. At this moment, she did not look at all like the heir of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. In tears, she said: “You really don’t blame me? Why would you trust me like that?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Why shouldn’t I trust you? Since I have a chance to solve this issue, then you could have just told me about it before entering, using the three of you to lure me in. You did not have to enter alongside me, to risk yourselves, but all all came anyway without hesitation, to share the danger with me. Is there any need to speak any further? Furthermore, I have already said everything I need to earlier, my trust in you all is absolute.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er had somehow appeared right next to Zhou Weiqing, giving his waist a savage pinch as she said: “You… naughty fellow… &nbsp;you really know how to steal someone’s heart.”</p>
 <p>Although her words were savage, her red eyes betrayed her true feelings right then.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily once more, opening his arms and pulling both Fei’er and Xue’er into his arms. Looking towards Bing’er and Tian’er, he said tyrannically: “Mine, all mine!”</p>
 <p>Such a shameless proclamation, it naturally induced the four girls to ‘treat’ him to a flurry of punches. However, none of them would actually say anything to rebut it. In this fiery red hot world, their hearts seemed to have been melted together as one. Originally, their nervous feelings from the danger had somehow relaxed.</p>
 <p>With the painful yet joyful cries of Zhou Weiqing ringing in the air, the laughter finally stopped. The gazes of the four girls landed upon him, and Shangguan Xue’er blushed as she looked at him with a gaze that made him melt. “Alright, what do we do next, you take charge.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “I can sense the source of the flames. Let us head over there to look first. You all be very careful, as soon as anything seems amiss, I want you to immediately use the Lustre Gem to leave.”</p>
 <p>The five of them continued on their journey once more, with Zhou Weiqing at the head of the party, and Tian’er beside him. With the protection of the Ice Heart Pearl, they no longer needed to use their Heavenly Energy to protect themselves from the temperature, and thus their speed of advancement increased greatly. The three shangguan Sisters followed behind the two of them, as they all advanced towards the source Zhou Weiqing could sense.</p>
 <p>As they moved along, the flames around them began to change in colour. The originally red flames turning darker, so much so that they were no longer able to see much around them, as if they were immersed in magma. The zone of icy mist around them from the Ice Heart Pearl was also starting to shrink around them, and Shangguan Xue’er actually had to start infusing her Heavenly Energy into the Pearl to ensure that it was sufficient to protect all five of them.</p>
