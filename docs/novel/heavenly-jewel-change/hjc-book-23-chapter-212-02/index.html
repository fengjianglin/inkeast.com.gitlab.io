 <p><b>Chapter 212 Spatial Collapse! (2)</b></p>
 <p>Seeing that sight, Shangguan Tianyue’s expression truly changed. Even if it were him, he dared not say that he could use a single Skill to force Shangguan Tianyang to stagger back one step! Yet, Zhou Weiqing had actually done so, and it was even after he had said what Skill he was about to use.</p>
 <p>“What a powerful Saint Energy that is.” Shangguan Tianyang couldn’t help but suck in a cold breath as he expelled the Heavenly Dao Energy around his body. However, when he looked at Zhou Weiqing again, his expression was very different, as if he was looking at the greatest treasure in the world. All along, he was extremely calm and impassive, never showing any of his emotions; but at this moment his eyes showed earnest hope.</p>
 <p>“Saint Energy… so that is the Saint Energy? This is the result of you infusing that Saint Energy into your Spatial Rend Skill?” Shangguan Tianyang asked the series of questions urgently.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded, saying: “When I first got the Saint Energy, we went through a series of tests. I discovered that the Saint Energy could be infused into any Skill. Furthermore, it would cause a qualitative change in any Skill it was infused in, but the issue is that I am currently unable to control the type of change. More accurately speaking, the stronger the Skill originally, the greater the requirement of Saint Energy it has, and the amount of Saint Energy infused also determines the extent of change in terms of power.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyang nodded, saying: “This Saint Energy is definitely one that is above all other Attributes, powerful and domineering. Just now, when your Skill landed on me, I had the feeling of my Heavenly Energy being absorbed and turned, as if my Heavenly Energy was also being used by the Saint Energy against myself. Although its strength was far from enough… but if you can cultivate it to a greater level, perhaps any other energy or attribute will quail before it.”</p>
 <p>With his status as the Heaven’s Expanse Palace Master, for Shangguan Tianyang to have such high praise for the Saint Energy, one could imagine the shock in his heart currently.</p>
 <p>Although it was just a short and simple attack, the impression it had left on him was deep and lasting. Shangguan Tianyang had discovered that for his own Elemental Jewels, facing this Skill that was infused with Saint Energy, he could sense that they were slightly suppressed. It had to be known that although it was just a minor suppression, the gap between him and Zhou Weiqing was just too huge, and for any sort of suppression to happen was already considered pretty unbelievable, showing the gap in levels between the Attributes. It was similar to the previous case on the Heavenly Snow Mountain where Zhou Weiqing had used his Dragon-Tiger Transformation’s bloodline superiority to suppress those Heavenly Beasts whose cultivation level was far above his.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “I have only just touched and explored the surface of the Saint Energy. According to my estimations, we need to at least reach the Heavenly King Stage before we can truly dig into the true profound secrets of the Saint Energy. However, there is one thing I am certain of; once I can use this Saint Energy to form the Heavenly Core Nucleus at the Heavenly King Stage, in the future when I am attempting to breakthrough to the Heavenly Emperor or even Heavenly God Stages, there will no longer be any bottlenecks or barriers for me.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyang nodded and said: “That is very possible. I have to say, this Saint Energy of yours is very convincing indeed. Tianyue, please bring Xue’er here to join us.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyue nodded. He gave Zhou Weiqing a strange glance before disappearing from the hall.</p>
 <p>When Shangguan Tianyue left, only Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Tianyang were left in the hall. At this point, the Heaven’s Expanse Palace Master had regained his usual impassive self.</p>
 <p>Looking at Zhou Weiqing, Shangguan Tianyang suddenly said: “Weiqing, if you are willing to join the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, I can make the decision now to marry Bing’er, Fei’er and Xue’er to you as your wives. What do you say?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s heart leaped for a moment, but he kept silent. After a moment’s thought, he shook his head resolutely, saying: “Uncle, I’m afraid that will be impossible.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyang’s gaze turned cold, and a sudden pressure caused Zhou Weiqing to subconsciously stagger back a few steps. He had to focus all his strength to even withstand the sheer pressure.</p>
 <p>“Why do you say it is impossible? You should know what this Saint Energy means. If I am not able to use it, I just need to kill you off here… at least to ensure that you will not act against the Heaven’s Expanse Palace in the future.”</p>
 <p>A thick killing intent surrounded Zhou Weiqing, causing his blood to almost freeze. In front of this Heavenly Emperor Stage powerhouse, even if he had the Saint Energy, there was no chance for him to resist.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, why don’t you let me analyze it for you before you jump to conclusions.” Zhou Weiqing said calmly. Currently, he was not flustered at all, even facing Shangguan Tianyang’s pressure… as if he had turned into someone else.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyang looked at him with some surprise, but was nodding in approval inwardly. With his experience and sight, he could easily see that Zhou Weiqing had already long thought of all possibilities happening before speaking of the Saint Energy, and it was not some last minute rash decision. He definitely had a full plan up his sleeve.</p>
 <p>“Speak then.” The pressure slowly withdrew, and Shangguan Tianyang resumed his benevolent elder pose.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “Uncle, in truth, it is not a big deal for me to join the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. In the first place, once I marry Bing’er, Fei’er and Xue’er, I can be considered the son in law of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, and we are all a family. I don’t have any issues against joining the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. However, have you thought about it closely at all Uncle. Once I join the Heaven’s Expanse Palace… what will it bring. I dare say that it will be the destruction of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace once and for all.”</p>
 <p>“Oh? Weiqing, are you exaggerating things with such alarmist speak.” Shangguan Tianyang said with a faint smile.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head and said: “I am definitely not exaggerating things at all. There are several reasons. First of all, this Saint Energy is not something that I can cultivate on my own, and I need Tian’er’s full cooperation to do so. And Tian’er is the only daughter of the Heavenly Snow Mountain. Even if you have the ability to kill her, she will never join the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. To this point, you can’t possibly deny it right? Without her, I am unable to continue cultivating the Saint Energy, so then what will be the point of me joining the Heaven’s Expanse Palace?”</p>
 <p>“Next, the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord also knows about the Saint Energy. Once I proclaim that I have joined the Heaven’s Expanse Palace… what will he think? Naturally, he knows the power of the Saint Energy. At that time, he just needs to proclaim and spread the word of the Saint Energy. At that time, I can guarantee that I will no longer have the chance to reach the Heavenly King Stage… and all we can do is wait for the Heavenly Snow Mountain to gather all the other Great Saint Lands to charge up the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and destroy us all.”</p>
 <p>“I am the Heaven’s Expanse Palace’s son in law, but I am also the Heavenly Snow Mountain’s son in law. As such, no matter which side I join, the other side will never let me go. As such, the only choice I have is to stay neutral, to never join either side or to help either side… to ensure that I am individual and separate. This is the only way that both sides will accept. I have already promised the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord that in the future, I will no longer join in the fight between the ZhongTian Empire and WanShou Empire… naturally I am also unable to join in any fight between the two Great Saint Lands. In such a circumstance, at least in the future, even if I become a powerhouse, I will not pose any danger to both your Great Saint Lands… after all I am still your son in laws. Even if I build up a new Great Saint Lands in the future, I will never forget the aid that the Heaven’s Expanse Palace has given me.”</p>
 <p>These words, Zhou Weiqing spoke with honesty and conviction, and Shangguan Tianyang also paid full attention to them.</p>
 <p>“Forming a new Great Saint Lands… Weiqing, looks like your ambitions are not small after all!” Shangguan Tianyang smiled faintly as he said.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing shrugged and said: “Who knows, no one can tell what will happen in the future. However, if it were just myself, I would rather enjoy a simple and easygoing life, just bringing my wives to wander the land, to explore it and be carefree. We humans only have one life, and my dream has always been to experience everything possible, to see all the various beautiful sceneries of the world, the taste all the delicious food possible in the world.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyang sighed faintly and said: “That is indeed a wonderful life. However, in the future you will understand… many times things are not as easy as we wish them to be.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed and said: “As long as one is willing to let go, there is nothing difficult.” [1. Cue the Frozen Theme song!]</p>
 <p>A hint of surprise flashed in Shangguan Tianyang's eyes. "Let go? Let go... what a good phrase indeed, to let go. However, can one truly let go? I have to admit that today, you have convinced me. However, whether or not you can really marry Bing'er, Fei'er and Xue'er, it will still be up to your final abilities and efforts."</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, Shangguan Tianyue appeared in a brilliant flash of light in the hall, along with Shangguan Xue’er.</p>
 <p>When Shangguan Xue’er saw Zhou Weiqing, her gaze wavered slightly, but she did not speak at all, not even looking at his eyes. Instead, she walked towards Shangguan Tianyang and curtseyed before standing respectfully at the side.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyang said: “Tianyue, Bing’er, Fei’er and Xue’er are your daughters… naturally their marriage will be under your charge, I will not intervene. Xue’er, its not often that Weiqing gets to come to the Heavenly Jewel Island, you can bring him around to look around. However, one thing I have to stress… in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, you all can’t go easy. Haha.”</p>
 <p>Hearing Shangguan Tianyang’s words, both Shangguan Tianyue and Shangguan Xue’er gave obvious looks of surprise. The underlying meaning behind his words were extremely clear, he had been convinced by Zhou Weiqing, and would not interfere in the relationship between Zhou Weiqing and the three sisters. As the Heaven’s Expanse Palace Master, his attitude could even represent the entire Heaven’s Expanse Palace.</p>
 <p>After saying all that, Shangguan Tianyang nodded towards Zhou Weiqing before moving off.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyue looked at Zhou Weiqing with a bleak, overcast expression, saying: “Stinking brat, don’t think that just because you have convinced my big brother, I will also agree to marry my three daughters to you…”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing quickly said with a flattering smile: “Of course, that is natural. Xue’er and her sisters, their marriage is definitely according to what you say.”</p>
 <p>“Hmph, its good that you know it. You better complete these two things well first before coming to ask for their hand in marriage again. First of all, this year’s Heavenly Jewel Tournament, you and your Heavenly Bow Empire have to gain the final championship. Our ZhongTian Battle Team will not go easy on you, so don’t think this will be an easy task. If you can accomplish this, I will allow my three daughters to follow you out. When you help them complete the so-called Saint Core Nucleus that you speak of, then you can actually marry them. That is the second condition.”</p>
 <p>Hearing Shangguan Tianyue’s words, Zhou Weiqing was instantly overjoyed. Without question, he knelt down before Shangguan Tianyue, kowtowing three times again. This swift, unhesitant and flowing action gave even Shangguan Xue’er a fright. Although the saying goes that men have gold under their knees [2. Literal translation - basically means men should not kneel easily], kneeling to one’s father in law was a serious matter. After all, one can only kneel to the heavens, the earth and one’s parents.</p>
