 <p><b>Chapter 116 Joining! Shangguan Fei’er! (3)</b></p>
 <p>Seeing Zang Lang and the others setting up camp, Lin TianAo nodded inwardly. Although Zang Lang and the others’ cultivation level was very low, but they were fast and orderly in their setting up of camp, with every detail impeccable. They truly lived up to being top graduates of the Fei Li Military Academy. Perhaps in one versus one combat, they were not great, but in terms of leading troops and various military knowledge, Lin TianAo was sure that those who graduated from the Heavenly Jewel Academy like himself were no match for them. At the same time, he was also marveling at how Zhou Weiqing had been able to let these talents follow him with such trust and faith. Zhou Weiqing was not even twenty years old, and he already had such charisma and leadership. When he was older… what would he grow into?</p>
 <p>Very soon, the camp was ready, and the tents that they had purchased on the way had been set up. They did not light a fire, instead taking out dry rations to eat.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er sat beside Zhou Weiqing, sneaking glances at this future brother in law of hers.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing sat there quietly, his eyes calm and placid as he looked to be deep in thought. No matter what angle one looked at him, Zhou Weiqing was not considered to be a very handsome young man, but he was tall, muscular and well built, and was slowly growing to have the unique flavour of a grown man. Shangguan Fei’er did not know why, although her own power was currently beyond his, but just sitting beside him, she felt a strange sense of security and peace.</p>
 <p>If at this moment, it was Shangguan Bing’er beside Zhou Weiqing, then she would definitely lean into him as she sat down, enjoying the comfort and security of his broad shoulders. However, Shangguan Fei’er could not do that; although she was from the same parents, her character was extremely different. Sitting a while was alright, but she would not be able to stay still for a long time.</p>
 <p>“Oei, let’s practice actual combat.” Shangguan Fei’er nudged Zhou Weiqing after a while.</p>
 <p>“Actual combat?” Zhou Weiqing looked at her warily. “Are you trying to take revenge on me?”</p>
 <p>Towards Shangguan Fei’er’s power, he had a very deep impression of it, and a deep ingrained wariness.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er replied angrily: “Why do you always think the worst of me? I am after all your future sister in law, what is there to take revenge about? I just want to practice a bit, to learn from each other by exchanging notes in actual combat… Don’t you think that your close combat fighting skills are a little too lacking?” 0</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at her helplessly. Weak? In the entire younger generation of the whole mainland, perhaps only Shangguan Fei’er could say that his close combat fighting skills were weak. After all, in comparison to a Mutated Duo Physical Jewel like hers, his close combat fighting skills were indeed lacking.</p>
 <p>Towards such a point, Zhou Weiqing truly admired, and even respected, Shangguan Fei’er. Just in terms of close combat fighting ability alone, she leaps and bounds ahead of him. Indeed, if he were to learn some fighting techniques and skills from her, it would undoubtedly benefit him greatly.</p>
 <p>“Now is not the time, you know this is the Ghost Demon Forest right… any Heavenly Beast might pop up at any time. If one attacks us suddenly, and our Heavenly Energy is drained in our practice, what do we do?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s words were truth. Amongst the entire group, Shangguan Fei’er was definitely the most powerful, with Zhou Weiqing and Lin TianAo behind her. Although Zhou Weiqing’s personal combat strength was not the strongest, but he was of the greatest use in the party; not just for coordination and harmonizing all of them, but also because he had many powerful Control and Support Skills. With these control and support skills, he could raise the entire power level of the whole team.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er grinned happily and said: “That’s okay, we can fight without Heavenly Energy. After all, we are practicing close combat techniques, and we do not need to use Heavenly Energy at all, just purely our bodies and abilities. How about that?”</p>
 <p>“En?” Upon hearing that, the perverted Zhou Little Fatty’s eyes lit up, as he eyed her body with obvious ‘ill intentions’.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, bastard, what nonsense are you thinking about?” Being stared at like that by him, Shangguan Fei’er’s face turned red. That rascal, he was always looking at her like that, how could Bing’er fall for him!</p>
 <p>“Are you a man or not? Do you want to train or not? Hurry up and make up your mind!” Shangguan Fei’er said huffily.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing gave a humph of his own as he said: “Actual combat… so be it. We’ll have to move a little further from the camp site. We have to agree first though, no using Heavenly Energy, Consolidated Equipment or Stored Skills!”</p>
 <p>In his heart, he was thinking, how could he be afraid of her? Although in terms of cultivation level he was no match for her, and her own techniques were likely better than his, he was still very confident in his sheer physical strength. He trusted in being able to use pure strength and power in to overcome any techniques. After all, as the name of his own Legendary Set suggested, as long as one had enough strength, they would hate the fact that the earth did not have a pull lever. Such a feeling was definitely incomparable.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er stood up, walking to the trees at the side. Zhou Weiqing gave Lin TianAo a signal to inform him that he wouldn’t be heading out far, before following suit.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing had just entered the trees behind her when he heard her shout out loud: “I’m coming!”</p>
 <p>Before Zhou Weiqing even had the time to think lewdly to himself about the other possible meaning of the phrase, a faint fragrance had entered his senses.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er had charged directly towards Zhou Weiqing. However, without her Consolidated Bracer-Gloves, her slim little hands did not seem to pose much threat.</p>
 <p>Her hands instantly grabbed out towards both his shoulders, and her entire body was like a swooping swallow. Along with her words earlier, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but daydream that she was flinging herself at him.</p>
 <p>“Come on.” Zhou Weiqing grinned, replying shamelessly. He knew his own Flexibility and Coordination was no match for Shangguan Fei’er’s, and did not bother attempting to dodge her blow, instead lifting both his hands towards hers to force it into a match of strength.</p>
 <p>As the four hands were about to meet, all of a sudden, her actions changed, her body dipping downwards in a strange position, and her hands also dipping down abruptly.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s reaction was not slow as well, as he quickly took a half step back, both hands elbowing downward in mid motion in an attempt to strike at her incoming arms, in an attempt to force her to be unable to attack him.</p>
 <p>A faint smile tugged at Shanggaun Fei’er’s lips. She was originally already with the exact same look as Shangguan Bing’er, and with that faint smile, it was almost as if Bing’er was right in front of him.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s heart softened momentarily, and the strength he used subconsciously lowered.</p>
 <p>Alas, at the same time, Shangguan Fei’er moved swiftly. Her feet did not move, but her upper body suddenly leaned backward slightly, barely half a chi, but her hands turned from a grabbing motion to a lifting motion, and in a lightning swift strike, her index fingers and middle fingers of both hands had struck down on Zhou Weiqing’s elbows.</p>
 <p>A human’s elbow was extremely tough, but at the center of the joints, there was a weak point known as the funny bone. Normally, one would not touch it, but if it was struck, it would give a momentary numbness. This time, Shangguan Fei’er had obviously struck it on purpose.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing felt as if his entire body was struck by lightning, and both his arms flopped down momentarily as he lost control of them. At that moment, Shangguan Fei’er advanced a step, her hands gripping Zhou Weiqing’s strength-less wrists, and once more her fingers pressed down onto the meridian points on his wrists, causing the numbness to spread from his arms to his body. The next moment, Shangguan Fei’er had made use of his second moment of weakness to pull backwards on his hands as she leaped backwards, her entire body topping back as her right leg lifted up right into Zhou Weiqing’s chest muscles. *Swoosh* Zhou Weiqing was sent flying all the way back to land hard on the ground.</p>
 <p>*Peng* Zhou Weiqing’s body flew almost five yards before landing savagely on a tree, sliding down slowly.</p>
 <p>Without the usage of Heavenly Energy, with Zhou Weiqing’s physique, he was naturally not injured by such a throw and fall. Even so, he lay spreadeagled for a moment, stunned.</p>
 <p>A peal of laughter came from Shangguan Fei’er as she turned around to see him clambering up from the ground. She waggled a finger at him, as if saying <i>In terms of close combat, you are no match for me!</i></p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing gave an angry humph, and his right leg exerted a sudden burst of power, and his entire body pounced forward like an angry tiger towards Shangguan Fei’er. This time, he learned his lesson, his hands held before his chest as he gathered all his physical strength, his muscles tightened as he locked his eyes on Shangguan Fei’er in preparation for any move she made.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er revealed a cunning grin in her eyes. Facing Zhou Weiqing’s reckless charge, she did not retreat, instead advancing forward. Lifting her right leg like a battle axe, she swung it towards his head, the motion so smooth and swift, a perfect marriage of strength and flexibility.</p>
 <p>Seeing Shangguan Fei’er’s leg strike down, Zhou Weiqing did not bother dodging. At such a moment, he still couldn’t help himself as he thought: <i>If she was wearing a dress, what kind of sight would this be!</i></p>
 <p>*Peng* Shangguan Fei’er’s right leg smashed down savagely on his left shoulder, causing him to grit his teeth in pain. Although she did not have the Strength Attribute, she was after all already at the six-Jeweled stage, and the boost to her physique was no laughing matter.</p>
 <p>However, this time, Zhou Weiqing had taken the blow on purpose. After all, he knew that with Shangguan Fei’er’s flexibility and coordination, under any normal circumstance, he would not be able to touch her.</p>
 <p>The reason why he had taken the blow on purpose was because he had already judged and planned his next move. The very instant that her leg struck him, his hand shot out like a bolt of lightning, grabbing onto her calf.</p>
 <p>If she had not kicked him, with Shangguan Fei’er’s reaction speed, she would have definitely been able to dodge his hands. However, when her leg struck onto Zhou Weiqing’s shoulder, the rebounding force from his tightened muscles had caused her movement to slow imperceptibly, and it was just that tiny lapse in movement that had allowed Zhou Weiqing to succeed.</p>
 <p>Although it was through her pants, when Zhou Weiqing’s hands grasped onto Shangguan Fei’er’s calf, he could feel the startling elasticity of her smooth skin, giving him a surprise.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er and Shangguan Bing’er were sisters, triplets even, and they looked exactly the same. However, the feeling of their bodies were totally different indeed.</p>
