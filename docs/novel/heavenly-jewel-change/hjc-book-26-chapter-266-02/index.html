The Peerless Heavy Cavalry had competed with them before, and they actually needed two or more Peerless Heavy Cavalry soldiers to deal with a single Snow Deer Tribe Heavy Cavalry soldier. Perhaps, in terms of pure strength, both sides were pretty equal. However, in terms of Cavalry fighting techniques, the Snow Deer Heavy Cavalry soldiers were far stronger than the Peerless Cavalry soldiers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, these three thousand five hundred Heavy Cavalry soldiers were lined up in a single file formation, slowly advancing to the frontlines.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Between every two Heavy Cavalry soldiers, there was about five metres of space. This was not empty, as five Heavy Infantry soldiers filled the vacant space. Behind these Heavy Infantry soldiers, there would be five of the Power Archer Battalion archers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Kalise Empire armies were already in a mess, even as the Peerless armies slowly advanced as one. Let alone the Kalise armies, even the Bai Da armies would be hard pressed to form a proper defense against them. Even if it was under normal circumstances, facing such an elite troop like these Heavenly Bow Empire forces, could they even hold out?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From the distance, one could see large numbers of soldiers streaming out from the burning camp in a fluster. At this moment, a shrill cry rang out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Power Archer Battalions and the Peerless Archers above had begun the slaughter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Land and air, the criss cross of arrows perfectly locked on to all the enemy figures that could be seen, piercing them instantly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The terror in the hearts of the Kalise and Bai Da soldiers was unimaginable. In this direct clash on the battlefield, Ming Yu had only sent nearly three Regiments of soldiers out. Of course, these three Regiments were the finest, most elite warriors of the entire Heavenly Bow Empire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides them, all of the other light and heavy cavalry, and archers, had been split into two groups before they even moved out, taking a long route to flank the enemies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had all been prepared with mounts, and the Heavy Cavalry soldiers had even seized the opportunity last night to route around a long distance. Ming Yu’s goal was clear; this battle, he did not just want a victory, he wanted a crushing victory, to kill off all the enemies.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In truth, as soon as the Kalise and Bai Da encampment went ablaze, there was pretty much no more suspense about the victory of this battle. The total army strength of the Kalise and Bai Da forces combined was around two hundred thousand, but they were now fully surrounded by the one hundred fifty thousand strong army of the Heavenly Bow Empire. The die was cast, and the outcome was already a foregone conclusion.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bathed in the Divine energies, one by one the officials of the Heavenly Bow Empire slowly awoke from the deep sleep the Fate Denying Seal had placed them in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The gentle warmth of the Divine energies were nourishing and enriching their bodies, causing to feel an indescribable comfort. When they opened their eyes, they were surprised to see that they were in a strange, gold and brilliant world. Due to the gold light being too powerful, they were not able to see what was outside clearly at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The passage of time of these few years… to them it was just like the dream of nanke <a href="#footnote_1">[1]</a>. In one instant, they had just seen Admiral Zhou using the Fate Denying Seal and sacrificing himself. In the next instant, they had just woken up so suddenly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Lingfeng looked around, his gaze still rather confused. Seeing all his government officials there, still recovering, in that moment he was rather stunned, unable to speak.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His emotions were still at the point where Admiral Zhou was resolutely choosing to unleash the Fate Denying Seal. Sorrow and pain rose in his heart, and he muttered: “It’s all my fault… this Emperor was just too useless. Admiral… Big Bro…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Subconsciously, Di Lingfeng looked around in search for Admiral Zhou, but all he saw was the patch of gold all around.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Zihan had also woken up at this point, looking in astonishment at the gold light surrounding them. “Could it be, we have already ascended to the heavens? This doesn’t look like hell right? Shui Niu, Shui Niu, where are you?” The last few words, she was literally shouting out loud.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking about how her husband had chosen to use the Fate Denying Seal to preserve the last strand of hope of the Heavenly Bow Empire, Ling Zihan’s eyes welled up in tears.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sis-in-law, calm down first. The situation doesn’t seem right!” Di Lingfeng quickly stepped forward to support Ling Zihan, who had almost fallen down in her haste to go look for Admiral Zhou.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Lingfeng was after all an Emperor, and he quickly calmed down far faster than any ordinary person. He had just pinched himself savagely, the pain telling him that they were still alive. Although they were surrounded by this brilliant golden glow, as he looked around, it was still his familiar palace hall!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right at that moment, the surrounding gold light slowly faded, revealing the pitch black night skies. The Heavenly Bow Empire officials involuntarily stared up into the skies, and the first thing that entered their eyes were a beautiful goddess in a white gown, hovering in midair. It was Tian’er.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Silver hair, purple eyes, glowing with gold light. Wasn’t this a goddess descended from the heavens? Furthermore, that blinding gold light was retreating in her direction.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that moment, all of the Heavenly Bow Empire officials couldn’t help but stare, stunned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Did she rescue us? Let alone the officials, even Di Lingfeng almost knelt down in obeisance upon sensing the thick divine aura from Tian’er.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, a vigorous booming voice rang out. “Do not kneel.” In the air, six coloured lights appeared suddenly, and the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya appeared beside Tian’er, supporting her. Without her Skills active, Tian’er’s current cultivation was not sufficient for her to fly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It had to be known, the original Heavenly Bow Empire’s strongest Heavenly Jewel Master was Admiral Zhou. Before using the Fate Denying Seal, his cultivation had only just broken through the nine-Jeweled stage. As such, the Heavenly Bow Empire officials had never seen a powerhouse flying on their own power. In that instant, they did not know if the current situation was good or not.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Di Lingfeng was still considered rather calm, his gaze quickly finding Admiral Zhou. However, currently Admiral Zhou was in someone’s embrace, and they were both surrounded by brilliant astral light. This was clearly not something they could interfere in.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“May I please ask who Senior is?” Di Lingfeng asked respectfully towards Long Shiya.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The reason why Long Shiya asked them not to kneel was naturally because of Tian’er. If a father-in-law and mother-in-law actually knelt down and paid obeisance to their daughter-in-law, wouldn’t it cause an awkward situation in the future?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Shiya laughed heartily as he supported Tian’er down to the ground to land in front of them. “You all do not to be so anxious, there is nothing to worry about. I’m that little brat Zhou Weiqing’s Master, and I’m here together with him to help him save the Heavenly Bow Empire.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Such a simple sentence from Long Shiya, but Di Lingfeng’s entire body shook as he was totally stunned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was real… they were really here to rescue us?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ling Zihan’s eyes widened, as tears welled up. “Weiqing, my Little Fatty, where’s my Little Fatty? Sir, where is Weiqing?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Shiya pointed into the skies as he said: “There, isn’t he right there? He is currently saving his father. You are Weiqing’s mother right? You have given birth to an amazing son.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Shiya’s age was more than enough for him to be Ling Zihan’s grandfather, but due to his relationship with Zhou Weiqing, he treated her as one of the same generation. Of course, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor had never really cared about such things.&nbsp;</span></p>

Ling Zihan subconsciously gripped her fists, biting her lips. These were the two most important men in her life!</span></p>

Almost in a flash, they appeared by their side.&nbsp;</span></p>

Shangguan Bing’er had been the hope of the Heavenly Bow Empire! Yet, how was there three of her in front of him right now?&nbsp;</span></p>

You have all been Sealed in the Fate Denying Seal all this time. Under Weiqing’s leadership, we have finally gathered enough power to counterattack the Heavenly Bow Empire. Our armies are now launching their attack against the Heavenly Bow City to reclaim it. I believe that in within the next few days, we will have reclaimed our Empire once more.”&nbsp;</span></p>

He could hardly believe all of this was real. It just felt like a few moments ago, he had been in utter despair, Emperor of a dead Empire!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shangguan Bing’er nodded seriously, saying: “It is real.

Instantly, their conversation stopped, as their gazes focused on that ball of light.&nbsp;</span></p>

Currently, his heart was filled with emotions.&nbsp;</span></p>
