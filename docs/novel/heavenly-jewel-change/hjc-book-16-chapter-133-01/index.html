 <p><b>Chapter 133 Reuniting with the Heavenly Bow Unit! (1)</b></p>
 <p>“Shall we head to your place first, or our place first?” Luo Ke Di asked Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>Without hesitation, Zhou Weiqing said: “Of course we’ll head over to your place first. That being said, Rogue Teacher… That Princess Difuya is together with you… that girl is rather dumb, you all better not listen to her.”</p>
 <p><span style>Luo Ke Di pursed his lips and said: “Don’t say that, although Princess Difuya is rather spoiled, but she is not bad at heart. Furthermore, she is your fiancee.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What fiancee?” Shangguan Fei’er’s voice had a hint of anger. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing quickly gave Luo Ke Di a look, but he acted like he did not see a thing, saying to Shangguan Fei’er: “Our Weiqing is the son of Admiral Zhou, and they have been promised to marry since birth. Alas, before they could actually be married, our Empire has fallen.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph! Very good! Zhou Little Fatty! You actually have a fiancee as well, how many women do you have relations with?!” Shangguan Fei’er said savagely. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing looked at Luo Ke Di speechlessly and said with a bitter smile: “I was going to annul that engagement with Difuya, but before I could go back and do it, our Empire was invaded. Don’t worry, no matter who I have relations with, it will definitely not be with her. Previously, I almost died at her hands…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Ke Di grinned and said: “Heh, Well, that is not up to you alone. Now that your father and godfather are both Sealed, who will annul the engagement for you? Weiqing, we have discussed this earlier… in order to revive our Empire, not only do we need a good leader and reason, then can we recruit the previous forces of the empire. From what I know, although the Heavenly Bow Empire armies had crumbled before the Bai Da Empire armies, there are still survivors scattered across the lands. As long as you and Princess Difuya marry, we will have the drawing power to recruit these men.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing face palmed his forehead, saying: “Let it go, Rogue Teacher. Don’t come up with such plans like that, it’s not possible Come on, let’s go meet the other teachers before we discuss this further.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Luo Ke Di led Zhou Weiqing and the other three around several small lanes before turning into one, stopping at the deepest courtyard. After tapping on the door rhythmically, the door opened, revealing Shui Cao (Little Grass)’s face. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m back! That little scoundrel Weiqing finally showed up!” Luo Ke Di pointed towards Zhou Weiqing. Shui Cao was overjoyed and immediately jumped forward to give him a big hug. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bing’er!” Shui Cao saw Shangguan Fei’er next. She had been in love with Hua Feng for so long, and towards Hua Feng’s little female disciple, she had a very close relation with her. Alas, this was not Shangguan Bing’er, but Shangguan Fei’er. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Before Shangguan Fei’er could do anything, Zhou Weiqing hastily pulled her aside. “Big Sis Shui Cao, let’s go in first.” Naturally, it was Shui Cao’s request that he call her big sis, after all that would make her feel younger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Very good! Zhou Little Fatty! Even the older ones you do not let go off.” Shangguan Fei’er said to him in a voice that only the two of them could hear. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s one of my teachers! Don’t talk nonsense.” Zhou Weiqing pinched her hand lightly before saying seriously: “Fei’er, no matter to myself or Bing’er, the Heavenly Bow Unit teachers are extremely important to us. You must be respectful towards them.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shangguan Fei’er stuck out her tongue and said: “Alright, I understand.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, the other members of the Heavenly Bow Unit rushed out of the house. Mu En still looked his old self, with nary a change, and he laughed heartily as he said: “Weiqing, you little brat! Hahahaha!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Teacher!” Seeing Mu En, Zhou Weiqing was overjoyed, dashing forward to hug him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Feng’s expression was much gentler, as he walked towards Shangguan Fei’er. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Luo Ke Di already knew Shangguan Fei’er’s identity, he did not attempt to stop Hua Feng. After all, he had already been thrown to the ground just now, how could he let Hua Feng escape the same fate so easily?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bing’er, how are you?” Hua Feng walked up to Shangguan Fei’er and said. </span></p>
 <p><span style><span>To Luo Ke Di’s surprise, having been warned by Zhou Weiqing, Shangguan Fei’er’s attitude changed. Smiling faintly, she said: “Greetings, you <a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> are Bing’er teacher right? I am her twin sister. My name is Shangguan Fei’er.” As she said that, she gave Hua Feng a respectful curtsey.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Feng started, and Luo Ke Di at the side stared at them with his jaw agape, mourning in his heart: </span><i><span style>That… that is just not fair!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing gave all his teachers a hug, even the Snake Lady Transvestite Yi Shi. After all, being able to meet them after all that had happened, he was just too overjoyed… especially since they were the last of his home remaining. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Meeting everyone now, Zhou Weiqing once again repeated what had happened to him after leaving the Heavenly Bow Unit, of course, in much more detail this time. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that he had actually managed to bring the Fei Li Battle Team to gain the Heavenly Jewel Tournament championship, all of them were both startled but overjoyed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Difuya was also there when Zhou Weiqing entered the house, but she was clearly rather embarrassed to greet him, and she only stood at the side without making a sound. As compared to the past, she was much thinner, and clearly much more subdued. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Difuya was not feeling good at the moment. Previously, when she was still in the Fei Li City, she had learned that Zhou Weiqing and the others had won the Heavenly Jewel Tournament Championship. Meeting Zhou Weiqing once again after this time, she found that his disposition and aura was very different from previously, more mature, profound, even deep. Even though he wasn’t considered handsome or suave, he was still tall and well muscled. Looking at him closely, he did not seem as irritating as before. However, she was despondent to see that since she entered the room, Zhou Weiqing had not even looked at her at all. She felt that although the distance between her and her fiance was just a few yards, it was like a gaping chasm. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After hearing Zhou Weiqing’s story, Hua Feng nodded and said: “So, your decision is to stay here and develop here, before returning back home?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “Yes. With just the few of us, our combined strength and power is just too weak. Even if we return back to our old headquarters, how many can we have? At most, we might be able to gather what… a Regiment of soldiers? However, we aren’t going to be facing just the Kalise Empire, but the immense Bai Da Empire. Only a troop which can be unsurpassed on the battlefield will give us the chance of reviving our empire. Perhaps… that target of reviving our empire is too far off for us now, our main target should be to have enough power to save father and godfather in the Heavenly Bow City after ten years. For that, we need a force of elites with sufficient strength.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A worried look flashed within Hua Feng’s eyes as he said: “Your plan is not aiming too far out of our reach indeed. I had wanted to warn you about just that as well, that without any external help, it would be nearly impossible for us to beat back the Bai Da Empire. However, if we are aiming to save His Majesty and Admiral Zhou, perhaps we might just be able to do so. That will be our focus in expanding our forces, training and building; to the target of saving them. Only then can we start thinking about reviving our empire.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing said: “Exactly that. It is just too good to see all you masters. I was just plagued with the decision on how I can train my Peerless Battalion. Now that you are here, I do not need to think too much, I want to turn the Peerless Battalion into an archery battalion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? Tell me your idea.” Hua Feng said in interest. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing said: “This is just a rough plan. In my Peerless Battalion, we have more than three hundred Physical Jewel Masters alone. That is quite a terrifying number indeed, far more than the total Jewel Masters that our Heavenly Bow Empire used to have. Although they may not have a high cultivation level, with an average of about two to three Jewel stage, it is still not difficult for them to become archers. If all of them can have a Consolidated Bow and have good training in archery, then no matter what foes we face, we can still have a deadly force while still protecting ourselves.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mu En said exasperatedly: “In order to become an outstanding archer needs a lot of talent as well.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing grinned shamelessly and said: “That is not something I have to concern myself about right? With so many of my teachers, all great archery masters in their own right, this should not be a problem right!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yi Shi made a orchid shaped hand gesture [1. A <a href="http://img002.21cnimg.com/photos/album/20140917/m600/AF0F1F4274CE2E4721529F7A6DD12DB9.jpg" target="_blank">type of hand gesture in traditional dances</a> (joined thumb and middle finger, the rest extended) </span><span style>], pointing to Zhou Weiqing and saying: “Don’t try to sweet talk us into that little Wei. Our archery skills are not that easily learned as well. However, over three hundred Physical Jewel Masters… that is indeed interesting. Are there any particularly strong and stout ones? I love those…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing had long been used to Yi Shi’s speech patterns, but both Little Four and Shangguan Fei’er beside him, hearing his saccharine sweet tones, had a strange look on their faces. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Hua Feng thought for a moment and said: “Our Empire is already gone, what use is there to keep our archery arts secret. Very well, Weiqing, I agree… we will become your archery trainers for your Peerless Battalion. However, you have also learned from us, and you know how difficult it is. Your Peerless Battalion has so many Physical Jewel Masters, will they actually listen to your orders?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Not my orders… to be more accurate, it is using profit to induce them to do what I need. As for keeping them in check, such a thing doesn’t need me, Fei’er is more than sufficient to do so. Just leave those who are not willing to listen to Fei’er, and I believe that they will have much more interest in learning archery than close combat. Heh heh.” </span></p>
 <p>At that, all of them turned to look at Shangguan Fei’er, and as they did so, the members of the Heavenly Bow Unit couldn’t help but marvel to themselves at the wonder of it all. From just her appearance, they really could not tell the difference between her and Shangguan Bing’er, and especially after learning that Bing’er was actually the daughter of the Second Palace Master of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, the shock in their hearts was considerable.</p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing said: “Alright, let’s go then to meet up with my guys. After that, I’ll need to buy some things and we can head back to the Peerless Battalion.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>As he thought about how he could turn the Peerless Battalion into an archery troop full of godly archers, Zhou Weiqing felt his blood boiling with excitement. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As compared to the courtyard house that Hua Feng and the others were living in, Lin TianAo and the group were staying in a much richer looking house. Previously, after Lin TianAo had parted with Zhou Weiqing, they had bought a large courtyard house near the north gate of the city. After all, if they were using it as a base, it couldn’t be too small. Furthermore, with the gold card that Zhou Weiqing had given him, and their own funds to boot, they were definitely extremely rich. </span></p>
