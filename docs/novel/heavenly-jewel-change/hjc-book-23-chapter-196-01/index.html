 <p><b>Chapter 196 Title Hidden! (1)</b></p>
 <p>When they had reached the Crescent City, Long Shiya had actually left silently. Even Zhou Weiqing did not know where his Master went or what he was up to. In fact, in Long Shiya’s eyes, in the Heavenly Bow Empire borders, there should not be anyone that could pose a threat to Zhou Weiqing. The Kalise Empire did not have any Heavenly King Stage powerhouses, and thought the Bai Da Empire should have some, they would definitely be holding the fort in the Bai Da Empire. At least in the near future, there was no possibility of them appearing. As such, Long Shiya felt relaxed in leaving.</p>
 <p>In the first place, Long Shiya had always been a person who loved freedom. Since Zhou Weiqing had already mastered the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, it could be said that he had already gained his full legacy. The only thing he was lacking was experience and attainment in the skill, as well as cultivation levels. Long Shiya had already passed on all the techniques and the path he needed to take. Now, for the revival of his own Empire, it would be up to Zhou Weiqing as an exercise for him.</p>
 <p><img class="alignleft " src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Cheval_de_frise_petersburg_civil_war_02598.jpg/597px-Cheval_de_frise_petersburg_civil_war_02598.jpg" alt="Anti-Cavalry Trap" width="140" height="141">After being run through by the Peerless Heavy Cavalry, the two Kalise Empire Infantry Battalions had barely a third of them surviving. The thick smell of blood lingered in the air, and in the back, the Kalise light cavalry retreated even further, not wanting to become the egg that threw itself on the rock. Set after set of Anti-Cavalry traps were rolled out, with four Heavy Infantry soldiers and a large number of ordinary Kalise soldiers setting them up in position and taking up their formation behind the traps in preparation.</p>
 <p>Zeng Jian’s heart was spasming and bleeding. He had never imagined that he would ever meet such a terrifying army. Just two hundred enemy soldiers, yet they seemed just like two hundred devils, instantly destroying nearly a third of his entire army. More importantly, that had included his most precious four Companies of Heavy Cavalry soldiers!</p>
 <p>Just the two hundred Heavy Cavalry soldiers in front of him gave him a strong sense of powerlessness. More importantly, their enemy had only sent out these two hundred men… and he did not even know how many more enemies there were in the Crescent City. In the military world, information was always key, and the unknown was to be feared. Since these enemies dared to come and actually successfully take the Crescent City, it showed a level of preparation and power… that definitely was not limited to these two hundred soldiers. To send out only this small force against him, there could only be one goal… to reduce their own injuries or deaths. Indeed, how could one deal with this Heavy Cavalry force? Even if he was a six-Jeweled Physical Jewel Master, if he charged forward, he would not have any use. These super heavy cavalry units were just like a moving fortress of metal, unstoppable in his eyes.</p>
 <p>In midair, Zhou Weiqing had already spotted Zeng Jian. In any army, the outfit of the commander was definitely different from all his soldiers. Furthermore, Zeng Jian had his personal guards in formation around him.</p>
 <p>“Ma Qun, Crow. Clear the battlefield. Do not advance any further.” Zhou Weiqing’s order came from above. He could see that the Peerless Heavy Cavalry’s bloodlust had been incited in the fight, and he was worried that they might just rashly charge into the enemy’s base. There were just too many obstacles and obstructions around the camp, especially the anti-cavalry traps, and it was not a good ground or position for the Heavy Cavalry soldiers. Of course, he did not think they could be defeated, but if they were entangled within, it would be unnecessary trouble.</p>
 <p>As he spoke, Zhou Weiqing drew back the Overlord Bow, a long arrow made out of pure Heavenly Energy suddenly coalescing into existence.</p>
 <p>Taking a deep breath, Zhou Weiqing raised his Ice Cold Perception to the max. His gaze was like a bolt of lightning, locked upon Zeng Jian’s body. As long as he could slay this commander, this Kalise Empire force would have no choice but to retreat.</p>
 <p>Zeng Jian was after all a relatively high leveled Physical Jewel Master. As soon as Zhou Weiqing locked onto him with his Overlord Bow, he immediately sensed danger. Lifting his head, he spotted Zhou Weiqing in midair, and instantly saw the strange hexagon-star formation glowing with a brilliant bluish purple light. All around Zhou Weiqing’s body, a thick lightning was arcing around, causing the entire air to reverberate around him.</p>
 <p><i>He wants to kill me! </i>Zeng Jian paled instantly as he realised what was happening. Swiftly, he unleashed his three Consolidated Equipment. At the same time, he jumped off his warhorse, darting deeper into the midst of his soldiers’ formation. [1. It actually says his Heavy Cavalry soldier’s formation here, but they are dead, so I assume it’s a typo and just changed it]</p>
 <p>All this while, though he flew In midair, Zhou Weiqing had not taken action. However, these Heavy Cavalry soldiers were already so strong, could this person be weak at all? Furthermore, that hexagon formation below him was so strange, who knew what unique powers it had?</p>
 <p><i>Dodging? </i>Zhou Weiqing smirked coldly. <i>Do you think that hiding in a crowd would be of any use?</i></p>
 <p>Thick Heavenly Energy, abruptly solidifying, and the now-bluish purple arrow gave off a terrifying energy reverberation. Within this arrow, there were no special effects or flourishes, just a pure terrifying amount of Heavenly Energy that had been consolidated through the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation. If one were able to examine it closely, they would discover that this arrow was truly strange looking. Three inches behind the arrowhead, there was a strange bluish purple round ball, fully made out of pure energy.</p>
 <p>With the Overlord Bow drawn to a full crescent, Zhou Weiqing raised his personal spirit and energy to the maximum, and in that instant, he unleashed his arrow.</p>
 <p>As his cultivation level had increased, his understanding towards archery was also no longer as simple as before. Within this arrow, it did not just hold energy alone, but it was highly compressed and transmuted to lightning elemental power.</p>
 <p>An ear-piercing screech rang out in that moment, and across the skies, all could only see a bolt of lightning flash across. The bluish purple light as if the heavens had thrown down a bolt of lightning, smashing down into the Kalise Sixth Regiment camp.</p>
 <p>However, right at the same time as he shot out the arrow, all of a sudden, Zhou Weiqing’s expression changed. In the next moment, his entire body flipped and rolled in midair, and he followed it up with an instant Blink Skill.</p>
 <p>That was because, in the instant that he had shot out the arrow, he sensed a sudden cold that he had never felt in his entire life, descending upon his entire body. An ambush!</p>
 <p>This foe’s choice of attack timing was just too perfect. Zhou Weiqing’s arrow had been fully focused on chasing an effect of guaranteeing an instant kill, consolidating that arrow from a massive amount of Heavenly Energy, and more so bringing his spirit and focus to a maximum point. As he shot out that arrow, in that instant when he released such a powerful blast of Heavenly Energy, his entire body was in a short temporary period of weakness. It was in this instant that this hidden foe had seized the opportunity to launch his attack.</p>
 <p>A thick black light that was almost like ink flew towards Zhou Weiqing’s body from below. Almost as Zhou Weiqing rolled away, it crossed paths with his body, bringing a bead of blood away from him. Right away, the black light seemed as if it had been locked onto its target, in a flash it swooped around and chased up to Zhou Weiqing who had blinked away… a black sword point striking towards Zhou Weiqing’s throat.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Zhou Weiqing’s arrow had reached its target. The thick bluish purple light drawing a beautiful arc in the skies, seeming to worm its way across all obstacles, flickering as it did so. It was almost as if the arrow had eyes as it flew past several soldiers, striking onto Zeng Jian’s Consolidated Shield with unbelievable accuracy.</p>
 <p>The bluish purple light flashed brightly upon the hit, seeming to lance right into his body through the shield. The next instant, a violent explosion rang out from Zeng Jian’s body. With that ball of lightning attached to the arrow blowing up from within his body, how could Zeng Jian survive?</p>
 <p>This critical arrow of Zhou Weiqing’s, it had taken all his power, spirit and planning to launch it. Let alone Zeng Jian, who was a six-Jeweled Physical Jewel Master… even an ordinary six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master would have been hard pressed to defend himself against it.</p>
 <p>However, although Zhou Weiqing had successfully killed Zeng Jian, he had now fallen into extreme danger.</p>
 <p>Ever since he had become a Heavenly Jewel Master, Zhou Weiqing had experienced his share of close shaves. However, this was truly the first time that he had felt so close to death. No matter even when he had faced the Lion Prince Gu Yingbing for the first time, he did not have such a feeling. After all, Gu Yingbing did not have a strong killing intent at that time, and he had not been trying to kill him.</p>
 <p>However, this enemy in front of him only gave Zhou Weiqing a single sensation. A simple one that could be described with one word. Death.</p>
 <p>A feeling of death. That icy cold feeling. There was only one single goal he had - to kill Zhou Weiqing. This was an assassin. An absolutely powerful assassin. A terrifying Heavenly Energy reverberations filled the entire air with the scent of death.</p>
 <p>The moment Zhou Weiqing fell into trouble, on the distant city wall, Shangguan Xue’er, Tian’er and Lin TianAo immediately leaped off the wall, charging at their top speeds without any hesitation. Alas, they were just too far from him now, at least a few li away, and in a short period of time they would not be able to rescue him.</p>
