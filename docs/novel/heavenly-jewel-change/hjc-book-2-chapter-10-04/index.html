 <p><strong>Chapter 10 Physical Jewel Consolidated Equipment, Elemental Jewel Stored Skills (4)</strong></p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er sat at a big tree about ten metres away from Zhou, taking off her backpack, and retrieving her dry rations and water to eat.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing continued panting a while more, and he gradually caught his breath and his breathing grew uniform, he did not have any dry rations with him, and seeing Shangguan Bing’er eating and drinking, he couldn’t help but swallow his saliva, as he edged closer to her.</p>
 <p>“Battalion Commander, I also want some.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er looked at that fellow’s greedy eyes, gave a humph and continued ignoring him.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “A General does not have hungry soldiers*, if I don’t have anything to eat, then I will not continue walking.” As he said that, he one sat down beside Shangguan Bing’er, although he did not bump into her, but just sitting together at the big tree, he could smell the subtle fragrance that she had, although his belly was still empty, but he still felt rather satisfied.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er moved her body a little to keep a distance from him, continuing to eat slowly. She did not believe that Zhou Weiqing would not come and beg her when he got hungry. This rascal was like a crafty hooligan, if she did not deal with him properly, how would he listen to her later? She did not believe that Little Fatty Zhou would have any problems missing a meal or two.</p>
 <p>Just as Shangguan Bing’er secretly thought that she had succeeded in her little scheme, Zhou Weiqing who was sitting beside her suddenly burst into motion, the next instant, his body was leapt up like a leopard, bounding deep into the woods.</p>
 <p>“What are you doing?” Shangguan Bing’er was startled, standing up along with him.</p>
 <p>“I’m going to look for something to eat.” Zhou Weiqing throws down those words, before he disappeared into the forest.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er was stunned momentarily, before keeping her dry rations to pursue Zhou Weiqing into the forest. The reason she followed him was because she was afraid that this rascal would not keep his promise and run away instead. Furthermore, she was also rather curious how Zhou Weiqing would go about looking for something to eat.</p>
 <p>After these few days of contact with him, the more she grew to believe that Little Fatty Zhou was of humble birth. Although there weren’t many good people amongst the nobles, but it was unlikely for there to be such a hateful little rogue like him right?</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er activated both her Physical and Elemental Jewels, going forth at a higher speed than Zhou Weiqing. Although she was not as familiar with the Stars Forest as Zhou Weiqing, but relying on her superior hearing and speed, she was still able to keep up with him easily.</p>
 <p>Looking at Zhou Weiqing twisting and turning uncannily through the forest, extremely agile; what was the most unusual was that the green light only shone from him occasionally, but that alone gave Shangguan Bing’er quite a shock in her heart. After all, she was a pure agility Heavenly Jewel Master, and was definitely well-researched regarding movement styles. From Zhou Weiqing’s movements, she clearly found that he was only using his Wind Attribute Heavenly Energy only when he need it most – on those occasions when he needed to jump up high, or just when he needed a quick speed boost, mostly used to surmount any difficult obstructions in his way. In doing so, not only did he manage to maintain high speeds, he could also conserve as much Heavenly Energy as possible. Shangguan Bing’er could also do this, but most importantly, how long had it been since Zhou Weiqing only awakened his Heavenly Energy? It was barely a few days, and he could already display such amazing control over his Wind Attribute Heavenly Energy! Shangguan Bing’er found that she was increasingly unable to see through this fellow anymore.</p>
 <p>After Zhou Weiqing had advanced approximately several hundred meters through the woods, he suddenly jumped upwards with a huge leap, grabbing a branch to propel himself forward, and in the next instant, he had firmly landed on top of a thick branch, his right foot hooked steadily into the branch, while his left foot trod steadily on the branch, and in completing those movements, he slung off the longbow from his back and in a swift motion, nocked an arrow and drew the bow to a full crescent. The arrowtip moved in a minute motion as he constantly adjusted his aim.</p>
 <p>What experienced and adept archery. Shangguan Bing’er thought, rather startled in her heart. As a formidable Heavenly Jewel Master Archer herself, she was extremely familiar in the ways of archery, and she could easily distinguish clearly that Zhou Weiqing had not made use of his Heavenly Jewels during that previous movements. Such experience and skill in nocking the arrow and drawing his bow along with his familiarity with the environment, just those points alone meant he was already an outstanding archer. Even if he were not a Heavenly Jewel Master, just based on those skills, he would be able to make his mark in Archery Battalion.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Zhou Weiqing’s eyes flashed with a bright light, and with a whizz, he released the arrow which flew out light a bolt of lightning, flying towards the depths of the jungle.</p>
 <p>However, at the same moment, Shangguan Bing’er’s both hands blurred in movement, a green light shot out from her Purple Dawn Bow, though it was shot out later, but it quickly reached Zhou Weiqing arrow instantaneously and struck it, causing it to lose its course, and with two light thudding sounds, both arrows embedded into a large tree in the distance.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing almost subconsciously swivelled his body around the tree, his whole body slid down the Stars Tree, and in doing so making sure his body being completely covered by tree trunk.</p>
 <p>“You still fear death so much.” Shangguan Bing’er said exasperatedly.</p>
 <p>On hearing it was Shangguan Bing’er, Zhou Weiqing poked his head back up and said with a grin: “Fearing death is basic human nature, what if it had been an enemy? My dear beautiful Battalion Commander, you should praise me instead for my resourcefulness right! Having such a subordinate like me, don’t you feel proud?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er said with a humph, “That little rabbit is so cute, yet you wanted to kill it. With me around, you shall not take an innocent life.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Wei said with a pitiful face: “Beautiful Battalion Commander, how can I live like that! You don’t give me any dry rations to eat, and when I hunt for food to eat, you also prevent me from doing so, where’s the justice in that!”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er did not know why, but looking at Zhou Weiqing’s distressed appearance, her heart felt a pleasant satisfaction, and her beautiful face revealed a self-satisfied smile as she said, “Didn’t you say you have the ability to look for food? Feel free to do so, but under the premise of not taking lives.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing came back around from behind the tree, re-shouldering his longbow onto his back and gave a long sigh with a suffering face: “Looks like I will not have any meat to eat today. Beautiful Battalion Commander, I’m still in the stage of growing, to suffer from malnutrition, so pitiful!”</p>
 <p>“Hmph! You’re as strong as a bull, what malnutrition are you speaking of?” Shangguan Bing’er said exasperatedly. However, as soon as she finished saying those words, her face flushed red, after all, she had experienced first hand that Little Fatty Zhou’s vigor and strength.</p>
 <p>However, Shangguan Bing’er’s words were also true, after Zhou Weiqing had Awakened his Heavenly Jewels, not only had his height grown, his entire person also seemed to be filled with vigor and energy, his muscles clearly defined under his military uniform, as if he had an inexhaustible reserve of strength. If his appearance were to be judged as a soldier, he definitely had the stature of an elite soldier, definitely more than comparable to any stout adults. Do not forget that he was still less than 14 years old.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately for Zhou Weiqing, he had not seen her embarrassed blush, or he might have had a greater sense of self satisfaction. As he spoke to Shangguan Bing’er, he was also lowering his head head to the ground, as if looking for something. Both his hands were moving around the shrubbery with seeming experience, and after a short while time, his bosom was filled with several items like bamboo shoots, and he had also picked up several large Stars Trees leaves, before he finally straightened his back.</p>
 <p>“Beautiful Battalion Commander, is it okay I eat these?” Zhou Weiqing said as he gave a solemn expression.</p>
