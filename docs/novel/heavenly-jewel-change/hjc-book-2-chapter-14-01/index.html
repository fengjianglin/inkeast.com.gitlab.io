 <p><strong>Chapter 14 Physical Jewel Consolidated Equipment Sets</strong></p>
 <p>Feng Yu stood up, saying: “I estimate that your little girlfriend probably will not be able to complete her Consolidating Equipment in such a short time could, let’s go look for Huyan Old Man first to consider the future now okay.”</p>
 <p>The two of them left the empty room, returning to the main room that they had come from earlier, barely a short while ago. Zhou Weiqing followed behind Feng Yu, his mind lost in thought. He was getting more and more curious about the black winged tiger that appeared in his mind. Without a doubt, the reason why he could become a Heavenly Jewel Master and also succeed in cultivating the Immortal Deity Technique, and even his easy success with Consolidating Equipment, definitely had a close relationship with that black pearl that he had eaten.</p>
 <p>Returning to the main hall, as soon as Feng Yu entered the room he saw that Huyan Aobo was there pacing back and forth, looking somewhat anxious.</p>
 <p>“Eh? Why are you two back so quickly?” Huyan Aobo looked doubtingly at Zhou Weiqing who had came in together with Feng Yu.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Heh, once I’ve handled things, of course I’ll come back right?”</p>
 <p>Feng Yu said: “Huyan Old Man, I think that we have met with a true talent, his first time using a Consolidating Equipment Scroll and he succeeded. Have you ever witnessed something like that before? In any case, I’ve never heard of such a thing.”</p>
 <p>Huyan Aobo looked with surprise at Zhou Weiqing, “Little brother, your luck is just too good right, you succeeded with just one scroll? Where are the surplus scrolls?” Just like talking trash was Zhou Weiqing’s habit, the disposition of being stingy was already deep down in the marrow of Huyan Aobo’s bones.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing instantaneously put on a righteous face and said, “Huyan Senior, gifts that have been given out, how can they be taken back?”</p>
 <p>Huyan Aobo was embarrassed by his words, and said to himself: “Could this really be some divine punishment?”</p>
 <p>Feng Yu said happily: “Haha, it looks like you, this miser, must give something up now. Stop being so hesitant, just decide quickly.”</p>
 <p>Huyan Aobo heaved a deep sigh, both his hands holding his big round belly, “Alright, enough, you do not need to come to his aid so subtly. Little brat, show me your Elemental Jewel. As long as we confirm that you have the appropriate Gold-Green Cat’s Eye which signifies the Spatial Attribute of the Heavenly Jewel Masters, I will accept you as an apprentice. Later on, I will be responsible for all your Consolidating Equipment and Skill-Storing. That should be okay right.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing immediately shook his head, swinging it so vigorously like a Bu Leng drum*.</p>
 <p><em>*TL: 卜楞鼓 – A sort of children’s toy that you shake vigorously</em></p>
 <p>Huyan Aobo said angrily: “What else do you want??”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said aggrievedly: “Senior, you don’t have to be so fierce. You must think, husband and wife are a linked together as one, how about my wife? Furthermore, we must add on one more rule, you cannot restrict my freedom.”</p>
 <p>Huyan Aobo immediately started breathing rapidly again, “Little brat, you are taking advantage of me. I’ve never seen such a disciple.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: “Haha, I’ve also never seen such a stingy person like you! You’ll get used to it, you’ll get used to it.”</p>
 <p>Huyan Aobo looked with a face of pain to Feng Yu, but Feng Yu actually looked up into the sky, with the innocent look that all of this did not concern him.</p>
 <p>“Feng Yu, you cannot defend him earlier for nothing, from now on their Elemental Jewel Skill Storing I’ll depend on you to be responsible for. I will deal with all their Consolidating Equipment, okay?”</p>
 <p>Feng Yu nodded and said: “For below six jewels, I will be responsible. Anyway I am idling around nowadays, going around with the young people is much better than staying with you, old thing.”</p>
 <p>Huyan Aobo gave a humph and said: “Okay, good. Alright brat, I have agreed to your condition. As long as you can overtake me in creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, who will limit your freedom? Quickly show me your Elemental Jewel.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s eyeballs swirled around as he said: “You must first use your Jewel to make an oath, if my Elemental Jewel contains the Spatial Attribute, you will accept me as disciple and agree to the previous conditions.” When he swore his own vows he had been slippery and deceitful by using the fake name, but he could see from Shangguan Bing’er’s expression at that time, for Jewel Masters, pledging an oath with their Jewels was truly a very serious pledge.</p>
 <p>Huyan Aobo scolded: “I have never seen such a sly brat like you.” Although he was stingy, but once he decided on something he no longer wasted any time, and he lifted his left hand, immediately, a layer of dim silver light covered his body, and Zhou Weiqing could clearly seeing seven green color Cat’s Eye Jewels simultaneously appear to revolve around his wrist.</p>
 <p>Seven Spatial Attribute Elemental Jewels, that was the rank of a lower position Zong Elemental Jewel Master! Not only was this fat old man a Consolidating Equipment Master, he was unexpectedly of such high ranking, indeed you can never judge a book by its cover.</p>
 <p>For ordinary Elemental Jewels, the Spatial Attribute is denoted by the green coloured Cat’s Eye Jewel, but for Heavenly Jewel Masters, it is the highest quality Cat’s Eye Jewel, the gold green Cat’s Eye that Huyan Aobo mentioned earlier.</p>
 <p>The seven green Cat’s Eye Jewels looked like seven eyes glittering with a strange light, and Huyan Aobo solemnly took the oath by the seven Jewels as according to what Zhou Weiqing had requested. When he said the last few words, the seven Jewels simultaneously flashed with a bright light, and a silver light flashed from the sky to strike Huyan Aobo’s brow area, and a light tattoo appeared for a while before vanishing.</p>
 <p>Huyan Aobo completed his oath, and in his heart was a little uncomfortable, he gave a humph and said impatiently: “Brat, that is okay already right. Quickly.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: “Heh, two Seniors, the time to witness a miracle has arrived, I hope your hearts do not have any problems, and you are not frightened by my sheer genius talent of my Elemental Jewel.”</p>
 <p>Huyan Aobo said exasperatedly: “Little Brat, your remarks are too much, as if I haven’t seen the gold green Cat’s Eye before……” Just as he was saying those words, Zhou Weiqing pulled up the sleeves of his left hand and Released his Elemental Jewel from his Taiyuan Acupuncture Point, and the rest of his words died in his throat.</p>
 <p>Feng Yu originally had a very happy look as Zhou Weiqing was teasing Huyan Aobo, but as soon as Zhou Weiqing’s Elemental Jewel appeared in front of them, his face instantly changed and froze.</p>
 <p>It was still a Cat’s Eye Jewel, and there was only that single one around Zhou Weiqing’s wrist, but it was not the gold green colour they had expected, but instead a noble looking deep red like a ruby.</p>
 <p>Feng Yu and Huyan Aobo had been in the world of Jewel Masters for over 60 years, yet this was the first time they had ever seen such an unusual Cat’s Eye Jewel.</p>
 <p>The room was filled with silence, so much so that even a fallen needle could be heard instantly. Feng Yu and Huyan Aobo’s gazes were locked on the Elemental Jewel around Zhou Weiqing’s left wrist.</p>
 <p>“Red, how can it be a red Cat’s Eye?” Huyan Aobo finally opened his mouth and muttered.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing turned around, shoved open the door and walked outside, “Two seniors, please come here and look again.”</p>
 <p>Huyan Aobo and Feng Yu quickly followed him, but this time, they were not just startled, but their jaws actually gaped open. It was still the same Cat’s Eye Jewel, but this time, its colour had actually turned into a clear sea bluish green. If the red was noble, then this bluish green colour was profound.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said with an innocent look on his face: “I reminded you both a moment ago, this is the time to witness a miracle.”</p>
