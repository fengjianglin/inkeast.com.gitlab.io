 <p><b>Chapter 61 Since I’m willing to bet, I’m prepared to lose. (2)</b></p>
 <p>Qin Feng laughed heartily and said: “Master Zhou, Master Yun, in future if you both have any requirements, you can head over here. Although I dare not say that I have stock of everything, at least most of the common necessities I will definitely have them, and I will be willing to sell them to you at cost price.” Indeed, he had not earned anything from Zhou Weiqing himself, but without a doubt, the bet and great battle between these two young talented Consolidating Equipment Masters had drawn many eyeballs to his shop. As such, even though it was already late, there were still many customers in his shop, and he had gotten much business in the past few hours. Having a talented and outstanding Consolidating Equipment Master buying from him was better than any advertising he could do.</p>
 <p>Bidding farewell to Qin Feng, Zhou Weiiqng and Shangguan Bing’er led Yun Li back to their house. Their house was rather huge after all, and it was no problems finding a room for Yun Li as well.</p>
 <p>As soon as they entered, Zhou Weiqing could sense that Ming Hua had not returned. He did not take much notice of that, as long as the Heavenly Demon Sect did not come after him again, he was more than happy to let them be. The only regret he had today was that although he had heard Tian Er’s voice once more, he had not been able to see that amazing beauty once more, causing him to have some regret in his heart.</p>
 <p>Yun Li did not really care about his living accommodations, and did not even bother checking into his room. Without any hesitation, he barged right into Zhou Weiqing’s room with a look of excitement on his face. As soon as the door closed, he quickly urged to examine the dual hammers once more.</p>
 <p>Even Shangguan Bing’er saw his eager and impatient look and couldn’t help but giggle to herself, turning to the kitchen to prepare some refreshments for them as she knew they would be holed up there for a long time. After which, she headed back to her room to cultivate as well.</p>
 <p>In a flash of dark gold light, Zhou Weiqing once again let loose the hammers which were the first of his Legendary Set. When Yun Li started examining them at close proximity, a besotted look entered his eyes.</p>
 <p>“No wonder you were able to shake that terrifying Lin TianAo. This is amazing… so beautiful… Legendary Sets are truly worthy of the word Legendary! That being said, how did you manage to successfully Consolidate this? Could it be that your sect is able to create an entire Set of this? Even if a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master created this, it would likely take ten Scrolls for a guaranteed success right?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said curiously: “How come I heard from my Teacher that it shouldn’t take ten?! Anyway, I was just extremely luck, my sect only had a single scroll, and I just tried it and succeeded in Consolidating it.”</p>
 <p>Yun Li stared at Zhou Weiqing like he was a monster. “Damn… Disgusting… Totally disgusting! I have such bad luck, I’ll be facing two disgusting monsters daily from now on. Ahhh… my life is so bitter!” Thinking how he had trained so hard for so many years, and just as he was about to become somebody important, he had bet and lost his own life and freedom… he couldn’t help but feel a sense of sorrow arise within him.</p>
 <p>Seeing the sorrowful eyes of Yun Li, Zhou Weiqing laughed and said: “That being said, you really did get tricked by me. However, that was also because of your own pride and ego right? Alas, Lin TianAo was the one who came over and sent himself to me. That rascal’s defense is really inhuman! Even not considering his defense, his strength alone is terrifying… It is indeed strange, he is definitely not a Strength Attribute Physical Jewel Master, yet his strength is unbelievable.”</p>
 <p>Yun Li thought for a while before saying solemnly: “Weiqing, if I do not guess wrongly, I think Bro Lin has the bloodlines of the Barbarian Tribes, that is the reason why he has such a terrifying strength. In addition to that Consolidated Equipment Assembly Set, it is truly a perfect match. If not for the fact he had been restricted by so many terms of our bet, even with your equally inhuman Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Jewel and both of us attacking together, I doubt we can defeat him. Although your twin Legendary Hammers are extremely powerful, they are after all just a single piece. Without the boost that the Set provides, even if you use your full power, you will not be able to hurt him. Furthermore, his Heavenly Energy is extremely full and vigorous, with much stamina. Without question, he will be able to outlast us. In a real fight, we would definitely lose to him.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed and said: “Real fight? Why would I fight with him headon. If I can’t beat him, I can easily outrun him right? Everyone has their own weak points. The reason why he chose to bet with us with his defense is exactly because of that, he is extremely confident in that, but has no confidence in his speed. However, this is also the first time I have witnessed the true power of the Consolidated Equipment Assembly Set. That is also with it being used on defense… I wonder what it’d be like if used on offense…”</p>
 <p>As he spoke up to that point, they both exchanged looks, and couldn’t help but shudder involuntarily. Yun Li said seriously: “Weiqing, it looks like we had better research on this, and perhaps design some Assembly Sets. This might be a good source of income.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s eyes lit up and he struck his own leg suddenly as he cried out: “That’s right! Great idea! Furthermore, we have Lin TianAo, this disgusting fellow, as a living advertisement. Heh heh heh.”</p>
 <p>“Alright, you have the face to call him disgusting? Aren’t you just as disgusting? If your cultivation level was also equal to his five-Jeweled stage, your overall power level will definitely be more terrifying than his. Hey, don’t keep your hammers, let me continue examining them…”</p>
 <p>With two Consolidating Equipment Masters together, especially with their relationship allowing them to not hide anything from each other, it caused them to have a sleepless night of discussion and exchange.</p>
 <p>The next morning, both of them exited the room with panda eyes.</p>
 <p>Yun Li had a face full of excitement as he said: “Boss, I’m going to get something to eat and I’ll head to bed. I already have a plan for a new design, when you’re back from class we can continue our discussion.” As he said that, he turned and headed for the kitchen.</p>
 <p>After a whole night of discussion, Yun Li was much clearer about Zhou Weiqing’s current situation. After Zhou Weiqing had been forced to agree to help him look for the materials for his own Legendary Set as well, Yun Li had started calling him boss. After all, it was already a fact, and calling him Boss was no detriment to himself. However, Zhou Weiqing was also happy to help him. After the night of talking, they had gotten much closer to each other. At least, they had a similar goal - to complete their Legendary Sets and to wear them sometime in the future.</p>
 <p>“Little Fatty!” Shangguan Bing’er, who had finished preparing breakfast, looked at him with an admonishing gaze.</p>
 <p>Before she could say anything, Zhou Weiqing quickly said with a smile: “It won’t happen again, I promise.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er gave him a clean set of school uniforms to change, and as she looked at his tired face, she felt a tinge in her heart. Touching his face lightly, she said softly: “Little Fatty, I know you are worried about the situation of our Heavenly Bow Empire, but rushing into things will not help. You are already doing very well. Promise me, in future, you will not risk yourself so much alright? I do not want you to use your future and life as a bet any more. What happens if you meet someone with a hidden ace, someone more powerful?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing held her in his arms, feeling her warmth and the sweet scent from her hair, he said softly: “I was indeed too impulsive yesterday. I promise, I will not do this again, alright?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er nodded and said: “Don’t overdo the sleepless nights as well, I do not like to see you suffer so much.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and whispered into her ear: “It’s easy to have a good sleep… as long as I can hug my beautiful Bing’er to sleep every night, who would want to stay up to work!”</p>
 <p>“Hmph! We’re being serious here, stop playing around. Go eat your breakfast.” Shangguan Bing’er blushed red again and squirmed out of his embrace, turning back and heading into the kitchen. However, what Zhou Weiqing himself would not expect was that her defenses were being eroded by his constant teasing, at least deep in her heart, her resistance to him was slowly being lowered. After all, she had already thought of him as her husband.</p>
 <p>After breakfast, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but keep yawning. After an entire night of focus and learning, he was indeed very tired. Washing his face quickly with cold water, he finally cleared his head a little. As they headed out towards the academy, he gave Yun Li’s room an envious look. <i>At least that fellow can get some sleep! Ahh, I have to suffer in class today.</i></p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing held onto Shangguan Bing’er’s soft little hands, and they headed towards the academy together. After all, Zhou Weiqing had already announced their relationship, and Shangguan Bing’er had come to terms with it and wasn’t so embarrassed.</p>
 <p>In the distance, the academy’s gates were already in sight, but the two of them were give a surprise. That was because there were many unexpected horse carriages parked in front of the academy, with quite a crowd standing in front of the gates looking around. From what they could see, there were more than a dozen horse carriages and almost two hundred or so people standing around, some of whom seemed to have a dignified, noble air.</p>
 <p>“What’s this? Did something happen? Why’s there so many people around?” Zhou Weiqing paused in hesitation and asked out loud.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Shangguan Bing’er had been deep in her own thoughts, thinking to herself whether or not to agree to her Little Fatty’s request. If she were not intimate with him, what if he couldn’t contain himself? Furthermore, there was that beautiful and alluring Ming Hua staying in the house with them…</p>
 <p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, she looked up in a loss. When she saw the situation in front of the academy, she was also taken aback. “Even during the registration dates, there weren’t that many horse carriages!”</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, a voice rang out close to them. “Junior, this is actually all because of you.” Zhou Weiqing turned towards the voice, only to see Ye Paopao walking over from the distance, dressed in his noble uniform. He was alone today, and seeing his handsome and harmless look, it was hard to imagine that this fellow was one of the noble leaders of their academy students.</p>
 <p>“Because of me? Senior, what do the horse carriages have to do with me?” Zhou Weiqing asked curiously, vigilance rising in his heart. This Ye Paopao was a master at controlling his emotions and expressions, and it was hard to read him. To be able to be the leader of the noble students, how could he be a simple person?</p>
 <p>Ye Paopao said in a helpless tone: “Junior, have you forgotten? Did you think that after your commoner class one beat up so many noble students yesterday, there wouldn’t be any repercussions? Speaking of which, you guys sure beat them up rather savagely! Out of that entire second year class, almost half of them had broken bones, and many of them were severely injured.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said with an innocent look on his face: “We can’t be blamed for that, the academy has already punished both sides very fairly, what else can I be blamed for.”</p>
 <p>Ye Paopao laughed heartily and said: “Although I do not know how you managed to accomplish that, you are indeed something to be able to have to academy not come after you after that. However, do not forget that this is the Fei Li City, and many of the nobles are here. To them, you are the instigator of beating up the noble students, and when you beat up the young ones, the old ones will naturally pop up to look for justice. The ones at the gates are all waiting for you. Inside the carriages are many of those who had been beaten up yesterday, here to point you out. Even if the academy doesn’t take action on you, do you think the nobles will let everything slide?”</p>
