 <p><b>Chapter 160 Fight between Love Rivals! (3)</b></p>
 <p>In truth, he did not have much other choice. Previously, his entire series of Skills were indeed powerful, but throwing them all out at once had almost drained him of his entire Heavenly Energy pool. This was especially so for the Dark Demon God Lightning, which was an even greater toll.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing did not know how he could possibly destroy that protective gold shield around Gu YingBing, but he definitely had to give it a try.</p>
 <p>The Yin Yang Giant Palm struck down on the golden shield of the Divine Guardian Angel, and Zhou Weiqing felt a fiery hot power stream into him, as if his entire soul was being burnt. Even though he was wearing the Yin Yang Giant Spirit Palm, the strange feeling of heat caused even him to cry out in pain, his entire body leaping back instantly.</p>
 <p>Gu YingBing gave a cold laugh and said: “You have the Demonic and Darkness Attributes, and you actually dared touch my Divine Guardian Angel? Don’t you know that the Divine Attribute is the antithesis to all Darkness Type powers…”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing’s heart felt as if he had finally seen the light. He finally understood why he seemed to suppressed on all levels by Gu YingBing. It was not just the sheer difference in power between them, but also the addition of the attributes clashing. His opponent had the Divine Attribute, one of the Four Saint Attributes, which just happened to counter both his Demonic and Darkness Attributes, and thus causing some of his strongest Skills to be rendered useless. That was the reason why the Dark Demon God Lightning had been so easily destroyed by the Divine Attribute, as it consisted of both the Demonic and Darkness Attributes!</p>
 <p>Gu YingBing took a large step towards Zhou Weiqing. Naturally, he could tell that currently Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy was almost totally expended. Although he had not expected that taking down Zhou Weiqing would take him so long and so much trouble, but it was undoubtedly his victory.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing took a deep breath, his eyes focused totally. At the same time, the over twenty energy whirlpools of his Death Acupuncture Points were at their absolute maximum, spinning crazily as they drew Heavenly Energy from the atmosphere to help him recover.</p>
 <p>Gu YingBing’s right hand waved, and the Dragon Head Staff in his hands actually flew towards Zhou Weiqing, glowing brilliantly with gold light. In that moment, the gold light glowed hard and the Dragon Head Staff seemed to come to live, warping into a large two zhang[1. a unit of measurement (3.3m long)] long golden wolf pouncing directly at Zhou Weiqing. This was the imbued Skill from this God Tier Consolidated Equipment of his.</p>
 <p>A layer of almost crystalline grey light lit up from Zhou Weiqing’s body, and in a loud *PENG* sound, it actually managed to block the charge of the massive gold dragon. At the same time, Zhou Weiqing lifted up his head, looking directly at the Lion Prince Gu YingBing, and two bouts of purple red light flashed from his eyes.</p>
 <p>Even if there was just a slightest chance, Zhou Weiqing was not willing to give up. What he was using now was the spiritual attack portion of the Demonic Dragon God Seal.</p>
 <p>Almost at the same time, two gold lights flashed in Gu YingBing’s eyes, and the two different glows actually clashed in mid air, causing violent sparks. Zhou Weiqing felt his eyes hurt in a sudden stabbing pain, and his entire body stumbled back uncontrollably as his entire brain felt as if it was being smashed repeatedly with a mallet.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, to actually use a spiritual attack against me… one who has the Spirit Attribute… what a conceited joke. Your cultivation level and Skill are just too far away from me…”</p>
 <p>The Lion Prince said disdainfully, as he walked closer and closer, and Zhou Weiqing had no choice but to use Ward of the Demon God to barely resist the gold dragon’s attack, his body being shoved back uncontrollably. Although his Heavenly Energy recovery rate was extremely fast, under the incessant onslaught of the massive gold dragon, the expenditure of Heavenly Energy of the Ward of the Demon God was far beyond his own recovery rate.</p>
 <p>“Enough! Gu YingBing, you dare…” Shangguan Fei’er could no longer hold back, and in a flash she charged forward.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the two old men who had came together with Gu YingBing appeared in a flash in the path of Shangguan Fei’er and Lin TianAo.</p>
 <p>“Heavenly King…” Shangguan Fei’er couldn’t help but cry in shock.</p>
 <p>What status did Gu YingBing have? In the entire WanShou Empire, he was definitely at the top of the pyramid. The Lionman Tribe had been the Royal Family of the WanShou Empire for so many years, and they had unbelievable resources. Naturally, these two Heavenly King stage powerhouses were specially here to protect him as his bodyguards.</p>
 <p>Lin TianAo and Shangguan Fei’er might be extremely powerful, their Heavenly Energy cultivation level or combat abilities not to be underestimated, especially for their ages. However, with each of them facing a Heavenly King Stage powerhouse, what could they do? They were not able to get past them so easily. Of course, the two Heavenly King Stage powerhouses would not take action against them without Gu YingBing’s orders, just blocking their way. Otherwise, perhaps all three of them would die right then.</p>
 <p>Gu YingBing did not seem to hear Shangguan Fei’er’s words, slowly stepping towards Zhou Weiqing with a ferocious look in his eyes. Looking at this love rival, his heart was filled with a strong killing intent. Today, he had won, but he was also clear that this live rival was more than a dozen years younger than he was. More importantly, he had already won Tian’er’s heart.</p>
 <p>At last, Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy fully ran out. Facing a true powerhouse, the weakness he had in having a fighting style totally about an explosive burst of offense. He did not have sufficient Heavenly Energy to sustain all the various Skills he used to block against the Lion Prince’s powerful attacks. Furthermore, many of his Skills were fully suppressed by Gu YingBing.</p>
 <p>The Ward of the Demon God also dissipated into sparks of light, and the giant gold dragon smashed savagely into Zhou Weiqing’s chest.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s entire body was sent flying up in the air, fresh blood spurting from his mouth. If not for the protection of the Source of Strength, he would have been instantly killed by that blow.</p>
 <p>The Gold Dragon swooped back to the Lion Prince’s hands, turning back into the Dragon Head Staff. He took a last step forward to reach Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>That blow was just too savage. Zhou Weiqing did not even have a single bit of Heavenly Energy left, the Yin Yang Giant Spirit Palms and Source of Strength vanished, with nothing left to sustain them. At the same time, the Demonic Change State faded back into his body. Zhou Weiqing fell down, his face pale and ashen, his innards feeling like they were being turned upside down and thrown about, causing him to vomit out a mouthful of blood involuntarily. At this point, he found it difficult to even breathe.</p>
 <p>Gu YingBing did not continue attacking, not giving him that one final finishing blow. He just stood there, looking down upon the fallen Zhou Weiqing, tall stout and handsome as his eyes flashed in a ferocious light, a hesitant, pondering look on his face.</p>
 <p>Looking at the Lion Prince’s eyes, Zhou Weiqing felt his a film of red cover his eyes. Despite the utter pain his entire body was in, he still forced himself, pushing himself bit by bit to clamber to his feet. Even if he was about to die, he would not die in such a position, but would stand tall in front of his love rival.</p>
 <p>Gu YingBing looked at him coldly, saying: “Do you know how many years I have loved Tian’er? Let me tell you… from the day she was born, she was already destined to be become my wife, the wife of the Lion Prince Gu YingBing. Since a young age, I have cared for her, protected her, not yet her suffer the slightest bit of pain or agony. With her mischievous nature, even though I was punished severely by Master several times, I was happy to do so. Every day, I watcher her grow up, watched her grow more and more beautiful, and my heart was filled with love and hope, knowing that she would be my wife eventually. Yet… you, you bastard, you dared to trick such a innocent girl who knows nothing about the world, stealing her heart from me and even her body. However, no matter what, I will not give up, and I will win her heart back.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing spat out another mouthful of blood and said: “Bullshit. Your so called love is a one-sided one. What do you mean trick? Tian’er loves me, and I love her as well, and we have spent a few years together. You will never win her heart back, she will only be mine, as I am hers. Even if you kill me, you will never change that fact. Even if I die, I will still live on in Tian’er’s heart. Come on then! Kill me… hahaha”</p>
 <p>That stubborn and obstinate nature within Zhou Weiqing’s nature was totally stimulated. At that moment, he totally forgot about being afraid of death. Even if he could not defeat this love rival in front of him, he would not bow down, would not show any signs of weakness and back down.</p>
 <p>Gu YingBing slammed his foot into Zhou Weiqing’s abdomen in a savage kick, sending him flying back. In a flash, he disappeared and reappeared in mid air, catching up to Zhou Weiqing, slamming continuous blows onto the flying body. At that moment, Zhou Little Fatty had become a true sandbag.</p>
 <p>“Little Fatty!” Shangguan Fei’er’s eyes also reddened, and she unleashed all her power at once, not caring about defense, fully pitting her life in reckless abandon attacks against the Heavenly King Stage powerhouse in front of her. Alas, he was a Heavenly King Stage powerhouse after all, and in a short time she could not break through his defenses.</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, a sudden soft sound rang out together with a flash of silver light. The Lion Prince, who had been beating on Zhou Weiqing, suddenly froze in midair, the Divine Guardian Angel around his body actually shattering.</p>
 <p>In that abrupt danger, Gu YingBing displayed his sheer strength and power, forcefully moving his body at the last possible moment to avoid his critical vital points from getting hit. In the end, the silver light was only able to leave a deep cut along his ribs, blood welling from the injury.</p>
 <p>Indeed, the one which had taken action so suddenly was the Silver Emperor Little Red Bean, Zhou Weiqing’s last ace in hand.</p>
 <p>With a loud thud, Zhou Weiqing landed back onto the ground, blood spewing from his mouth, even leaking from his nose and ears. He had already been injured previously, and the new series of blows caused him fall into semi consciousness, only a sheen of red in front of his eyes. Both his arms and his left leg were broken, and only his unbelievably tough Demonic Right Leg was tough enough to stay unbroken, though at least five of his ribs were broken. Even so, he was still alive. No one knew why, Gu YingBing could have easily finished him off, but did not end it there and then.</p>
 <p>“Hmph. A puny little Silver Emperor…” Gu YingBing had been injured, but it was nothing to a powerhouse like him. Still, the ferocious light in his eyes flashed even stronger, and his hands circled suddenly in mid air, a powerful golden red light spreading out, seeming to congeal the air in a fifty yard radius. The next moment, the gold red light seemed to form a net, forcefully stopping the Silver Emperor Little Red Bean as it was enclosed within.</p>
 <p>“Die!” Two beams of gold light shot forth from Gu YingBing’s eyes, landing directly on Little Red Bean. Originally, it had been attempting to break free of the encirclement with the Spatial Rend and Silver Emperor Lightning Pierce, but its body froze, shuddering violently before going limp. The net of light seemed to collapse inwards on it, and with a terrifying and disgusting sound, Little Red Bean’s little body was totally shredded by the terrifying net, falling into little bits of meat and blood, indubitably dead.</p>
 <p>A max level Zong Stage Heavenly Beast… yet it seemed to frail and weak in front of Gu YingBing’s Divine and Spirit Dual Saint Attributes. It was clear that if he really wanted to kill Zhou Weiqing, perhaps even if there were ten Zhou Weiqings, they would all be dead now.</p>
 <p>Gu YingBing lifted his hand towards Zhou Weiqing, and a powerful suction force dragged his body right in front of him.</p>
 <p>“Gu YingBing, if you dare kill him, our Heaven’s Expanse Palace will not let the matter go so easily. Weiqing is our Heaven’s Expanse Palace son in law…” Shangguan Fei’er shouted angrily.</p>
 <p>Gu YingBing looked at her coldly. “If I wanted to kill him, even if he is the son of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace Master, so what? He would still die now…”</p>
