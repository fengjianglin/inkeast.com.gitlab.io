 <p><strong>Chapter 13 An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth (3)</strong></p>
 <p>At this moment, Feng Yu who had been standing at the side smiling and watching suddenly opened his mouth to say: “Huyan Old Man, money is merely an external material good, it will come and go, haven’t you understood this by now? A Heavenly Jewel Master apprentice is not easy to find. If you miss this opportunity, you may never find another one again in your lifetime. All these years, why have you been earning so much money for? Are you happy in your heart? Is money more important than your lifelong dream?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing gave a surprised look at Feng Yu, he had not expected that this Feng Yu, who was obviously here to protect Huyan Aobo, would actually speak out on his behalf.</p>
 <p>Huyan Aobo’s brow wrinkled fiercely, then suddenly a bright silver color light flashed out, and his body suddenly vanished from the room totally. Before Zhou Weiqing could react, the silver light flashed once again, and the fat old man reappeared in front of him and Shangguan Bing’er. In his hands, there were appeared two jet-black wooden boxes, and he handed Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er one each.</p>
 <p>“You two go to the side room to start Consolidating Equipment first. This is the Overlord Bow the Wind Wielding Boots respectively. Let me think some more. Feng Yu Old Man, you lead them over there.”</p>
 <p>Feng Yu said with a laugh: “Haha, you two kids, come with me.” As he said that, he walked outward.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er received the box, which did not weigh much, and followed Feng Yu outside. Shangguan Bing’er’s hand was being held by Zhou Weiqing now, but she did not try to break free. She was still in a daze, everything seemed to be happening like in a dream. Just a moment ago, they could not even afford a single set of Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, and now they actually both obtained a set each, without even spending a single cent.</p>
 <p>Feng Yu brought them to the side rooms, and said with a smile: “You two little kids, don’t be so reluctant to part with each other, each person to a room, so that when you are Consolidating Equipment your attributes do not clash.”</p>
 <p>Only then did Shangguan Bing’er awaken, and she quickly shook free of Zhou Weiqing’s hand, but her beautiful face was flushed red.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said reluctantly: “Wife, you must be careful okay.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er stomped on his foot, before turning around to run into one of the rooms. When the door finally closed, she couldn’t resist any longer, and on her beautiful face her dimple bloomed like a flower as she smiled, tightly holding the wooden box in her bosom. Compared with the Silent Tracking Arrow that was her first Consolidated Equipment, this Wind Wielding Boots that could mount an Elemental Jewel was many times stronger and better*. Therefore, even though she had been taken advantage of by Zhou Weiqing, being called his wife, she had not been truly that angry.</p>
 <p>Looking at Shangguan Bing’er walking away, Feng Yu looked at Zhou Weiqing with a faint smile on his face, saying: “Such a young age, and you already know how to seize the opportunity so well. Kid, you are very promising.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing flashed his trademarked simple and honest smile, saying: “Senior praises me too much. I also want to give my thanks to Senior for speaking up for me earlier, it was of much help.”</p>
 <p>Feng Yu gave a hearty laugh, saying: “That’s no problem, I have had beef with that Huyan Old Man for a while. If not for my promise to him, I wouldn’t be staying here to defend this stingy old miser. This is your first time carrying out a Physical Jewel Consolidating Equipment right? Go on in, I will teach you how to use the Consolidating Equipment Scroll.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing entered the room with Feng Yu, in comparison with the elegant main room earlier, this room was totally empty.</p>
 <p>Feng Yu said: “No choice, Huyan Old Man was too stingy. Just sit on the ground.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing followed suit and sat on the ground, and Feng Yu sat down opposite him, taking the wooden box from him.</p>
 <p>As he opened the lid, Zhou Weiqing was surprised to see that the so-called Consolidating Equipment Scroll was not a single one, but instead was a thick stack of them. The uppermost one had an extremely complex pattern, and he could see indistinctly, at the center of those patterns, there was a semblance of resemblance to the Overlord Bow on the picture earlier.</p>
 <p>“So many!” Zhou Weiqing said in surprise.</p>
 <p>Feng Yu said: “Didn’t you hear what Huyan Old Man said earlier? With his grandmaster standard, the success rate of Consolidating Equipment Scrolls is still only 1%. Actually, the most important judgement standard of a grandmaster is, out of 100 Consolidating Equipment Scrolls at least one will succeed for sure. For lower grade Consolidating Equipment Masters, this is difficult to say. Although Consolidating Equipment Masters can earn money, but it is actually very difficult to practice, even if they have the Spatial Attribute Elemental Jewel, but they still need to go through painstaking efforts. The Consolidating Equipment Masters who have low success rates will have less patronage, that’s the reason why there are so few Consolidating Equipment Masters.”</p>
 <p>As he said that, he took up the uppermost Consolidating Equipment Scroll and handed it to Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was finally able to examine the Consolidating Equipment Scroll closely, and he found that it was made from a special leather as the foundation material, the patterns on it were lively and of rich colours, almost as if it were living even. Although he only had one set of Heavenly Jewels, he could clearly sense the strong special fluctuation of energy in this small leather scroll.</p>
 <p>“You can only carry out one Physical Jewel Consolidating Equipment every day, and doing so will also consume more than 50% of your Heavenly Energy, so you should not be startled when that happens later. Now, you can start activating your Heavenly Energy an move it to your Physical Jewel, then rest your right hand on the scroll and silently feel it. You do not need to do anything else, your Physical Jewel should naturally start communication with the Consolidating Equipment Scroll under the stimulation of your Heavenly Energy.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you Senior.” Although Zhou Weiqing was quite the prankster, but he was not a person who didn’t know how to differentiate good from bad, and he definitely had a very favorable impression of this good-tempered Upper Level Zong Physical Jewel Master.</p>
 <p>Focusing his will, he guided his Heavenly Energy from his Dantian upwards in a cycle, and as the Heavenly Energy passed by the right shoulder’s Clavicle Acupuncture Point, the energy whirlpool immediately increased in speed. The Taiyuan Acupuncture Point Released the Icy Jade Physical Jewel, and under the injection of Heavenly Energy, released a layer of icy mist fog immediately, and the familiar intense feeling of strength swept through his whole body instantaneously. Zhou Weiqing does not dare pause, pulling up his right arm’s sleeve with his left hand, his right palm pressing down onto the Consolidating Equipment Scroll.</p>
 <p>Looking at Zhou Weiqing’s pure Icy Jade Physical Jewel, Feng Yu’s eyes couldn’t help but reveal a flash of envy.</p>
 <p>In the instance when his palm made contact with the scroll, Zhou Weiqing could feel a huge suction from the Consolidating Equipment Scroll suddenly, and the Heavenly Energy flowed in a torrent outwards. The patterns on the Consolidating Equipment Scroll shone out brightly instantaneously, and a special strange feeling spread over Zhou Weiqing’s whole body. It was as if a strange strength was swallowing his Heavenly Energy while sweeping across his entire body.</p>
 <p>The Consolidating Equipment Scroll vanished in the next instance, warping into a burst of bright light encircling Zhou Weiqing’s right wrist, and in Zhou Weiqing’s mind the image of a longbow appeared suddenly, exactly the same as the picture on the table earlier. A strong intense ferocious feel arose in him, flying quickly into the Icy Jade Physical Jewel in his right hand.</p>
 <p>The Heavenly Jewels of Heavenly Jewel Masters were always together, at the same time his Physical Jewel was being utilized, Zhou Weiqing’s Alexandrite Cat’s Eye also appeared under the cover of his sleeves. What made Zhou Weiqing most startled was that the six color wheel disk had unexpectedly started spinning at top speed when he started on the Physical Jewel Consolidating Equipment. As it revolved, both the black and grey coloured regions were twinkling brightly, absorbing the Heavenly Energy from his body, causing his Heavenly Energy consumption to dramatically increase.</p>
