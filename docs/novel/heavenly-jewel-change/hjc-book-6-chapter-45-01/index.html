 <p><b>Chapter 45 Gaining Status in the Academy (1)</b></p>
 <p>“My dear wife, you really want to let her stay in the room? Won’t Da Huang and Er Huang be seen by her then?” Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but ask Shangguan Bing’er.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er said: “Let her see them then. Did you think that noble families do not rear Heavenly Beasts? It’s a common sight!”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s eyeballs swirled around, and he suddenly grinned and said: “Heh heh, are you afraid of her threat? Have you so little faith in your dearest husband?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er gave a cold humph and took out a handkerchief from her bosom. “Wipe your drool off then. Humph! I’m going to choose my own room.”</p>
 <p>“Errr…” Zhou Weiqing took the handkerchief and said. “Bing’er, listen to my explanation! It wasn’t intentional!”</p>
 <p>Ming Hua who was just about to enter her room laughed and said: “Explain? Explaining means you have something to cover up… covering up the truth? Haha… Do you want to come to my room to sit a while? Just now… you hurt me a lot!”</p>
 <p>“I’ll deal with you later! If you want to stay here, fine… Landlord uncle, collect the money from her!”</p>
 <p>After he said that, Zhou Weiqing ran off to look for Shangguan Bing'er.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing'er had chosen her bedroom. Indeed, this house was tons better than their dormitory rooms, with all furniture, amenities and facilities provided for, most of them relatively new too.</p>
 <p>“Bing’er, are you angry with me? That… Everyone has an eye to admire beauty, I was just looking. I have no other thoughts about her.” Zhou Weiqing followed by her side. Seeing her busy choosing her room and ignoring him, he couldn’t help but say nervously.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing'er stopped suddenly and spun around to look at the pitiful looking Zhou Weiqing. “Little Fatty, let me discuss something with you.”</p>
 <p>“Ah?” Zhou Weiqing saw Shangguan Bing'er with a faint smile on her face and felt a little uneasy in his heart, but he said honestly: “Yes, what is it?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing'er gave a soft sigh and said: “My mother said, if I choose an outstanding man to be my husband, I must have the preparation in my heart. Outstanding men never have a lack of female admirers. There is no point trying to fully stop you at all, or I will follow in her footsteps and make the same mistakes she did. I just want you to promise me. No matter if you like another girl, you must never forget me. More importantly, she must meet with my approval as well. Otherwise, you better find a way to hide it from me forever. Is that clear?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing blinked as he stared at her, a sudden stabbing pain in his heart. Looking at Shangguan Bing'er before him, he was filled with love and tenderness for her. Opening his arms, he enveloped her in an embrace, holding her tightly. Without knowing why, he suddenly felt a sense of terror, as if afraid she would leave him at any time.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing'er embraced him back, leaning into him as she said gently: “Little Fatty, it's not that I don't trust you. It’s just that in matters of the heart, we can never be clear of the future. I just ask that you never ever lie to me about that.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said stutteringly: “Bing'er, I won’t like to you, definitely won’t lie to you. I do not know what will happen in the future, I really do not know. But when I thought of the fact that you might leave me, if there was any chance that you would leave me, my heart just felt so terrified, even more afraid than I am of death. Bing'er, if I make any mistake in the future, you can scold me, hit me, anything… But please don’t leave me ever, okay?”</p>
 <p>Although Zhou Weiqing was usually cunning and sneaky, this time Shangguan Bing'er could feel his sincerity, touching her deep inside. If at that time he promised that he would never like another woman or something like that, perhaps she would have laughed it off with a little disappointment. At this point, listening to his words, she could feel his sincerity, the words coming straight from his heart.</p>
 <p>“En…” Shangguan Bing'er said softly. At this time, she felt a sense of relaxation. Before she had left home, her mother had talked to her, and it had caused her much stress in her heart. Earlier, when she had just met up with Zhou Weiqing, she was so delighted at meeting up with him after such a long time that she didn’t think much about it. After that, it was followed by the few days of them playing around which allowed her to continue putting it away. However, when Ming Hua appeared, it sparked a huge sense of danger in his heart, releasing that pent up stress that had been hidden in her since that time. Now, Zhou Weiqing’s words had eased her mind and relieved her fears, and somehow their hearts seemed to grow closer.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing hugged Shangguan Bing’er intimately for a while, until their feelings calmed down before they finally let go of each other reluctantly. However, he couldn’t resist kissing her lightly on her lips.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er flushed deep red but did not resist, only stopping him when he tried to go further.</p>
 <p>“Bing’er, how about we both stay here, okay? At most, I’ll lay out some bedding and sleep on the floor. As long as I can see you, that’ll be great.” Zhou Weiqing’s repressed feelings grew lively once more. Thinking of Shangguan Bing’er’s beauty and soft warm body, he felt an itch in his heart.</p>
 <p>“No way.” Shangguan Bing'er rapped him on the head with her hand. “You stay in another room Da Huang and Er Huang will guard my room. Hmph, don’t think I don't know you, this rascal? If you get an inch, you’ll want one feet, in a few days you’ll be trying to find some way to climb onto the bed. Go quick, find your own room, I want to clean up and unpack.”</p>
 <p>The entire house was fairly large, and Zhou Weiqing had no choice but to choose another room which was just beside Shangguan Bing'er’s room. The following day was spent by the two of them cleaning up and unpacking their things. This was even under the condition that they were both Heavenly Jewel Masters with the Wind Attribute speeding up their actions, otherwise they wouldn’t have been able to complete everything so quickly.</p>
 <p>Ming Hua had not left her room for the whole day since she entered it, her door remaining shut tightly. To this, neither Zhou Weiqing nor Shangguan Bing’er questioned it. After all, she had sustained quite some injuries in the fight, and had even had some of her life energy drained by Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>Da Huang and Er Huang were finally freed from the confines of the ring, and were now staying in Shangguan Bing’er’s room. Her room was one of the largest in the entire house, a suite room with an outer and inner room, and the two large fellows were naturally sleeping in the outer room, acting as guards.</p>
 <p>The two little Icy Soul Heavenly Bears were now at the critical period of their growth stage. When they were adult, they would be Zong Stage Heavenly Beasts, but for now they were still young. Heavenly Beasts had their own methods of cultivation; as for Icy Soul Heavenly Bears, Zhou Weiqing did not know what their methods were. However, all he saw was those two large fellows didn’t do anything but sleep and eat, yet their power grew steadily day by day. He couldn’t help but compare to his own Immortal Deity Technique… Jealousy and envy!!!</p>
 <p>After they started staying in the house, the strangest thing for Zhou Weiqing was actually another separate matter altogether. When he started cultivation at night, the little white tiger Fat Cat who was usually stuck to his side actually went to the side instead, jumping onto a chair instead of snuggling up to him.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was rather unused to this, after all, cuddling such a soft furry little creature every night to warm his bed, he had grown used to it. However, he did not know what had happened to Fat Cat, but even when he tried to hug it to sleep, it refused, struggling out and back onto the chair. Zhou Weiqing could only stare at it helplessly and go to sleep alone.</p>
 <p>Dawn.</p>
 <p>“Fat Cat, aren’t you go to the academy with me?” Zhou Weiqing looked questioningly at the little white tiger who was sprawled lazily on the chair.</p>
 <p>Fat Cat immediately shook its head. Zhou Weiqing was not at all surprised that it could understand his words, after all even Da Huang and Er Huang those two large fellows could understand about sixty to seventy percent of what he said.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing walked over to feel Fat Cat’s forehead. “Are you having a fever? After snuggling with your big brother for two years, are you abandoning me? Are you trying to run away now? No way, even if you’re not going to school with me… hmm I should look for a chain to lock you up, so you don’t run away.”</p>
 <p>Being together for so long, he had grown used to Fat Cat’s presence around him all the time. If it were to leave suddenly, he wouldn’t be able to bear it.</p>
 <p>Fat Cat stared at him, black lines around its head. It sprang to its feet in a quick motion, jumping onto the table, and dipped a little furry paw into Zhou Weiqing’s drinking cup. The next thing that happened surprised Zhou Weiqing - it actually used the water to write on the table. “No, I am just cultivating quietly here.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing stared at it with his mouth wide open. “What!? The skies are falling down, the earth is cracking open, even a tiger can write now?! Did I see wrongly? Fat Cat! Let’s go display your prowess, I’m sure we can earn a lot of money doing so.”</p>
 <p>Fat Cat glared at him, its little paws dancing around the table again before it jumped back to its chair to sleep. As Zhou Weiqing looked at the table, he saw another word written on it. “Idiot.”</p>
 <p>Finally, Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er went to the academy by themselves. By the time they left, they realised that Ming Hua had already left. Leaving Fat Cat alone in the house, they were not worried. After all, not only were Da Huang and Er Huang there, both of them already Zun Stage Heavenly Beasts, even Fat Cat alone had shown its strange powers before.</p>
 <p>Today was the Fei Li Imperial Family Military Academy’s official first day, and the entire Academy seemed rather lifely. No matter freshmen or seniors, all of them were dressed in the school uniform, walking around the academy compound.</p>
 <p>The opening ceremony in the morning was for all four levels of students, and everyone headed for the main assembly hall on the first level of the school building. Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er naturally joined the others.</p>
 <p>The Fei Li Military Academy was indeed worthy of being one of the top three academies in the entire Fei Li Empire. The assembly hall was more than enough to hold three thousand people, though the number of students numbered much less than that.</p>
 <p>As Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er entered the assembly hall together, they drew much attention. It wasn’t that Zhou Weiqing’s fight with Zang Lang had already spread through the entire school, even if they knew about it, most of them probably wouldn’t recognize him anyway. The main reason they drew so much attention was because Shangguan Bing’er was just too beautiful, especially since she was still wearing a commoner student’s uniform.</p>
