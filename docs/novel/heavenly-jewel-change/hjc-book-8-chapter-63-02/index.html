 <p><b>Chapter 63 A Seal that cannot be Extinguished (2)</b></p>
 <p>Ma Qun patted his chest and said: “No problem, it’s easy to find a place to stay. Boss, look at me, I’m so loyal, when can you start on my six piece Consolidating Equipment Set?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing glared at him exasperatedly and said: “You concentrate on cultivating first. Come to think of it, actually I have a good plan for you, however I do not have the ability to create that type of Consolidating Equipment Scroll yet. You might need to wait a year at least for that. However, if you can wait that long, a unique six-piece set might not be impossible… and perhaps be much better for you. If you cannot wait, I can start on something else for you.”</p>
 <p>Without question, when he spoke of this, Zhou Weiqing had thought of Lin TianAo. Ma Qun was of the exact same attributes as Lin TianAo, both being Heavenly Jewel Masters of pure defense. If Ma Qun could follow in Lin TianAo’s route of development, this could be of great help to him.</p>
 <p>Ma Qun thought for a moment, then said: “Boss, I trust you. I will wait.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and patted him on the shoulder, saying: “Well, perhaps… Just wait for me to return from the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, and I will find you a specialised teacher.” Thinking about the time, that should also be around the time Lin TianAo would return from his own business.</p>
 <p>Just as Zhou Weiqing was about to head to dinner before returning to his dorm to start creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, he was suddenly blocked by the few bald seniors once again.</p>
 <p>Ma Qun and Kou Rui revealed a guarded look in their eyes, but Zhou Weiqing just smiled faintly and said: “Senior Zang Lang, I thought it was about time you would look for me. Ma Qun, Kou Rui, you both go ahead to eat first, I’ll be fine here.”</p>
 <p>Zang Lang said: “Zhou Weiqing, let’s speak alone.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded, and led by Zang Lang, both of them walked to a corner near the stairway.</p>
 <p>“So, what are your decisions?” Zhou Weiqing smiled and said.</p>
 <p>Zang Lang took a deep breath and looked hard at Zhou Weiqing once more before asking: “Is it really impossible to be the same as your classmates?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said passively: “I am not running a charity. Furthermore, you should know, every Consolidating Equipment Master has his limits. It is because you are my schoolmates that I am giving you face and not having any extra limitations. After all, each of you have your own values to stick to.”</p>
 <p>Zang Lang sighed and said: “You’re right, there is no free lunch in this world. I have discussed the issue with my classmates. Amongst the forty four of us, including myself, originally only three were willing to become your Follower. However, after your class beat up that noble class, there are now sixteen of us who are willing to become your Followers.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: “Have you heard of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament?”</p>
 <p>Zang Lang started, not expecting Zhou Weiqing to change the topic so strangely at this point in time. “Yup, of course I have heard of it.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “In two days time, I will be representing the Academy to attend the Heavenly Jewel Tournament as a substitute team member, and I will only be back in about three months time. You do not need to rush to give me an answer, you can let your classmates think about it more. When I’m back, that will be their last opportunity. At that time, you can bring all those who wish to Follow me and look for me.” He had to leave soon, and did not have the time and energy to get them all to Follow him. After all, there was no rush to complete this, and he could easily wait til he returned.</p>
 <p>After hearing that Zhou Weiqing would be attending the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, Zang Lang was taken aback. Originally, he had thought of Zhou Weiqing as merely a relatively strong person, the more important thing about him being his Consolidating Equipment Master status. However, it seemed that he was more than just an ordinary Consolidating Equipment Master… at least, his relation with the Academy was not ordinary! Not only did he get off easy after beating up nobles, he was still able to represent the academy for such a tournament! This was an honour that wasn’t easily granted, and was normally only for 4th year seniors!</p>
 <p>“I understand. I will let everyone know about this. Have a safe and successful trip.” Zang Lang extended a hand towards Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his hand, and said: “Train hard. What is a substitute worth. My goal is to try to become a first line team member, and also to bring those fellows from the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy to vie for the top four positions, and enter the Heavenly Jewel Island! Hahahaha.” In the midst of laughter, Zhou Weiqing turned and walked off.</p>
 <p>Looking at Zhou Weiqing’s disappearing back, Zang Lang was suddenly struck by a strange feeling… that this youth before him was not exaggerating. Zhou Weiqing had given him a few more months of time, but Zang Lang knew that if in that time he truly managed to enter the Heavenly Jewel Island, his requirements for Followers would definitely become much higher. By that time, it wasn’t a matter whether or not he and his classmates were willing to Follow him, but a matter of whether Zhou Weiqing was whether to accept them.</p>
 <p>With a light sigh, he suddenly felt that what Zhou Weiqing said was right. Instead of thinking so much, it was better to concentrate on training and cultivating hard. Personal strength was the most important after all.</p>
 <p>After eating his dinner, Zhou Weiqing did not rush back to his dorm, but vaulted across the wall instead, stealthily heading back to his home. His goal was simple, to get Yun Li to head to the Academy as well.</p>
 <p>After hearing that it had to do with creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, Yun Li naturally did not protest. Both he and Zhou Weiqing had not finished their discussion last night, and he was more than happy to follow him into the Academy. As such, they both headed to the Academy and sneaked in.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing quickly explained the current situation to Yun Li, who couldn’t help but cry out in surprise: “Are you mad? To create so many Consolidating Equipment Scrolls for so many people… and for free?! What are you up to?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing sighed and said: “I will not hide anything from you. Both myself and Shangguan Bing’er are from the Heavenly Bow Empire. Our empire is small and weak… and the only way to change that is to have large numbers of talents. These commoner classmates of mine can all be called talents. Outstanding talents! Not only are they all Jewel Masters, they also have an outstanding grasp on military skills and tactics. My plan is to find a way to recruit some of them back. As the saying goes, One is obliged to help in return after receiving something, as long as a third of them are willing to Follow me wholeheartedly, my investment will have paid off.”</p>
 <p>Yun Li shrugged and said: “Well, I’m just your Follower, if you’re willing to make that kind of investment, I will do as you say. Since you asked me to stay here, I can just stay here as a teacher. However, I will not be teaching anything, and will be researching on Consolidating Equipment Scrolls still.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed and said: “No problems, the reason I asked you to enter the school was mostly to help protect my classmates, and not let them be bullied by the noble students. Come on, let’s discuss on the best designs for their Consolidated Equipment.”</p>
 <p>Yun Li nodded, he was naturally most interested in anything to do with Consolidating Equipment Scrolls.</p>
 <p>After much discussions, the fact was proven that indeed Yun Li’s experience was a lot greater and more varied than Zhou Weiqing’s, especially in terms of design. According to the information provided by the commoner students, analysing and trying to find a most suitable fit for them, the two of them started designing the various scrolls. Their whole night was spent discussing and designing. Zhou Weiqing learned much from Yun Li, especially the experience in using the most basics to complete designs, that was extremely valuable experience. However, at the same time, Yun Li also learnt a lot from Zhou Weiqing, with his various strange and peculiar ideas which seemed to leap around, as well as Zhou Weiqing’s sect’s unique creation methods. In short, both benefitted greatly from that night’s work.</p>
 <p>In the next two days, Zhou Weiqing ended up just skipping lessons using the Heavenly Jewel Tournament as an excuse. Besides bringing Yun Li to see Cai Cai once in order to confirm his hiring as an assistant teacher, as well as going out for meals, both he and Ming Li barely rested for four hours per day, and that was usually spent in cultivation. The rest of the time, they were all spent designing and creating Scrolls.</p>
 <p>In terms of design, Zhou Weiqing was far from Yun Li. However, when it came to actual creation, even ten of Yun Li was no match for Zhou Weiqing. In a short span of three days, Yun Li had only creating three sets of Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, while Zhou Weiqing had already completed twenty seven sets, not only successfully meeting all the current requirements of the commoner students, but with some spare to boot!</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing left these extra scrolls with Yun Li, for him to use to purchase materials while he was gone.</p>
 <p>When Zhou Weiqing entered the commoner class once more, he was almost chased out… as his appearance was almost so different that he couldn’t be recognized.</p>
 <p>His clothes were all dirty, with many places stained with Consolidating Ink - which was almost impossible to wash out. His hair totally messy, and even with beard and mustache growing out. Furthermore, a person who hadn’t bathed for three days, how could he smell good? Although it wasn’t at the level of having his socks stick to the walls, it was already quite a sight...</p>
 <p>“Little Fatty, are you okay?” Shangguan Bing’er ignored the filth on Zhou Weiqing, as she asked with an aching heart. The others might only notice his clothes and hair, but Shangguan Bing’er could clearly see that in these three days, Zhou Weiqing had lost weight substantially.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “No problem, no problem at all. These few days, I have indeed accomplished much. Don’t stare at me like that, isn’t it all because of you all. Come come, it’s time to give out Scrolls, everyone has their own!” These few days, he had indeed accomplished a lot, and his personal gain was also huge. After the mutual learning with Yun Li, added on to his powerful Time Attribute, Zhou Weiqing could clearly feel that he had improved drastically. His Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Scrolls were almost in some ways equal to High Level Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, especially in terms of Consolidating success rate, improving from the usual 3 in a thousand chance to almost 7-8 in a thousand chance. As soon as he improved a little more, he was very close to breaking through to the High Level Consolidating Equipment Master rank!</p>
 <p>Hearing that it was time to distribute Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, a spark grew in all the students’ eyes. This time, Zhou Weiqing gave out almost twenty sets of scrolls. Besides the few Elemental Jewel Masters, only Shangguan Bing’er, Yan Zhexi and Ma Qun, the three Heavenly Jewel Masters did not get Scrolls.</p>
 <p>Yan Zhexi and Ma Qun did not question them. Both of them had easily guessed that Zhou Weiqing did not give them their scrolls now in order to create stronger ones for them in the future… perhaps even an entire Set!</p>
 <p>Ming Hua had arrived midway when Zhou Weiqing was giving out the scrolls. Looking at him grinning away as he gave out the scrolls to the Physical Jewel Master students, Ming Hua suddenly felt a cold fear grip her heart. She could clearly see the fanaticism arise in the students’ eyes as they received their Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. It wasn’t a fanaticism towards the Scrolls in their hands, but towards Zhou Weiqing, their monitor! After all, they were all commoners! This was the first time that each and everyone of them had their own Consolidating Equipment Scroll. Just like how a girl’s first time was most memorable to her, without question, this class monitor Zhou Weiqing had branded a seal in each of his classmate’s hearts… an unbreakable seal!</p>
