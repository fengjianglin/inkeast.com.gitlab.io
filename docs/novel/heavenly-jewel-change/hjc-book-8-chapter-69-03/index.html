 <p><b>Chapter 69 The Powerful Little Witch (3)</b></p>
 <p>In that moment of distraction, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but look down at his chest. He knew that without question, the change in his body had to be connected to Fat Cat’s level up. Although he did not know what happened when he was unconscious, but it was obvious that he had definitely gained a lot from Fat Cat, not to mention that he had not experienced any of the usual pain when breaking through to this key Death Acupuncture Point.</p>
 <p>Lifting his hands, he stroked Fat Cat on the head, and said with much emotions: “Thanks, Fat Cat. So you got rid of my clothes in order to help me… Thank you.”</p>
 <p>Fat Cat, who had been stewing in anger, was startled by the sudden touch. Hearing his words, she did not know why but she suddenly felt an unspeakable sense of warmth. Such a feeling was new to her, not having even felt that from her father.</p>
 <p>As they spoke, Zhou Weiqing had walked out of the cave. At first, he had been planning to praise Fat Cat more, but the moment he stepped out and saw the scene in front of him, his entire body shuddered in shock. In a flash, he charged forth to Shangguan Bing’er, who was lying on the ground.</p>
 <p>“This… what happened?” Zhou Weiqing held Shangguan Bing’er in his arms, blood-red flashing into his eyes, and a fierce killing intent erupted from his body. As he held her, his Heavenly Energy poured into her.</p>
 <p>The scene in front of him had indeed given him a big shock. The floor was filled with blood and littered with corpses of Heavenly Beasts. In the Heavenly Bow Unit, he had attended several missions facing Heavenly Beasts, and he naturally had a lot of experience in dealing with them. On first look, he could already tell how powerful these Heavenly Beasts were. Furthermore, each and every one of his companions were sitting or lying on the ground, wounded, how could he remain calm!?</p>
 <p>With the infusion of Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy, Shangguan Bing’er recovered a little. Amongst the team members, she was one of the rare few who had remained injury free, and the reason she collapsed was because of sheer exhaustion and the stress of the previous battle. Seeing that Zhou Weiqing was in front of her, safe and well, she heaved a sigh of relief. Snuggling in his arms, feeling his warm embrace, she finally relaxed as her eyes reddened.</p>
 <p>“Little Fatty, I thought I’d never see you again. It’s great that you are okay.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing held her closely, a strong sense of fear filling his heart, causing his face to go pale. He could not imagine losing Shangguan Bing’er, and he had never felt such terror before.</p>
 <p>“Little Fatty, I’m alright, just a little exhausted, you should go look at the rest. These three days, in order to protect you and Fat Cat, we have gone through at least a few dozen battles. Just a moment ago, there was this black clad young girl, she almost killed us all.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing quickly cleared his head; he was no fool after all, and had only just been distracted by the sight of Shangguan Bing’er on the ground. He immediately understood that these Heavenly Beasts attacks had been due to Fat Cat’s Level Up, and the rest of the team had spent the last three days fighting to defend them. Three days! For Shangguan Bing’er to be so exhausted to fainting, he could imagine how tough the fighting had been.</p>
 <p>Carefully, he placed Shangguan Bing’er back onto the ground in a comfortable spot, before quickly heading to Lin TianAo.</p>
 <p>It had to be said that Lin TianAo was indeed worthy of his title as the leader of the team. His injuries were serious, but he was still the only one who managed to sit there cross legged, meditating and cultivating to heal himself.</p>
 <p>Just that resilience and determination alone, it was far beyond anyone.</p>
 <p>“Leader, how is it?” Zhou Weiqing looked to Lin TianAo concernedly. He was rather taken aback, as Lin TianAo was currently pale and ashen, with uneven breathing and his muscles twitching, clearly in a large amount of pain. Zhou Weiqing knew very well how powerful his defense was, and for him to take such damage in the fight, it was clear how violent the fight had been.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing did not have the Lie Attribute, and could not help heal Lin TianAo. The only thing he could do was the infuse him with Heavenly Energy, to help him in his process of self-heal.</p>
 <p>Sitting behind Lin TianAo, Zhou Weiqing placed both his palms onto Lin TianAo’s broad back, slowly infusing his own Heavenly Energy.</p>
 <p>As soon as he did so, Zhou Weiqing found something peculiar. In Lin TianAo’s body, there was a strangely familial energy, and as Zhou Weiqing infused his own Heavenly Energy, the feeling grew stronger.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, a cool refreshing energy returned through Zhou Weiqing’s palms into his body, and the attribute wheel in front of his eyes automatically rolled to the grey area, signifying the Demonic Attribute.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on?” Zhou Weiqing was caught by surprise. Could it be that when he broke through the second portion of the Immortal Deity Technique, he could control the Devour technique outside of the Demonic Change? But… it was Lin TianAo in front of him, he did not want to Devour him!</p>
 <p>Just as Zhou Weiqing was trying to puzzle things out, the cool energy entering his palms grew stronger. Furthermore, he quickly realised that this energy was not what he first thought; it was definitely not Lin TianAo’s Earth Attribute energy, but an icy cold Demonic Heavenly Energy!</p>
 <p>As the Demonic Attribute Heavenly Energy was drawn away by Zhou Weiqing, he could obviously feel that the tensed muscles on Lin TianAo’s back relaxing a little, and he was also able to sit up straighter. This pure Demonic Heavenly Energy was also mixed in with some Darkness Heavenly Energy, and as soon as Zhou Weiqing drew it in, it was absorbed by his thirteen Death Acupuncture Points, being transformed into his own, and Zhou Weiqing could feel that his Heavenly Energy had actually grown, along with his cultivation level!</p>
 <p>“I’m alright now.” Lin TianAo released a breath. Earlier on, when Little Witch had struck his Assembly Shield with her final blow, it had almost been destroyed. These three days, Lin TianAo had been the mainstay of the entire team, the pillar holding them together, and the drain on him was just too immense. If not for that, Little Witch would not found it so easy to deal with him. After sustaining such a heavy injury, the thing that was of the greatest problem to Lin TianAo was just that cold Demonic energy. As soon as it had invaded his body, it had started nibbling away at his energy, damaging his meridians. He had to spend a large amount of Heavenly Energy just to suppress it, but was unable to clear it. With that, he was unable to put his focus on healing the other injuries. He knew that if this continued, even if his other wounds were healed, the Demonic Energy would remaining in his body, continuously leaving him with a major injury.</p>
 <p>Just as he was getting worried, Zhou Weiqing arrived, and as his hands were placed on his back, Lin TianAo could feel the hugely problematic cold energy get drawn away by Zhou Weiqing. Without that Demonic Energy, he heaved a sigh of relief, as he could now focus on healing the rest of his wounds.</p>
 <p>“Weiqing, head over to the other side to look at Drunken Bao. He sustained the heaviest injuries, and he is also plagued by the Evil Energy. Save him first, then Little Four and Crow. Ye Paopao is just exhausted, and Xiao Yan burnt his own life energy to summon the Flame of Life, and he can only slowly recuperate by himself.”</p>
 <p>Even at such a time when he was so heavily injured, Lin TianAo was still a responsible team leader. He knew it wasn’t time to ask Zhou Weiqing about how he was able to deal with the ice cold Evil Energy in his body, and it was much more important to deal with everyone’s injuries.</p>
 <p>In the next hour, Zhou Weiqing finally managed to draw all the Demonic Energy within all his companions’ bodies, alleviating much of their injuries. At the same time, the mass influx of Demonic Energy was also like a tonic to himself, giving a huge boost to his cultivation level.</p>
 <p>As the team gathered together, only then did Zhou Weiqing realise the seriousness of the matter. Among the seven of his companions, the only one who remained uninjured was Shangguan Bing’er. Ye Paopao had just awoken, but he had sustained some injuries during the past three days of fighting. However, both he and Crow’s injuries were still relatively light. Especially Crow, whose main toll here was the invasion of the Demonic Energy, which was already drawn out by Zhou Weiqing. However, the rest of the team was in dire straits.</p>
 <p>Drunken Bao was severely injured, and although Zhou Weiqing had helped him draw out the Demonic Energy in his body, it had already one the damage within. Added to his other injuries, it would take a long time for him to recover. The next worst was Xiao Yan, whose meridians had sustained quite a serious injury. In order to fight with Little Witch, he had burnt his life force to summon the Fame of Life. He did not sustain a lot of injuries, but it had drained his vitality and life force, and both he and Drunken Bao were in a coma. Little Four was only slightly better than the other two; just like Lin TianAo, he had sustained internal injuries and would require some time to recover.</p>
 <p>Out of the entire eight members of the Fei Li Battle Team, four out of the five main team members were heavily injured. Yet, it was barely twenty days to the Heavenly Jewel Tournament! Twenty days was definitely not enough time for the four of them to complete their recovery.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing slowly and quietly harvested the various materials from the dead Heavenly Beasts. Despite knowing that his team members were safe now that he had drawn the Demonic Energy from their wounds, his brow was still furrowed. In order to protect him and Fat Cat, these seven companions had not abandoned him, fighting with all their lives for three whole days. No matter what happened, this put him in severe debt to them. More importantly, in order to protect him, with the four main team members injured, especially Lin TianAo, what would they do for the Heavenly Jewel Tournament?! They had come to this tournament with high hopes to enter the top four, especially for Lin TianAo who was already twenty nine years old, it could be said that this was his last chance, and something he had worked towards for the past few years. It had been that final thing he wanted to accomplish before returning to Zhou Weiqing to be his Lifetime Follower.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Since Fat Cat had already completed her level up, the aura drawing the Heavenly Beasts was no longer up. As such, they rested in the clearing for the next three days, managing to recover from the worst of the situation. Xiao Yan and Drunken Bao finally woke up, and though no one blamed Zhou Weiqing, he could still see the depression in all their eyes.</p>
 <p>As night dawn, they sat around the fire, eating the dinner that Zhou Weiqing had prepared. Everyone remained awkwardly silent.</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, Drunken Bao who had his head lowered down with a slight reddish tinge in his eyes raised his head and said: “Leader, let’s go back home.”</p>
 <p>With so many injuries, how could they possibly continue attending the Heavenly Jewel Tournament?!</p>
