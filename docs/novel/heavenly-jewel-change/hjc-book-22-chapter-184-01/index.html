 <p><b>Chapter 184 Boundless Infinitum! (1)</b></p>
 <p>“You’re Shangguan Xue’er?” The moment Zhou Weiqing asked the question, he wanted to slap himself on the face.</p>
 <p>Indeed, lying right there on the ground, her body huddled up in herself as she cried… it was the heir to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, the eldest sister of the Shangguan Sisters, Shangguan Xue’er.</p>
 <p>Originally, when the border wars had ended and the Peerless Battalion was alright, Shangguan Fei’er had discussed with Shangguan Xue’er and left silently to return to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. Since Zhou Weiqing was not around, she wanted to head back to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace to talk to Bing’er first, before returning to look for Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>Before she left, this mischievous Little Demon Girl had schemed a trap for her own sister…</p>
 <p>“Sister, I am going back now, but I am still worried about the Peerless Battalion. Anyway, no one can recognize the difference between you and me. As long as you do not use your Consolidated Equipment, you’ll be exactly the same as me. Those Peerless Battalion fellows, without me to keep them in their places, who knows what they will end up doing? You take my place for now to suppress them and help train them ok?”</p>
 <p>“Also, also… Little Fatty is such a playboy, you help me look after him. Don’t let me bring back another few more women. Big sis, help me please. For mine and Bing’er’s sake, you must keep watch on Little Fatty. Ok?” Just like that, after countless wheedling and begging, Shangguan Xue’er had finally agreed to take her position after she left. Just like Shangguan Fei’er had predicted, no one recognized her after that, especially since the close combat training of the Peerless Battalion was already on the right track, and Shangguan Xue’er’s cultivation level was even above Shangguan Fei’er’s, naturally they would not have any issues in that area. As such, in this period of time, Shangguan Xue’er had slowly eased into her sister’s position without any problems.</p>
 <p>Today, when Shangguan Xue’er saw Zhou Weiqing bringing Tian’er back, how could she not furious? This little bastard had already seduced her two sisters, and was still going after other women?! Even though she had seen Tian’er in her ‘Fat Cat’ form before, she had never seen Tian’er before. As such, she had not been able to resist in calling Zhou Weiqing out. In her original plan, she would beat him up savagely first before informing him of her identity, and getting him to dump Tian’er.</p>
 <p>Who knew that the heavens would play such a huge joke on her. Zhou Weiqing had truly taken her for Shangguan Fei’er, and with her Acupuncture Point suppressed, she had not been able to resist… and the events had played out as such.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing stood there staring at Shangguan Xue’er dazed, unable to even say a word. All his plans and shameless ideas for Shangguan Fei’er had suddenly turned into being against Shangguan Xue’er… and that was a whole different matter!</p>
 <p>Oh Heavens! What had he done!</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er’s outer clothes had been thrown to the side by him, and she did not have much covering her any longer; even her pants were halfway down.</p>
 <p>The heavens were falling, and the earth was sinking. That was his own sister in law!</p>
 <p>No matter how intelligent and cunning Zhou Weiqing was, faced with such a scenario, he was totally at a loss. Having almost committed such an evil act, he wished that the earth would open up and swallow him whole. If Bing’er or Fei’er knew about this, he would truly be a goner!</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er remained sobbing bitterly on the ground, even forgetting to wear her clothes. From young, she had always been the most hardworking, the most disciplined, as she knew the responsibilities that weighed down on her young shoulders. In the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, she was the First Young Miss, above all. Let alone anyone daring to violate her, most people would not even dare to look at her in the eye. Even Zhan LingTian, who had feelings for her, would keep some distance when he spoke to her.</p>
 <p>Previously, when Shangguan Xue’er had lost her first kiss to Zhou Weiqing by accident, she had already been in much pain and suffering. However, for the sake of her little sister, she had forced herself to tolerate it. However, that hate in her heart for Zhou Weiqing for stealing away her first kiss had never disappeared, thus holding that grudge in her heart all this time.</p>
 <p>Yet, just right now, Zhou Weiqing had actually even done far worse to her, doing all sorts of intimate things to her forcefully. Currently, the only thing left in Shangguan Xue’er’s confused heart was utter sorrow.</p>
 <p>The two just remained there, one standing there at a loss, the other crying her eyes out.</p>
 <p>At last, it was Zhou Weiqing who recovered first. The situation had already occurred, and it was no point in trying to avoid it. No matter what, he would have to face it. Carefully, he walked to the side and picked up Shangguan Xue’er’s clothes, carefully covering her with them. Bracing himself, he said softly: “I’m… I’m sorry. I really did not know it was you, I thought it was Fei’er…”</p>
 <p>“How about… how about… you beat me up. Will that make you feel better? I will not fight back at all, how’s that?”</p>
 <p>With a sudden swoosh, Shangguan Xue’er’s head abruptly lifted, her eyes that were red from crying were filled with flames of hatred. Her teeth gritting hard, she had already charged forward in a flash. An intense killing intent burst forth like a sharp blade from a sheath. “I’m going to kill you!” Her eyes were bloodshot, and with a single palm strike to the chest, Zhou Weiqing flew all the way out.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing had kept his word, allowing her palm to strike hard on his chest without any resistance, and he was instantly sent flying back.</p>
 <p>The powerful defensive capabilities of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation saved his life here; luckily he had been in that state all this while.</p>
 <p>When Shangguan Xue’er’s palm struck his chest, Zhou Weiqing’s entire body glowed in a purple light. If Shangguan Xue’er had been in a calmer state, she would have instantly sensed that her blow was scattered by the purple light, as if the strength behind the blow was separated to every inch of Zhou Weiqing’s body. As such, though it seemed like he had been savagely blown away by that palm strike, Zhou Weiqing was actually not injured at all.</p>
 <p>The defensive capabilities of the Dragon race could be said to be top notch even amongst all Heavenly God Tier Heavenly Beasts, and they themselves were considered one of the strongest amongst all their peers. Furthermore, the Dragon-Tiger Transformation was not just the sole Dragon bloodline alone, but with the power of the Dark Demon God Tiger behind as well. With Shangguan Xue’er’s seven-Jeweled cultivation level, her palm strike wasn’t able to actually hurt Zhou Weiqing, even if he did not defend himself, and could only cause his chest to hurt.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing crashed onto the ground, skidding back almost a dozen yards before he came to a stop. At that moment, Shangguan Xue’er’s killing intent finally locked down upon him.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s heart gripped in shock. She was really trying to kill him! If Shangguan Xue’er was going to beat him up, he would allow her to do so without any question, even if he was severely injured. After all, he was the one in the wrong! However, if she wanted to take his life, he couldn’t possibly lay his life down just like that!</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er’s body was like a gust of icy cold wind, and as Zhou Weiqing was struck back by her palm, she flew forward in chase. In midair, her entire body suddenly burst forth with a brilliant dark-gold light. The three chi long snow-white sword that Zhou Weiqing had once seen before appeared in her hands, pointing right towards his chest.</p>
 <p>Even though he was still in the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, even with that snow white blade only just pointing at his chest, Zhou Weiqing felt a slight sensation of pain.</p>
 <p>The blade in Shangguan Xue’er’s hands was the Boundless Infinitum Sword from the Boundless Infinitum Set. In the world today, the Boundless Infinitum Set was currently the only Legendary Set that consisted of eleven pieces, known as the God Set. It was also the greatest treasure of the entire Heaven’s Expanse Palace… how could it be ordinary?</p>
 <p>Currently, Shangguan Xue’er’s eyes were covered with a film of blood red. Any pure and innocent girl who met such a huge shame and humiliation, how could one remain calm?</p>
 <p>A snowy white light flashed through the skies, drawing a beautiful arc that raced right towards Zhou Weiqing’s heart. In that instant, Zhou Weiqing could only sense that the distance between him and Shangguan Xue’er seemed to warp strangely. Even with his powerful senses, he was actually unable to sense which area Shangguan Xue’er’s Heavenly Energy was targeting and locked on to.</p>
 <p>In the blink of an eye, the white light had reached Zhou Weiqing’s chest area.</p>
 <p>A lean to the side, a sidestep, a Blink Skill. Only then did Zhou Weiqing escape instantly. At the same time, two triangles of bright light appeared on each of his hands, as he quickly released his Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation.</p>
 <p>He had no choice but to do so! Shangguan Xue’er’s cultivation level was higher than his, not just at simply a seven-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, but already at the maximum of the seven-Jeweled stage, barely a thread away from reaching the eight-Jeweled stage. More importantly, with the Boundless Infinitum Set’s terrifying pressure, Zhou Weiqing could sense that without using the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, he would not be able to even survive. However, even at the same time as he used his Blink Skill, his heart relaxed slightly inwardly. That was because the position that the white light had been about to strike at his heart, but at the last split second before he blinked he sensed it move to the side very very slightly. It was only a slight movement, barely even noticeable, but if it had landed on him, it was the difference between a fatal wound and a severe wound. That was to say, although Shangguan Xue’er was in a berserk rage, she still held a thread of sanity, perhaps not willing to actually kill him off.</p>
 <p>Having her blow dodged by Zhou Weiqing and seeing the glow of the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation appearing below his feet, Shangguan Xue’er’s face grew even frostier. Six more bouts of dark gold light appeared, and in the cover of the Consolidating Equipment God Protective Aura, the magnificent looking Boundless Infinitum Set appeared around her.</p>
 <p>The pieces of the Boundless Infinitum Set that Shangguan Xue’er currently had were the two shoulder pauldrons, chestplate, girdle and belt, war kilt, and greaves for her right leg. Just like any Legendary Set which had not been completed, her current Boundless Infinitum Set items were still dark-gold in colour, but the tattoos and inscriptions around them were one of the most beautiful that Zhou Weiqing had seen from any God Tier Consolidated Equipment or Legendary Sets.</p>
 <p>The tattoos and inscriptions around the Boundless Infinitum Set items were like beautiful Cloud Dragon Tattoos, surreal and even ethereal. From the surface of the armour, these Cloud Dragon Tattoos seemed to come to life, like many little cloud dragons twirling around Shangguan Xue’er’s body.</p>
