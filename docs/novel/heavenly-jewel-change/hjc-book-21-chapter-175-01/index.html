 <p><b>Chapter 175 First Test. Power. (1)</b></p>
 <p>The two huge Heavenly Beasts slowly lumbered all the way to the front of both youths before they stopped. They looked almost exactly the same, their body length about seven metres large, covered fully with a thick layer of icy blue scale armour. In contrast, their height was only one and a half metres tall, with their entire body down close to the ground, showing a stark difference between their heights and lengths.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing did not recognize such a Heavenly Beast, but it looked like a huge pangolin. Its eyes flashed with cold light, and from the aura, both were Upper Level Zong Stage Heavenly Beasts.</p>
 <p>It had to be known - the task for both Zhou Weiqing and Gu Yingbing was not to defeat these Heavenly Beasts, but to overwhelm them with their aura. To an ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master, perhaps they might be able to defeat a Heavenly Beast of equal level, maybe even higher level. However, in order to just use their aura to overwhelm a Heavenly Beast, they had to be at a much higher cultivation level! Yet, these two Heavenly Beasts in front of them… let alone Zhou Weiqing, even Gu Yingbing was at a lower cultivation level! After all, Gu Yingbing had only just reached the Nine Jeweled stage. This test would truly be highly dependent on both their bloodlines now!</p>
 <p>The two huge Heavenly Beasts were extremely obedient, their eyes fixed upon the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord Xue AoTian, as if waiting for any instruction. From the looks of it, they were unbelievably well behaved and honest.</p>
 <p>Xue AoTian said passively: “You both can start now. The time given is five minutes [1. The term used here is 一炷香, or time for one incense stick to burn. From my research, I believe in the old days it's their reference for 5 mins]. If in this time, any of you have not succeeded in overwhelming them, it counts as a failure.”</p>
 <p>As Xue AoTian gave the command to start, Gu Yingbing was the first to act. Gold-red light sprang forth around his body, and his eyes also turned a brilliant gold. At the same time, a powerful aura burst forth from him, the terrifying presence enveloping the huge pangolin-like Heavenly Beast in front of him.</p>
 <p>The Heavenly Beast’s body trembled slightly, and it seemed to hesitate slightly before it stepped back a few steps. Its four limbs buckled, and it fell to the ground, its body still trembling. Success… it had been overwhelmed.</p>
 <p>The gold-red light slowly dimmed slightly, and Gu Yingbing put his hands behinds his back in a relaxed position, as if nothing much had happened.</p>
 <p>In a matter of a few short breaths, he had successfully overwhelmed a powerful Heavenly Beast living in the depths of the Heavenly Snow Mountain. One could imagine how powerful his aura was.</p>
 <p>In truth, with Gu Yingbing’s bloodline and current cultivation level, he normally would not be able to overwhelm such a powerful Heavenly Beast at such a speed. However, he had been in quite an unstable state for the past few hours, with all the hate towards Zhou Weiqing raging in him. This time, he wanted to give Zhou Weiqing a quick blow first, and he had burst forth with a massive power boost at the start, succeeding in an instance.</p>
 <p>As soon as Gu Yingbing succeeded, he naturally turned his gaze to Zhou Weiqing at the side, waiting to see if he could actually succeed.</p>
 <p>As he did so, his eyes naturally gleamed with an obvious disdain and contempt.</p>
 <p>As compared to Gu Yingbing’s dazzling performance and impressive presence and aura, Zhou Weiqing’s performance was vastly different. He actually took a few steps forward right in front of the powerful Heavenly Beast, placing his palm on its huge forehead. The faint grey mist around his body started glowing more, swirling around, though his body did not have any other obvious changes, nor did he seem to release his aura much at all.</p>
 <p>Gu Yingbing gave a cold smirk. He had been waiting all this while for Zhou Weiqing to take action. This first Heavenly Beast was already at the Upper Level Zong Stage, and with that puny cultivation level that Zhou Weiqing had, how could he possibly overwhelm it? Still, why didn’t he release that Demonic Change State of his? If he used that, at least he might have some chance of success.</p>
 <p>Just as Gu Yingbing was getting slightly curious about that, all of a sudden, the huge pangolin Heavenly Beast in front of Zhou Weiqing collapsed onto the ground. It was success for Zhou Weiqing as well! Although its body was not shivering, it had actually collapsed cowering down on the ground.</p>
 <p>Gu Yingbing subconsciously turned his gaze to Xue AoTian, and actually saw slight surprise on his teacher’s face.</p>
 <p>In a way, one could say that this form of overwhelming Heavenly Beasts was of no meaning in actual combat. After all, in any normal fight, Heavenly Beasts would never stand there obediently allowing you to slowly overwhelm it. At the same time, Heavenly Jewel Masters would usually not spend their Heavenly Energy on strengthening their aura and pressure. Despite all that, it was no question that it was a shockingly impressive feat for Zhou Weiqing, a mere six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, to be able to successfully overwhelm a nine-Jeweled Heavenly Beast! More so, he had not taken much more time than Gu Yingbing did!</p>
 <p>On the scene, there were six people in total. Of them, three were at the Heavenly Emperor Tier stage, and one Heavenly God Tier stage. In the entire world, that was already considered the apex of power. Yet, out of all four of these powerhouses, somehow none of them could figure out how Zhou Weiqing actually succeeded in overwhelming the Heavenly Beast. Indeed, not a single one. Even the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord Xue AoTian was not able to figure out. Only Long Shiya could vaguely guess how Zhou Weiqing managed to do so, but he was still not sure.</p>
 <p>Even though he seemed to have succeeded in overwhelming that nine-Jeweled stage Heavenly Beast, Zhou Weiqing still did not emit any powerful aura or presence. It was truly a strange sensation. How did he manage to pull that off?</p>
 <p>In fact, when Zhou Weiqing placed his palm on the massive pangolin Heavenly Beast’s forehead, his eyes had subtly turned a deep purple. However, his back was facing the group, and the others did not see it. As for the Heavenly Beast, in the next instant it felt a strange presence emitting from the palm, an aura filled with despair.</p>
 <p>Icy cold, despair, darkness, gloom, deathly stillness.</p>
 <p>Uncountable negative emotions swarmed into the pangolin’s mind. A Zong Stage Heavenly Beast already had some intelligence, but it was no match for those Heavenly King Stage or higher Heavenly Beasts. As soon as it was filled with those powerful negative emotions, its only feeling was that it could only surrender or die.</p>
 <p>In this first round, Zhou Weiqing had actually resorted to skillful trickery. He did not want to reveal his true powers too quickly. What he had done was actually very simple - hiding the Devour Skill of the Demonic Attribute within his palm, but not actually releasing it out. As such, none of the others could detect it, but the sensation and aura of it was still emitted through his palm to the Heavenly Beast’s head, even if it had not taken action yet.</p>
 <p>As his cultivation level had grown, and his body had gone through evolution twice, Zhou Weiqing’s Devour Skill had also improved drastically. It could be said to be full of many different miraculous uses, and it truly lived up to its name as the strongest Skill of the entire Demonic Attributes, able to improve infinitely. More importantly, the Heavenly Beast had been given strict instructions not to fight back, and his strategy of using the hidden Devour Skill had been a straightforward, yet miraculously effective one.</p>
 <p>As soon as Zhou Weiqing completed overwhelming the Heavenly Beast in front of him, he did not even look at Gu Yingbing. Instead, he took a few steps back, standing there in a calm and relaxed position.</p>
 <p>When the two Heavenly Beasts stood up once more, the one that faced Gu Yingbing did not have much change, just a hint of fear in its eyes. However, the one which faced Zhou Weiqing had its head held down low, not even daring to look at Zhou Weiqing. It was ingrained into its mind that even if it just looked at Zhou Weiqing, he would Devour it totally.</p>
