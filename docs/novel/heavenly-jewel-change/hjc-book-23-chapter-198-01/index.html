 <p><b>Chapter 198 Breakdown! Rescue! Devour! (1)</b></p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing did not know that this state he was in was known as ‘Breakdown’. That was to say, his entire body was in the midst of breaking down and collapsing from within.</p>
 <p>When he had triggered the energy that his body could not withstand, he had gained a temporary boost to his combat abilities, saving his life in front of the Heavenly King assassin. At the same time, the backlash was not something his body could withstand.</p>
 <p>The Dragon-Tiger Transformation could be said to be a power that had come about through the mutation of his bloodline. Such a mutation was extremely rare, or perhaps even totally non existent in the entire Boundless Mainland. After all, the Dark Demon God Tiger bloodline was not from this world, and added to it the rare phenomenon of the Solidified Dragon Spirit… the fusion between the two had caused such a unique mutation that only Zhou Weiqing had.</p>
 <p>When he had first achieved the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, Zhou Weiqing had actually only managed to tap into a small portion of the power of the bloodline, but it was in perfect balance. At the same time, as Zhou Weiqing continued growing, the bloodline power would continue being unlocked and triggered. According to normal growth, if Zhou Weiqing cultivated to the nine-Jeweled stage, the second stage of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation should naturally come to him, giving him a huge boost to his combat abilities, also mimicking the innate fighting style of dragons or tigers. That formidable might alone would have been astonishing indeed.</p>
 <p>However, he was after all currently only at the sixth Jeweled stage. No matter his body, its strength and toughness, as well as his Heavenly Energy, his Legendary Sets, all of it could not meet the requirements for the perfect fusion of the second stage of the Dragon Tiger Transformation.</p>
 <p>The bloodline power had been invoked by him, but he was only able to maintain that state for a very short period of time. What followed next would be the power attempting to settle back down, and this process would need his entire body to be strong enough to re-forge itself and fuse with the new bloodline power. This was a process just like when he originally first Awakened his Demonic Change State.</p>
 <p>However, it was clear that Zhou Weiqing did not have the power, toughness and stability to settle the abruptly awakened bloodline, resulting in the clash of energies in his body now, as it raged through his body in an attempt to find a place. Once his body was unable to withstand it, then the energy would burst through and he would be utterly disintegrated. Even the Resurrect Skill of the Divine Attribute would not be able to bring him back, as Breakdown meant he would instantly be disintegrated into nothing.</p>
 <p>Currently, the sheer amount of power was no longer something he could control. It was not just a simple matter of willpower that could allow him to tide through.</p>
 <p>Perhaps if the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya was here, he might have a slight possibility of using his Heavenly Emperor energy to suppress the bloodline power, forcing it to settle down… but Long Shiya wasn’t here!</p>
 <p>*PENG* The door slammed open and two graceful figures entered. At this moment, both Shangguan Xue’er and Tian’er were extremely worried, and they had rushed here urgently at top speed.</p>
 <p>As soon as they entered, the two girls immediately saw Zhou Weiqing’s current condition. His body had not shrunk back to his original state, still stuck in the second stage of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, stout as can be. However, by now, the scales on his body were already indistinct, a very thin layer that seemed to disappear and reappear like an illusion. It was clear that it was about to vanish, and they could clearly see the horrible cracks and tears on Zhou Weiqing’s skin.</p>
 <p>Both girls were heirs of the two most powerful Great Saint Lands, and at this moment, neither of them panicked, instantly making their judgement of the current situation.</p>
 <p>Tian’er was the first to spring into motion. In a flash, she appeared beside Zhou Weiqing, her hands outstretched and Divine Attribute Heavenly Energy bursting out of them, warping into a thick gold light which enveloped Zhou Weiqing’s body. With all her might, she focused on the healing and boosting effects of the Divine Attribute.</p>
 <p>The Divine Attribute was truly one of the four Saint Attributes, and the healing effect was one of the top in the world. The horrifying cracks on the surface of Zhou Weiqing’s skin, all the way down to the tears in his meridians, started to heal. The involuntary shuddering of his body also calmed slightly.</p>
 <p>For Zhou Weiqing, lost in the violently intense pain, he suddenly felt a soft warmth encompass him, lowering his pain slightly.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er stood by Zhou Weiqing’s side, looking urgently at Tian’er. She did not have any healing capabilities, and she was unable to help besides watching Tian’er save Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>“What is his current status?” She asked urgently with worry.</p>
 <p>Tian’er’s brow was currently furrowed. As her Divine Attribute energy entered Zhou Weiqing’s body, she instantly sensed his current condition.</p>
 <p>In this world, in terms of knowledge of Zhou Weiqing’s body, no one could surpass Tian’er. She had the most intimate relations with him so many times, and they often cultivated together with the four Saint Attributes. As such, no matter his meridians, his bloodline energy, how he circulated his Heavenly Energy, down to all parts of his body, Tian’er was extremely clear of everything. As such, she directly discovered the tremendous danger he was currently in.</p>
 <p>“It’s his bloodline energy exploding forth and acting up. I believe his current state is due to that excessive bloodline energy, initiated when he was facing death… but the problem now is that his body is unable to withstand such a level of energy, resulting in a severe backlash. He is in danger of Breakdown at anytime.” Tian’er said urgently.</p>
 <p>Her Divine Attribute could only help Zhou Weiqing suppress the energy for a short period of time, but it would never be able to help him settle it down. After all, it was still an external source of energy, and while the healing might help, it was no long term suggestion. Once Tian’er’s energy ran out, then the suppressed bloodline energy would burst out once more.</p>
 <p>“What do we do then?” Shangguan Xue’er asked worriedly.</p>
 <p>Tian’er bit her lip, hesitating for a moment before saying: “Help me, circulate your Heavenly Energy into my body to support me. I will have to try using my two Saint Attributes to invoke his two Saint Attributes. There is nothing we can do directly… Perhaps now the only chance is for the four Saint Attributes to fuse together, and hopefully that will help the raging bloodline energy calm down and settle.”</p>
 <p>In a flash, Shangguan Xue’er appeared behind Tian’er’s back. Placing her palms on Tian’er’s back, she took a deep breath and said: “Be careful. We must definitely succeed now!”</p>
 <p>Tian’er nodded and said: “We will.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er began to slowly infuse her Heavenly Energy into Tian’er’s body. Without any instructions, she automatically knew what to do. She purified her own Heavenly Energy, ensuring there was no Attributes within, only the purest form of Heavenly Energy. This would enable Tian’er to better use it for her own purposes.</p>
 <p>With Shangguan Xue’er’s help, Tian’er’s spirit perked up, and the circulating of her Divine Attribute Heavenly Energy also increased.</p>
 <p>The Heavenly Energy cultivated with the Boundless Infinitum Technique had one unique point, that was a vast amount, boundless and long lasting. With such a strong support of sustainable Heavenly Energy, Tian’er clearly heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>A faint purple light rose slowly from Tian’er’s eyes, and a thick spirit energy fluctuation appeared. Tian’er took a deep breath. Abruptly, the purple light shot out from her eyes, but not directly onto Zhou Weiqing’s body. Instead, it spread out, forming a faint purple shield of light enveloping Zhou Weiqing, starting to merge with the Divine Attribute energy that she was infusing into his body.</p>
 <p>No matter Tian’er or Shangguan Xue’er, they were now extremely nervous. To be honest, Tian’er did not know whether this last ditch method could work. After all, in all the time that she had cultivated together with Zhou Weiqing, though they had done so with the fusion of the four Saint Attributes, they had never succeed in actually using the fused Saint Attributes or understanding the underlying profound secrets. The reason they did so was because with such cultivation, it was much faster than if they did so individually.</p>
 <p>Currently, Tian’er was facing two problems. Firstly, she did not know how or if using her two Saint Attributes would actually invoke Zhou Weiqing’s two Saint Attributes as well. Secondly, even if it worked, she did not know if it would actually be of help in suppressing and settling his bloodline energy.</p>
 <p>If any one of those problems ‘failed’, then she would have no way of saving Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>The Divine and Spirit Attributes surrounded and enveloped Zhou Weiqing’s body, but his body actually seemed to tremble even more violently. Just as Tian’er was surprised by that, a grey coloured light rose up, along with a faint energy reverberation that seemed to warp the world around.</p>
 <p>The four Saint Attributes were indeed able to attract each other, and she had successfully invoked Zhou Weiqing’s two Saint Attributes as well. The four Saint Attributes fused together, forming the usual whirlwind shape it took, spinning right above Zhou Weiqing’s body. At the same time, the violent shuddering of his body slowed down, his ragged breathing having a better turn.</p>
 <p>Miraculously, as the four fused Saint Attributes swirled in the whirlpool, the raging bloodline energy in Zhou Weiqing’s body actually seemed to calm down slightly, at least not smashing around violently. Under Tian’er’s control, the fused energies slowly entered Zhou Weiqing’s body, slowly entering his over twenty energy whirlpools of his Death Acupuncture Points, as they too whirled along.</p>
 <p>Both Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er did not know that when the four Saint Attributes gathered and fused together, the unique product from it was only one - Nature’s Fortune Stealing Heaven and Earth.</p>
 <p>The Nature’s Fortune Stealing Heaven and Earth was actually the key to breaking through the human limits that everyone faced, that was the Heavenly God Tier stage. Of course, the great improvement in cultivation speed that Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er enjoyed was just one of the benefits that the Nature’s Fortune Stealing Heaven and Earth granted.</p>
 <p>Currently, it was this Nature’s Fortune Stealing Heaven and Earth that was above all other forms of energy. The four Saint Attribute’s fusion energy forcefully suppressed the ebullient bloodline power.</p>
 <p>Tian’er’s desperate choice had been accurate. With Zhou Weiqing’s current situation, even if Long Shiya had been here, using his powerful Heavenly Energy to suppress his bloodline powers, even if he managed to save Zhou Weiqing, there would definitely be terrible side effects. Only the fusion of the four Saint Attributes, entering the Nature’s Fortune Stealing Heaven and Earth state… the critical key was the ‘Nature’s Fortune’ words. Facing the fusion energies that was above all, even the great mutated bloodline of the Dragon and Tigers had no choice but to submit.</p>
 <p>It could be said that Zhou Weiqing’s Dragon-Tiger Transformation was the strongest bloodline in the entire world today, but the four Saint Attributes’ fusion energies was the strongest attribute power in the world. The actual strength of both was difficult to actually compare, but the two energies were not actually clashing. Instead, the fusion Saint Attribute energies were guarding, protecting, restoring and repairing. Along with the fact that not all of the bloodline powers had been invoked out, and by chance it had definitely been a case of ‘applying the right medicine to the problem’. Zhou Weiqing’s body was steadily taking a turn for the better.</p>
