<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Duan Tianlang’s entire being seemed to have entered an unusual state. An intense silver light was constantly released from his body, channeling into Jade Tide. The Heavenly Energy ripples within the room became more intense as well.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing sensed it and slowly opened his eyes. Naturally, he would not disturb Duan Tianlang. He merely stood up quietly and observed from a distance. Duan Tianlang’s cultivation base might not be as high as his, but in the aspect of consolidating equipment, his abilities were far from Duan Tianlang’s. Zhou Weiqing could only become a God Tier Master because of his innate talent - he did not have to put in much effort. He needed to learn from Duan Tianlang, who was very experienced and skillful.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Jade Tide spun vigorously before Duan Tianlang. Gradually, the emerald green light that was emitted from Jade Tide merged with the Spatial Heavenly Energy, and transformed into a greenish silver light.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>What was even more strange were the changes around the rim of Jade Tide. The greenish silver light took on the shape of a funnel - its stem extended all the way down into Jade Tide. A tiny black hole, about the size of a fingernail, could vaguely be seen at the tip of the stem. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Duan Tianlang moved. Suddenly, his hands metamorphosed countless rays of solid-like light. However, despite the rapid speed, they were very stable.</p>
 <p>Rays of light continuously channeled from the greenish silver whirlpool within the Jade Tide into the black hole. Strangely enough, even though a majority of valuable materials were generally large in size, once they entered the whirlpool, they would immediately vanish without a trace.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Duan Tianlang’s speed was too fast. It was not only fast, there was also a rhythm to it. Due to the rapid speed, from a distance away, all that could be seen was colored light constantly falling gracefully into the Jade Tide from his illusion-like hands.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As more light rays entered the Jade Tide, the emerald green shade of the beautiful alms bowl became richer. The speed it was spinning at kept increasing as well, as it continuously engulfed the valuable materials.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s will had already spread to the outside of the room, forming a natural barrier - not only could it prevent outsiders from spying on them, it could also prevent the Heavenly Energy ripples and the aura of the valuable materials from escaping the room, during the process of creating the Consolidating Ink.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This was clearly necessary. Otherwise, it could easily attract the attention of Heavenly Beasts within a huge area. Naturally, Zhou Weiqing was not afraid of the threat of Heavenly Beasts, but it was better to prevent any forms of disturbances during his Senior Uncle’s ink-making process.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was currently a High Level Heavenly Emperor, almost reaching the Max Level Heavenly Emperor Stage. However, at this moment, the astonishment in his eyes continuously grew stronger.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>That was because he clearly noticed how terrifying the energy ripples, that were constantly rising within the Jade Tide, were. He was absolutely sure that if the Jade Tide were to detonate, it would completely obliterate the Heavenly Bow Empire, and that was considered the best case scenario. One could imagine just how strong the energy ripples within the Jade Tide were.</p>
 <p>Originally, when Duan Tianlang ordered Zhou Weiqing to retrieve the Sidhe Empress’ blood, &nbsp; he had assumed that the most important ingredient was the Sidhe Empress’ blood, and that the other materials needed were much less important in comparison. However, from the looks of it, he was wrong. The process of making the Consolidating Ink had only started, but the energy ripples within the alms bowl were already that intense, to the extent that a Max Level Heavenly Emperor like him was shocked. One could well imagine how terrifying the energy contained within the other valuable treasures was. Only the most valuable treasures could produce such intense energy ripples! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s judgment was impeccable - even though he did not know most of the valuable treasures that Duan Tianlang was using, the few that he recognized were sufficient for him to affirm his initial speculations. For instance, he had seen a fist-sized crystal clear Nucleus Core that was emitting a rich fiery red light earlier. When Duan Tianlang was tossing that Nucleus Core into the alms bowl, the fiery red halo in the surroundings was completely solidified, as though it was covered in a layer of solid halo. According to Zhou Weiqing’s judgment, it was the Nucleus Core of a Heavenly Beast in the Heavenly God Stage.</p>
 <p>If he were to absorb a Nucleus Core as such, he would be able to steadily reach the Max Level Heavenly God Stage! However, Duan Tianlang was only using it for a mere Consolidating Ink.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing had a sudden epiphany - the eleventh piece of a Legendary Set alone was worth more than the first ten pieces combined. Most of the valuable treasures that his Senior Uncle was using were not bought by the Heaven’s Expanse Palace; they were accumulated over the years by The Legacy of Strength lineage.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Subconsciously, Zhou Weiqing’s gaze fell upon Duan Tianlang, who had a determined and resolute look in his eyes. He focused his entire attention on the Jade Tide, and his entire being released some sort of invisible qi field, akin to a gigantic mountain keeping guard.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing pursed his lips slightly. His gaze had softened significantly. During the process, his pupils had constricted into pinpoints. He had resolved to put in his best effort to complete the Consolidating Equipment Scroll as if his life depended on it, regardless of how great the obstacles might be. That was the only way he could make his Senior Uncle’s painstaking efforts worthwhile, and fulfill his Senior Uncle’s greatest wish.</p>
 <p>The emerald green light that was released from the Jade Tide made it look as though it was a small dazzling emerald green sun. It was also releasing an extremely strong fragrance, that was filled with life aura, as well as the energy ripples of all the attributes that Zhou Weiqing knew of. Furthermore, every single one of them was extremely pure.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing could easily purify a single attribute, However, it was impossible for him to purify them as a whole. He was able to assimilate all the attributes via Saint Energy, but it was impossible to break apart every single attribute and purify them separately.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was unable to do it, and clearly, Duan Tianlang was unable to do it as well. However, it was only made possible because of the Jade Tide, which was worthy to be deemed as a magical treasure by Consolidating Equipment Masters. This was also the reason why Duan Tianlang was confident in completing the creation of the Consolidating Ink as long as all the materials were gathered. Even the three great God Tier Masters of Heavenly Jewel Island’s Heaven’s Expanse Palace did not possess treasures of that quality. It would require the three of them to work together just to create a Consolidating Ink of that level. Even so, they might not necessarily succeed on the first attempt.</p>
 <p>If not for the protection of Zhou Weiqing’s will, Heavenly Jewel Masters with a high cultivation base within a dozen mile radius would have detected the strong energy ripples, particularly the dense aura of the valuable treasures, that would induce envy in anyone.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Time went by. Duan Tianlang’s expression gradually became more grave. When the speed at which the Jade Tide was spinning at had reached its limit, it lowered abruptly, as though it became heavier. Black fine cracks kept appearing in the air surrounding the Jade Tide - space was being torn apart.</p>
 <p>Clearly, the energy within the Jade Tide was too massive, to the point where it seemed too much for the Jade Tide to bear. Beads of sweat began trickling down Duan Tianlang’s forehead; his clothes were fully drenched in his sweat. The Spatial Attribute Heavenly Energy that erupted from his body kept getting stronger and stronger, but his hands were getting slower.</p>
 <p>It was the first time in his life carrying out such a process to create the Consolidating Ink. Even though he had done several simulations and had thought of several different situations that could possibly happen, he was still having a hard time due to the enormous pressure upon starting the actual process.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I cannot fail, I definitely cannot fail. There is only one batch of materials, and if I fail, nobody knows how long it’ll take before I am able to start my second attempt.</em> Furthermore, Duan Tianlang was positive that he only had one chance. Even though the Saint Energy that Zhou Weiqing channeled into his body was sufficient to save his life, his energy was limited - he had exhausted most of it over several years of creating Consolidating Inks, to the point where he almost died. If he were to fail this time, he had absolutely no courage to attempt it again. Admittedly, it was possible for him to guide Zhou Weiqing through the process, but that would mean that he would not be the one to personally make it!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Duan Tianlang seemed to toss in a treasure into the Jade Tide every few minutes, with each interval longer than the previous one. Every time he tossed a new ingredient in, the Jade Tide seemed to become heavier and heavier, as it sunk from its original position in mid-air. Upon seeing that, Zhou Weiqing broke into cold sweat.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this time, Zhou Weiqing did not dare to intervene at all - he did not even dare to channel any Saint Energy into Duan Tianlang’s body. Duan Tianlang was like a taut bowstring; if he were to be disturbed a little, it might cause him to snap.</p>
 <p>Finally, Duan Tianlang extended both his hands and two golden fruits landed into Jade Tide.</p>
 <p>After a dull hum was heard, the Jade Tide stopped spinning and abruptly descended to the ground.</p>
 <p>Duan Tianlang shouted, “Arise!” His right foot suddenly stomped on the ground and terrifying Heavenly Energy erupted in an instant. A silverish white light channeled straight into the Jade Tide without any reservation, causing it to stop an inch before hitting the ground.</p>
 <p>However, at this moment, unstable energy ripples erupted above the Jade Tide that had stopped spinning. The emerald green light flickered and a few fine cracks started appearing at the top, looking as though it was about to shatter. A circle of black light appeared in the surroundings of the Jade Tide, making it seem like it was about to break the space open and escape.</p>
