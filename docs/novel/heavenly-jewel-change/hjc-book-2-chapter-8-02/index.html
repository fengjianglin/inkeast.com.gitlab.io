 <p><strong>Chapter 8 Profound Secrets of the Immortal Deity Technique (2)</strong></p>
 <p>However, at the same time, Zhou Weiqing could clearly feel that his emotions were being changed, as his Heavenly Energy cycled, he could feel a rising feeling of fierce bloodlust.</p>
 <p><em>What was going on?</em> Obviously, it was not from Heavenly Energy, as Shangguan Bing’er had not mentioned it when she was explaining things to him just now.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, inspiration struck, and Zhou Weiqing remembered the huge black tiger from that night – wasn’t that fierce bloodlust the same aura that the tiger gave out in his memory? Even the cold feeling from that night has also appeared. Luckily, these unique auras did not seem to be hurting him, in fact when they appeared it seemed like his Heavenly Energy started moving faster.</p>
 <p>Finally, the two streams of Heavenly energy reached the Clavicle Acupuncture Point, unavoidably touching the energy whirlpool which had formed there.</p>
 <p>As the two streams of Heavenly Energy both touched the respective whirlpools at the Clavicle Acupuncture Point, they suddenly accelerated, rushing down Zhou Weiqing’s arms, and giving him a fright. The next moment, the twin streams had reached the Taiyuan Acupuncture Points in his wrists, and flared up there, melding together with his respective Jewels.</p>
 <p>A sense of complete harmony descended on Zhou Weiqing’s mind, and he felt like his Heavenly Jewels were part of his body. With a single thought, the Jewels entered his body through the Taiyuan Acupuncture Point, settling firmly in his meridians. He could still sense the presence of the Jewels, but they did not have a substantial feel.</p>
 <p><em>I succeeded just like that? It seems like it was not as difficult as I had expected.</em> Zhou Weiqing was delighted to have succeeded in Receiving his Heavenly Jewels on the first try. Actually, how was he to know that the real reason why it seemed so easy for him was because he had already broken through to the Taiyuan Acupuncture Points on his wrists, which was extremely good for Receiving and Releasing Heavenly Jewels. Otherwise, how else would such a cultivating newbie like him succeed so easily! This point was also something that Shangguan Bing’er had not expected, and it was also just the tip of the iceberg for the benefits that the Immortal Deity Technique would grant him.</p>
 <p>With a thought, manipulating the link between his Heavenly Energy and Taiyuan Acupuncture Point, the 2 Heavenly Jewels sprang out of his wrists. Another thought caused them to be kep within again, the whole process seemed so easy.</p>
 <p>If Shangguan Bing’er knew about the process of his training, she would definitely be shocked. She was already considered a genius, but it had taken her half a month before she could Receive and Release her Heavenly Jewels so easily, while Zhou Weiqing had managed that feat in just a single try.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was very curious about his own Heavenly Jewels, and since his training target for the day had already been met, he decided to investigate the exact benefits that his two Heavenly Jewels brought to him. Not even mentioning the fact that he was only 13 years old, even a steady, mature adult would also be hasty to find out what his Heavenly Jewels could do if they just Awakened.</p>
 <p>He chose to examine his Icy Jade Physical Jewel first, after all his Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Elemental Jewel had been praised so much by Shangguan Bing’er that he was rather nervous about it.</p>
 <p>Earlier on, when he was trying to control the Receiving and Releasing of his Heavenly Jewels, Zhou Weiqing had used his Heavenly Energy to wrap around the Jewels, letting them meld with his Energy and they were easily moved through his Taiyuan Acupuncture Point. At this point, he carefully used his Heavenly Energy to enter his Physical Jewel.</p>
 <p>In the instance that his Heavenly Energy entered his Physical Jewel, Zhou Weiqing’s whole body shuddered, as a jet of pure, incomparable strength seemed to originate from his right hand to encompass his whole body; his muscles, bones, meridians, all seemed to be filled with that same strong feeling. He felt as though he could easily lift a large bull if it were standing in front of him.</p>
 <p>After his Heavenly Jewels had Awakened, although Zhou Weiqing had felt that his body had gone through much change and improvement, but it was definitely far from the obvious feeling he had now. Previously, it had only been a slight improvement in strength and agility, with his body feeling lighter. However, at this moment, the sheer explosive strength that coursed through him felt so real and unparalleled. He just felt like unleashing the explosive power within him.</p>
 <p>However, at the same time, Zhou Weiqing also found that while this burst of strength was active, the Heavenly Energy within his body was slowly being consumed. Even though the rate of consumption was not fast, but it was a constant outflow. By now, he had already broken through 4 Death Acupuncture Points, Clavicle, Taiyuan, ZhuSanLi, SanYinJiao, whose energy whirlpools had increased their absorption rate when his Heavenly Energy had entered his physical Jewel, an increase even greater than when he focused his attentions on the whirlpool alone. However, though the absorption rate was fast, but it still wasn’t enough to offset the consumption of Heavenly Energy, but could only slow down the draining rate.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing did not think much of this, and thought it was normal. However, if Shangguan Bing’er knew about this, her jaw would definitely drop in shock. No matter Physical, Elemental or Heavenly Jewel Masters, whenever they made use of their Jewels, they needed to sustain the usage with Heavenly Energy, and that Energy had to be accumulated through cultivation. Although some advanced cultivation techniques were able to slowly recover Heavenly Energy even while not cultivating, but it was definitely unlike Zhou Weiqing who could still absorb the Heavenly Energy even when he was using his Jewels!</p>
 <p>This was another secret of the Immortal Deity Technique, after all, by risking one’s life to breakthrough the Death Acupuncture Points, after going through so much danger how could there not be any advantages? The creator of the Immortal Deity Technique had accidently broken through one Death Acupuncture Point and discovered all the various amazing powers, which was why he continued developing the technique and couldn’t resist recording it down, despite its danger.</p>
 <p>One could imagine, as the amount of Death Acupuncture Points broken through increased, the strength of the Immortal Deity Technique would grow exponentially as the automatic absorption rate of Heavenly Energy while using the Heavenly Jewels would be even faster, thus allowing Zhou Weiqing to have greater sustainability during fights than any other Heavenly Jewel Master. Of course, that is on the premise that he can survive breaking through more Death Acupuncture Points.</p>
 <p>Withdrawing the Heavenly Energy from the Physical Jewel, the feeling of great strength also vanished, and the sudden loss made Zhou Weiqing lick his lips involuntarily – that feeling of great strength was just so addictive, unfortunately it required the continued consumption of Heavenly Energy.</p>
 <p>After his successful trial of his Physical Jewel, Zhou Weiqing grew in confidence and picked up the nerve to focus his Heavenly Energy to carefully enter his Alexandrite Cat’s Eye Jewel.</p>
 <p>This time, Zhou Weiqing was even more careful and meticulous, moving his Heavenly Energy slowly into the Alexandrite Cat’s Eye. Just as his energy entered it, a curious phenomenon appeared.</p>
