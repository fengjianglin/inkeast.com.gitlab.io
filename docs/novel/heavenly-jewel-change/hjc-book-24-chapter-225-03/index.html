 <p><b>Chapter 225 Breakthrough! Saint Energy entering Death Acupuncture Point! (3)</b></p>
 <p>Naturally, Zhan LingTian was not afraid of Zhou Weiqing as well. He had waited for this day for such a long time. He hated Zhou Weiqing, hated him for stealing the heart of Xue’er from him. Not long ago, when Shangguan Xue’er had returned to the Heavenly Jewel Island, Zhan LingTian had realised something had gone wrong. That was because Shangguan Xue’er’s face had such a gentle expression. Furthermore, when she spoke with Fei’er about something, her face actually showed the youthful embarrassment of a young girl. Without question, that was not because of him.</p>
 <p>Zhan LingTian was an extremely intelligent man, being one of the top geniuses in the entire younger generation, otherwise he would not have such high status in the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. His associative imagination was definitely not weak at all, and after some devious roundabout questioning and tentative veiled references, he realised a shocking news. Zhou Weiqing, it was that Zhou Weiqing once more. He actually had such an unclear relationship with Fei’er and Xue’er as well! From that moment onwards, the fury and hate in Zhan LingTian’s heart burned bright.</p>
 <p>A few days ago, when Zhou Weiqing had ascended the Heavenly Jewel Island, he had already wanted to cause trouble for him. Alas, due to Shangguan Tianyue’s sudden appearance, he had not succeeded. However, today he had calculated that Zhou Weiqing would definitely be coming to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, and he had long since been waiting here. He wanted to defeat Zhou Weiqing, to prove that he was the stronger one, more worthy one. He was not reconciled at all!</p>
 <p>From a young age, he had always liked Shangguan Xue’er, and though the Shangguan Sisters had exact same features, the only one in Zhan LingTian’s heart was Xue’er. All these years, he had been training so hard, fighting with all of his might to gain a higher status in the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. A big half of that reason was because of Shangguan Xue’er. Now, seeing the love of his life being stolen right in front of his eyes by someone else, how could he not be enraged?</p>
 <p>What so great about Zhou Weiqing… with his looks, how could he match Xue’er! Furthermore, he already had the love of Lady Bing’er!</p>
 <p>Towards Zhou Weiqing’s playboy ways, Zhan LingTian was extremely dissatisfied. As such, now that they were here today, he had made preparations to totally defeat Zhou Weiqing, letting him not have the face to stay on the Heavenly Jewel Island.</p>
 <p>Both men, filled with fiery passion and fighting for their love… clashing in that instant with dazzling fireworks.</p>
 <p>Zhan LingTian’s reactions were extremely fast; facing Zhou Weiqing’s charge, the Light-Dark Divine Spear piercing forward, totally ignoring Zhou Weiqing’s Dual Legendary Hammers as he made use of the length of the spear to aim directly at Zhou Weiqing’s throat. A thick Light Attribute and Darkness attribute energy exploded out, the two opposing Attributes causing a violent shockwave, the terrifying energy fluctuations bursting forth from the Light-Dark Divine Spear instantly, a concussive wave that spread out towards the Dual Legendary Hammers.</p>
 <p>Eight Jewels. Indeed, Zhan LingTian’s cultivation level had reached the eight-Jeweled stage. When he released the Light-Dark Divine Spear, his Heavenly Jewels had already told Zhou Weiqing his cultivation level.</p>
 <p>However, Zhou Weiqing did not change styles, instead using the Blink Still instantly. His Dual Hammers had already been smashing downwards, but with the aid of the Blink Skill, his body appeared abruptly right in front of Zhan LingTian.</p>
 <p>The Light-Dark Divine Spear swept to the side, and without warning Zhan LingTian’s body also moved to the side by three chi. Somehow, the Light-Dark Divine Spear was being used like a whip, slamming savagely into Zhou Weiqing’s hammers.</p>
 <p>A massive explosion, one so violent that almost the entire Heavenly Jewel Island could hear and even feel. The opposing forces and terrifying energy held within the Light-Dark Divine Spear exploded without any holding back. At the same time, Zhou Weiqing’s Dual Legendary Hammers had been struck with all his strength behind it, also an equally terrifying power indeed.</p>
 <p>In the violent explosion, Zhan LingTian’s body staggered back a few steps. Of course, Zhou Weiqing did not fare much better, the Dual Legendary Hammers surrounded with gold and black light as he staggered back three steps as well, and he was forced to channel his Heavenly Energy to dispel the terrifying mix of Light and Darkness energies.</p>
 <p>In terms of just pure destructive power, the Light and Darkness fusion held an inherent explosive capability that was actually above any single Saint Attribute. That was Zhan LingTian’s strongest point. All his years of focusing on this area had allowed him to enter combat with these two attributes so easily, manipulating them at his beck and call. With the two terrifying energies merged together, it was more than enough to tear through any defenses of equal level.</p>
 <p>Alas, today he was facing Zhou Weiqing. Although Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation level was still no match for Zhan LingTian, in terms of pure strength, even two Zhan LingTians would be no match for him. With the five ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set pieces, his strength was already at a horrifying level. With his Heavenly Energy on top of that, even a Heavenly King Stage powerhouse would not dare to let him strike out at will so easily.</p>
 <p>As such, Zhan LingTian was also forced back in their clash. Similarly, Zhou Weiqing had been affected by the opposing energies of his Light-Dark Divine Spear… that was a pure union of Heavenly Energy and power of one’s attributes. However, even though the Light and Darkness Attribute’s Heavenly Energy reverberations were so tyrannical, when they met with the Saint Energy in Zhou Weiqing’s body, they vanished like snow in springtime.</p>
 <p>Zhan LingTian’s Light and Darkness Fusion Attribute was definitely extremely power, however in terms of power and the stage it was at, it was still far from the pure Destruction Attribute that the Blood Red Hell had used. Even the Destruction Attribute had fallen to the Saint Energy, let alone Zhan LingTian’s attack.</p>
 <p>Despite that, it was clear that Zhou Weiqing’s fighting capabilities were still greatly affected by it; at least not allowing him to swing a follow up attack quickly.</p>
 <p>Zhan LingTian staggered back in a cross step, feeling an aching and tingling sensation in his arms. Though his emotions were in great agitation, it did not stop his heart from gripping in shock from that exchange of blows. This Zhou Weiqing’s strength had already reached such a point? The pure strength he had was actually able to disregard the sheer gap between their power levels… This fight was not going to be easy at all.</p>
 <p>However, Zhan LingTian had never planned to underestimate Zhou Weiqing, having known him for a time. In fact, he even felt that in terms of Stored Skills, he was definitely no match for Zhou Weiqing. After all, Zhou Weiqing had six Attributes, with even two Saint Attributes. If he tried to compare Skills with him, he would definitely be at a disadvantaged position.</p>
 <p>As a result, even though his arms weren’t in top condition, Zhan LingTian still launched a follow up attack as soon as he could, his left leg stomping on the floor savagely as he soared into the air, the Light-Dark Divine Spear bursting into millions of gold and black threads of light, enveloping Zhou Weiqing’s body.</p>
 <p><i>Since your strength is so startling, then I will use pure combat skills to defeat you!</i></p>
 <p>Do not even think of underestimating these gold and black lights, each and every one of them held the fusion attribute of Light and Darkness. As long as they could pierce into their enemy, or met any obstruction, the protective layer around that energy would disappear, resulting in an explosion.</p>
 <p>Facing Zhan LingTian’s swift attack, Zhou Weiqing stood there, an icy cold look on his face. In that instant, the wings behind his back abruptly sprang wide open. On his Dual Legendary Hammers, bluish purple light burst out abruptly, the ‘Flying Lightning God Technique’ coming into play at once.</p>
 <p>It was clear that Zhou Weiqing’s ‘Flying Lightning God Technique’ was no match for Zhan LingTian’s Light-Dark Divine Spear. However, all Zhou Weiqing wanted was to stall him for a moment.</p>
 <p>When he had been knocked back from the clash earlier, Zhou Weiqing had not remained idle, instantly releasing the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation. It was only with the support of the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation could he maintain such a high level of combat and expenditure of Heavenly Energy without too much problems. This was even more so since they were on the Heavenly Jewel Island, as the concentration of Heavenly Energy in the atmosphere was just so high, allowing the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation to work to its maximum effect.</p>
 <p>In the skies, a patch of crackling lightning that burst out like a angry roar. As countless lightning bolts crashed and exploded in air, dissipating. At this moment, a thick grey light sprang forth around Zhou Weiqing, warping into a strange layer of grey crystalline shield of light. He was actually attempting to purely defend against the Light-Dark Divine Spear that had just broken through his ‘Flying Lightning God Technique’.</p>
 <p><i>Looking for death! </i>That was the only thought in Zhan LingTian’s mind. A six-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master was trying to block his Light-Dark Divine Spear’s Thousand Light Strikes with just a defensive skill? That was preposterous! After all, his Light-Dark Divine Spear was exactly specialised in piercing through defenses.</p>
 <p>However, that was just Zhan LingTian’s thoughts. Naturally, Zhou Weiqing had his own plans as well. As soon as he saw the light from Zhan LingTian’s spear about to land on him, the Dual Legendary Hammers swinging out as he totally ignored the incoming attack from Zhan LingTian. It seemed like he was going on an attack that would burn stone and jade alike [1. Direct translation, basically means killing an opponent in a suicidal type attack], directly striking at Zhan LingTian as well.</p>
 <p>By this point, it was already too late for Zhan LingTian to change his attacks. If that happened, he would lose his first strike advantage. Furthermore, he had already struck out with his full might, and if he tried to change attack now, he would have to suffer the backlash of changing and sustain an injury. As a result, he could only grit his teeth and push his offense to the greatest. To Zhan LingTian, as long as his attack could land on Zhou Weiqing and injure him, then it would also automatically ward off his attacks. Furthermore, the length of the Light-Dark Divine Spear was beyond the Dual Legendary Hammers.</p>
 <p>However, as the bouts of black and gold light began to land on the grey shield, Zhan LingTian’s expression changed.</p>
 <p>Bursts of energy and strange light began to spark upon the grey shield upon contact, but the Thousand Light Strikes which had already been weakened by the ‘Flying Lightning God Technique’ actually only caused the grey shield to ripple constantly upon impact, but did not seem to be able to break through.</p>
 <p><i>How was this possible?! What kind of powerful defense was that?! </i>Zhan LingTian’s heart was filled with shock. However, at this point he no longer had any other choice. Biting down hard, the thousands sparks of light suddenly gathered together, forming a single point as if warping into an extension of the Light-Dark Divine Spear, piercing forward as one.</p>
 <p>*Puuu* A soft sound, followed by a series of violent explosions in the air.</p>
 <p>The Ward of the Demon God had a truly startling defensive capabilities, but Zhan LingTian was no pushover. At last, with the merger of all the remaining Thousand Light Strikes and sheer power behind it, he had finally managed to break through the Ward of the Demon God, piercing towards Zhou Weiqing’s chest.</p>
 <p>“No!” Right at that moment, three female voices rang out at once. Both Zhan LingTian and Zhou Weiqing felt their hearts grip just as they were about to take action.</p>
 <p>However, by this time, neither of the two fighters could stop themselves.</p>
 <p>With the soft *Puuu* sound, Zhou Weiqing was pierced right through. However, it wasn’t his body, but his wings. At the last possible second, his wings had wrapped around himself, blocking in front of his body, forcefully blocking the Light-Dark Divine Spear. The actual spear had been blocked, but the energy held within the spear still managed to pierce through.</p>
 <p>A layer of black and gold light burst forth from Zhou Weiqing’s chest, traveling around his entire body. At the same time, Zhou Weiqing grunted in pain at the impact.</p>
