I am not being rash, but I will not give these fellows any chances. I will not allow my family to be hurt. The rest, please, I will depend on you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Shiya looked at Zhou Weiqing’s tall and stalwart back, and he sighed inwardly. This child, he is no longer the young man that had just become his disciple those years ago! The playful exterior he usually had on could no longer hide the steady, profound and overpowering nature he had. Of course, this was a good thing for him. He had already grown up. It looked like after this matter, he will no longer need my protection. From today onwards, in the Heavenly Jewel Master, there will definitely be a place for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Alright then, you be careful.” Long Shiya did not try to persuade him further. This was a battlefield, and he chose to place absolute trust in him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed. Absolute trust. This was the best recognition and approval he could give to Zhou Weiqing’s power.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The terrifying energy reverberations burst forth from Zhou Weiqing instantly, such a terrifying explosiveness that caused the entire area to turn grey.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ming Gui was given a shock. “Is that little brat actually trying to face the four of us by himself?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the other side, Long Shiya’s six-coloured lights spread forth again; this time they enveloped the entire palace hall. Without question, the master disciple pair had chosen to divide up the work. Long Shiya would ensure the Fate Denying Seal was not disturbed or broken, and the four Blood Red Hell powerhouses would be the targets of Zhou Weiqing’s attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing raised his Dual Legendary Hammers in hands, both glowing with various different coloured lights. The left hammer was glowing black, while the right was a purplish red. In the next instant, two giant figures appeared at each side of him as he waved his hammers. It was the Hell’s Angel and the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Demonic Dragon Lady.</span></p>

Heavenly Skill Image? But… how could one summon two Heavenly Skill Images at once… and they looked so real too?</span></p>

The Hell’s Angel and the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Demonic Dragon Lady were both summoned by Zhou Weiqing, and the order he gave them was simple: Attack. Balls of dark purple light were sent flying towards all the Blood Red Hell powerhouses. At the same time, the Demonic Dragon Lady began flashing with purplish red light</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">, sending Dragon Silencing Seals shooting forth one after the other. From appearance, she was just like that Terror Sea Dragon, her body full of spikes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This attacking style of the Demonic Dragon Lady was indeed what Zhou Weiqing had learned in his fight against the Terror Sea Dragon. Of course, he did not have the Water Attribute, and was unable to Store Skills from the Terror Sea Dragon. However, he was still able to learn from its attacking styles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This type of attacking style was undoubtedly extremely energy consuming. However, do not forget, he had just Devoured three Heavenly Kings dry of all their Heavenly Energy. Furthermore, the current Zhou Weiqing, would he actually be afraid of expending too much energy?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three Blood Red Hell Heavenly Kings instantly raised their defense, as Heavenly Skill Images also lit up around them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon Silencing Seal was an absolute-effect type Skill, but the precondition was that it actually had to hit its target. The three Blood Red Hell Heavenly Kings were by no means weak, and they had their own powerful Skills as well, especially with the Destruction Attribute. Facing the abrupt explosive attacks from Zhou Weiqing, they naturally blocked it in an instant. After all, the Hell’s Angel and the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Demonic Dragon Lady were just summonings, not true existences.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that moment, Meng Gui melded into the darkness. In truth, no one knew that Meng Gui was the real top assassin in the world. However, he had attained that rank fifty years ago, and after reaching the Heavenly Emperor stage, he had retired from the assassin world. However, his current level was naturally far more dangerous than he had been then.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Gui did not have the Spatial Attribute, nor did he have any Skills like the Blink Skill. However, hidden in the darkness, his ability to conceal his aura was no weaker than Zhou Weiqing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In midair, Zhou Weiqing suddenly took a step to the left. As his body flickered, the pitch black devil claw spike swiped across the space he had just been. Where it passed, the air was split apart instantly. If Zhou Weiqing had still been there, even with his Legendary Set and the protection of the Immortal Deity Shield, he might still have sustained a severe injury.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As his body moved, the ‘crying-face’ hammer in his hand did not hesitate to smash outwards at Meng Gui’s hands.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Gui did not dodge at all. His fingers spread wide, and the devil claw spike actually twisted around to grab towards the incoming hammer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Gui was after all a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, and any Heavenly Emperor would have absolute confidence in themselves. When Zhou Weiqing said he would deal with the Blood Red Hell powerhouses by himself, he had almost blown his top. What did this little brat treat him as?! No matter how talented and outstanding he was, he was still just a mere Heavenly King. Yet, he dared to brag about taking down all four of them?!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, the two summons of the Hell’s Angel and the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Demonic Dragon Lady by Zhou Weiqing had given him a shock, but that did not mean Meng Gui would feel Zhou Weiqing was stronger than him. As such, he did not even bother dodging, wanting to use his own Skills in a hard direct clash to defeat Zhou Weiqing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Gui’s Consolidated Equipment were all pitch black, barely entering the realm of the ‘Legendary Set’. This was an eight-piece set, amongst which two were the devil claw spikes in each hand respectively. He had always been an offense orientated Heavenly Jewel Master.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A earsplitting explosion, as the devil claw spike clashed with the ‘crying-face’ hammer. In the next instant, a look of utter disbelief crossed Meng Gui’s face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His body curled up into a ball, flying back at lightning speed as if he had become a large black cannonball. He had actually been sent flying back by the impact of Zhou Weiqing’s hammer!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was Zhou Weiqing wielding… the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Legendary Dual God Strength Hammers! As his ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set had already reached nine pieces, what kind of boost to his strength did that give? His physical strength had already reached a truly terrifying state. Let alone Meng Gui, even Long Shiya with his full ‘Hate Sky no Handle’ Legendary Set… in terms of just pure physical strength, he might not be comparable to Zhou Weiqing. Even an ordinary Heavenly God powerhouse, perhaps if he was clashing directly in terms of strength with Zhou Weiqing, he might be disadvantaged!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This time, Meng Gui had definitely taken a huge disadvantage. Furthermore, on the crying-face hammer of Zhou Weiqing’s, there was an extremely powerful suction ‘Devour’ power. In just the short moment where they had clashed, it had already drained a substantial mass of energy from Meng Gui.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Meng Gui gritted his teeth against the violent pain, forcing himself not to cry out. When he realised he had lost the clash, he changed strike to a push, using Zhou Weiqing’s power to fly back as best he could, trying to shift as much of the power from landing on his own body. However, Zhou Weiqing’s strength was just too terrifying, at least several hundred thousand jin in power. That hammer blow, no matter how high Meng Gui’s cultivation was, even if he used the Darkness Attribute energies in the atmosphere to protect himself, he was still at a massive disadvantage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The right devil claw spike had actually been shattered, along with his right arm. That was the price Meng Gui had to pay to prevent the power from smashing his body. His entire right arm was vaporized into a blood mist explosively before he managed to shunt away the rest of the power from Zhou Weiqing’s strike.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing’s full power, could it be as simple as just the surface Heavenly King stage he showed?&nbsp;</span></p>

The dual hammers in his hands swung around, and a massive grey figure slowly appeared behind his back.&nbsp;</span></p>

Although the three Blood Red Hell Heavenly Kings their own powerful defenses, in that instant, none of them could escape the fate of being struck by the Dragon Silencing Seal.&nbsp;</span></p>
