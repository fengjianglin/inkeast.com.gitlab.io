<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>“Eh?” &nbsp;Shangguan Tianyue had a stunned look in his eyes. &nbsp;He quickly sensed his entire body turning slow and sluggish.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s left hand suddenly struck out as well. &nbsp;The air behind him was broken apart, with silver light flashing and then disappearing. &nbsp;Boom! The extremely dense longspear of ice transformed into countless specks of light, then disappeared. &nbsp;This was what happened when Saint Energy was used to activate the upgraded version of Spatial Rend, Spatial Collapse.</p>
 <p>As for that feline Heavenly Beast, it was the evolved version of the control technique, ‘Absolute Delay’!</p>
 <p>When Zhou Weiqing released Skills, he no longer emanated particularly powerful auras from his body. &nbsp;He looked just like an ordinary person waving his hand, but the process didn’t slow down in the slightest.</p>
 <p>After sweeping out with his arms, he didn’t retract them. &nbsp;Instead, he took advantage of the brief moment where Shangguan Tianyue was affected by the Absolute Delay to rapidly point with both hands, his fingers stabbing out like butterflies drifting through flowers. &nbsp;Over on Shangguan Tianyue’s side, a series of azure lightning bolts began to light up. Twelve consecutive Fetters of Wind landed upon him!</p>
 <p>What sort of casting speed was this?! &nbsp;Although this looked like the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation which Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya had developed based on the Six Ultimate Heavenly Dao Formation, in reality Zhou Weiqing was relying on his Saint Energy. &nbsp;The way in which he used these techniques was completely different from how Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya used them.</p>
 <p>Simply put, the same Fetters of Wind technique was now at least four times more powerful in Zhou Weiqing’s hands than those of an equivalent-level Heavenly Jewel Master. &nbsp;This was a 7 Star rated technique which when used by him had the effect of a 10 Star technique. When these twelve Fetters of Wind fell upon Shangguan Tianyue, it wasn’t easy for him to break free even though he was a Heavenly Emperor.</p>
 <p>Although it was impossible for him to summon atmospheric energies from the outside world here, the local atmospheric energies were still quite dense. &nbsp;Zhou Weiqing didn’t pause after unleashing twelve Fetters of Wind. He flipped over his palms, then placed them facing each other. The spectators could all see the blue-violet light shining between his palms. &nbsp;In the next instant, an enormous lightning dragon burst forth from his palms and shot straight at Shangguan Tianyue.</p>
 <p>The lightning moved incredibly fast. &nbsp;Even though it was now in the shape of a great dragon, it didn’t lose this intrinsic property.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyue had been caught off-guard and thrown off-balance by the Absolute Delay and the Fetters of Wind. &nbsp;Before he had managed to completely break free, Zhou Weiqing’s lightning dragon had arrived.</p>
 <p>At this moment, he put his power as a Heavenly Emperor on full display. &nbsp;Although he had yet to fully extricate himself from the Fetters of Wind, his eyes flashed and a translucent, crystalline shield of ice appeared before him. &nbsp;This ice shield was three meters in diameter, and it securely covered his entire body. Just because he couldn’t move didn’t mean he couldn’t cast Skills.</p>
 <p>However, Zhou Weiqing’s control over his lightning dragon technique wasn’t that simple either. &nbsp;Right as the great lightning dragon was about to collide against the ice shield, it suddenly twisted aside to dodge the shield and still blasted against Shangguan Tianyue.</p>
 <p>An enormous explosion rang out. &nbsp;A layer of blue-violet light appeared across Shangguan Tianyue’s entire body. &nbsp;He had finally managed to break free from the Fetters of the Wind, but now a powerful numbing sensation pervaded his entire body.</p>
 <p>This lightning dragon technique was something Zhou Weiqing had created after simulating and testing out multiple variations of Lightning Suffering. &nbsp;Not even Long Shiya, who had the Lightning Attribute, would be able to do this because he wasn’t strengthened by Saint Energy!</p>
 <p>Black light suddenly descended upon the area. &nbsp;This black light had actually come from beneath Shangguan Tianyue’s feet, and it manifested itself in the form of a six-cornered black star.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyue, as a Heavenly Emperor, had an incredibly tough body. &nbsp;Although Zhou Weiqing had landed the attack, it didn’t actually injure him. &nbsp;However, this black light was simply too fast. He hadn’t had a chance to break free from the numbness. &nbsp;A black-red light suddenly flashed about his head, coming together to form a strange glyph.</p>
 <p>This was the Curse of Doom. &nbsp;Of course, it had also been strengthened.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing didn’t even pause as he used these techniques. &nbsp;It can be said that they all came out one after the other, and each of them was tremendously powerful.</p>
 <p>After the Curse of Doom, his movements slowed down for just a brief moment as he pressed his hands together across his chest, then pushed them outwards in an arc while unleashing a dense blast of silver light. &nbsp;By the time his hands were completely unfolded, a Silver Emperor suddenly flew out. It instantly accelerated through the skies, piercing forward at lightning speed. Next, a Silver Emperor Wing Slash fused with the Spatial Rend to produce the Fusion Skill, Silver Emperor Spatial Rend. &nbsp;It almost instantly charged over to Shangguan Tianyue.</p>
 <p>The joss stick had only burned down a tiny amount thus far, but during that brief period of time Zhan Lingtian’s back had already been drenched by sweat. &nbsp;Aside from awe, he was unable to feel any other emotions. No matter what, he never would’ve imagined that Zhou Weiqing would reach such a level that he could actually suppress Shangguan Tianyue. &nbsp;He wasn’t a weakling, and he was very familiar with the two Palace Masters. He could tell that aside from not using the Legendary Set, Shangguan Tianyue wasn’t holding back at all. And yet, he was still being suppressed by Zhou Weiqing!</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyang, who stood next to Zhan Lingtian, hadn’t revealed a smile after his first one had vanished. &nbsp;His understanding of the battle was naturally much deeper than Zhan Lingtian’s. These techniques Zhou Weiqing were using… although they were his, they were completely reliant upon being cast through the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation. &nbsp;In other words, these were all simulated techniques but just as strong as the real ones.</p>
 <p>A dazzling streak of golden light suddenly burst forth from Shangguan Tianyue’s body. &nbsp;The light appeared around his chest, causing him to be filled with a godlike aura. It actually managed to instantly dispel the numbing effect as well as the Curse of Doom. &nbsp;His eyes flashed with divine light as he spat out a streak of golden light which transformed into a golden knife that clashed head-on against the Silver Emperor.</p>
 <p>An enormous explosion rang out, resulting in the Silver Emperor falling backwards while Shangguan Tianyue’s shoulders trembled slightly. &nbsp;He had been at a disadvantage and had just barely managed to unleash that Skills, and so he didn’t manage to actually destroy the Silver Emperor.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing didn’t let up with his attacks at all. &nbsp;After the Silver Emperor flew out, his hands and his back actually began to glow with two completely types of light.</p>
 <p>The light coming from his back was purple-red, while his two hands were glowing dark-purple. &nbsp;As these two streaks of light were formed and flew out, his movements finally paused for a moment. &nbsp;However, his technique was completed just as Shangguan Tianyue beat back the Silver Emperor.</p>
 <p>Six wings flapped violently as the Hell’s Angel soared into the skies. &nbsp;This was what had been materialized from the dark-purple light, and as emerged it came to hover five meters in front of Zhou Weiqing. &nbsp;Countless globes of dark-violet light burst from it, smashing towards Shangguan Tianyue as the Silver Emperor attacked a second time from the side.</p>
 <p>Just at this moment, a human figure with a serpent’s tail and a devilish face suddenly flew out from Zhou Weiqing’s back. &nbsp;A beam of violet-red light shot out from its eyes and burst towards Shangguan Tianyue.</p>
 <p>This had all happened in mere seconds. &nbsp;Zhou Weiqing had actually successfully revived the Silver Emperor, Hell’s Angel, and the Demonic Dragon Lady. &nbsp;These three powerful creatures simultaneously launched attacks at Shangguan Tianyue.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s attacks finally came to a temporary pause after he completed these three revivals. &nbsp;Reviving the Hell’s Angel and the Silver Emperor was easy, as both were at the Heavenly King stage. &nbsp;Given his cultivation, he could complete their revivals with ease. The Demonic Dragon Lady, however, was a Heavenly Beast who was a Max Level Heavenly Emperor. &nbsp;Reviving it had been quite taxing for Zhou Weiqing. Even the Astral Saint Core Nucleus in his chest dimmed slightly.</p>
 <p>However, this actually showed how powerful Zhou Weiqing was. &nbsp;Although the Astral Saint Core Nucleus in his chest had dimmed slightly, the golden aura around his body had grown markedly stronger. &nbsp;All types of atmospheric energies in the air were being pulled into him at incredible speeds. In fact, not even the two Heavenly Emperors were far from being his match when it came to controlling atmospheric energies.</p>
 <p>When Shangguan Tianyue pushed back the Silver Emperor and then saw the Hell’s Angel and the Demonic Dragon Lady appear, he momentarily felt as though the person he was facing was the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor himself.</p>
 <p>This was supposed to be a contest to see if Zhou Weiqing could survive for the time needed to burn a joss stick, but this entire time it was Shangguan Tianyue who was being beaten up. &nbsp;He wasn’t trying to hold back on purpose! Zhou Weiqing’s techniques simply came out far too quickly, and they included so many different Attributes. He also was able to control all of the techniques perfectly, allowing him to keep Shangguan Tianyue completely off-balance.</p>
 <p>His mindset had originally been that of a senior providing guidance to a junior, but now it had completely changed. &nbsp;This kid was far more freakishly talented than he had imagined.</p>
 <p>Ordinary Heavenly Kings would probably be terrified even before the battle started if they knew they had to face a Heavenly Emperor, but Zhou Weiqing was not. &nbsp;He had just returned from the Xuantian Continent. Forget about Heavenly Emperors, he had even battled Heavenly Gods. In his heart, he didn’t feel the slightest bit of nervousness.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing himself had been suppressing his temper for quite some time. &nbsp;<em>Heaven’s Expanse Palace wanted to use this sort of trickery to prevent me from wedding Xue’er, right? &nbsp;Fine. I’ll use my power to shut their mouths</em>.</p>
 <p>A layer of blurry golden light shot out from Shangguan Tianyue, blocking the Hell’s Angel’s attack. &nbsp;At the same time, Shangguan Tianyue folded his hands together, then spread them apart. His right hand now had a long golden sword within it.</p>
 <p>The longsword was around 1.1 meters long and three fingers wide. &nbsp;An image of an enormous dragon appeared behind Shangguan Tianyue as well, and it spat out golden light which blocked the Dragon Silencing Seal which the Demonic Dragon Lady had shot out from its eyes.</p>
 <p>Shanguan Tianyue’s Elemental Jewels were also of many different Attributes, but the strongest one without question was ‘Light’. &nbsp;The sword in his hand and the light dragon behind him were his most powerful techniques, Skills which he had Stored from a Heavenly God-level Heavenly Beast, the Holy Light Dragon. &nbsp;The Holy Light Dragon was the guardian Heavenly Beast for Heaven’s Expanse Palace, and its position was similar to the Tenebrous Demon Dragon of Xuantian Palace.</p>
 <p>Thanks to this mighty technique, he finally managed to find his footing and defend against Zhou Weiqing’s consecutive attacks.</p>
 <p>A true Heavenly God Stored Skill was naturally not something a pseudo-Heavenly God like the Demonic Dragon Lady’s could compare to. &nbsp;In addition, the Demonic Dragon Lady herself was partially a Darkness Attribute creature, as was the Hell’s Angel. Both were countered to a certain degree by the Light Attribute. &nbsp;Shanguan Tianyue’s aura suddenly increased in might, sweeping out and transforming into a layer of almost physical golden light which thundered towards those two revived Heavenly Beasts.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyue didn’t immediately attack, which was why Zhou Weiqing had been able to catch him off-guard with a series of attacks. &nbsp;He needed to first catch his breath. This was especially true with Zhou Weiqing furiously sucking the atmospheric energies from the surrounding world. &nbsp;If he wasn’t able to assert some control, he probably wouldn’t be able to replenish his energy at all.</p>
 <p>The Silver Emperor flew towards him from the side, while the Demonic Dragon Lady and the Hell’s Angel were standing in front of Zhou Weiqing. &nbsp;What was Zhou Weiqing going to do?</p>
 <p>His hands were slightly crooked and began to form an arc before his chest, maintaining a circle within his hands at all time. &nbsp;The glowing light on his body grew even stronger, and the golden ribbons began to spread out from Zhou Weiqing’s body and coiled around him.</p>
 <p>Even though Shangguan Tianyue’s Heavenly God technique was able to continuously emanate an aura of might, it didn’t have any effect on Zhou Weiqing at all. &nbsp;As the ribbons of light appeared, the entirety of the drill grounds began to shudder.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyang was badly shocked. &nbsp;He hurriedly exerted his Heavenly Energy to protect this plane, but he could clearly sense that a terrifying sucking power had exploded from Zhou Weiqing’s body which was draining away even his own Heavenly Energy.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyue was even more stunned, because as the surrounding plane had trembled, he found that he was actually unable to draw upon any of the atmospheric energies from this region. &nbsp;It was as though they had found a master, and they were all furiously pouring to him.</p>
 <p>A Heavenly Emperor just had all the local atmospheric energies stolen away by a Heavenly King. &nbsp;This had completely upended Shangguan Tianyue’s understanding of the world.</p>
 <p>He didn’t dare to continue to try and recover. &nbsp;Without atmospheric energies replenishing him, he wasn’t able to recover much strength at all. &nbsp;Regardless of how Zhou Weiqing had done this, the best solution was for Shangguan Tianyue to end this as soon as possible.</p>
 <p>Gold light flashed. &nbsp;Shangguan Tianyue charged towards the Demonic Dragon Lady and the Hell’s Angel, meeting their unceasing attacks. &nbsp;The powerful aura of this Holy Light Dragon made it so that he was able to completely dominate these two revival techniques in terms of aura.</p>
 <p>An absolutely awesome blade of light slashed out, slicing through the Hell’s Angel and causing it to vanish within the light. &nbsp;This was what often happened when darkness and light clashed, and the difference in cultivation levels made it impossible to overcome.</p>
 <p>However, even as the Hell’s Angel fell beneath this sword, an absolutely awesome wave of Demonic energy instantly exploded from behind it.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyue had relied on his Holy Light Dragon’s supportive aura to give him the absolute advantage, as it prevented the Hell’s Angel and the Demonic Dragon Lady from using their full power. &nbsp;However, right at this moment, Shangguan Tianyue felt all of the energies in his body suddenly come to a halt. A Demonic aura which caused the deepest parts of his soul to quiver had just appeared out of nowhere, smashing down upon him like a staff.</p>
 <p><em>What was this?</em>&nbsp; Shangguan Tianyue’s face had a look of complete shock on it. &nbsp;Was this the Demonic Dragon Lady’s aura? Impossible, absolutely impossible. &nbsp;Even if the actual Demonic Dragon Lady was here, she wouldn’t be a match for him, much less generate such a terrifying energy ripple. &nbsp;But if it wasn’t the Demonic Dragon Lady, then who was it?</p>
 <p>Right behind the Demonic Dragon Lady was a gray figure which was slowly increasing in size. &nbsp;By the time the gray figure had truly emerged, the entire drill grounds seemed to quiver slightly in terror.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing continued to hover there. &nbsp;They could clearly see that those ribbons of light swirling around him were continuously sucking in atmospheric energies, including the energies of this very plane. &nbsp;The Demonic energy was coming from his back, and as it took form the dim golden light that had been around Zhou Weiqing suddenly turned completely gray, but it was still tinged with astral specks.</p>
 <p>Even the Demonic Dragon Lady behind him had actually been stained the same color of gray. &nbsp;The Demonic Dragon Lady was trembling slightly, an extremely excited look on her face as her aura skyrocketed explosively. &nbsp;She no longer feared the Holy Light Sword in Shangguan Tianyue’s hands or the Holy Light Dragon’s aura.</p>
 <p>“Milord father-in-law, please be careful,” Zhou Weiqing said leisurely, and then those purple-red beams of light shot out from the Demonic Dragon Lady’s eyes once more. &nbsp;This time, the Holy Light Dragon’s light was actually unable to stop it, allowing it to descend upon Shangguan Tianyue.</p>
