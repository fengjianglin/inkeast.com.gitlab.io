 <p>This thirty-seventh vortex slowly rose up from Zhou Weiqing’s DanTian, almost like it was floating up through the air.&nbsp;This was very slow, and it was only rising because Zhou Weiqing’s body had accumulated an even more massive amount of Astral Saint Energy.</p>
 <p>At the same time, the other vortexes within Zhou Weiqing’s body began to transform as well.&nbsp;They originally had been spinning at a very fast pace.&nbsp;Now, not only did they begin to absorb energies more slowly, the rotation speed itself became slower.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing himself could sense as though his body was filled with quicksilver, dense and highly sticky quicksilver, which was slowly spinning.&nbsp;Even if he wanted to stop, he wouldn’t be able to.&nbsp;His body was like a statue that had become completely solidified inside.&nbsp;His blood flow had already slowed down to an incredibly low rate.&nbsp;If Shangguan Bing’er put her fingers beneath his nose, she would find to her amazement that Zhou Weiqing had completely stopped breathing.</p>
 <p>Right.&nbsp;He wasn’t breathing, but this didn’t mean Zhou Weiqing was dead.&nbsp;He was in a very marvelous state which was filled with opportunity and danger.</p>
 <p>Due to it only be possible to train to the thirty-sixth stage of the Immortal Deity Technique, Zhou Weiqing hadn’t had any suitable cultivation techniques for him to train in after he entered the nine-Jeweled stage.&nbsp;As a result, he was constantly improving his own Saint Energy.&nbsp;What was happening right now was something he had never even heard of.&nbsp;He had no idea what was going on, and could only continue according to his imagination.</p>
 <p>In truth, even if he wanted to stop he couldn’t.&nbsp;A Saint Core.&nbsp;Was he really about to consolidate a Saint Core Nucleus?&nbsp;Although Zhou Weiqing wasn’t able to move his body, his head was blazing with flames.&nbsp;Six days ago, his Saint Energy had already broken through to the thirty-ninth stage.&nbsp;He had spent five days devouring energy, resulting in his Saint Energy being fully converted into Astral Saint Energy, which also took a full day.&nbsp;After that, he hadn’t seemed to make any further breakthroughs at all.&nbsp;He had no idea how his Saint Core Nucleus would be consolidated.</p>
 <p>It must be remembered that he had Devoured the full Heavenly Energy of a Heavenly God-level Heavenly Beast!&nbsp;However, he still wasn’t able to break through to become a Heavenly King.&nbsp;One could imagine how harder the breakthrough requirements were for Saint Energy than any other Attributes.</p>
 <p>According to what the great dragon Hui Yao believed, this time Zhou Weiqing’s Devour Skill should’ve at least allowed him to rise to the early Heavenly Emperor level.&nbsp;However, it now looked as though it would be good if he could even rise to the Heavenly King level.&nbsp;The only thing remaining of that Terror Sea Dragon was its final core essence.</p>
 <p>Although the energy within the core essence was the purest of all, there just wasn’t enough of it.&nbsp;It was hard to say if it would be enough to help Zhou Weiqing break through to the Heavenly King stage.</p>
 <p>The Saint Energy in Zhou Weiqing’s body continued to climb upwards.&nbsp;Although the process was slow, it was still agonizing to his body, as his meridians were full.</p>
 <p>His bones and his meridians were all straining in pain due to being completely full.&nbsp;As for the thirty-seventh vortex, it had already risen to his chest as well.&nbsp;As it did so, it halted its rise and began to continue spinning once more.&nbsp;This time, however, it didn’t seem to be interested in drawing in anything else.&nbsp;And yet, Zhou Weiqing had a very special feeling about it as it continued to slowly spin.</p>
 <p>This was an unclear, unspeakable level.&nbsp;When the vortex in front of his chest began to spin, he vaguely gained insight into a certain something.&nbsp;In that instant, everything around him seemed to undergo an utterly earth-shattering transformation.&nbsp;It was as though he wasn’t even in the Boundless Mainland.</p>
 <p>This sensory world of his mind had become completely dark, but within the darkness there were countless specks of light.&nbsp;These specks of light slowly began to gather around him, spinning and forming a vortex around him.</p>
 <p>More and more of the light appeared, slowly coming together into a series of long ribbons.&nbsp;As for Zhou Weiqing himself, his light around his consciousness began to grow stronger and stronger, as though transforming into a giant astral cloud.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing had never studied astronomy before, and he had no clue what this state was.&nbsp;He just had the vague feeling that aside from the atmospheric energies, there was another sort of energy that came from an incomparably distant world which was pouring into his body.&nbsp;What was this energy?&nbsp;It seemed to come from the skies.&nbsp;This was the energy of the Big Dipper constellation!</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s emotions were currently quite stable.&nbsp;Although he didn’t know what was going on, upon entering this marvelous state all of his earlier pain vanished.&nbsp;The only thing left in his heart was enlightenment.</p>
 <p>As more of those light ribbons accumulated, the entire astral cloud continued to spin at a pace which was neither fast nor slow.&nbsp;The astral cloud itself didn’t rise upwards; in fact, it actually began to shrink inwards.&nbsp;During this process, the ribbons of light began to gather around the larger cloud of astral light, causing it to grow brighter and brighter.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing didn’t know that when he had entered this state, the people outside were terrified.</p>
 <p>Almost the very first thing he had done was to fully absorb all the final core essence of the Terror Sea Dragon.&nbsp;Then, his body suddenly unleashed an incomparably dazzling silver light.&nbsp;When this light appeared, an enormous gray image actually descended from the heavens and entered Zhou Weiqing’s body.&nbsp;But, even as it merged it wasn’t able to change the silver light which was glowing across his body.</p>
 <p>Even if the Terror Sea Dragon didn’t have Heavenly Energy, its body remained at the Heavenly God level.&nbsp;However, just as Zhou Weiqing’s body began to emanate a strong aura of starlight, the dragon’s great corpse began to tremble nonstop.&nbsp;It was as though its flesh and blood had also transformed into energy and had been swallowed away by Zhou Weiqing.&nbsp;In the next instant, the two great dragons latched onto the Terror Sea Dragon and instantly reduced the body to dust.</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, the specks of light around Zhou Weiqing’s body suddenly became incomparably tough.&nbsp;They began to rotate rapidly, exploding with a terrifying aura was simply indescribable.&nbsp;Hui Yao’s first reaction was to draw Shangguan Bing’er into its own body, while its wife fled far away from Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t incapable of resisting this energy, but if it tried to resist by force it could end up hurting Zhou Weiqing. <em>What type of energy is this?</em> A sense of indescribable awe appeared within Hui Yao and Duo Si’s minds. They had no idea what level Zhou Weiqing had just reached.</p>
 <p>In the next instant, something even more stunning occurred.&nbsp;Originally, the two great dragons had completely controlled the weather in this area, ensuring that nothing disturbed Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation.&nbsp;However, the heavens suddenly changed.</p>
 <p>The bright day suddenly transformed into night, while the skies became incomparably translucent.&nbsp;Not a single cloud could be seen.</p>
 <p>They were able to clearly see that every single star within the skies was shining with radiant light.&nbsp;As for Zhou Weiqing, he floated there like the stars above the waters.&nbsp;The lustrous light emanating from him actually resonated with the astral light in the skies, and a few dim strands of astral light actually gathered within his body.</p>
 <p>Not even the long-lived dragons held any memories of such a strange phenomenon, despite their ancient histories.&nbsp;That sense of pressure vanished, but the two great dragons could no longer sense Zhou Weiqing either.&nbsp;It was as though he had completely fused into the stars of the night sky and was no longer a mere human.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er had been covering her lips this entire time, shocked.&nbsp;She was a human, and her senses were different from those of the two great dragons.&nbsp;In this instant, she suddenly felt as though her Little Fatty was no longer on the same level of existence as her.&nbsp;This wasn’t something which came from a disparity of power, it came from an indescribable intrinsic quality he now possessed.</p>
 <p>The astral light emanating from Zhou Weiqing grew even denser and thicker, and it coiled around him faster and faster.&nbsp;The ribbons of light sped up to an inconceivable amount, with all of the light suddenly vanishing within Zhou Weiqing’s body.</p>
 <p>In the next instant, a burst of terrifyingly bright light which couldn’t be stared at blasted out from Zhou Weiqing’s body.&nbsp;This light stretched out for thousands of kilometers, and in that instant all of the stars in the skies turned dim.</p>
 <p>The mighty light didn’t have a powerful aura to it, but even so, the two great dragons simultaneously could sense a spiritual pressure pushing them down into the sea.</p>
 <p><em>W-what type of power is this?!</em> The two great dragons were completely stunned. They had no idea what Zhou Weiqing was doing.</p>
 <p>In truth, not even Zhou Weiqing himself knew what he was doing.&nbsp;He had the feeling that all of the astral light had merged into his body, which seemed to have immediately exploded.&nbsp;His thoughts and senses sped up to an incredible rate, but the only thing he could sense was that boundless astral light.</p>
 <p>He didn’t sense any energy, but Zhou Weiqing realized that almost everything in the starry skies seemed willing to follow his lead.&nbsp;This was an extremely strange feeling.&nbsp;In that instant, Zhou Weiqing discovered to his astonishment that his Saint Energy had completely disappeared.&nbsp;Right.&nbsp;All of the Astral Saint Energy had completely vanished.</p>
 <p>When he noticed this, he finally sensed that his thoughts had returned to his own body.&nbsp;The Astral Saint Energy had vanished, but something else had appeared within his body.&nbsp;It was a faint golden pearl that was perfectly smooth.</p>
 <p>This pearl hovered within his chest, and the strangest thing about it was that it was actually surrounded by slender little ribbons of light that circulated around it.&nbsp;Zhou Weiqing scanned himself and instantly realized that he seemed to have undergone an earthshaking change.&nbsp;His body no longer seemed to exist, while everything within the world was available for him to command, including the endless starry night sky.</p>
 <p><em>I-is this my Saint Core Nucleus?</em> Zhou Weiqing felt incomparably stunned.</p>
 <p>Outside his body, the night sky finally turned back into day.&nbsp;Everything quickly went back to normal… but the great dragon Hui Yao couldn’t help but let out an astonished cry.</p>
 <p>What could cause a Heavenly God-level great dragon, especially one who was a progeny of the Dragon Emperors, call out in shock?&nbsp;One could imagine how truly stunning this scene was!&nbsp;“Forty-nine days?&nbsp;It was actually forty-nine days?!”&nbsp;Hui Yao stared dazed as it mumbled to itself.</p>
 <p>Puzzled, Duo Si asked, “What do you mean, forty-nine days?”</p>
