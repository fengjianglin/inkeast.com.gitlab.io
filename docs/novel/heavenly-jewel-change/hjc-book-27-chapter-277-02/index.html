 <p>Immediately, the different colors representing the Nature Elemental Attributes could clearly be seen ascending to the skies. Nature Element Energy filled the entire world. From afar, the entire place looked like a gigantic colorful ball of light, and the six of them were right in the center of this light ball.</p>
 <p>A strong suppressive force instantly overwhelmed Zhou Weiqing and company, causing them to feel suffocated.</p>
 <p>When the sidhe had arrived, Zhou Weiqing had briefly scanned the crowd for their cultivation bases - none of them were above the Heavenly King Stage. However, when the sidhe joined forces, their combined power was incredibly intimidating. Even the suppressive power from a Heavenly God’s aura might not necessarily be stronger than theirs.</p>
 <p>They made use of nature’s power to combine respective Attributes together - even if they were different, they were still somehow compatible with one another. Most likely, only the sidhe were capable of this. Additionally, Zhou Weiqing could faintly sense that this was related to the sealed grounds. In the sealed grounds, all the nature elements were magnified. The sidhe could be considered as a part of the nature elements, hence their control naturally became greater.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing had repeatedly warned the five women, and so they did not make any counterattack - they merely stayed quietly by Zhou Weiqing’s side. Even though the pressure was high, it was not too big a threat to them as they possessed Saint Energy.</p>
 <p>The male sidhe that ordered the attack on them was taken by surprise - he knew exactly how strong the suppressive force was. Initially, he assumed that those young human beings would cave in the face of such power and might. Little did he expect them to be that strong, to the point where they seemed completely unaffected by it.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said in a low voice, “My sidhe friends, please do not attack. How about this, let us meet the leader of your tribe and explain everything clearly. Indeed, we ran into your princess earlier, but she was abducted via a special Time Attribute skill. Let’s face it, none of you can subdue us, but we are willing to go back with you. How does that sound?”</p>
 <p>He did not explain patiently out of fear of those sidhe, but rather, he did not want the true perpetrator to get away with it. Furthermore, he wanted to save the Sidhe Princess as soon as possible, just by virtue of the fact that he adored the little girl, and not because of other reasons.</p>
 <p>The male sidhe leader replied furiously, “Let us seal your cultivation first, before we discuss any further.”</p>
 <p>A cold look flashed across Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, “Do you really think we are scared of you guys?”</p>
 <p>As he spoke, the reddish golden Nebula energy was released in an instant, creating another reddish golden light ball within the enormous colorful light ball. At the same time, the reddish golden light ball released dazzling brilliant rays of light. The sidhe surrounding Zhou Weiqing and company could only feel the nature elements in the air rush wildly towards the reddish golden light. To them, it felt as though a portion of the nature elements in their bodies had unexpectedly abandoned them.</p>
 <p>The glowing reddish golden light became brighter after being amplified by the nature elements. Even though it did not emit any suppressive aura, the surrounding sidhe were overwhelmed by the pressure - some weaker sidhe even fell from the sky.</p>
 <p>The reddish golden halo started spreading, creating an enormous air cushion, thus providing a safe landing for the fallen sidhe.</p>
 <p>The formation of hundreds of sidhe, that was able to form a formidable suppressive power that was on par with that of a Heavenly God, was crushed by Zhou Weiqing with ease. Even though it was technically impossible for those sidhe to join forces to create an attack that was on the same level as a Heavenly God, the suppressive force that they created was still formidable enough to subdue any ordinary Heavenly Emperor Stage powerhouse.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, in the Attributes department, Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy trumped them all. It was impossible for them to suppress Zhou Weiqing by solely relying on a little Heavenly God grade aura.</p>
 <p>Chaos ensued, and the majority of the sidhe panicked. Indeed, it was rather impressive that the sidhe could control Nature Energy. However, they had lived within the sealed grounds their entire lives and had no actual combat experience. If the enemy was subdued by their suppressive force, all was good; if the enemy resisted, things would take an ugly turn.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at the sidhe coldly. The sidhe had to be threatened by force, or they would refuse to cooperate, despite claiming to be most peaceful and freedom-loving creatures. It was apparent that in this world, power was the most important thing - as long as one possessed sufficient power, he would have right to dominate over others, regardless of where he was.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing did not launch any attack, he was definitely going to keep his promise to Xue’er that he would not harm any sidhe. Additionally, Zhou Weiqing was very intelligent - if he were to harm the sidhe, it would validate the criminal charges against him. He was not scared of the sidhe taking revenge against him, but he definitely was unwilling to take the fall for someone else.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Now, can you take me to see your leader?” Zhou Weiqing’s looked at the male sidhe.</p>
 <p>The male sidhe was dumbstruck and could only stare blankly at Zhou Weiqing. Till now, he had not snapped out of his trance. In his eyes, Zhou Weiqing was nothing but a human being in his twenties, which was why he ordered the attack on them earlier without any reservation. The sidhe specialized in controlling nature and life - they had an innate ability to tell the real age of the other party. Without a doubt, they could tell that Zhou Weiqing and company were only in their twenties. Hence, the male sidhe assumed that capturing them would be an easy feat. Little did he expect Zhou Weiqing to display such intimidating and formidable abilities. All of a sudden, he was at a loss.</p>
 <p>At this time, there were more sidhe rushing over to their location from afar. Their transparent wings did not allow them to fly too fast, but the mere fact that they could fly gave them a huge advantage over humans.</p>
 <p>Additionally, most of those sidhe were holding onto bow and arrows. The moment Zhou Weiqing saw that, he instinctively felt a sense of familiarity. He couldn’t help but wonder if his Peerless Regiment was stronger than the sidhe.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“There is a limit to my patience. From the looks of it, I have to get the attention of your leader on my own instead.” As Zhou Weiqing looked at the hesitant look on the male sidhe’s face, he was somewhat disappointed in them. It seemed to him as though they had led a peaceful life for too long, such that they had forgotten how to fight a battle.</p>
 <p>Faint rays of light flickered; a faint light was emitted from Zhou Weiqing’s face. His hands were folded on his chest, and the light in his eyes flashed - a bright Astral band of light rushed towards the sky. Indistinctly, an enormous phantom image could be seen behind Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>When the phantom image appeared, even Zhou Weiqing’s reddish golden Astral Saint Energy became a shade of dull gray in an instant. The gray astral light flashed and the hundred over feet tall enormous phantom behind Zhou Weiqing emitted an immense suppressive force that soared to the sky.</p>
 <p>When the suppressive force appeared, all the sidhe, regardless of whether they were already present or making their way there, felt suffocated. Luckily, the coercive force headed directly for the sky. If it was targeted at them, perhaps the sidhe in the sky would have fallen down, or even get destroyed by it.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Demon God’s aura?” A shocked female voice was heard. Immediately after, a vision suddenly appeared - countless faint green light rushed out in all directions. Another hundred over feet tall enormous phantom image appeared high up in the sky.</p>
 <p>What appeared behind Zhou Weiqing’s back was indeed a Demon God, but it was completely different from the ones he had summoned from before.</p>
 <p>The first noticeable change was its clarity. The Demon God that Zhou Weiqing summoned using the Nebula Saint Energy was wearing a black long robe, covering his entire body. His gray hair was so long that it reached the ground; there was a bright dazzling gray gemstone that was embedded in the center of the chest of his robe. Additionally, his facial features could clearly be seen this time.</p>
 <p>He looked exceedingly handsome, with a pair of gray eyes on that pale face of his. Nonetheless, there was a faint bloody line that ran down the middle of his forehead to his eyebrows. His enormous body emitted a demonic aura. Intimidating energy ripples were constantly emitted from his body - it was so menacing that it could cause the entirety of the sidhe’s sealed grounds to shiver in fear.</p>
 <p>Not far from the Demon God, another phantom image was being condensed - it was much more stunning. It was an image of a woman decked in a long green dress. Almost all of her accessories were made from plants. Her slender waist was exposed, revealing her navel; her well-endowed bosoms looked as though they were almost bursting; her pale delicate skin had a healthy color to it and she had long turquoise hair. Even though her hair was not as exaggeratingly long as the Demon God, her hundred-plus feet frame made her hair look like a beautiful turquoise waterfall cascading down.</p>
 <p>Similarly, the woman had extremely beautiful features - she had a pair of blue eyes that seemed to be filled with endless life aura, and she had three pairs of transparent wings behind her. Her body continuously released dense life aura, preventing the Demon God’s demonic aura from spreading.</p>
 <p><em>What a powerful life energy</em>! Zhou Weiqing was slightly taken aback. In the next moment, something strange happened. Zhou Weiqing waved his sleeve, and under the layer of his reddish golden Astral Saint Energy, the five women and him had disappeared into thin air, merging themselves with the enormous body of the Demon God.</p>
