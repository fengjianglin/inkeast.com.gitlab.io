 <p><b>Chapter 199 Saint Energy! (3)</b></p>
 <p>Right at that moment, Shangguan Xue’er froze in shock. She clearly sensed that as she bit Zhou Weiqing, a burst of pure energy instantly filled her mouth, streaming down her throat. Within moments, that pure Heavenly Energy entered her body, filling her entire body with a soothing cool, a comfortable, almost euphoric feeling extending through every inch of her body.</p>
 <p>This… this was the secret behind him kissing Tian’er? Shangguan Xue’er was extremely intelligent, and she immediately realised what had happened. Previously, every time Zhou Weiqing had kissed Tian’er, she had glowed with that light of treasure. So, that was because of this strangely pure energy entering her body. Although Tian’er did not know how this energy had come about, but she could sense it held its sheer purity and the massive amounts inherent, with the aura of the four Saint Attributes as well… what kind of valuable treasure was this! He… he actually gave me a drop, but I bit him instead. Instantly, Shangguan Xue’er’s face turned red, looking at Zhou Weiqing apologetically.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Tian’er opened her eyes, looking at Zhou Weiqing pained look, she couldn’t help but giggle out loud. “Serves you right, who asked you to just take advantage of her without explaining anything. Couldn’t you just spit it out and give it to her?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at her exasperatedly: “Why does it sound so disgusting when you say it like that! What do you mean spit it out!? Without my aura protecting it, once it comes into contact with the atmosphere, it will quickly dissipate and vanish.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er said apologetically: “I’m so sorry, I… I didn’t know.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing shamelessly stuck out his tongue once more, showing the slight teeth imprint. “Give me some more kisses and it won’t hurt anymore.”</p>
 <p>“Bah…” Shangguan Xue’er blushed deeply, subconsciously dodging behind Tian’er, saying in a low tone: “In the future, you do not need to do so again. This is the energy that you both risked your lives for, and gone through so much trouble to cultivate, how can you just give it to me?”</p>
 <p>Tian’er giggled and extended her hands, pulling Shangguan Xue’er to her side and saying: “Sister Xue’er, I haven’t even thanked you properly yet. Earlier, if not for your intervention in reminding some particular scoundrel, I would have been drained dry and killed now. Little Fatty is right, we are a family, why should we be so particular about sharing?”</p>
 <p>Although she had argued a lot with Shangguan Xue’er, in that previous instant earlier, she had finally truly accepted Shangguan Xue’er in her heart. Without question, they were rivals in love, but in that point of critical danger, Shangguan Xue’er had still been willing to save her life. Not just willing, but anxious. Although there was still the possibility that Zhou Weiqing might have come to his senses in time, it was still without a doubt that Shangguan Xue’er’s reminder had saved her, and Tian’er had been extremely touched by that. The previous ill feelings she held towards Shangguan Xue’er had vanished.</p>
 <p>At the same time, Tian’er was no fool. She knew Zhou Weiqing’s feelings for Shangguan Bing’er was the strongest; not to mention there was still another Shangguan Fei’er. The three of them were sisters, triplets. No matter what, the three sisters added together would have a higher place in Zhou Weiqing’s heart than her. If she continued on this path of constantly arguing with Shangguan Xue’er, just like what Zhou Weiqing said, the days ahead would not be good at all. It was a good opportunity at hand in closing the gap between the two of them, and at least they would not have such a sense of enmity towards each other.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er looked at Tian’er with a slightly startled expression before she finally shook her head lightly, saying: “Although I do not like you much, but we are not enemies after all. If it had been you, you would have also done the same thing.”</p>
 <p>Tian’er giggled and said: “It isn’t as simple as not being enemies right. Because of a particular rascal, we have been forced to become sisters. For the sake of Little Fatty, and for our own sakes, we should indeed try to accept each other. What do you say?”</p>
 <p>Both girls could be said to have extremely stubborn characters, each with their own strong personalities. It was not easy for either of them to admit defeat at all. At this moment, with Tian’er taking the initiative to ease the relations between them, it instantly broke the thin barrier between them that was the most difficult first step to take.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er slowly nodded. Looking at Tian’er, she slowly smiled faintly. For a person who was cultivating the Boundless Infinitum Technique to actually smile, it was not an easy feat!</p>
 <p>Only then did Tian’er turn her gaze to Zhou Weiqing, whose tongue was still stuck out as he stared at the two of them with wide eyes. “Little Fatty, what was all that about? What is that liquid energy? How did you gain such a thing?”</p>
 <p>Due to the fact that the leading force was Zhou Weiqing, as such although Tian’er had accepted the pure energy and benefited from it during their long cultivation, she was actually just as confused as Shangguan Xue’er, not knowing what had happened at all.</p>
 <p>At that time, Tian’er had discovered that her body was almost drained dry, even her life force was about to vanish. In her heart, there was some fear and panic, but at that very moment, she sensed Shangguan Xue’er’s shout of warning towards Zhou Weiqing, the voice that shook down to the very soul even managed to cause her dazed thoughts to rouse slightly. The next instant, Zhou Weiqing had pulled her closer and kissed her lips.</p>
 <p>In that instant, Tian’er could sense a vital life force entering her body, fully replenishing all of her drained life force. Next, the silvery white liquid of pure energy fused fully into her body. Tian’er’s senses were no lesser than Zhou Weiqing’s, and within moments she discovered the power of the liquid. As the involved party, her curiosity about it was definitely even higher than Shangguan Xue’er.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Heh, Tian’er, we have just been too lucky. I’d say we were blind cats that caught a dead rat[1. Literal Translation of chinese idiom, pretty much means unbelievably lucky].”</p>
 <p>Tian’er said exasperatedly: “You are the one who’s the blind cat.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “If only we can meet such good luck all the time, so what if I’m a blind cat. Hahaha.”</p>
 <p>Tian’er said, full of curiosity: “Hurry up, tell me and Xue’er, what was actually going on? Why was there that pure energy whenever you kissed me? How come all my Heavenly Energy was totally transformed in the process?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing began to describe the entire process of that cultivation simply, and as the two girls listened to his story, their expressions changed several times.</p>
 <p>Previously, Tian’er was still bashful and irritated about Zhou Weiqing’s choice of words with blind cat, but after hearing his description, she could only shiver with fear on how close she had come to death several times. Indeed, she had to admit that the phrase was rather apt in the circumstance.</p>
 <p>“That was a true mix of time, luck and life. Sometimes, when luck comes, one can’t even reject it! It looks like we have to thank that assassin, otherwise we might not have such a miraculous encounter.”</p>
 <p>Tian’er said: “Don’t get too excited, this is just the beginning for us. Now that our Heavenly Energy has all been transformed, how are we going to cultivate in the future? Without our original Heavenly Energy… could we continue cultivating with this pure and refined energy? This is already the fusion of the four Saint Attributes.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “This is also what I am worried about, so we will need to continue experimenting in all the cultivation techniques for the four Saint Attributes. This is something we have to fumble about before we can find a right path. However, what you mentioned just now should not be possible. When the Heavenly Energy was refined and transformed to that silvery white liquid, I was no longer able to affect it with the Devour Skill, not able to draw upon it. As such, it cannot be used as our Devour Skill cultivation. We will have to try on other areas.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er stood at the side, her heart filled with envy. However, she did not have any Saint Attributes, and naturally could not cultivate together with them in a similar fashion.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “That is the reason why I infused a drop of the fused power to Xue’er. Since we are going to experiment, we need to conduct many different tests with many different variables. I have a thought to try out later… I will begin Devouring Xue’er’s Heavenly Energy instead this time, and Tian’er you and I will start forming the four Saint Attribute fusion whirlpool within my body like the last time, and we shall see if we can help Xue’er to transform all of her Heavenly Energy as well… as well as what difference there might be in such a process, or what we can gain from it. With that drop of the silvery white energy protecting her, no matter what happens, at least Xue’er will not be in danger.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er blushed deeply, but her heart was secretly rejoicing. At least, Zhou Weiqing had not forgotten her, and such an unbelievable treasure, he was still willing to think of her.”</p>
 <p>“You both haven’t eaten for a whole day and night, aren’t you hungry?” Shangguan Xue’er asked concernedly.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er exchanged looks. Indeed, such a long time had passed, yet neither of them felt any sense of hunger.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “Perhaps it is because of the four Saint Attributes’ fusion and that sheer massive amount of energy that it holds, that it even settled all issues of hunger and thirst. Alright, it is rather tiring to keep calling it that, how about we give it a name. Hmmm… a simple one… our original energy is called Heavenly Energy, and this is the product of the four Saint Attributes… shall we call it Saint Energy then?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er said: “Weiqing, I think your idea of experimentation is in the right step. However, I think that you should not rush to start on that first, especially in using the Devour Skill in training for now. That is because you still have not fully grasped this Saint Energy yet, understanding it fully and being able to control it. I feel that you both should begin cultivation first, try to learn how to cultivate it on your own and also how to control it, and also begin sharing your thoughts and understanding. With that, you can begin to fully understand it, the underlying principles and control. Only then should we start experimenting with the various training methods.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s eyes lit up and he nodded in agreement. “That is true, I am being too eager to try that out.” At the same time, his heart was secretly rejoicing. Everything else aside, it was at least clear that Shangguan Xue’er’s attitude towards him had changed. This could be seen just from the fact on how she addressed him compared to previously. Furthermore, it looked like the relationship between Tian’er and Xue’er was starting to improve as well. This was amazing news for him! At least, with this improvement, his days would no longer be plagued with suffering!</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Although they weren’t particularly hungry, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er still decided to rest up and have a meal first, along with Shangguan Xue’er. While doing so, the three of them began to have a simple discussion regarding the four Saint Attributes. Only then did they begin the fresh round of cultivation, entering a meditative state.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing sat there cross legged, starting his attempt to circulate this new Saint Energy of his. What Shangguan Xue’er had said was indeed true, he had to learn and understand it, and to do so, he would have to start actually using it and trying it out. Only then would he be able to understand the underlying profound meanings behind it, and to truly make it his own.</p>
