<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Even Fen Tian, who thought that he had the perfect plan, could not help but be dumbfounded by what happened. This was because he had his head turned towards Xue AoTian when he was speaking to him and thus could not see the changes in the sky. Even so, he was completely unable to explain everything that was happening before his eyes, especially when his subordinate clearly had the upper hand earlier. How did the situation change so suddenly? Even though the Tiger King looked like he was badly injured, his subordinate was directly killed off.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was to be noted that the Blood Red Hell had a shortage of powerhouses. After all, Zhou Weiqing had killed off quite a number of them earlier. Hence, the number of Heavenly Emperors he had was limited. The Blood Red Hell’s schemes were not only limited to this Grand Tournament. In fact, Fen Tian had already drawn up specific plans to deal with the other Saint Lands. However, just like that, he had lost one of his best Heavenly Emperors. Fen Tian could not hold back his gloominess.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“What happened?” He had to clench his teeth as he asked his subordinate.</p>
 <p>The final collision in the sky was equivalent to a dramatic scene. Everyone else could clearly see that when the Blood Red Hell’s Heavenly Emperor’s black gigantic figure rammed into Xue AoYing’s body, the Tiger King, who originally looked pale and on the verge of death, suddenly released a piercing golden light from his body.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The ray of golden light actually managed to forcefully rip open the extremely powerful Destructive Energy. With one blow, it created a big hole in the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor’s body. The Tiger King had also suffered a heavy impact from the fallout of the Destructive Energy. Hence, both of them had fallen to the ground from above.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hearing the account given by his subordinates, Fen Tian was in disbelief. If the Destructive Energy was that easy to destroy, what was he going to rely on to lead the Dan Dun Empire into defeating the Geritimo Empire without much difficulty? Moreover he had made a grand appearance earlier on, preparing to use the Grand Tournament as a stepping stone to rule over the Mainland.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xue AoYing was clearly on the losing end earlier on, not forgetting the fact that he was already injured. Even if he was not injured and went all out without sparing any effort, it should not have been possible for him to destroy the Destructive Energy. The difference in their cultivation base was negligible and the power difference of their attributes was absolutely great. Any techniques he could have engaged in at that time should have been useless!</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Fen Tian, I think that it must have been AoYing’s mistake. You have seen it too - when it comes to life and death, AoYing had to give his all as well. I would like to express my deepest regret with regards to your subordinate’s death.” Xue AoTian’s voice rang in Fen Tian’s ears. While the tone of his voice was truly apologetic, when Fen Tian turned to look at Xue AoTian, he could not see a trace of apology or regret on his face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fen Tian subconsciously clenched his fist. He nearly flared up, but ultimately, he managed to hold in his anger. In any case, he was not morally right. After all, it was his subordinate who tried to deliver the fatal blow. Although he had not fully made out what happened, it was still not the time to fall out with the Heavenly Snow Mountain.</p>
 <p>He forced out a smile, “The Tiger King is not to be blamed entirely. In the Grand Tournament, death can happen in just a blink of an eye. However, from the looks of it, the Tiger King is unable to continue fighting. In this battle, it could be considered that there are no winners. However, my subordinate had died. Hence, I had lost more in comparison. In that case, my man will join the battle line first, and you can send your second participant in after.”</p>
 <p>Xue AoTian nodded. Both Fen Tian and him sent out a participant each. Just like before, Fen Tian had sent out a Heavenly Emperor, but to everyone’s surprise, Xue AoTian sent out a Heavenly King instead.</p>
 <p>However, the leaders of the other Saint Lands were not taken by surprise pertaining to this arrangement. After all, the strongest individual in the Heavenly Snow Mountain was Xue AoTian himself. Their power on the whole was not too strong. Hence, it was inevitable for him to send in a Heavenly King.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The mutual casualties of both the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Blood Red Hell had benefited the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. At least the Heavenly King, a cannon fodder, that they sent in for the first round was still able to allow the Heaven’s Expanse Palace to remain in the fourth place in the next cycle. Unfortunately, he was up against the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue next.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A Heavenly Emperor against a Heavenly King. Unless he was an outlier like Zhou Weiqing, there was no suspense with regards to the end results.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Yunyue did not waste too much effort and energy. Just like that, he won the first round easily.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, the first cycle of the first round of the Grand Tournament had ended. The winner of the first cycle was the Peerless Sect. Of course, in the eyes of Fen Tian, the Peerless Sect won only because of luck. If the Heavenly Emperor that he sent out did not die, Wu Yunyue might not have had it that easy.</p>
 <p>There were no breaks allowed during the Grand Tournament. Wu Yunyue’s next opponent was a participant from the Passion Valley.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The second participant sent out by the Passion Valley was a Heavenly Emperor, just like before. He seemed somewhat nervous with Wu Yunyue as his opponent. When both parties soared to the sky, he clearly lagged behind Wu Yunyue.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This was no wonder. Wu Yunyue was the Sect Leader of the Heavenly Demon Sect. Even though the Heavenly Demon Sect was the least powerful compared to the rest of the Great Saint Lands, but when it came down to individual power, nobody dared to take Wu Yunyue lightly due to his cultivation base. The Evil Attribute had a rather overbearing power. Moreover, it was coupled with the great Light and Darkness Attributes, as well as Life. Wu Yunyue’s power was great enough to win against Shangguan Tianyang who was equipped with the Boundless Infinitum Set. How could an ordinary Heavenly Emperor be able to win against him? Furthermore, in the previous match against the Heaven’s Expanse Palace’s cannon fodder, Wu Yunyue barely consumed much energy.</p>
 <p>Following Wu Yunyue’s ascent to the sky, the entire sky became a shade of gray. The originally icy-cold air had became gloomy as well. Wu Yunyue’s face looked very calm but he had a ferocious look in his eyes. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>He did not have a favorable impression of the other four Great Saint Lands. If not for their persecution, the Heavenly Demon Sect would not have needed to rely on someone else. He had volunteered to be the first participant of the Peerless Sect. He did not think about how long he needed to endure either - he merely needed a channel to release his burden. Without a doubt, the Demonic Emperor in such a state was extremely terrifying.</p>
 <p>Even though Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy could not help Wu Yunyue to successfully make a break through to the Heavenly God Stage, it managed to close the gap between his current cultivation base and the Heavenly God Stage. He was just one small step away. This was also because of the severity of Wu Yunyue’s old injury - part of the Saint Energy was used to treat his injuries as well.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Passion Valley’s Heavenly Emperor was facing Wu Yunyue from a distance in the sky. A distorted light allowed him to gain a foothold in the sky. However, compared to the omnipresent Evil Attribute of Wu Yunyue, he was clearly a lot weaker. The Passion Valley’s Heavenly Emperor was only at the Mid Level Heavenly Emperor Stage.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Demonic Emperor, after you.” Under the flickering light, while he was being equipped with eight pieces of a Legendary Set, the Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor gestured towards Wu Yunyue at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Yunyue did not even reply him - in an instant, he made his first move. A dense gray light erupted from within his body. At the same time, Wu Yunyue’s entire body began to swell up. Both his eyes instantly became blood red. His long hair had also turned into a horrifying shade of gray.</p>
 <p>Demonic Transformation. Indeed, the moment he ascended to the sky, he had used the Demonic Transformation. He did not even bother to test waters.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Boom - an terrifying explosion sound resonated in the sky. Wu Yunyue charged towards the Passion Valley’s Heavenly Emperor like a cannon being shot out. The nine-piece Legendary Set covered his entire body, like gray crystals. Within his right hand, a long sword that was being condensed by gray crystals created a ray of light in the air, as it flashed across.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Demonic Emperor Set - even though this Legendary Set only had nine pieces, it was the Legendary Set that all the previous Demonic Emperors were equipped with. Amongst all the nine-piece Legendary Sets, it was the most powerful.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Heavenly Jewel Masters with the Evil Attribute all believed in the Demon God. Amongst everyone present, Zhou Weiqing was the one who could sense all the abilities used by the Demonic Emperor the clearest. Wasn’t the gray sword in his hands an imitation of the Sword of the Demon God?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing who was standing on the ground accidentally looked at Huang Xingyun of the Passion Valley. The moment he saw that Wu Yunyue had used the Demonic Transformation immediately, he clearly was stunned. Immediately after, he looked extremely worried.</p>
 <p>Rumble ——</p>
 <p>At this moment, a thunder-like sound was heard in the sky. At the Heavenly Emperor Stage, blows that were exchanged were a lot more direct. One must at least possess skills of the same level as the Heavenly Skill Image in order to have any effect. However skills at that level were not easy to use. Hence, in general, Heavenly Emperors were fighting with brute force. It was purely based on power and attributes, as well as combat experience and special techniques.</p>
 <p>The Heavenly Emperor of the Passion Valley also seemed to use his full force to attack. Similarly, he had a sword in his hand. Taken by shock, he raised his sword as well.</p>
 <p>The distorted Time Attribute had caused the light rays around his body to show traces of disorder - one was to confuse the Demonic Emperor, the other was to use Time Disorder Skill to throw the Demonic Emperor off with regards to his attack.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, his cultivation base was a far cry from that of Wu Yunyue’s. Moreover, after using the Demonic Transformation, not only did Wu Yunyue enhance his entire body, the icy cold sensation had been magnified to the maximum.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The sword of the Demonic Emperor sliced through the Time Disorder Skill from a narrow crack, striking the Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor’s sword.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A loud clash was heard as a result.</p>
 <p>At the crucial moment, the Heavenly Emperor had unleashed his power. As though he was electrocuted, his entire body trembled violently. It was impossible for him to completely endure the strike from Wu Yunyue’s sword. The Evil Attribute was truly terrifying.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, in the next moment, his body unexpectedly separated. His phantom image shattered under the attack of the Demonic Emperor’s sword, but his actual body had already retreated more than ten meters behind, neutralizing a huge part of Wu Yunyue’s attack.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Time Mirror Image? This was a high level Time Attribute skill. The mirror image that was created by a Heavenly Emperor was not entirely a phantom image. He would be able to maintain a certain degree of defensive strength in the mirror image and hence giving the actual body of the cultivator sufficient space to dodge the attack. The Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue’s sure-win attack was thus neutralized by his opponent under such a circumstance.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A ray of light flashed across the Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor’s eyes. Naturally, he could tell that the earlier attack by the Wu Yunyue was a fatal one that was meant to take his life. If he did not manage to use the Time Mirror Image to evade the attack, even if he did not die, he would have been severely injured.</p>
 <p>Wu Yunyue swung his sword, and in the next moment, the Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor retreated once again, dodging the attack. His body had charged upwards once again, causing the space surrounding him to become distorted. It enveloped both Wu Yunyue and him within it. At this moment, only Wu Yunyue and him were the only two people who knew what was happening within that area. All the other powerhouses gathered on the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain could no longer clearly see what was happening.</p>
 <p>The Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor appeared right before Wu Yunyue. His body and sword merged as one, charging towards Wu Yunyue’s chest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even though Wu Yunyue was slightly passive due to his old sword techniques, he had a lot of combat experiences. His body followed the sword, and a cluster of dense dark blue light erupted from all directions, enveloping his entire body within it. It was indeed the unique defensive skill of the Life Attribute that was used to protect one’s life.</p>
 <p>The Blue Rain Hibiscus Mutabilis bloomed with a myriad rays of light. Not only was it used for defensive purposes, at the same time, it rolled towards the Passion Valley Heavenly Emperor. Following his movements, the Demonic Emperor’s sword swung upwards.&nbsp;</p>
