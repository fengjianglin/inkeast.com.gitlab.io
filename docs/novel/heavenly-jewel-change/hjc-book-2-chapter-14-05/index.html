 <p><strong>Chapter 14 Physical Jewel Consolidated Equipment Sets (5)</strong></p>
 <p>“En. Since that’s the case, you can just wait here for me to finish Consolidating Equipment, then we will both leave together. With Huyan Senior as your teacher, your cultivation path in the future will be much smoother.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said with a grin: “It is not I, it is we. Teacher promised to help us both with our Consolidating Equipment and Skill-Storing.”</p>
 <p>“I do not need it.” Shangguan Bing’er said passively. “I may not have much money now, but when I have enough funds, I will return Huyan Senior the money for the Wind Wielding Boots Scroll. Also, Little Fatty Zhou, let me emphasize again, You are you, and I am my ownself. We do not have any special relations at all. I will cultivate with my own efforts, and I do not need you to give me anything.”</p>
 <p>Looking at the resolute look in Shangguan Bing’er’s eyes, Zhou Weiqing grew silent.</p>
 <p>When Shangguan Bing’er said these words, her heart did not feel good, but she definitely did not want Zhou Weiqing to take advantage of her just because of free Consolidating Equipment and Skill-Storing, even if the advantage was just words. Although she had already lost her first time to him, but she would not allow anyone to trample upon her dignity. She deeply remembered that when she was very young, her mother had said to her – If you want others to respect you, then you must want respect yourself.</p>
 <p>Looking at Zhou Weiqing who had gone silent, Shangguan Bing’er thought that he had gotten angry, and was somewhat apologetic in her heart as well. Just as she was about to try saying something to ease up the atmosphere, Zhou Weiqing actually raised his head up again.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing gave a thumbs-up to Shangguan Bing’er, saying: “Very good, Battalion Commander, you are truly our Heavenly Bow Empire’s Viscount. Self-respect, always striving to improve and self-love. With those words you spoke a moment ago, I have found that I have a deeper understanding about you, and also a greater admiration for you. This has also strengthened my conviction to pursue you. You will definitely become my wife!”</p>
 <p>Looking at him saying that with such a serious face, yet such teasing words, Shangguan Bing’er felt a sense of helplessness. How could she be so foolish as to think so much. How could such a shameless fellow be angry?</p>
 <p>“You rascal, get lost now. I will not give you the opportunity!”</p>
 <p>In the previous instance Zhou Weiqing had been totally serious, the next moment his expression turned into a deeply loving look as he stared at Shangguan Bing’er affectionately, saying: “How do you know my childhood nickname?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er did not understood what he meant, and gave him a querying look: “What did you say?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing continued to gaze at her affectionately, “I meant that my childhood nickname was called Rascal Ah!”</p>
 <p>“Get lost –!” Shangguan Bing’er let loose a flying kick onto that rascal, she did not know that if she continued staying in the same room as him, she would go crazy.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing dodged quickly, did a lazy roll, and actually tumbled a few meters before jumping up quickly. He did not actually exit the room, but instead stuck his head out the door and looked around.</p>
 <p>Just as Shangguan Bing’er was about to land a foot on his ass to kick him out, that fellow actually turned his head back with a mysterious manner. With a lowered voice, he said: “Battalion Commander, I’m not joking with you now. Lend me some money, I have some serious use.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er said suspiciously: “What do you need to borrow money for?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing took a step forward, and was about to whisper in her ear, but Shangguan Bing’er took a vigilant step back, keeping her distance as she said: “You can stand there and say. If you do not convince me clearly, I will not lend you the money.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said in a low voice: “I want to go to Skill-Store my Elemental Jewel by myself.”</p>
 <p>“En?” Shangguan Bing’er looked at him surprisedly, saying: “Why? Didn’t you say that Feng Yu Senior will help you with the Skill-Storing?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said with a strong sense of righteousness: “I thought that what you said was very true, we cannot owe others too much. Therefore, I decided to go about the Skill-Storing by myself.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er said with a cold humph: “Speak the truth.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s face fell immediately: “I knew that I cannot hide the truth from you. I actually just wanted to borrow 2000 gold coins. Didn’t you say that Skill-Storing cost 500 gold coins for one try? I wanted to test whether my Darkness and Evil attributes will superimpose again and help in Skill-Storing for my Elemental Jewels as well. If that is true, then perhaps I can also succeed in Skill-Storing for my Elemental Jewels in a single try?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er’s eyes brightened, “That makes sense, but, I will go with you.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “Don’t you trust me? I will not use your money to do any misdeeds. The money that the wife gives, I must naturally use it in the proper place.”</p>
 <p>Anger flashed in Shangguan Bing’er’s eyes and killing intent rose: “Little Fatty Zhou, what did you call me?”</p>
 <p>“Battalion Commander, I certainly called you my Battalion Commander.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er gave a humph, “I’m going with you to help you with your cover, otherwise, if it is only you by yourself, it is easy to arouse suspicion.” Actually, her original intention was truly to monitor that this rascal was really goes to the Skill-Storing Palace.</p>
 <p>Zhou Wei nodded and said: “Okay, we will go and try tomorrow, after all Skill-Storing can only be attempted once a day, and I currently do not have sufficient Heavenly Energy.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er said: “Okay, tomorrow early morning then.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “Good. Then we should rest early today.”</p>
 <p>“Less idle talk, go to the hotel to withdraw the room, then come back here to cultivate.” Shangguan Bing’er discovered that the longer she spent together with with Zhou Weiqing, the number of times that she got angry increased by many times as compared to before. Even after she had joined the army, she had tried to be more serious, and she had also occasionally scolded her subordinates. However, that could not compare to this rascal who had angered her so many times.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing went to let Huyan Aobo know his whereabouts before heading to the hotel to withdraw their room, then he returned to the little courtyard once again; this time he does not disturb Shangguan Bing’er anymore, but instead went to his own room.</p>
 <p>Feeling his own Heavenly Energy, Zhou Weiqing discovered that the Heavenly Energy that he had consumed in going through his Physical Jewel Consolidating Equipment trying out his new Overlord Bow, had actually automatically been restored about a third by the four Death Acupuncture Point’s energy whirlpools. Focusing his will upon his Heavenly Jewels, his heart itched to try his new abilities.</p>
 <p>“How I wish I could find a place to test the might of this Overlord Bow. Alas, I do not have sufficient Heavenly Energy. I wonder with my current amount of Heavenly Energy, how many arrows can I shoot with with this overlord bow. No wonder my beautiful Battalion Commander said that Heavenly Energy is the basis of Jewel Masters. Having insufficient Heavenly Energy is really painful!”</p>
 <p>After arriving at Flying Hill City, Zhou Weiqing could be said to have his horizons greatly widened, and had learnt a much greater understanding about Heavenly Jewel Masters. What he really wanted to know most is what fortuitous encounters he would have tomorrow when he went to try out Skill-Storing. What really was that black pearl that he had swallowed? Why was it that the Darkness and Evil Attributes could automatically superimpose?</p>
