 <p><b>Chapter 140 Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor! (2)</b></p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing held back Shangguan Fei’er by the shoulder, walking up beside her before stopping. Grinning wide, he said: “Heh heh, Senior, you [1. Using the respectful term of you here] do not have any real ill intentions towards us right, you do not need to try and scare us. Furthermore, we have one similarity, one look and we know we are linked by destiny.”</p>
 <p>“Oh? Say then, what is this similarity between us?” The fat man looked on at Zhou Weiqing with interest, a faint smile on his face. Of course, that smile caused the fat on his face to squeeze his eyes until they were almost invisible.</p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing was about to open his mouth when the fat man suddenly waved towards Zhan LingTian: “Little brat, behave yourself. Do you think I am like Han Tianyou, so arrogant and thinking so highly of himself but amounting to nothing but dogshit?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no sign of any energy fluctuations, no light of attributes energy or the white of pure Heavenly Energy. However, in that moment, Zhan LingTian sensed an unbelievable pressure coming from above, like an entire mountain range was pressing down upon him. *Poof* He sat back down on the ground as his legs buckled, and even the Light-Dark Divine Spear disappeared. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heavenly Emperor Invisible Energy!” Shocked exclamations rang out from Shangguan Fei’er and Zhan LingTian almost simultaneously. Their voices held a tremble that was not even there when they had faced Han Tianyou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amongst the people present, Zhou Weiqing, Lin TianAo and the others might not know what had just happened and what that entailed. However, how could Zhan LingTian and Shangguan Fei’er not know?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Heavenly Emperor Invisible Energy’, as the name suggested, referred to Heavenly Emperor Stage powerhouses, with Eleven Heavenly Jewels. At that level, their Heavenly Energy no longer had any colours, and they could control the energy in the atmosphere without any signs. Previously, the pressure on Zhan LingTian was not the fat man’s Heavenly Energy, but just his sheer control over the air. At the Heavenly Emperor Stage, all energy in the world was under his control, even the heavens and atmosphere. </span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Heavenly Emperor Invisible Energy’. These four words might seem simple, but they represented the absolute top echelons of the world. Heavenly King Stage powerhouses might be very rare, but in the entire mainland, there were still quite a few. Besides the Heavenly Demon Sect, every Great Saint Lands had a few Heavenly King Stage powerhouses. Of course, the Heaven’s Expanse Palace had the most, with at least twenty Heavenly King Stage powerhouses. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when it came to the Heavenly Emperor Stage, perhaps the entire mainland had only ten or so, each and every one of them were either Great Saint Land Leaders or top tier powerhouses known in the mainland. After all, the Heaven’s Expanse Palace Master Shangguan Tianyang was at the max level of the Heavenly Emperor Stage. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Who could have imagined that in this tiny little Snow Deer Tribe encampment, they would actually meet a Heavenly Emperor Stage powerhouse?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Han Tianyou and all the other Blood Red Hell members added up together, when compared to this fat man in front of them, would all be considered mere ants. Heavenly King Stage and Heavenly Emperor Stage might seem to be only one stage apart, but in truth it was like the difference between heaven and earth. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Sensing the terrifying power of a Heavenly Emperor Stage powerhouse, both Shangguan Fei’er and Zhan LingTian did not have any thoughts of resisting. In front of such a powerhouse, resistance was futile. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Zhou Weiqing did not know what that ‘Heavenly Emperor Invisible Energy’ meant, his mind was extremely quick and intelligent. Hearing those words shouted out by the two, he quickly understood what it could possibly signify. As such, his face turned rather strange as well. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Speak then! What similarities do we have?” The big fat man looked at Zhou Weiqing with a big smile on his face. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Only then did Zhou Weiqing break out of his slight reverie, laughing heartily as he said: “My nickname is Zhou Little Fatty, I would think Senior is called Big Fatty. We are both one Big Fatty and one Little Fatty, isn’t that a great point of similarity? What do you think Senior?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha.” As he said that, he started laughing out loud. Alas, none of the others standing beside him could laugh. Making fun of a Heavenly Emperor Stage powerhouse’s looks, had he lived for too long as decided to commit suicide?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the large fat man still looked smilingly at Zhou Weiqing: “Little Fatty right? Let me tell you one thing, in the past, those who called me fat, with the exception of one person, the rest are all dead. It looks like your glib tongue won’t be able to save you this time!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Heh heh, but I’m still alive now right? Senior, don’t try to scare me anymore, I am a coward. We do not have any possible hatred between us, no enmity, and you clearly do not have any ill will towards us, why are you trying to scare us then? If you really wanted to kill us, with your power, that could be done in seconds and there is nothing we can do about it. Why bother with all the nonsense with us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The large fat man gave a humph and said: “I’ve never seen a little rascal as cunning as you. Alright, I won’t beat around the bush with all the crap. Hurry up, kneel down and kowtow to me, beg this old man to accept you as my disciple.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh?” Although Zhou Weiqing could easily tell that this large fat man had no ill will towards them, he had not expected something like this to happen. </span></p>
 <p><span style>All the others also started in surprise. What was going on? This large fat man wanted to accept a disciple, yet he still wanted Zhou Weiqing to beg him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“No way.” To their even greater surprise, Zhou Weiqing did not even think about it, and rejected the offer instantly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the fat man’s turn to start in surprise. “What? Why no way? Don’t think that this old man cannot tell that you totally aren’t part of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace? Or… could it be you already have a teacher? That does not matter, I’ll wring your teacher’s head off, that solves the problem right?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Far off, deep in the Peerless Battalion camp, Mu En suddenly shivered involuntarily as a cold chill ran down his spine for no reason. </span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Zhou Weiqing gave a humph and said: “Nothing forcibly accomplished will have a good effect<a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>, Senior, you wouldn’t force me right? Indeed, I already have a teacher, and although his cultivation level is far below yours, he is someone I respect the most. I will not betray my teacher.”</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>The fat man started once more. “Aren’t you afraid that I will be angry and kill you all?” </span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Zhou Weiqing shook his head, saying sternly with a righteous air. “I’m not afraid. As the saying goes, never surrender to power and force’<a id="footnoteref-3" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>, haven’t you heard of it before, Senior?” </span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cheh.” The large fat man said disdainfully. “If anyone else says that, I might still believe it. For you… little brat, you’re too cunning and wily, and way too afraid of dying. Trying to act in front of this old man is of no benefit to you. Just now, &nbsp;before Han Tianyou left, he clapped your shoulder. That was not a simple clap, but an infusion of yin fire. Within three years, that yin fire will continuously invade and eat up your body from within until you die. I do not even need to do anything, with your cultivation level, you won’t be able to resolve this problem on your own. If you don’t want to die, you should beg me now.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yin fire?” Hearing the large fat man’s words, Zhou Weiqing blinked. “Senior Large Fatty, how about this, shall we make a bet?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Zhou Weiqing asking to make a bet, Lin TianAo, Shangguan Fei’er, Crow all rolled their eyes involuntarily. This rascal was trying to con someone again. In their memories, every time Zhou Weiqing wanted to bet with someone, that rascal definitely felt he had a hundred percent guarantee of winning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bet? Bet on what? That you won’t die in three years?” Large Fatty looked on at Zhou Weiqing with interest again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “No, no, three years is far too long. WIth Senior’s cultivation level, it should be extremely easy for you to check whether or not that yin fire will actually harm me. We can bet now, whether or not I can take care of this yin fire by myself. If I am unable to take care of it, I will beg you to accept me as a disciple. However, if I can take care of it by myself… heh heh, then it’s your turn to beg me.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Large Fatty suddenly burst out laughing, saying: “You little brat, truly a wily one eh. Alright, I won’t play with you any longer.” As he said that, he suddenly burst into action, yet no one could actually see him move. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In an instant, he appeared in front of Shangguan Fei’er, a single hand pressed upon her forehead. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shangguan Fei’er did not struggle at all, not because she did not want to, but because she found she could not move at all. Once again, the Fetters of Wind, and she was left totally helpless. At the same time, the Silver Emperor Little Red Dot was actually still caught in the previous Fetters of Wind, even though quite some time had passed it was still in effect. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry up and kneel down and beg this old man, otherwise, I will kill this little lover of yours. My patience has a limit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, Zhou Weiqing had wanted to gain some advantage with a bet, but who knew this large fatty was more cunning than he thought, not falling for it at all. Instead, he had quickly taken hold of his weak point easily. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“How do you know she is my love?” Zhou Weiqing asked curiously. As Zhan LingTian was with them, both he and Shangguan Fei’er had been extremely careful not to show any intimacy. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The way you look at each other, breathing, heartbeat.” The large fatty grinned and said: “Heh, every time you all look at each other, both your heartbeats and breathing will have some small change. Also, the way you look at each other, that cannot fool me. You two are already at such a stage, what else can you be but lovers? Earlier, when you were facing Han Tianyou, even when you were in extreme danger yourself, a lot of your attention was on this little girl. Alright, enough trash talking, hurry up and kneel down and beg me to accept you as my disciple. Otherwise, every minute, this old man will scratch an un-healable scar on this little girl’s beautiful face. You little brat, you might not have heard of my name, but this Heaven’s Expanse Palace little girl should have heard of me. Anyone else might be afraid of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, but since when have I, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor, been afraid of anyone? Furthermore, I am known to be ruthless… heh heh.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing the words ‘Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor’, both Zhan LingTian and Shangguan Fei’er’s face changed again. Clearly, the name had a stunning effect on both of them. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“That… Senior Large Fatty, then I have one last request.” Zhou Weiqing said with a wronged look on his face. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What request?” The large fatty gave a cold humph, clearly getting rather impatient. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing’s face suddenly turned very serious, with a hint of sorrow as he said solemnly: “I can acknowledge you as my master, but you cannot harm my original teachers. They will still be my teachers no matter what. Just think, if every time someone stronger wants to take me as a disciple, and I betray my old teacher, wouldn’t I become someone that also betrays you in the future? If you do not agree to this term, no matter what, even if you kill all of us, I will not agree.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The large fatty looked at Zhou Weiqing with piercing eyes, but they slowly turned gentle. Nodding his head in satisfaction, he said: “That does make sense. Alright, I agree to that. Damn it, looking for a successor is so tough. If not for the fact you little brat also has six Attributes, do you think I will waste so much time with you?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Right at that moment, there was an abrupt thud as Zhou Weiqing knelt down on the ground. This little rascal changed faces as quickly as others flipped the pages of a book indeed. Facing the large fatty, he kowtowed: “Senior Large Fatty, please accept me as your disciple!” That expression, so sincere and earnest. In terms of acting, Zhou Weiqing was definitely second to none. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Such a sudden change of attitude, let alone the others, even the large fatty couldn’t help but feel his mouth twitch.</span></p>
