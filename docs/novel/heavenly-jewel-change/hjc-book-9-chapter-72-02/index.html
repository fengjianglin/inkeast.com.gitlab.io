 <p><b>Chapter 72 In front of Absolute Strength, Tricks are Useless (2)</b></p>
 <p>As compared to yesterday at the grouping ceremony, the atmosphere at the Plaza was obviously full of fighting spirit and killing intent. Every battle team was there in strength, even the seeded teams, with the lowest numbers being eight and the highest up to more than ten. The only exception was naturally the Fei Li Battle Team and our dear Leader Zhou Weiqing, with their mere four.</p>
 <p>When Zhou Weiqing led Shangguan Bing’er, Crow and Ye Paopao to the Fei Li Resting House, they immediately drew the attention of all the other battle teams, including the four seeded teams.</p>
 <p>Even for the four seeded teams, all five main team members and three reserve members came, eight in total. In everyone’s point of view, the Fei Li Battle Team was just too arrogant; having only four members come was tantamount to announcing to others that they were so confident in winning today that only four members were required.</p>
 <p>Of course, the one with the ugliest expressions was undoubtedly their opponent for today, the Mi’Ou Empire’s Battle Team, and they were currently glaring hard at the Fei Li Battle Team.</p>
 <p>Alas, our dear Leader Zhou’s skin was extremely thick, and no matter how everyone stared at them, he just had an expression of ‘It is not my problem’, sitting down openly in the Resting House.</p>
 <p>The side of the Resting House facing the main stage was not covered, and seeing him sit there so casually, everyone’s impression of the Fei Li Battle Team’s arrogance rose once more.</p>
 <p>It wasn’t long before all the teams were gathered. From the distance, they could also see that the VIP stage was also full of people. Zhou Weiqing glanced towards it before looking away quickly. It wasn’t that great to have such a high sensitivity in this case, just that single glance had given him a huge scare, as cold sweat covered his entire back. He couldn’t tell what power levels most of the people in the VIP stage were, but he was sure that there were at leasts more than twenty who were more powerful than Ming Wu!</p>
 <p>What sort of concept was that? That was to say, there were more than twenty nine-Jeweled Zong Stage Masters or greater on that stage alone! Each of them were powerhouses that could shake the world.</p>
 <p>At this moment, a middle aged man of around forty stood up from the VIP stage, heading to the front. He was dressed in a yellow dragon robe, with a gold crown on his head, with several beautiful gemstones mounted on it. His waist was also studded with eighteen snow-white jades. He was not very handsome, giving off a stable, simple aura, but there was a lustrous gleam in his eyes that could not be hidden, and it was hard to determine how old he truly was. He was also one of the people which Zhou Weiqing had sensed as having a stronger power level than Ming Wu.</p>
 <p>“Hello, all you youths from twenty four different Empires, it is good to meet you. I am the Emperor of the ZhongTian Empire, Shangguan TianXin. I would like to welcome all of you to our ZhongTian Empire, to join the great Heavenly Jewel Tournament held every three years.” His voice was soft and gentle, yet like mercury seeping into the ground, pervasive; and everyone could hear him clearly.</p>
 <p>The competitors in the houses quickly walked out, bowing towards the VIP stage in greeting “Greetings Your Majesty.” Amongst them, the eight members of the ZhongTian Battle Team kneeled down respectfully.</p>
 <p>The several hundred thousand citizens who were surrounding the plaza also knelt down at the same time, shouting out loudly: “Long live, Long live, Long live Your Majesty!”</p>
 <p>Several hundred thousand people shouting at once was definitely a stunning experience, as the huge sound waves reverberated around the air, it was likely that they could even be heard from the Heavenly Jewel Island several thousand metres above! This was the prestige and might of the Emperor; even though Shangguan Tianxin did not reveal any majestic aura, in front of his many citizens, he quickly became the focus of the entire area.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing also bowed slightly, but was surprised to see that Shangguan Bing’er, who was beside him, seemed rather dazed. “Bing’er, what’s wrong?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er shook her head softly, saying: “Nothing, I just had a sudden feeling like his voice was so soothing and comfortable.”</p>
 <p>By now, Shangguan TianXin spoke once more. “The Heavenly Jewel Tournament rules are as they have always been. Today is the first round, and I hope that all you promising youths can display your full potential, and get good results.”</p>
 <p>“The battle teams entering the top four will be able to enter the Heavenly Jewel Island to attend the finals. At the same time, they will also get tremendous prizes there. This is your stage! That’s all I have to say. Shangguan Longyin, where are you?”</p>
 <p>“Here I am” An old man stepped forward from the side, bowing respectfully to Shangguan Tianxin.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianxin said: “Longyin, you will be the overall judge of this year’s Heavenly Jewel Tournament, and you will supervise it, with your Skill Storing Palace staff as judges.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, Your Majesty.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianxin’s gaze swept across the members of the twenty four teams, and his own citizens, before saying solemnly: “Let the games begin!” [1. Technically, he said Heavenly Jewel Tournament, Officially Starts Now. I like my version better! :P]</p>
 <p>“Long live, Long live, Long live Your Majesty!”</p>
 <p>Another huge outcry arose as Shangguan Tianxin returned to his seat in the center of the VIP stage, and Shangguan Longyin replaced him at the previous position in front.</p>
 <p>As compared to Shangguan Tianxin’s gentle appearance, Shangguan Longyin looked to be imposing and strict, his face impassive and a fierce light in his eyes, as if he were a sheathed sword.</p>
 <p>Ye Paopao said softly: “I’ve heard of this man, he is the ZhongTian Empire Skill Storing Palace Master, and is one of the most important persons in the entire ZhongTian Empire. Furthermore, it is rumoured that the upper echelons of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace is also made up of the members of the Royal Family. As such, although the ZhongTian Empire is so huge, the Shangguan Family’s status has never been shaken, and the seat of Emperor has always been theirs.”</p>
 <p>‘ZhongTian Empire Skill Storing Palace Master’, the rank alone gave Zhou Weiqing chills. Even the Fei Li Empire’s Skill Storing Palace Master was a Heavenly King ranked powerhouse, and this Master in front of him was definitely even more powerful. Yet, he wasn’t even the most powerful person in the ZhongTian Empire, with the Heaven’s Expanse Palace above him! The world is indeed huge, and his eyes had indeed been opened.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Longyin’s imposing gaze swept past the audience, and they actually instantly quietened down. Impressive, as there were more than a few hundred thousand people! If one were to examine their faces closely, they would be able to see the fanatic light in the citizens’ eyes.</p>
 <p>“First round, Group 1 Fight 1, ZhongTian Battle Team versus TianFeng Battle Team. Both sides, please send out your first participant. Skill Storing Palace Judge, ascend the stage.”</p>
 <p>Under the anticipating looks of the audience, the first to ascend the stage was a middle aged man wearing a cream coloured robe - the Judge. On his robes were silver thread embroidery decorating it, and right in the middle of the chest area, the silver thread formed a large ‘Zhong’ word.</p>
 <p>The ZhongTian Battle Team was one House away from Zhou Weiqing’s, and in a flash of white light, a huge youth leapt up the stage. The ZhongTian Battle Team’s uniforms were pure white, with embroidery looking similar to the judge’s robes, though their uniforms weren’t robes, but tight fitting clothes suited for fighting, while the threads were gold, but similarly forming the ‘Zhong’ word in the center of the chest area.</p>
 <p>As soon as the ZhongTian Battle Team member ascended the stage, the TianFeng Battle Team shouted out: “We admit defeat.”</p>
 <p>The judge turned towards them and asked: “Do all of you admit defeat?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>On hearing that, the ZhongTian Battle Team member did not seem surprised, remaining expressionless, as if he had already expected that this would happen. After bowing towards the judge, he walked back down, returning to his Team House.</p>
 <p>According to the tournament fixtures, the first four fights would be the four seeded teams’ fights, followed by the other.</p>
 <p>Facing a seeded team in the preliminary heats and admitting defeat instantly was not something that was shameful, but rather an intelligent choice. After all, defeating the seeded teams was extremely difficult, or maybe even impossible. Even if there was a chance of success, they would not do so during the preliminary heats. Avoiding a tough fight that would take too much of a toll, saving strength to take care of the others in the preliminary group in order to take the second position; this was definitely the stance that most, if not all, of the other teams.</p>
 <p>As expected, in the next three fights, the other three seeded teams also won without a fight, easily getting their first victory.</p>
 <p>Next up was the second fight of each group; this was finally the start of the actual fights!</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing sat in the rest house, watching closely. Watching the two teams of Group 1 fighting, he was rather surprised in his heart. Both of these battle teams were from small empires, but their power was not to be underestimated. Out of the five who actually fought, both sides were all with 2 3-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters, and 3 4-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters. For youths of less than thirty, this was already considered extremely powerful. Furthermore, their combat skills and fighting styles were all pretty good, as they fought hard on the stage, Heavenly Energy flying all about. It was pretty impressive, after all, these two teams were merely relatively ‘bottom-feeder teams’ in terms of ranking amongst the twenty four.</p>
 <p>Finally, the fight ended with one side barely winning with a 3-2 score.</p>
 <p>When it came to the second group’s second fight, Zhou Weiqing was unable to watch any further; mainly because the next round was their group three’s turn to fight .</p>
 <p>“Crow, you take the first round. Paopao, the second round. For the third round, 2 v 2, Crow and I will take it.” As the temporary leader, Zhou Weiqing quickly assigned their roles.</p>
 <p>Although she was not assigned to fight, Shangguan Bing’er did not complain, just sitting silently beside Zhou Weiqing. Towards her man, she had a total unrelenting confidence and support towards him.</p>
 <p>The second round ended rather quickly, as one of the teams was from a rather large empire, similar in strength to the Fei Li Empire, the Gerry Connaught Battle Team. They displayed their sheer power and superiority here, winning easily by just sending 4 members, 2 4-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters and 2 5-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters.</p>
 <p>Whenever every fight ended, the judge on the stage would be changed. At this point, a new judge stepped up onto the stage and shouted out: “Third Group, Second Fight. Fei Li Battle Team versus the Mi’Ou Battle Team, both sides, please send your first participant onto the stage.”</p>
 <p>Crow had been waiting for the fight for so long, and she quickly stepped up towards the stage. When she reached it, she did not even bother using the stairs, stamping hard on the ground with her right foot, flying up and landing straight on the tournament stage.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing quickly clapped his hands to his ears, and in the next instant, a huge explosion rang out, shocking everyone.</p>
