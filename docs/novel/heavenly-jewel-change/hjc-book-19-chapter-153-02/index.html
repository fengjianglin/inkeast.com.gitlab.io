 <p><b>Chapter 153 Shangguan Sisters! (2)</b></p>
 <p>After their intimate moment in the tent last night, she would still blush deeply and feel her skin heating up whenever she thought about it. More touching to her were the words that Zhou Weiqing had spoken to her. She was clear that her line of defense against that fellow was growing weaker and weaker by the day, and who knew when it would totally collapse. However… what about Bing’er!</p>
 <p>Just as she opened her tent flap and stepped in, she stopped abruptly as an abrupt sense of alarm tore her from her thoughts, and her unfocused gaze instantly gathered swiftly and she snapped out: “Who’s there?”</p>
 <p>She did not unleash her Consolidated Equipment yet, but her Heavenly Energy immediately circulated to the maximum. At the same time, she made use of her step into the tent to enter a defensive stance that was ready to spring into action at anytime.</p>
 <p>“Come in.” A cold voice, with a hint of anger, rang out softly in Shangguan Fei’er’s ears.</p>
 <p>It was a very familiar voice, one that she had heard for all her life, and a voice that filled her heart with shock. If we were to say who Shangguan Fei’er was currently the most afraid of seeing now, it was undoubtedly Shangguan Bing’er, and the next after that would be the owner of this voice.</p>
 <p>Quickly stepping fully into the tent, Shangguan Fei’er instantly saw a figure who looked exactly like her, dressed in the ZhongTian army uniform. It was Shangguan Xue’er, standing right in the middle of the tent, the exact same features with the only difference was that frosty look on her face, and even her clear eyes held a hint of cold and anger as she looked towards Shangguan Fei’er.</p>
 <p>“Big Sister, you, why are you here?” Even Shangguan Fei’er could sense the noticeable tremor in her voice as she asked the question.</p>
 <p>“Why am I here? What do you think? If I did not come any sooner, I’m afraid you would do something to let down Bing’er right?” Shangguan Xue’er’s voice was filled with anger. This was actually the first time that Shangguan Fei’er had seen her like this.</p>
 <p>Both these sisters were triplets after all, and though Shangguan Bing’er had not grown up together with them, the two of them had, and they were extremely close to each other. Although their ages were less than an hour apart, Shangguan Xue’er had always shown the bearing of an elder sister since a young age. No matter what, she would always give way Shangguan Fei’er in all things. However, when it came to critical moments, if Shangguan Xue’er got angry, Shangguan Fei’er would definitely listen to her obediently. It could be said that in the entire Heaven’s Expanse Palace, even the two brothers Shangguan Tianyang and Shangguan Tianyue were unable to control the Little Demon Girl, and only her elder sister could make her afraid. However, she was not afraid of Shangguan Xue’er’s power, but that Shangguan Xue’er would ignore her, and lapse into a cold war.</p>
 <p>Even in the past when they were growing up together in the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, no matter the argument or their worst deadlocks, they had only entered a cold war. This was actually the first time that Shangguan Xue’er had scolded her like that directly.</p>
 <p>“Sis, what are you talking about!” Although Shangguan Fei’er refused to admit anything, her heart started racing.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er gave a cold humph and said: “What am I talking about? I already witnessed it with my own eyes last night, do I still need to say anything else?”</p>
 <p>“Last night… it was you?” Shangguan Fei’er instantly felt as if she had been doused with a bucket of ice cold water. The next moment, her face turned totally red.</p>
 <p>However, to her surprise, Shangguan Xue’er’s face also turned red.</p>
 <p>What Shangguan Fei’er did not know was that as triplets, under such a close proximity like last night, they had somehow sparked an induction of emotions, causing Shangguan Xue’er to clearly sense what Shangguan Fei’er had been feeling, that sense of joy while she was being intimate with Zhou Weiqing, as well as that feeling of excitement. It was also because of that feeling she had never sensed before that she had quickly fled that scene so hurriedly instead of showing herself then. At this moment, seeing her sister in front of her, she suddenly remembered what she had seen and felt last night, not to mention that day on the Heavenly Jewel Island which she would never forget, the kiss that caused her to grit her teeth in anger. That was her first kiss!</p>
 <p>“Sis, I’m wrong…” Shangguan Fei’er lowered her head in shame. If the Peerless Battalion’s ruffians soldiers saw such a sight, their jaws would drop all the way onto the ground.</p>
 <p>Was this still their valiant, ferocious drill instructor who would smack down anyone who caused trouble?!</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er’s expression eased slightly. After all, her relationship with Shangguan Fei’er was extremely close. In the past, every time Shangguan Fei’er did something wrong and was caught by her, she would admit her mistake just like that, and every time, Shangguan Xue’er would forgive her. They had not spoken heart to heart for quite some time, and with those familiar words, Shangguan Xue’er felt her heart melting. However… this time… was what she did so easily forgiven?</p>
 <p>“Fei’er, don’t you know you are playing with fire? He is Bing’er’s man! They are already engaged to be married, yet… yet… that actually happened. How, how could you be intimate with him? Is that fair to Bing’er?” Shangguan Xue’er paused for a while, biting her lip, but she finally gritted her teeth and steeled herself to continue.</p>
 <p>Hearing her words, the rosy red cheeks of Shangguan FEi’er suddenly turned ashen pale. She bit her lip lightly and said: “I’m sorry, Sis, I really am… I know I am wrong, but … but… I really could not control myself. I also do not know when it was that I actually fell for him. Sis, feelings and emotions… it is not something that can be controlled. When I first ran to look for him, I was just curious about him, and more so, to take some revenge against him for both myself and your sake. Who asked him to steal our first kisses! However, that bad fellow seems to have some strange magic about him. The longer I spent with him, the more I was influenced by that… unable to extricate myself. I…”</p>
 <p>As she spoke up to that point, her beautiful eyes were misty and welling up, her body shuddering slightly as she clenched her hands tightly.</p>
 <p>Looking at her like that, Shangguan Xue’er could not bear to continue. Although she was always icy on the surface, it was just a cover for her soft heart. In truth, amongst the three Shangguan Sisters, she was the most tenderhearted. However, she had always used her icy cold demeanor to cover that tender-heartedness. Seeing her little sister in such pain and suffering, her own heart ached in tandem.</p>
 <p>Taking a few steps forward, she embraced her sister, who fell into her arms and started crying.</p>
 <p>In the past few months, her relationship with Zhou Weiqing had been the greatest problem plaguing Shangguan Fei’er. She had put her all into training the Peerless Battalion soldiers, not just because she enjoyed it, but also also in an attempt to lose herself in it and prevent herself from thinking too much about things. She had also started trying to avoid Zhou Weiqing, but even though she did not see him, it was as if he held some magnetic power, and she could not escape it.</p>
 <p>Currently, seeing her own big sister, the emotions she was hiding in her heart burst forth, and in opening the floodgates of her tears, she found she was unable to stop. In moments, Shangguan Xue’er’s shoulder clothes was soaked with her tears.</p>
 <p>Seeing her sister crying in such sorrow, Shangguan Xue’er could no longer speak the words of admonition on her lips. Stroking her back softly, she gritted her teeth and said: “That bastard Zhou Weiqing, playing around with one of my sisters isn’t enough for him, and he has to incur another one. I really feel like killing him with one sword strike.”</p>
 <p>“No… please…” Hearing that, Shangguan Fei’er’s crying suddenly stopped and she grasped hold of Shangguan Xue’er urgently, looking up in fright.</p>
 <p>“You…” Looking at her like that, Shangguan Xue’er was left speechless. “Fei’er, you have really fallen for him beyond help.”</p>
 <p>Her brow furrowed tight, Shangguan Xue’er was currently in an inward dilemma. She did not know how to face both her sisters. Originally, the words she had prepared to speak out, she found she was unable to say them. Her heart ached for Bing’er, and did not wish for her husband to be taken away, but Shangguan Fei’er was also her sister! How could she hurt one sister for another? That was something she could not possibly do, not at all. In truth, Shangguan Xue’er had never been an ambitious person. In her eyes, even the Heaven’s Expanse Palace Palace Master position was no match for kinship and familial love. Even the reason why she worked and trained so hard was to make her uncle and father happy, to maintain their family and protect them from being hurt by any enemies.</p>
 <p>“Sis, what should I do? I truly am unable to let it go. There have been many times in the past few months that I have tried to garner my courage to leave him, but every time I tried to step out of the camp, that sense of loss… it is as if I am being torn apart from the inside, and I could not help myself and walked back in. I really like him, and also like this Ruffian Battalion we have here. Everyone here, although each and everyone of them has their flaws, but they are extremely genuine… so real. No matter what they think, they will show it out instantly, even if they might seem rough, even vulgar and coarse, but as compared to our Heaven’s Expanse Palace, they just feel more authentic to me. I truly do not wish to leave.”</p>
 <p>Looking at Shangguan Fei’er’s pitiful look, Shangguan Xue’er could only remain silent. Even if she asked her what to do, she too did not know!</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er said softly: “Did Father ask you to come and bring me back?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er shook her head and said: “Father only asked me to come and keep watch on that Zhou Weiqing; he did not ask me to bring you back.”</p>
 <p>“Really?” Upon hearing those words, it was as if Shangguan Fei’er had been injected with stimulants. She leapt up abruptly, exclaiming: “Great, that’s awesome! Sis, you are the best!” As she said that, she planted a big kiss on Shangguan Xue’er’s cheek.</p>
 <p>Caught by surprise by the sudden kiss, Shangguan Xue’er flushed slightly and said: “Stop it. Although Father did not ask me to bring you back, but I am also here to keep watch on you as well. I have already been here for some time… previously everything was still okay, and you were still able to keep your distance from him. However, what happened yesterday? Fei’er, you know, Bing’er has been separated from us for so long, since birth, and it is Father who has let her and Mother down. Now that she has finally returned to us, if you really steal her beloved, how are we going to face her in future?! She is so kind and goodhearted…”</p>
 <p>The excitement that had just risen up disappeared once more, and Shangguan Fei’er sighed softly. “I also do not know, Sis, I truly do not know how to face Bing’er. It isn’t like I haven’t thought about it… if not for Bing’er, I would have already accepted Little Fatty long ago…”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er couldn’t help but ask: “Is that fellow really that good? Is he really worth you being like this?”</p>
 <p>To her surprise, Shangguan Fei’er nodded without hesitation, saying: “It is true, Sis. Although Little Fatty might seem bad at times, rougish and a scoundrel… But, the things he shows subconsciously has truly infected me. If I have not truly fallen in love, I would not be suffering so much now. What should I do!”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er took a deep breath and sighed deeply, saying: “Fei’er, such a thing can only depend on yourself.”</p>
 <p>“I… I…” Tears welled up once again in Shangguan Fei’er’s eyes.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er thought deeply for a moment and said: “Fei’er, you go back home then. You have to.”</p>
 <p>“No, I.. I do not want to leave.” Shangguan Fei’er replied almost as a reflex. Looking at the strange look in her sister’s eyes, she lowered her head and said: “Sis, I’m afraid that if I leave, I will never see Little Fatty again. Furthermore, there are still so many things for me to do here at the Peerless Battalion. I really cannot leave!”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er pulled at her once more. “Silly girl, you cannot just leave things like this forever, or keep avoiding the topic. You will have to solve the issue eventually. You definitely have to return to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. If you think you truly love that bastard, then the only way is to speak to Bing’er and get her forgiveness! Although I do not want to see such a thing happen and give that fellow such an advantage, but… who asked you both to…”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, Shangguan Fei’er was struck dumb, opening her mouth and staring at Shangguan Xue’er in amazement.</p>
 <p>Being stared at like that for so long, Shangguan Xue’er felt rather embarrassed, and she retorted: “What are you staring at me like that for?”</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, Shangguan Fei’er took a big step forward and gave her a big hug, giving her another kiss on the cheek. “Sis, you are just too smart! Why didn’t I think of that? That’s right, isn’t that the perfect solution? Both Bing’er and myself can marry Little Fatty! Hehehe, that’s too good!”</p>
 <p>“Good? Good your head!” Shangguan Xue’er gave her a light thwap on the head with her hand. “You are really hopeless. What so good about that fellow you are so eager? You silly girl! Furthermore, whether or not you can persuade Bing’er remains to be seen.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er smiled happily and said: “I’m sure there is a way. Bing’er is so kind and gentle, I’m sure she will forgive me. She can be the first wife, and I’ll be the second, anyway we are sisters. That Zhou Little Fatty is such a player, there is still that Tian’er, better to let our own gain the advantage than outsiders! With me and Bing’er together, we can unite together against the others, and we won’t lose out.”</p>
 <p>It was Shangguan Xue’er’s turn to be struck dumb. She truly could not understand what her sister was thinking, and no matter what, she could only think how terrible this Zhou Weiqing was. Yet, in her sisters’ eyes, that fellow was like some treasure, and she truly could not understand it.</p>
 <p>“You… You are really making me angry!” Shangguan Xue’er pushed her away lightly in exasperation. “Hmph, you decide for yourself then, I shall not interfere in this matter anymore.” As she said that, Shangguan Xue’er turned around. Currently, she did not have any sign of her usual icy outlook.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er said merrily: “You can’t not interfere, who asked you to be my sister! You can’t cut off blood ties like that.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er gave another exasperated hmph. Looking at her back, Shangguan Fei’er abruptly thought of a daring idea. Although she felt guilty towards Shangguan Bing’er, she had after all grown up with Shangguan Xue’er, and if she were to say who she was closer to, it would definitely be Shangguan Xue’er. When that daring idea popped up in her head, her heart raced instantly, and her eyes swirled about in her sockets as the idea took hold in her mind.</p>
 <p>Hearing her sister’s words cut off so abruptly, Shangguan Xue’er turned back in curiosity, only to see her with her head lowered, as if deep in thought. She did not suspect anything, asking: “Fei’er, when are you prepared to return?”</p>
 <p>“Ah?” Shangguan Fei’er was broken out of her reverie, and quickly said: “Sis, I cannot return at such short notice, at least until things here are relatively stable. Anyway, Bing’er is still in closed door cultivation, you wouldn’t want me to disturb her training now right?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er insisted: “At least you need to set a time. I will not interfere between you and Zhou Weiqing, but before you get Bing’er’s permission, I will not allow you to be intimate with him.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er said: “We are just about to receive a new batch of soldiers. In two months, the WanShou Empire armies are going to attack. Weiqing said that this is the best opportunity for us to temper our Peerless Battalion, to put them through the grinder of true combat. In such a critical moment, how could I leave him? Leave them? How about this, I will return as soon as the WanShou Empire armies are beaten back.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er thought about it for a moment, and decided her words made sense. Nodding slowly, she said: “Alright then, but you must honour your words.” Towards this Little Demon Girl, she was all too familiar with her character.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er said seriously: “Sis, I will listen to you. As soon as the WanShou Empire armies are beaten back, I will definitely go back. At the same time, I also promise you that during this time, I will definitely not… you know… with Little Fatty. However, I also have something to ask you, how about that?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er got her promise and relaxed inwardly. Subconsciously, she replied: “What is it?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er said: “Sis, you have also seen for yourself, this Little Fatty has such a ‘flowery’ heart, and our ZhongTian Empire armies also allow females to join. For example, that Shen Yi from the Sixteenth Regiment beside us used to have good feelings towards Little Fatty, and even wanted to marry him. That’s why, if I really leave, I cannot help but be worried. Furthermore, if I go, these Peerless Battalion brothers will not have anyone to take care of them. Your power is greater than mine, if I leave, it will be stealthily, then you can replace my chief instructor position and not let Little Fatty discover it. Firstly, to help me take care of the soldiers here, and secondly to keep watch on him for me and Bing’er. Don’t let me have any other women, otherwise you can beat him up!”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing her words, Shangguan Xue’er did not feel anything amiss. After all, what Shangguan Fei’er said was true, that Zhou Weiqing was just too much of a player, if no one kept him in check, who knew how many other women he would attract. Her own two sisters had already fallen for this fellow, and Shangguan Xue’er naturally did not want anyone else to come into the picture.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er had truly spent too much time with Zhou Weiqing and had been influenced by him, even her words in the art of trickery was at a much higher level. She first sincerely agreed with all her sister’s requests, before giving a small request of her own… with all of it for Bing’er and her own sake. Naturally, Shangguan Xue’er would not be suspicious.</p>
 <p>“Alright then, I will help you keep watch on him. If he dares to court any other girls, then my sword will…” As she said that, Shangguan Xue’er made a downward chopping motion.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er was laughing inwardly. She had not expected that her sister would rise to the bait so easily. Her daring idea was on the first step to coming true.</p>
 <p>Inside, she thought to herself: <i>Little Fatty, it is all up to you to succeed. If you can drag Sis down as well, Heh Heh… then us three Sisters can stay together forever, and we three can bully you! Hmph hmph, we’ll see if you dare bully me next time.</i></p>
 <p>If Shangguan Xue’er knew what Shangguan Fei’er was thinking at that moment, she would definitely run over and slay him with a single sword strike. Alas for her, she did not know that she had fallen into her sister’s trap.</p>
 <p>“Sis, then will you still hide in the camp?” Shangguan Fei’er asked.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er shook her head and said: “How can I stay here, I have been observing you all from nearby the camp. I brought enough food.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er said happily: “Don’t… stay here! You can stay in my tent… anyway besides that fellow, no one else would dare intrude here. He is in closed door cultivation in the near future, and will not come here as well. We have not seen each other for so long, I want to keep company with you!”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er could only nod helplessly and say: “Alright alright, you silly girl! What can I say to that. However, if I stay here, you’ll have to tell me everything that has happened between you and that Zhou Little Fatty. Let me see what he has done to make you fall for him so hard. Don’t you know that what you said just now, I truly cannot believe that you are my sister, the Little Demon Girl of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er laughed and said: “No problem, I’ll tell you everything, even all the details of our intimacy, how about that?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er’s face turned cold. “Fei’er, your skin is getting itchy right?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er giggled and said: “Too bad there isn’t enough space, otherwise I do want to have a practice fight. Although I did not have much practice time by myself since I came here, however perhaps because I have been enjoying myself while teaching these fellows, I also have learned a lot. I have the feeling that I am almost about to breakthrough to the Seventh Jewel, almost catching up with you!”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er smiled faintly and said: “You better work hard then. I’m afraid that you currently can’t fight with me still.”</p>
 <p>As she said that, Shangguan Xue’er closed her eyes. Instantly, a gentle aura rose from her body, filling the entire tent with a strange sensation, as if the entire air had been turned into liquid, reverberating. The soft, gentle sensation seemed to envelop Shangguan Fei’er. There was no strong Heavenly Energy fluctuations, but Shangguan Fei’er could feel as if she was in a swamp, restricted in an uncomfortable feeling.</p>
 <p>“You… you already grasped the Boundless Infinitum Technique?” Shangguan Fei’er said in shock.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er nodded slightly, saying: “My Heavenly Energy cultivation level has almost caught up with Big Bro Zhan.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er gave a speechless look before saying: “You are truly born to cultivate… I don’t think my talent is any lesser, but how come I can never catch up to you? Nevermind, although I can’t catch up to you, but my man will definitely do so.”</p>
 <p>“What do you mean your man?! So unpleasant sounding, next time don’t speak about such things like that.” Shangguan Xue’er furrowed her brow once more.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er said happily: “Why not, even you have agreed, so he is now my man.”</p>
