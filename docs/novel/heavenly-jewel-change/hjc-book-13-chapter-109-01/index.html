 <p><b>Chapter 109 Joy and Fortune, Shock and Tragedy! (1)</b></p>
 <p>As time passed day by day, the three Masters grew even busier since the day Zhou Weiqing and Lin TianAo arrived.</p>
 <p>After that day, Lin TianAo returned back to the inn to rejoin the rest of the Battle Team. After discussion with Zhou Weiqing, the Fei Li Battle Team decided to stay in the Heavenly Jewel Island until they could all collect their scrolls and leave. With the three Masters working together, it was estimated that it would barely take a month to complete all their Scrolls. After all, even though Zhou Weiqing’s Legendary Set was not easy to create, he only needed a single Scroll per Equipment.</p>
 <p>They had already been away for such a long time, and Zhou Weiqing wanted to get back to the Fei Li Empire as soon as possible. Although Bing’er could not leave anytime soon, he still had many things to do in the Fei Li Military Academy. Feelings and relationships were very important, but the goal in his heart had never wavered as well - to help the Heavenly Bow Empire grow strong.</p>
 <p>As such, after much thought, Zhou Weiqing had decided to give up attempting to gain extra Legendary Set pieces from the three Masters, telling them the secret that he only required one Scroll to successfully Consolidate Equipment.</p>
 <p>The three Masters had treated him very well, and Zhou Weiqing’s honesty let their impression of him grow even more favourable.</p>
 <p>As such, in the next thirty seven days after Lin TianAo returned to the inn, Zhou Weiqing did not leave the laboratory hall. He spent every single day together with the three Masters; although his Consolidating Equipment Master skill was not sufficient to help the three Masters, he could still be a minor assistant.</p>
 <p>With the prowess of the Three Masters at creating Consolidating Equipment, it caused a deep and lasting impression and influence on Zhou Weiqing. Although the three Masters could not take him as disciple, they were not stingy in teaching this young man with the utmost suitable talents in the field of Consolidating Equipment Masters, and had a good character to boot. Of course, this was also because they knew that Zhou Weiqing was the future son in law of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, and the Heaven’s Expanse Palace had agreed to let him watch them, otherwise Zhou Weiqing might not have learned anything so easily.</p>
 <p>Three days after Zhou Weiqing started his closed door training with the three Masters, Little Witch left. Her mission had been fulfilled, and she needed to return to the Heavenly Demon Sect as soon as possible in case any trouble occurred. After all, her true identity was easily discovered.</p>
 <p>As for the others, they naturally were in no hurry to leave. The Heavenly Jewel Island was not only beautiful and with a great atmosphere, great air; more importantly, the Heavenly Energy here was extremely thick and strong. Training here was definitely much faster and more efficient for anyone; this was even more so for those Heavenly Jewel Masters like them who were at a lower cultivation level.</p>
 <p>With Shangguan Longyin’s promise, their food and lodging were all free, and the rest of the team, led by Lin TianAo, settled down quietly to wait for Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>This time, attending the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, it could be said that each and every one of the Fei Li Battle Team members had gained massively throughout. Besides the large amount of combat experience and improvement in cultivation level or the money they had won betting, just the two Zong Stage Consolidating Equipment Scrolls they had gained alone more than enough to put a huge grin on their faces. Besides the one that Zhou Weiqing had given them, each member of the Champion Battle Team had gotten another set of Zong Stage Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, and they could just pick one out from the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion.</p>
 <p>As soon as their cultivation levels reached the sufficient requirement, the entire power level of the whole Fei Li Battle Team would rise up to a whole new level.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>37 days later.</p>
 <p>When a disheveled and unkempt Zhou Weiqing returned to the inn where the Fei Li Battle Team members were staying, his appearance was just too shocking. Crow couldn’t recognize him on first sight and almost kicked him out of the inn.</p>
 <p>It took almost two hours of cleaning and grooming before Zhou Weiqing finally resumed his original appearance.</p>
 <p>“Weiqing, don’t tell me that in the last thirty seven days you have not bathed at all?!” Drunken Bao looked at the freshly cleaned Zhou Weiqing, whose skin was clearly paler from more than a month of not seeing the sun, and said helplessly.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing gave a bitter smile and said: “Just a simple cleaning, yes, but there were just too many things to do every day, so many things to learn, there was just no time for me to properly wash up! When the Masters are creating the Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, every step of the way, every little move has such deep meaning behind it. This opportunity is such a rare chance for me, and perhaps I will never get to experience anything like it in the future. So… even if I can’t learn everything, I will just have to memorize everything I possibly can. Heh, when I become a powerful Consolidating Equipment Master in the future, you guys won’t have to worry about your Consolidating Equipment Scrolls anymore!”</p>
 <p>As he said that, Zhou Weiqing took out four simple black boxes from his Spatial Realm, and handed it to Lin TianAo.</p>
 <p>Instantly, Lin TianAo’s gaze turned searing hot. Without question, the four boxes contained the four future Consolidating Equipment Shields for his Assembly Set, including one God Tier Stage one!</p>
 <p>Silently keeping the four boxes into his Spatial Realm, the heat in Lin TianAo’s eyes slowly faded away, to be replaced by a resolute determination.</p>
 <p>Sweeping his gaze across the other members of the Fei Li Battle Team, Lin TianAo suddenly said slowly and solemnly: “I have something to proclaim to all of you…”</p>
 <p>Hearing his words, Zhou Weiqing seemed to understand something. He did not speak, instead sitting down silently to the side. The other member’s eyes turned to focus on Lin TianAo.</p>
 <p>Drawing a deep breath, Lin TianAo continued: “This year’s Heavenly Jewel Tournament is finally over, and this is also the final step in my journey in the Heavenly Jewel Academy. From today onwards, I have graduated, and am a free man, and I will no longer be your team leader anymore. When we return to the Fei Li Empire, I will not return to the Academy anymore. My deepest gratitude to all of you for accompanying me on this final journey of mine in my studying years, and to give it a perfect ending.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan, normally of few words, couldn’t help but ask: “Big bro, you aren’t returning to the Academy? Where are you going then? This is also my graduation… Where are you going, I will follow you…”</p>
 <p>Lin TianAo looked at Zhou Weiqing, then turned back to the rest, saying: “At this point, there is no need for me to hide anything from the rest of you any longer. In truth, before we began the journey to the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, I had already become Weiqing’s Lifetime Follower. However, he was kind enough to give me this three months of my own time to come join this Heavenly Jewel Tournament.”</p>
 <p>“What?!” Besides Zhou Weiqing, a surprised chorus burst forth from everyone’s mouths.</p>
 <p>The most shocked was definitely Ye Paopao. He had seen Lin TianAo’s power with his own eyes. Perhaps in this Heavenly Jewel Tournament, Lin TianAo’s showing had not been the most dazzling or eye catching, but it was without a doubt that in the entire Fei Li Empire’s younger generation, no one could compete with him. It was clear that Lin TianAo would definitely be a powerhouse in his own right in the future, an unbelievably strong ultimate defense Heavenly Jewel Master.</p>
 <p>Someone like this was an immense aid to anyone, as a partner or Follower. Instantly, an influx of emotions swamped Ye Paopao, envy, jealousy...</p>
 <p>Lin TianAo smiled faintly, but there was no bitterness in it at all. He began to tell the story of how he had met Zhou Weiqing, of how he had witnessed Zhou Weiqing betting with Yun Li, and how he had tried to seize the opportunity to bet with the two of them… all of it in a relative summary.</p>
 <p>“........... Greed caused me to lose my freedom, but there is no such thing was ‘Regret Medicine’ in this world. A loss is a loss, and I am willing to own up to it. However, at that time, for the sake of this final Heavenly Jewel Tournament, I asked Weiqing for a three month break, and he agreed. At that time, all I thought was that no matter what, I just wanted to put in my all for this Tournament before thinking about the future. Besides this Heavenly Jewel Tournament, my future seemed totally bleak.”</p>
 <p>“However, who knew that Weiqing would be like a nightmare following me, ending up as my teammate to join this Heavenly Jewel Tournament. At first, I was rather unhappy and unconvinced deep in my heart, feeling like I had lost in such an unjust fashion. However, as time passed, and we fought battle after battle together… I’m sure all of you have seen what Weiqing has done throughout, and there is no need for me to say anything further. In any case, in terms of cultivation level, he is perhaps the lowest amongst us, but I dare say that in terms of overall power… he is the strongest.”</p>
 <p>“More importantly, after interacting with him for these few months, I have truly gotten to know Weiqing. His intelligence, wit, decisive resolution, bravery, unswerving will, his strength and talents, yet without arrogance. It is as if I can see his future… and being able to Follow someone like this, a genius Heavenly Jewel Master and Consolidating Equipment Master who I believe can create a miracle in the future, I now feel that I am too lucky.”</p>
 <p>As he spoke up to this point, Lin TianAo abruptly stood up, taking a step forward towards Zhou Weiqing, and went down on one knee. “From today onwards, the Fei Li Battle Team Leader Lin TianAo no longer exists; there is only Zhou Weiqing’s Follower Lin TianAo!”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was taken aback by the sudden kneeling, and he quickly stepped forward to grab Lin TianAo’s arm to pull him up. At this point, the entire room was dead silent.</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan’s eyes were filled with shock, and Drunken Bao and Little Four had their heads bowed low. Crow was also staring at the two of them in a confused loss, while Ye Paopao’s eyes was filled with envy.</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, Xiao Yan also stood up and walked beside Lin TianAo, a faint smile appearing on his face. Facing Lin TianAo, he said: “Leader, do you think you can get rid of me so easily? That’s not possible. Weiqing, do you still want another Temporary Follower?”</p>
 <p>Could there be anything better? How could Zhou Weiqing possibly reject such an outstanding and talented Heavenly Jewel Master like Xiao Yan. Without hesitation, he said: “I do, of course I do!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yan said: “Very good, then I am willing to become your Follower as well. Of course, you must continue improving on your part as well, otherwise if I find that you are no longer worth me Following, I will not hesitate to leave, even if Leader still stands by your side.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said shamelessly: “Following a future Heavenly God Master, you will not regret this!”</p>
 <p>At this point, Drunken Bao also lifted up his head, but the one he looked to was Little Four beside him. “Brother, I am ashamed of ourselves for breaking our own vow. We are all true men, and we can hold ourselves to our own words. Since Leader can do it, how can we not as well? No matter what you chose, I have already made up my mind. Weiqing, I also want to be your Lifetime Follower… not just because of Leader, but also because I have already lost to you a long time back. Give me a Seal.”</p>
 <p>As he said that, he too stood up resolutely and walked in front of Zhou Weiqing, going down on one knee.</p>
 <p>Little Four stood up as well as cried out angrily: “Damn! Do you think I’m not a man of my word?! Weiqing, I too will keep my promise. Come on!”</p>
