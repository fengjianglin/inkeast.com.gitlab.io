 <p><b>Chapter 20 The One Deciding Arrow (2)</b></p>
 <p>Three Wind Blades flew out, viciously cutting into one of the Four-Jewelled Physical Jewel Master who was unable to move; Shangguan Bing'er’s Wind Blades had already evolved once since she had gotten her second pair of Heavenly Jewels, and as she sent the three Wind Blades slicing in at the same time targeting the enemy’s frail neck, the result could be imagined. That Low Level Zun Physical Master’s head was instantly cut off. At the same time, her Purple Dawn Bow also moved swiftly as she shot out a Silent Tracking Arrow without hesitation, slamming right into the forehead of the other Four-Jewelled Low Level Zun Physical Jewel Master, piercing right through his brain. It looked like he wouldn’t live much longer as well.</p>
 <p>This was the true fearful power of a Control Skill, especially when taken by surprise, when the body was instantaneously controlled, they could only take any incoming attacks passively. Although Shangguan Bing'er was only a Mid Level Heavenly Shi Jewel Master, she was after all still a Heavenly Jewel Master, and her strength was still more than comparable to a Three-Jewelled Ordinary Jewel Master. With her sheer speed, she had seized the opportunity to finish off two of the enemies.</p>
 <p>The fierce explosion had also startled Xiao Ru Se and attracted her attention. Her response was also just as swift, and her Purple Dawn Bow did not idle at all, as she ‘Roll-Called’ [1. If anyone forgot what this means, it’s their lingo to snipe a particular target - seen in Chapter 16.1] the Three-Jewelled Physical Jewel Master who had been knocked unconscious. Under normal circumstances, that Physical Jewel Master might not have feared her arrows, but with him unconscious and unable to circulate his Heavenly Energy, how could he protect his own body?</p>
 <p>In a flash, the situation on the battlefield had reversed, as three out of the thirteen enemy Physical Jewel Masters had perished. More importantly, once the explosively strong arrow had appeared along with the Control Skill with the 12 black tentacles, the courage of those Jewel Masters had also been shaken.</p>
 <p>The Darkness Attribute was already quite rare, let alone one having such a strong supplementary explosive effect.</p>
 <p>“Elemental and Physical Jewel Fusion Technique! It is Zhou Shui Niu! Quick, we have to retreat now!” The Mid Level Zun Physical Jewel Master did not bother about his own dignity, going all out in breaking free from the black tentacles, rolling on the floor and turning to flee.</p>
 <p>Seeing that their leader had fled, the other Jewel Masters naturally turned to flee as well.</p>
 <p>Although they had charged and fought fiercely just a moment ago, these Jewel Masters had also consumed much of their Heavenly Energy during that period. Their original plan had been to flee immediately after taking out Shangguan Bing’er, otherwise, once they were full surrounded by the entire army, they would not be able to escape.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing'er’s face was a mask of frost, and the Purple Dawn Bow in her hands repeatedly shot forth arrows. At this time, without anyone to suppress her, she was able to fully show the superior strength of a Heavenly Jewel Master. Her Silent Tracking Arrow was even stronger than the Silent Arrow that had been suppressing her earlier, being a Heavenly Jewel Master coupled with the fact that her arrow had the ‘Tracking’ ability. When she was shooting at those Three-Jewelled Physical Jewel Masters, her firing rate was just too fast for the opponent to resist, even if they were able to survive the arrows, their speed in escaping was greatly reduced in doing so. By the time these enemies had escaped the tight encirclement, less than half had managed to do so, as only the five strongest enemies had managed to do so. Of the remaining, two had been captured and the rest had been finished off by Shangguan Bing'er’s Silent Tracking Arrows.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing'er did not give pursuit, standing there panting for breath, her beautiful eye full of vigilance. Dozens of Heavy Infantry Troops surrounded her, their shields raised up high in order to protect her.</p>
 <p>That fight could be said to be the most difficult fight that Shangguan Bing'er had ever experienced since birth, and she had barely managed to survive. If not for that sudden arrow striking the strongest member of the enemy party, the Mid Level Zun Physical Jewel Master, and also Controlling the other 12 enemies, which allowed the two girls to instantly make a counter attack and kill three enemies instantaneous, perhaps the result of the entire fight would be completely different. Not only would she die, all of the enemy Physical Jewel Masters would probably have escaped unharmed.</p>
 <p>Was it Marshal Zhou? That should be impossible! As the the battle situation at the border area was temporarily stable, Marshal Zhou had been recalled back to the Capital City to report on the activities, and should not be returning to the front lines in the near future. Yet, that formidable arrow just now, that was obviously a Dark Attribute based Elemental and Physical Jewel Fusion Technique. Wait. Could it be him?</p>
 <p>In this moment, Xiao Ru Se walked over, her delicate eyebrows furrowed tightly as she arrived beside Shangguan Bing'er, saying: “Battalion Commander, are you alright?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing'er shook her head, saying: “I’m fine, I just used up too much Heavenly Energy. Thank you, Company Leader Xiao. If not for your instructions, our troops would have suffered much more damage. I might also…”</p>
 <p>Xiao Ru Se said: “You shouldn’t thank me, but Little Fatty instead. You know...”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing'er froze in place: “Is it really him? Where is he?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Ru Se said: “How would I know? Our losses this time are not low, but, we can also consider this to be quite a great achievement and merit. I will let everyone check out our casualty numbers and treat the wounded.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing'er sighed lightly: “I’m sorry. I really am not a qualified Commander.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Ru Se said lightly: “You were the focus of the enemy, how could you have found the opportunity to instruct the troops. Furthermore, you are truly an outstanding Heavenly Jewel Master. Anyway, let’s rush to the military camp first.” Ever since she knew about Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing'er’s relations, her attitude towards Shangguan Bing'er’s had noticeably improved. After all, ‘Fertiliser and Water should not be irrigated to an outsider’s fields’ [2. Direct translation of 肥水不落外人田, basically meaning good things should be left to their inner circle / not be allowed to fall into outsiders’ hands], she considered Shangguan Bing'er’s as her future little sister-in-law. Of course, occasionally in Xiao Ru Se heart, there was also a little sour feeling.</p>
 <p>At this time, Zhou Weiqing appeared from amongst the surrounding soldiers. When he saw that Shangguan Bing'er was all right, he gave a big sigh of relief.</p>
 <p>That amazing arrow earlier was naturally shot forth by him a moment ago, Earlier, when he had managed to suppress that Master and servant pair with his Overlord Bow, he had originally wanted to pursue and finish them off. However, before he did so, he suddenly felt an inexplicable feeling of intense restlessness and fear surge forth in his heart, and he quickly rushed back to the edge of the woods, just reaching in time to witness Shangguan Bing'er being besieged from all sides. At that critical moment, he could not care about anything else, making use of his Overlord Bow with the Touch of Darkness Skill, his Elemental and Physical Jewel Fusion Technique that had essentially changed the entire course of events singlehandedly in a single, deciding arrow.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing'er looked at Zhou Weiqing with an unusually gentle look, saying in a soft voice: “Thanks.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned, thinking in his heart secretly: <i>What is there to thank. Isn’t it normal to protect my own woman?</i></p>
 <p>Xiao Ru Se raised up her thumb at Zhou Weiqing, such an amazing arrow that was the deciding factor in a fight. It was truly too beautiful.</p>
 <p>Compared with their relaxed situation here, the side of the ambushing enemies was a scene of gloom and sorrow.</p>
 <p>The leader was the youth in white clothing who was shooting forth the Silent Arrows. After escaping from the soldier’s encirclement, the five Physical Jewel Master had met together with this Master and servant pair.</p>
 <p>“Trash, you bunch of trash! So many of you just to take out one little girl with a mere rank of Two Jewels, and yet you still failed.”</p>
 <p>The Mid Level Zun Physical Jewel Master with the twin warhammers said with a bitter smile: “Your highness, much apologies. Please calm down. You also saw for yourself in the distance, that sudden arrow appearing with such overbearing power. We did not have the means to deal with it. I’m afraid that Zhou Shui Niu is nearby, if we did not run at that point, perhaps we would all be totally annihilated.”</p>
 <p>This white clothed youth was in fact the Kalise Emperor’s ninth son, Bai Jiu. He was 25 years old this year, yet he had actually already managed to cultivate up to four Physical Jewels, and was one of the most outstanding princes in the Kalise empire, and was even in charge of governing the Jewel Masters of the Kalise Empire. This time he had personally led a strike team to assassinate Shangguan Bing'er. Alas who knew that all their planning and efforts had came to naught.</p>
