 <p>“Yet another parallel space?” Zhou Weiqing looked at Shangguan Xue’er in surprise.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er nodded and said, “Compared to the Luster Spatial Realm, the sidhe’s sealed grounds is much more enormous and very stable. Even a Heavenly God Stage powerhouse would not be able to break into it that easily. After all, the Luster Spatial Realm was merely created by a few Great Dragons working collectively, but the sidhe’s sealed grounds were formed via the strength and power of the entire race. Furthermore they used the sidhe’s Tree of Life as its core. So long as the Tree of Life is not destroyed, the sealed grounds will continue to exist. Additionally, they gained one more advantage from creating the sealed grounds. Because it’s in another dimension and the area is very limited, the natural elemental aura that is emitted by the Tree of Life is confined to a specific area. The entire space would then absorb the atmospheric energy of the Boundless Mainland, constantly churning out pure natural energy within it. Hence, the sidhe could reap a lot of benefits by cultivating there. It also increased their reproductivity.”</p>
 <p>After hearing Shangguan Xue’er’s words, Zhou Weiqing finally had a rough idea about the sealed grounds.</p>
 <p>“So how are we going to enter the sealed grounds?” asked Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er replied, “It is very difficult to enter it, and impossible to break in by force. You need to rely on the guidance of the natural elements in order to enter. Heaven’s Expanse Palace holds the Heart of Nature, bestowed to us by the sidhe. By using that treasure, we are able to enter the sealed grounds as we please. However, we don’t have access to it, so we’ll just have to play it by the ear and hope for the best once when we get there. Weiqing, you have to remember, do not use your cultivation base to barge into the sealed grounds. If you do that, sidhe will regard you as their mortal enemy.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was rather depressed, “In other words, just entering the sealed grounds will be a problem, let alone getting the blood of the Sidhe Queen.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er said rather resignedly, “From the start, I felt that our mission this time would be hopeless. You have almost no chance of getting the blood of the Sidhe Queen.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing chuckled, “Xue’er, why not let’s make a bet? If I succeed, why don’t you…ahem. &nbsp; You know.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er glared at him and said, “No.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing stared blankly for a brief second and asked, “Why not?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er answered plainly, “Firstly, I know your personality very well - even though I don’t believe you will succeed, given your personality you will not make a bet unless you are confident of winning. There were already several people who fell into your trap. Didn’t Lin TianAo lose to you in a similar fashion? He’s still busy working for you to this very day. Secondly, you have nothing I want.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing had a helpless look on his face. “Nonsense. I have myself! If you win, you can have my body!”</p>
 <p>Tian’er interrupted, “Sisters, shall we kick this shameless bastard down? Who’s with me?”</p>
 <p>Five small hands were raised at almost the same time. Thereafter, Zhou Weiqing was greeted by five legs, one of which belonged to Wu Yuehan, who he was carrying with him.</p>
 <p>With Zhou Weiqing around to liven things up, their journey to the Amber Empire was not dull at all. Additionally, even though it was five people flying, in reality, the women were almost entirely relying on Zhou Weiqing’s strength to fly.</p>
 <p>They did not know how fast they were flying at, but with the presence of Zhou Weiqing’s Astral Saint Energy, they did not feel the impact of external forces going against them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Traveling from Heavenly Bow Empire to the border of the Amber Empire and Mi Ou Empire was essentially traveling from the west of the Mainland to the east. In other words, they were crossing the entire Mainland! One could well imagine the distance they had to cover. Zhou Weiqing had to take care of the women, aiding them in their flight, hence it would require seven full days for them to get to their destination despite his level of cultivation.</p>
 <p>At a distance far from them, an enormous dense forest appeared in their sight. It seemed boundless. Above it, the aura of life could be felt in abundance.</p>
 <p>The person who sensed it the strongest was Little Witch. She had the Life Attribute within her body, her face couldn’t help but display how intoxicated she was by the amount of life aura she sensed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed, “The sidhe really know how to pick the right location. They built their their sealed grounds within this dense forest, allowing themselves to absorb a huge amount of life energy. Xue’er, where’s the entrance?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er replied helplessly, “Somewhere within this huge forest. It could be anywhere. This is exactly why I told you that it is very difficult for us to find entrance.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was shocked, “You’re saying that the entrance to the sealed grounds changes every now and then?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er nodded, “Yes, indeed. If we had the guidance from the Heart of Nature, we would be able to find it easily. When we enter, we normally need its Nature Energy to engulf our bodies in order to step within the sealed grounds.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s brows furrowed. He suddenly smiled and said, “I understand, Xue’er. When you talked about entering by force, you were talking about completely destroying this forest, right? If that was the case, the entrance would naturally be revealed. Based on my cultivation base, entering by force is not a big deal.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er hurriedly said, “Weiqing, you must not. If you do that, we will become their mortal enemies.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed, “Don’t worry, alright? I will keep my promise. Let me try to locate where the entrance is.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing slowly closed his eyes, and tried to sense the surroundings, sweeping through the forest with his will.</p>
 <p>The five women who were hovering next to him could clearly see that Zhou Weiqing’s body had immediately become surrounded by a bright reddish golden glow - his clothes could not cover the light rays emitting from his body.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Circles of reddish golden light halos were continuously being emitted from his head, heading in the direction of the enormous forest.</p>
 <p>This was the marvel of Saint Energy.</p>
 <p>Generally speaking, Heavenly Energy of any Attribute could at most could refine one’s spirit energy, which would then develop into one’s will, which could only be boosted via advancing one’s cultivation base.</p>
 <p>However, Saint Energy was different. The Saint Energy could completely merge with one’s will and become a part of it, boosting it further. With the help of the Nebula Saint Energy, Zhou Weiqing’s will expanded extremely fast. The most remarkable thing was that the consciousness that was supported by Nebula Saint Energy would directly absorb the atmospheric energy from the air to strengthen itself, allowing the area it covered to be wider.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>An ordinary Heavenly Emperor powerhouse might be able to sense energy ripples within a radius of ten miles, but Zhou Weiqing could increase this range more than tenfold by relying on his Nebula Saint Energy.</p>
 <p>The vast forest was huge, but it was not truly boundless. As long as Zhou Weiqing continued to scan the forest by constantly changing his position, it would not take long before he located it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er looked at Zhou Weiqing in shock. Without a doubt, Zhou Weiqing knew very little about the sidhe’s sealed grounds; everything he knew, he had learned from her. The method he engaged in was not only simple but also quite clumsy as well. It would have also been futile for other Heavenly Emperors, as the entrance of the sealed grounds teleported at random within a short period of time. It was simply too difficult to locate the entrance of the sealed grounds using his will.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, the area which Zhou Weiqing’s will was able to cover could be described as “frightening”. Under these circumstances, a stupid method as such would become quite effective instead.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing carried the five women with him as he was sweeping through with his will. Before fifteen minutes had passed, Zhou Weiqing suddenly smiled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Found it.”</p>
 <p>After he said that, Zhou Weiqing abruptly opened his eyes and gestured with his right hand. A light band that was made from Nebula Saint Energy engulfed all six of them within it. Immediately after, their bodies zoomed towards a certain direction at a higher speed, moving like meteorites.</p>
 <p>Previously during their journey, Zhou Weiqing and the five ladies had been cruising at a stable speed, talking and laughing along the way. The ladies hadn’t felt as though they were moving particularly fast, but now when Zhou Weiqing increased his speed with all his might, they could sense the difference in power between themselves and him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The surrounding air became distorted in an instant. They had arrived at another place within a few breaths.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>What kind of speed was this? It was practically on par with Spatial Shuttle, fast to the point where the air itself became distorted.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing had already descended to the ground with the five women. Not far from them was a huge tree which Zhou Weiqing’s gaze was focused on. This tree was so gigantic, several people would have to link arms if they wanted to form a ring around it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With the exception of Little Witch, the other four women had already advanced to the Heavenly King Stage - their perceptivity was naturally rather strong, even aside from the fact that they had Saint Energy within their bodies. They followed Zhou Weiqing’s gaze and immediately discovered the special tree.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At first glance, it was only an ordinary albeit ancient tree within the forest. However, upon further inspection, the space surrounding the tree was slightly distorted. It was entirely created via the condensation of life energy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The ancient tree seemed to have sensed the scrutiny of the people. As though it had a mind of its own, a silver light flashed and it disappeared into thin air.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You wanna escape?” Zhou Weiqing smirked. In the next moment, the silver light flashed once again, engulfing him and the five women in it. As the light was flashing, they appeared at another place.</p>
 <p>It was a collective Blink Skill. The more crucial part was that, after the Blink Skill was completed, the ancient tree was still before their eyes.</p>
