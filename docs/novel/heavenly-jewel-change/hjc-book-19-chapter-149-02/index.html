 <p><b>Chapter 149 God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master Joins! (2)</b></p>
 <p>He paused for a moment, then raised his voice, saying: “Now, I will proclaim a new rule. Everyone listen carefully. From now on, without my orders, no one is allowed to leave our Peerless Battalion camp site, otherwise they will be punished accordingly. However, if anyone comes to our territory to cause trouble, no matter who it is, just beat them up. If you lose, you will be throwing our Peerless Battalion faces, and you better just go look for Trainer Shangguan to receive your punishment. Alright, now, go set up camp, and once it's done we shall drink.”</p>
 <p>Once they heard about drinking, cheers erupted, and the fatigue fled from the entire Peerless Battalion as everyone quickly burst into motion to clear the camp and started pitching tents. As for the rubbish, once they had collected it, they were not biased at all, throwing half each to the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Regiment.</p>
 <p>Long Shiya looked on with a strange expression on his face before he turned to Zhou Weiqing and said: “Little Fatty, your army troop is allowed to drink wine?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Heh heh, my Peerless Battalion is very different from any ordinary army troop, and the way we control and teach them is very different as well. Master, let me first arrange for the two best tents for you and Senior Uncle to rest.”</p>
 <p>Long Shiya grinned as well and said: “Let Old Duan rest, why would Your Father, I, need to rest! I also want to go drink! Oh right, arrange for someone to get me a set of army uniform as well, otherwise I might stand out too much.”</p>
 <p>“Master, that isn’t too good right?” Zhou Weiqing said in surprise.</p>
 <p>Long Shiya smiled and said: “No problem, do I still care about such trivial things? Drinking with some soldiers, isn’t that quite an interesting experience.”</p>
 <p>Long Shiya’s size was impressive indeed, and even the largest sized army uniform was still tight on him, and the length of the sleeves and trousers had to be cut slightly to fit him.</p>
 <p>Fine wine was perhaps one of the greatest attraction to these Peerless Battalion soldiers, who had not tasted wine in so many years, and in their fervor the camp was quickly settled in about an hour. Soon after, jars of fine wine was cracked open, and the strong fragrance of wine spread through the entire Peerless Battalion.</p>
 <p>Although Zhou Weiqing had indeed prepared a large quantity of wine, he still gave the order that one jar was to be shared between three to four people, with an equal sharing, and nobody was to drink too much. After all, after so many years of not drinking, it would not do if anyone got alcohol poisoning.</p>
 <p>“Fei’er, Fei’er, let’s go drink as well!” Zhou Weiqing quickly turned to Shangguan Fei’er, who wasn’t far off from him.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er rolled her eyes and said: “Why must I drink with you?” Although she said that, she still walked to Zhou Weiqing’s side. The soldiers nearby who witnessed this hid their smiles; in their eyes their Battalion Commander and Head Drill Master (Mistress) was already a matching pair.</p>
 <p>As Shangguan Fei’er walked up to him, Zhou Weiqing boldly grabbed her hands and dragged her into his tent.</p>
 <p>The tent was as simply decorated as previously, and there were four simple meat dishes on the table. Zhou Weiqing pulled her along to the table to take a seat, but still did not let go of her hand.</p>
 <p>“What are you doing?” Shangguan Fei’er could clearly feel her face burning as she struggled slightly, trying to draw back her hand.</p>
 <p>However, in terms of strength, she was naturally not Zhou Weiqing’s match, and she was unable to do so.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing did not make a sound, just staring at her directly, his expression a mixture of dazed wonder and befuddlement as his heated gaze fixed on her, causing her to be in a fluster.</p>
 <p>“You… are you thinking of Bing’er when you look at me?” Shangguan Fei’er lowered her head, not willing to look at him directly.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing started momentarily, but after a while he nodded slightly. “A little, I miss Bing’er.” Shangguan Bing’er was his first and greatest love, her gentle demure bearing always soothing to him.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er’s eyes dulled slightly, though her lowered head would not allow Zhou Weiqing to see this.</p>
 <p>“Fei’er, let’s not run away from the truth anymore. I like you a lot, and have long since fallen in love with you.” Right at that moment, the startling words rang out in Shangguan Fei’er’s ears.</p>
 <p>“Ahh?” Shangguan Fei’er lifted up her head in surprise.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing looked deeply in her eyes. “Liking someone is a slight love, love is a deep liking. At that time, when I was in severe danger, you endured all that pain and suffering and yet was unwilling to let go of me, no matter whether or not it meant your death. In that instant, I fell for you with all my heart. I know that I am an asshole, falling for so many, but if I give up on you, I know I will not be happy for the rest of my life. I will not allow such a thing to happen. Fei’er, I love you, and I will always be like now, holding on to you and not letting you escape.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er did not expect that Zhou Weiqing would profess his love at such a moment, and she did not have any preparation in her heart at all. Looking at him, the normally eccentric Little Demon Girl of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace was suddenly just like any ordinary girl, her heart racing as she bit lightly on her lower lip.</p>
 <p>“But… you already have Bing’er. If it were any other person, I would beat her away… but definitely not Bing’er. We have lost her for so many years, and we finally found her… how could I possibly steal her man?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing sighed and gave a bitter smile. “In truth, I have a bigger headache than you… that is the price of being a person with so many loves[1. Rather awkward I know, the direct translation would be ‘player’ I guess, but he isn’t actually one in that regards imo]. However, no matter what, I will not let go of any of you so easily, definitely not; otherwise I will regret it for life. I know, I am very greedy, but no matter what, no matter how you all look at me for that, even if I have to bind you to me, I won’t let any of you leave… I am originally a rogue, a scoundrel, so no matter how shameless I have to be, you all won’t get rid of me so easily.”</p>
 <p>As he said that, Zhou Weiqing tugged on her hand suddenly, enveloping her in his embrace tightly, his emotions in flux as well.</p>
 <p>“Fei’er, do you know? When I saw you die right in front of my eyes, in that moment my heart almost died at the same time. If that time I had not been able to revive you, I would have followed you into death. Please do not leave me… truly… I do love Bing’er deeply, perhaps the most, but I do love you the same. All the difficulties, the responsibilities, please let me shoulder them all. As long as you do not leave me… okay?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er could clearly sense the heat emanating from Zhou Weiqing’s body, and more so, the fiery hot core within his heart. She was unable to speak… although logic told her that if the two of them were to try to be together, they would have to face untold difficulties and trials, but at this moment, she truly could not bring herself to refuse him. After all, in her heart, he had already imprinted himself deeply, almost irreplaceably.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er nodded slightly, her beautiful countenance as red as a fresh apple, as if able to squeeze the juice from it.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was unable to hold back any further, and his hot lips sought her quivering red luscious ones in a deep kiss.</p>
 <p>These few months, he had been in deep closed door cultivation, training with all his might in the Six Ultimate Skill Manipulation Arts, his heart had not been at peace, constantly thinking about him and Shangguan Fei’er. The worries that she had… naturally he had thought of them as well. He had also tried his best to make himself forget her; after all nothing had actually happened yet between the two of them. However, Zhou Weiqing found that he could not do it. Shangguan Fei’er being willing to die for his sake… that image had been seared into his mind and heart, so very vivid. Ever since that time, Shangguan Fei’er’s position in his heart was no lesser than Bing’er or Tian’er any longer, how could he give her up easily?</p>
 <p>Finally, Zhou Weiqing had set his resolve… he would rather have more loves than to be disloyal to his loves and his heart. Even if others would call him a scoundrel, shameless… he would not give up his loves so easily. As such, this scene in front of them had played out due to that decision.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er’s lips started trembling, but that was quickly replaced by the heat. The Little Demon Girl was after all the Little Demon Girl of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, and once she slowly unlocked her heart under Zhou Weiqing’s onslaught, she began to reciprocate crazily. Hadn’t she also been repressing herself all these while? Once the shackles in her heart were unlocked, her suppressed emotions and feelings burst forth, perhaps even greater than Zhou Weiqing’s.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s hands had somehow wandered into her clothing, feeling the soft smooth skin and its slight trembling, it was as if a demon had taken over his heart.</p>
 <p>Outside, cheers, laughter and the sound of talking could be heard, but in the tent, it was just the silence of springtime spreading.</p>
 <p>Just as Zhou Weiqing had carried Shangguan Fei’er and was headed to the bed, all of a sudden, a cold humph rang out.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s senses were extremely acute, and even in such a state immersed in his emotions, that was still true. That abrupt cold humph was just too sudden, as if an explosion in his ears, and both he and Shangguan Fei’er felt as if they were suddenly jolted awake, shuddering.</p>
 <p>Only then did Shangguan Fei’er realised that her hands were also in Zhou Weiqing’s shirt, stroking his chest, while Zhou Weiqing’s hands were even more shameless, holding her by her buttocks, almost slipping into her pants.</p>
 <p>“Who’s there?” Zhou Weiqing shouted angrily. For someone to be interrupted at such a moment, who could be in a good mood?</p>
 <p>There was no response… no sound at all. Both of them stayed in the same position, their Heavenly Energy released as the probed the area for any sign of anything. Zhou Weiqing even unleashed the Touch of Darkness, increasing his senses, spreading out to its maximum forty yard radius. No matter how strong an enemy was, as long as he was in the area, he should technically be discovered by Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>Yet, to their surprise, despite all their efforts, they could not sense anyone in the vicinity.</p>
 <p>The two shared a glance, seeing the shock in each other’s eyes, and naturally knew that the other had also not found any trace of anyone.</p>
 <p>“What’s going on? Did I imagine things?” Zhou Weiqing asked.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er rolled her eyes at him and said exasperatedly: “Do you think we both imagine the same thing at once? There has to be someone… could it be your teacher? Otherwise, how could we not find someone?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing felt the warmth in his hands and grinned, boldly stroking some more as he said: “Who cares about him, let’s continue.”</p>
 <p>“Continue your head!” Shangguan Fei’er’s face was totally red. Previously, she had been lost in her emotions, but now that she had calmed down, with Zhou Weiqing stroking her buttocks, how could a young virgin lass like her take it? The hand on Zhou Weiqing’s chest pushed outwards, and her supple body slid out of Zhou Weiqing’s evil grasp.</p>
