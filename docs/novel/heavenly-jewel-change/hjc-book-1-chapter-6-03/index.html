 <p><strong>Chapter 6 – Tourmaline Sacrifice, Alexandrite Cat’s Eye (3)</strong></p>
 <p>As soon as he started running, Zhou Weiqing quickly realised the change to his body. Compared to the past, it seemed as if his body was ten times lighter, and every step he ran was 5-6 metres. The aches in his body from the previous day’s run was totally gone.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing then remembered the true origin of everything that happened last night, and groaned inwardly: <em>Oh no. </em>He had left the Immortal Deity Technique manual in the tent when he ran out just now.</p>
 <p>The dismay was soon replaced by happiness though, as he thought to himself: <em>Did I master the Immortal Deity Technique? </em>At this point, he had already ran out of the army camp, and ran in a single direction. At the same time, he focused his attention on his Clavicle Acupuncture Point.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing realised that his Clavicle Acupuncture Point seemed to have become like a whirlpool – but it was no longer like yesterday where it was drawing his energy in, but instead it was now drawing it from the world outside; it was truly unique and amazing.</p>
 <p>When he concentrated upon the whirlpool, Zhou Weiqing immediately felt the energy suction power strengthen, and strands of cold energy flowed unstoppably into his body from the environment, finally entering his Dantian. He also quickly realised the other changes in his body.</p>
 <p>When he focused on the Clavicle Acupuncture Point, 3 other Acupuncture Points also gave him a similar feeling.</p>
 <p>First were the the ones on both wrists, although Zhou Weiqing had not fully memorised the whole Immortal Deity Technique, but he had gone through the first few pages many times and remembered clearly that this was the second Death Acupuncture Point in the first section – the Taiyuan Acupuncture Point, which when focused would disrupt the Hundred Meridians, causing internal injury. Taiyuan Acupuncture Points was similar to the Clavicle Acupuncture Points, being a double Point, each on a wrist.</p>
 <p>Besides the Taiyuan Acupuncture Point, there were also the points on the outer knee, the ZhuSanLi Point, and the SanYinJiao on the ankles. These 4 large Death Acupuncture Points were now similar to his Clavicle Acupuncture Points, each having generated a whirlpool which was now constantly drawing energy from the atmosphere.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing knew that this was all the contribution of the black pearl, and it was the one which helped him breakthrough the four Death Acupuncture Points. In one fell swoop, he had almost completed the whole first section of the Immortal Deity Technique, without only one last Point to go. His Heavenly Energy had also shot up to an impressive 4th stage.</p>
 <p>This fellow had rather thick nerves*, a while ago he was still full of regret and pain from hurting Shangguan Bing’er, and now he was full of excitement from the successful cultivation of the Immortal Deity Technique.</p>
 <p><em>*TL: 神经粗壮 – literally translated to thick nerves, it’s a Chinese phrase that is rather difficult to translate to an English meaning. It has connotations of being undiscerning or uncaring or naive to a relatively minor degree, depending on the context used. Can be used in a good or bad sense.</em></p>
 <p><em>Heavenly Energy 4th stage, doesn’t that mean I have Awakened my Power Jewels?</em></p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing quickly realised the implications, and looked down at his wrists. As soon as he did so, he suddenly stopped running, raising his hands in front of him, cackling insanely out loud.</p>
 <p>“Haha! Wahahaha! Heavenly Jewel! I finally have Heavenly Jewels, I’m a Heavenly Jewel Master! Wahaha, now who can say I’m a trash!!” This bout of insane laughter caused him to almost spit out saliva all around. Years of repressed feelings were suddenly released, and he couldn’t help but to express the sheer joy he was feeling.</p>
 <p>On Zhou Weiqing’s right wrist was a white pearl, glittering and translucent, as if it were an ice crystal. There were no impurities at all; it was the pure jade of a Heavenly Jewel Master, but it was different from Shangguan Bing’er’s Dragonstone Jade, and was instead the Icy Jade, which gave him a pure strength boost.</p>
 <p>On his left wrist, was a strange and unique jewel. It was totally dark blue in colour, yet on top there was a bright marking which was glowing in white and seemed to move along when Zhou Weiqing moved his wrists, always ensuring that the white marking was always facing the top. As compared to when Shangguan Bing’er saw the rose-red Cat’s Eye Gem, what Zhou Weiqing saw was a dark blue Cat’s Eye Gem, and within the bright markings there was a trace of grey.</p>
 <p><em>What kind of attribute is this Elemental Jewel? Could it be of the Spatial Attribute?</em> Zhou Weiqing knew that Cat’s Eye gems usually signified the Spatial Attribute, however although he wasn’t as clear as Shangguan Bing’er on the various Jewels, but he also knew that the Cat’s Eye Gems were not usually of this colour. Furthermore, Admiral Zhou was of the darkness attribute; as his son, he should have inherited that attribute, yet why did his turn into this strange Cat’s Eye Gem?</p>
 <p><em>Unfortunately I’m not able to go back and ask Shangguan Bing’er. It looks like my plan to join the army has failed, I better run first. As for Shangguan Bing’er, when I’m stronger in the future, I will find a way to repay and compensate her. After all, I’m also a Heavenly Jewel Master now, who knows maybe next time we can actually be together? Heh heh.</em></p>
 <p>As his thoughts ran along, Zhou Weiqing was suddenly filled with regret – Shangguan Bing’er’s body was so bruised, what had he done to her that would be hated by both man and god! As he scolded himself, he also thought slyly: <em>What a shame, if only I had been awake to experience that….</em></p>
 <p>Just as Zhou Weiqing was about to move off again, he suddenly felt a cold feeling at the back of his neck, and a sharp pain, and his whole body froze on the spot.</p>
 <p>“Little Fatty Zhou, you sullied my body and now you want to run away?” a voice full of anger and hate caused Zhou Weiqing to shudder in fear. He quickly raised his hands in surrender, “I’m not running, I’m definitely not running. Battalion Commander, let’s talk things through, don’t be so fast to take action, let me explain myself!”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er came around from behind Zhou Weiqing, the arrow in her hand pointed at Zhou Weiqing’s throat. Although she was still dishevelled, but her body was now covered by the army uniform that Zhou Weiqing had washed yesterday.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er was after all a Heavenly Jewel Master, and her physique was much stronger than any ordinary human. If an ordinary girl had been abused like she had been yesterday, even if she didn’t die, she would have been bedridden for at least half a month. However, Shangguan Bing’er was boosted by 2 Heavenly Jewels, and after recuperating for a short while, she had restored some Heavenly Energy and was able to move. Seeing that Zhou Weiqing was about to escape, how could she content? She quickly grabbed the clothing left in the tent to cover herself before giving chase.</p>
 <p>When she spotted Zhou Weiqing, that fellow had his hands raised, cackling gleefully to himself, and Shangguan Bing’er had also hesitated a while when she saw his wrists again, which was why she was late to subdue that rascal.</p>
 <p>“Show me your left hand.” Shangguan Bing’er said coldly. Her once beautiful and gentle eyes now had streaks of blood within them, and they were filled with a cold, angry light. If not for the fact that the Jewel on his left hand was so shocking to her, she would probably have stabbed down with the arrow.</p>
