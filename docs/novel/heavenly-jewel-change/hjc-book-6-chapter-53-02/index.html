 <p><b>Chapter 53 Beautiful Lady Principal (2)</b></p>
 <p>“Princess Difuya, how can you say that about him. No matter what, he is still currently your fiance!” Shangguan Bing’er’s voice was rather cold.</p>
 <p>Alas, when Difuya heard the word fiance, she felt a rush of worry in her heart, totally missing the expression on Shangguan Bing’er’s face. After all, this was right in front of Ming Hua! The Prince Charming in her mind’s only younger sister! How could Difuya not be worried about Shangguan Bing’er mentioning the fact about their betrothal in front of Ming Hua.</p>
 <p>“Bing’er Little Sis, you can’t speak nonsense like that… who is his fiancee? That’s just a political betrothal arranged by my father. This time I left home, I never planned on returning. I do not want that betrothal, even if I must marry a pig or a dog, I would not marry him!”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er’s face turned frosty. “Difuya, you’re too much! What’s wrong with Little Fatty, that you must treat him like that?”</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong with him…?” Difuya started a little. For her to actually state out what was wrong with Zhou Weiqing, she was also at a loss momentarily. At that point, she could only say stubbornly: “No matter what, I already have someone else I like. Do not mention that Zhou Weiqing, as useless as he is, even if he were a top genius in the world, I would still not like him…”</p>
 <p>Ming Hua said impatiently: “Enough. You can stop trying to proclaim your love and loyalty in front of me. It’s useless. I know my brother best, and once he has decided on something, he will never change his mind. In any case, I know why he doesn’t want you… you are indeed a fool. In front of someone’s girlfriend, you keep insulting him, I really do not know how to describe a fool like you. Also, there is one thing that you got correct. Indeed, I have never seen a greater talent and genius than that little brat Zhou Weiqing, not even my brother.”</p>
 <p>After saying that, Ming Hua took her papers and left. She had no mood to talk to a foolish girl like Difuya.</p>
 <p>Hearing Ming Hua’s words, Difuya went into shock. Seeing Shangguan Bing’er with a cold look on her face, she said inconceivably: “Bing’er, you… You actually became his girlfriend? Is that for real?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing'er said solemnly: “Why can’t it be for real? I have been together with Little Fatty for two years. Difuya, you may not like him, but it doesn’t mean everyone does not like him.”</p>
 <p>“The Little Fatty, who is useless in your eyes, is an exceptional man in my eyes. I will not speak with you further on this, I am heading to the canteen to wait for him.” As she said that, she headed out.</p>
 <p>“I got it.” Difuya said as if in sudden comprehension. “It must be because of Admiral Zhou, right?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing'er stopped in her tracks, turning back towards Difuya and saying in an icy cold voice: “Your Highness, please do not insult me, and do not insult yourself. From today onwards, we are no longer friends. Also, I hope that you remember every word you said today. I will never let you have Little Fatty…” Though at first she felt ashamed and guilty towards this official fiancee of Zhou Weiqing’s, now Shangguan Bing'er did not feel that anymore. In fact, she even felt that it wasn’t even important to try to dissolve the engagement anymore, as she knew Zhou Weiqing would never like a person like that.</p>
 <p>Of course, Zhou Weiqing did not know what had happened in the classroom, as he was currently walking together with Dean Xiao. As they walked, he said sincerely: “Dean Xiao, thank you so much for everything you did yesterday.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Shi smiled faintly, saying: “You little brat, you are rather well informed! Well, you do not need to thank me, that was all your own capabilities. If you weren’t outstanding, I wouldn’t even have noticed you, let alone protect you…”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was rather surprised at Xiao Shi’s directness. He found that he was growing to like this Dean of Students even more.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing continued asking: “Dean Xiao, why did you look for me?”</p>
 <p>Xiao Shi laughed and said: “It’s not me who is looking for you. It is our Principal who wants to meet such an outstanding and talented young genius like you.”</p>
 <p>Hearing the words genius, Zhou Weiqing thought about the test they had just taken and how he had not known anything. In a rare sight, he flushed red in embarrassment, saying: “I am far from being any genius, I will have to depend on Dean Xiao in the future to take care of me.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Shi said: “If you aren’t considered a genius, then there aren’t any genius in the world. According to your registration records, you still haven’t reached the age of seventeen, and you are already a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master. Not only are you the first Consolidating Equipment Master in our school, you are also the youngest Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master I have ever heard of. Even those who inherit the heritage of famed Consolidating Equipment Masters, they are still mostly Low Level Consolidating Equipment Masters at such an age. We have indeed high hopes for your talent.”</p>
 <p>As they spoke, Xiao Shi led the way up the stairs. The principal’s office was at the fifth level of the main building, which was also the highest level.</p>
 <p><i>Hmm… Principal?</i> Zhou Weiqing’s mind was instantly filled with images of that distinguished and elegant beauty he had seen the other day. She had definitely left an impression on him.</p>
 <p>Very soon, they had reached the fifth level, which was obviously a lot quieter than the rest of the academy. This was the level where all the high ranking members of the academy had their offices.</p>
 <p>Leading Zhou Weiqing to the deepest parts of the level, Xiao Shi finally stopped at a door with a sign portraying the Principal’s Office. With a respectful expression on his face, Xiao Shi knocked softly twice on the door.</p>
 <p>A calm, elegant voice came from within. “Please enter.”</p>
 <p>Only then did Xiao Shi push open the door and enter together with Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>The office was rather large, almost three hundred square metres, and was entirely adorned in a pale yellow look, giving a peaceful yet refined feel. All the furnishing in the room was meticulously designed and well thought out, and right behind a large semi-circular table sat the beautiful lady Principal, Cai Cai.</p>
 <p>Just like yesterday, she was dressed in her unique black teacher robes, her long hair bundled up to her head. She had a small, pleasant smile on her face, and her expression was peaceful and calm, without an imposing aura like one might expect from someone of her position.</p>
 <p>“Principal, I’ve brought Zhou Weiqing before you.” Xiao Shi said to her with a slight bow.</p>
 <p>Cai Cai smiled and inclined her head in greeting: “Thank you Dean Xiao, I have troubled you.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Shi smiled in return and said: “It was no trouble at all, Principal. I shall take my leave now, you can have a good talk with him.” He bowed once again before leaving the room. Before he did so, he gave Zhou Weiqing an encouraging look.</p>
 <p>As Xiao Shi left, he closed the door behind him, and there was only the two of them left in the office. When Zhou Weiqing had seen Cai Cai from afar previously, he had been awestruck by her beauty. Now, to see her at such a close range, he almost felt a little uncomfortable.</p>
 <p>This Principal Cai Cai gave him somewhat of a feeling like a goddess who shouldn’t be sullied, giving forth a natural, untouchable aura. That invisible stress seemed to have a presence in the room itself, and her noble grace seemed inbred into her very bones, making others feel a strange sense of inferiority despite the lack of arrogance.</p>
 <p>According to Kou Rui’s information, this beautiful lady principal was already thirty-five years old. However, just from outward appearance, she looked barely twenty years old. Yet, her aura and presence seemed to be that of a person in power of fifty to sixty years of age. Such a unique combination of presence was more than sufficient to draw the eye of anyone.</p>
 <p>“Student Zhou Weiqing right, please have a seat.” Cai cai pointed to the high backed chair in front of her desk.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing did not hesitate, pulling back the chair and sitting down in it, not really caring about any noble etiquettes. After all, he was a commoner student in the academy… Furthermore, to compare noble etiquettes with this lady, that would be something useless to do.</p>
 <p><i>In front of a beautiful lady, in order to draw attention to yourself, you must either be stronger than her, otherwise the other route is to just be something extremely unique and different. </i>This was Mu En’s teachings to Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>“Greetings, Principal Cai Cai.” Zhou Weiqing said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Cai Cai started a little, even the teachers of the academy did not usually call her by her full name. Furthermore… This youth, Zhou Weiqing, was a lot more mature and stable than she had expected.</p>
 <p>Naturally, what Zhou Weiqing had done at the opening ceremony yesterday was not hidden from her. In fact, every detail of the entire incident was reported to her. In this academy, she held the ultimate authority.</p>
 <p>“Zhou Weiqing, do you know why I asked Dean Xiao to call you here?” She asked passively.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head and said: “No, I do not.”</p>
 <p>Cai Cai said: “I saw your entrance exam, and I heard that General Ming Yu right?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded and said: “Yes, the examiner teacher then did not like my answer, and General Ming Yu passed by and saw it, and he thought it was still okay, and gave me a pretty good score.”</p>
 <p>“Okay? In my view, your answer deserved a zero.” Cai Cai’s voice suddenly turned cold, so much so that Zhou Weiqing felt as if the entire temperature in the room dropped a few degrees.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing started a little. It seems this Principal wasn’t too friendly towards him.</p>
 <p>Cai Cai said solemnly: “In your answer, I saw an unbelievable amount of bloodshed and death, and the suffering of countless citizens. Perhaps, your tactics might be successful, bringing victory. But at what cost? How many will die with you commanding? Every life only has one chance to live here, and no one should have the right to strip them of this right. When someone dies, it also brings suffering to their families. Perhaps you might think it’s a petty kindness, but what I want to tell you is that a commander who does not care about the lives of citizens will never be a true leader, and his army will never be a champion army.”</p>
