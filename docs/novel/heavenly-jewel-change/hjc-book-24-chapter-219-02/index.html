 <p><b>Chapter 219 Shen Little Demon’s Destruction Fire Phoenix! (2)</b></p>
 <p>XiHua sighed gently and said: “Yu Yun only told me one sentence… that Zhou Weiqing is his savior.”</p>
 <p>Butterfly Orchid giggled and said: “Interesting… it looks like today’s fights will be very interesting indeed.”</p>
 <p>XiHua gave a bitter smile and said: “I don’t find it particularly interesting, no matter who we have to face in the top eight, it will not be an easy fight for us.”</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Back in the Heavenly Bow Battle Team Rest House.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing and the others had come early in the morning. In the previous two days, Zhou Weiqing had not bet on anyone. With the influence of the ZhongTian Empire, the betting odds were just too low, and it felt pointless to bet. However, today was different… their fight against the Dan Dun Battle Team was the highlight of today, perhaps even the highlight of the entire preliminary round. It was safe to say that almost every single bettor was betting on their fight, and the Dan Dun Battle Team clearly held the absolute advantage. As such, even the massive bet from the ZhongTian Empire side did not greatly influence the odds too much.</p>
 <p>In the end, Zhou Weiqing placed all of their seventy million gold on themselves. The odds were 1 to 3. To Shangguan Tianxin’s amusement, the way the bets were going, it was almost as if the Royal Family was working together with the Heavenly Bow Battle Team to earn money. After all, they had bet heavily on the Heavenly Bow Battle Team as well.</p>
 <p>Of course, that was not a big influence on the ZhongTian citizens. The majority of the large bets were those officials, merchants or various rich men. Even if the ordinary citizens placed bets, they were extremely limited. Shangguan Tianxin was more than happy to earn from those fellows. The only heartache would be that once the Heavenly Bow Battle Team won, they would be taking away almost two hundred million gold. With such a sum of gold, within the next ten years the Heavenly Bow Empire could spend extremely comfortably.</p>
 <p>However, Shangguan Tianxin could only let it be. A few days ago, he had ascended the Heavenly Jewel Island to speak with his two elder brothers. As such, towards this fight and the bet, Shangguan Tianxin could only treat it as ‘If one doesn’t sacrifice children, they would never catch the wolf’[1. It’s pretty complicated this one - another literal translation. The basic meaning is one has to sacrifice something / pay the price in order to reach their goals. The phrase originates from an old dialect phrase which is actually sacrifice one’s boots to catch the wolves? In that dialect, the word for boot and child is the same, and somehow across time when it was transferred to mandarin, the phrase became the current incarnation, but the overall meaning remains the same], or ‘if one doesn’t sacrifice one’s daughter, they would never catch the scoundrel’........ Indeed, this fellow was truly a scoundrel, otherwise how could he steal the hearts of his three nieces? Everytime he thought about that, as an uncle, he felt vexed and gloomy.</p>
 <p>“Today, it should be time to let me fight first right?” Yun Li was itching to go. It was time to face the Dan Dun Battle Team, and the Heavenly Bow Battle Team members were all filled with fighting spirit.</p>
 <p>However, to Yun Li’s surprise, Zhou Weiqing shook his head. “No, the first fight is not for you. Today, our main goal is not just to win, but to ensure that we do not have any losses or severe injuries, otherwise it will not be worth it. If anything happens to you, how can I account to Little Miss Muddle?”</p>
 <p>Yun Li said exasperatedly: “Who are you preparing to send then?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Heh heh, I will be going first.”</p>
 <p>Hearing those words, the entire team was caught by surprise. Without question, Zhou Weiqing was the strongest in the entire team. Of course, that was a judgement made without knowing Tian’er’s actual combat strength.</p>
 <p>Still, as a team leader, to be the first to fight was already a rare and surprising thing.</p>
 <p>Yun Li furrowed his brow as he said: “You want to learn from that Bai Da Battle Team?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Wait and see how it goes. If we are lucky, we might only need to fight a single tough fight today. Even if we are unlucky, with my arrangement, we should only have two extremely tough fights. Tian’er, are you sure that your body is alright?”</p>
 <p>Tian’er was still satisfied with his concern, smiling as she said: “Do not worry, I will not joke around with our child’s life.” The last line was said very softly, and only Zhou Weiqing could hear it.</p>
 <p>As the sun rose higher in the sky, the sixth day of the tournament finally began officially.</p>
 <p>Without exception, the first round was a quick and simple surrender to the ZhongTian Battle Team, as they became the first official team to advance to the top eight stage.</p>
 <p>At last, it was time for the second fight, the highlight of the day.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Longyin stood up in the VIP Stand. With a single step, he walked into the air, and in another step, he landed on the tournament stage.</p>
 <p>“This upcoming fight will determine which is the final team to advance to the top eight stage. Since this is such an important fight, this old man will personally be the judge for it. Heavenly Bow Battle Team versus Dan Dun Battle Team. Teams, please send out your first fighter.”</p>
 <p>Towards Shangguan Longyin actually taking on the role of judge for this fight, no one had expected it. For the Dan Dun Battle Team, the leading youths’ expressions turned ugly. However, for the Heavenly Bow Battle Team, Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly.</p>
 <p>This was a relatively good favour from the ZhongTian Empire! Why was Shangguan Longyin personally being the judge for this fight? With his cultivation level, he could naturally prevent any unwanted deaths. From any angle, this was of no detriment to the Heavenly Bow Empire.</p>
 <p>Walking out of the Rest House, Zhou Weiqing did not have any intention of seeking popularity by doing anything sensational. On the other side, the first member to represent the Dan Dun Battle Team had already walked out and jumped onto the stage. From her position, she just saw Zhou Weiqing walking up the stage.</p>
 <p>The team member representing the Dan Dun Battle Team was Zhou Weiqing’s old foe, the ex team leader of the last Dan Dun Battle Team, Shen Little Demon.</p>
 <p>When he saw Shen Little Demon, Zhou Weiqing gave a wide grin, as if it was all within his grasp.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing had long guessed that the Dan Dun Battle Team would not underestimate his side. As such, they would definitely send out a powerhouse for the first fight, but not their team leader. As such, he estimated that either Shen Little Demon or the vice leader would be the one in the first fight.</p>
 <p>The facts had proved that Zhou Weiqing was right. This time, the reason he decided to fight first was to take a victory from one of their top few powerhouses.</p>
 <p>In the preliminary stages, besides the 2v2 fights, every member could only fight once. To be able to take down one of the enemy’s powerhouse was definitely something Zhou Weiqing wanted to do.</p>
 <p>Seeing that it was Zhou Weiqing, Shen Little Demon’s eyes lit up with two fiery red gold flames, a powerful fighting spirit rising up in her as her aura burst forth towards Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing totally ignored her aura, as if he could not feel a thing. Laughing heartily, he said: “No need to be so anxious, Lady Shen, or are you afraid?”</p>
 <p>Shen Little Demon glared coldly at Zhou Weiqing, her hands balled in fists as she said solemnly: “Three years ago, the humiliation that you granted me, I will definitely return to you today.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing ignored her instead, turning to Shangguan Longyin, bowing respectfully as he said: “Greetings, Senior Shangguan.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Longyin smiled faintly and said: “No need for such formalities.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing sighed faintly, saying: “Senior Shangguan, looks like I made a terrible mistake in helping someone heal the poison in the previous tournament! This time, if something like that happens again, I apologise in advance for not giving you face. Please do not blame me for that.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Longyin smiled faintly and said: “I owe you one for that.” His words, only Zhou Weiqing could understand, and even Shen Little Demon looked rather confused. Clearly, Shangguan Longyin had already known about how Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er had healed Yu Yun. It was also because of this matter that this ZhongTian Empire Skill Storing Palace Master was so dissatisfied with the Dan Dun Battle Team. In the past, when they had been poisoned, he had helped them get the antidote. However, when he had asked for a favour back, they had refused to heal Yu Yun. This would forever be imprinted deeply in Shangguan Longyin’s memory.</p>
 <p>“Both sides, introduce yourselves.” The procedure of the tournament still had to be followed.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned wickedly at Shen Little Demon, saying: “Heavenly Bow Battle Team, Zhou Weiqing.”</p>
 <p>Shen Little Demon continued glaring at him coldly: “Dan Dun Battle Team, Shen Little Demon.”</p>
 <p>Right at Shangguan Longyin was about to proclaim the start of the fight, Zhou Weiqing suddenly interrupted him. “Senior Shangguan, I have a question I need to clarify before we start the fight.”</p>
 <p>“What is it?” Shangguan Longyin looked at Zhou Weiqing’s serious expression, and his heart twitched inside. When this fellow had that kind of serious, officious expression, it was likely he was trying to scheme against someone. Previously, when they were in the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, facing the Palace Master, he was also like that… in the end… that Immortal Deity Technique of his…...</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “For the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, is there any restrictions on flying? Does it mean as long as we do not leave the zone above the stage, it should be fine?” [2. Not sure if its phrased in an understandable fashion. Basically means he can fly above the stage, but not out of the confines]</p>
 <p>Shangguan Longyin nodded and said: “Exactly.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned widely at Shen Little Demon, revealing a row of perfect white teeth. “Alright, then I have no further questions.”</p>
 <p>Shen Little Demon suddenly had a sinking feeling, but she did not have the chance to think deeply before Shangguan Longyin proclaimed the start of the fight.</p>
 <p>*Fooomp* Golden red flames sprang forth from Shen Little Demon’s body instantly. Her Elemental Jewels were the Light and Fire Attribute, and as soon as she came up, she fused her two attributes into Light Flames. At the same time, she summoned all seven of her Consolidated Equipment, the powerful pressure and temperature of the flames causing the entire stage to become a sea of flames.</p>
 <p>“Three years ago, you couldn’t defeat me. Three years today, how can you possibly defeat me? Surrender now, lest you lose in an ugly fashion later.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing stood there, unmoving, but the burning Light Flames could not get within a radius of three chi from him.</p>
 <p>Shen Little Demon looked at him coldly, the Consolidated Equipment around her had turned the same golden red. She did not conceal her strong killing intent as she said: “Die!”</p>
 <p>The massive Light Flames formed into the shape of a phoenix, swooping crazily at Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>However, in the next instant, she lost sight of Zhou Weiqing totally.</p>
 <p>In a flash of silver, Zhou Weiqing appeared in midair, more than ten metres above ground. It was his Blink Skill. At the same time, his palms pressed downwards, activating the Silver Emperor Lightning Pierce. However, it was not targeted at Shen Little Demon, instead causing his body to pull upwards abruptly, thrown higher into the sky.</p>
