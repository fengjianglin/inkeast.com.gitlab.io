 <p><strong>Chapter 14 Physical Jewel Consolidated Equipment Sets (4)</strong></p>
 <p>After hearing Huyan Aobo’s words, Zhou Weiqing’s eyes both lit up in joy, his heart fiery with passion. When he had first heard of Physical Jewel Consolidating Equipment, he had told Shangguan Bing’er that he had wanted a set of high defense armor to protect his precious life. Now, wasn’t this Consolidating Equipment Set Armor just what he wanted? Now that it was place right before him as an opportunity, how could he possibly not be excited? As he listened to Huyan Aobo’s words, he nodded his head quickly and repeatedly in agreement.</p>
 <p>After Huyan Aobo spoke these words, his eyes revealed a proud light. “If one day, my disciple can have a full set of ten God Level Consolidated Equipment Sets, I will not have lived in vain. Little Fatty, you do not need to care about the Consolidated Equipment Scrolls at all, you just need to practice hard and cultivate with your best efforts. These next two years will be especially important to you, and without creating Consolidating Equipment Scrolls to divert your attention, you must practice wholeheartedly with every possible effort, understood?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said seriously with a very resolute look on his face: “Teacher, you can rest assured that I will try extremely hard even if you did not ask me to.” For the sake of this formidable Consolidated Equipment Set to protect his life, he will definitely not be lazy.</p>
 <p>When humans are alive, as long as they have a goal to work towards, they will not feel empty and lost. It is definitely necessary to have a goal in order to be competitive and to have the zest to work. This was definitely the situation for Zhou Weiqing. Although he was an intelligent person who liked to do things in the easiest way possible, he was not really a lazy person. This was especially so after the door to the world of Heavenly Jewel Masters had been opened for him, bringing him to a whole new mysterious world. which made him yearn for strength and to become formidable.</p>
 <p>Huyan Aobo took down the silver light shield protecting the room, and Feng Yu also released his Consolidated Equipment Set, smiling faintly as he said: “You can go cultivate in that side room while waiting. A servant will bring you food and drinks later, and the bathroom is at the west corner. After that little girl has completed her Consolidated Equipment, you both can leave together. If you need to go out for any reason, just let me or your teacher know first.”</p>
 <p>“Many thanks, Feng Yu Senior. Teacher, I’ll go first then.” As he said that, Zhou Weiqing turned and walked out. As he reached the entrance, he suddenly stopped and turned his head, smiling at Huyan Aobo before saying: “Teacher, I think that you really should lose weight.” After he spoke those words, he did not wait for Huyan Aobo to react and he turned around and ran off quickly.</p>
 <p>Huyan Aobo took a look at his round belly, while Feng Yu couldn’t help but burst out laughing.</p>
 <p>Huyan Aobo shook his head helplessly, “That funny little brat, I will be irritated to death by him sooner or later.”</p>
 <p>Feng Yu Wei said with a smile: “Isn’t it good that he has such a personality? Luckily, this child was born in the Heavenly Bow Empire, if he were born in the Fei Li Empire, how could you possibly have the chance to receive him as a disciple?”</p>
 <p>Huyan Aobo said with a smile: “This is called ‘A person with luck need not worry’. I had thought that this would be it for my achievements in this life, I never really expected that heaven would actually give me such a huge gift. Feng Yu Old Man, when do you plan to bring my treasured disciple to go Skill-Storing?”</p>
 <p>Feng Yu shook his head and said: “I think we should not let him go through Skill-Storing for now at least.”</p>
 <p>Huyan Aobo started in surprise, saying: “Why?”</p>
 <p>Feng Yu said: “With that kid’s lively personality, if he went through Skill-Storing on his Alexandrite Cat’s Eye, it will be very difficult to guarantee that he will not use it, and that would increase the chance of his Elemental Jewel being found out, which would be very bad. We might as well waits for two years before we decide. At that time, his second set of Heavenly Jewels should be close to cultivated, if not already. After he has 2 sets of Heavenly Jewels, we can go through the Skill-Storing all at once, by that time he can easily protect himself against simple opponents.”</p>
 <p>Huyan Aobo thought about it and nodded, saying: “That makes sense. This child came in bearing a longbow on his back, and he is also an archer in the army. That is quite a good choice for him actually. The Alexandrite Cat’s Eye is more than three attributes, I forgot to ask earlier what are his other attributes.”</p>
 <p>Feng Yu said with a smile: “It’s ok, it’s best that we do not ask for now. Too much excitement within a day is not good for the body. Little Fatty Zhou this little kid, is really an interesting fellow.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing did not return to the room where he went through the Physical Jewel Consolidating Equipment, but instead went directly to outside Shangguan Bing’er’s room, and lifted his hand to knock on the door, calling out: “Wife, how was your Consolidating Equipment?” Since Feng Yu had said that they could only go through Consolidating Equipment once a day, he thought that Shangguan Bing’er would probably be finished by now, regardless of whether she succeeded or not.</p>
 <p>As he had guessed, the door opened, and the angry and embarrassed Shangguan Bing’er appeared before Zhou Weiqing, saying in a low tone: “Who is your wife?! Come in!” She seized him by the ear, dragging him into the room.</p>
 <p>“Aiyo, that hurts! Wife, are you trying to murder your husband? That is a serious crime!” Zhou Weiqing, even while he was in pain, did not forget to take advantage with his mouth first.</p>
 <p>“You still dare to say?” Shangguan Bing’er’s fingers who were holding his ear twisted in a 90 degree motion, instantly causing Zhou Weiqing to shout out in pain again and again, shouting out that he dared not already, before Shangguan Bing’er finally let go.</p>
 <p>This room was exactly the same as the one that Zhou Weiqing had been in, completely empty of any furnishing. Zhou Weiqing looked at the wooden box on the ground and asked, “Wife, err… no, Battalion Commander, how did your Consolidating Equipment go?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er’s expression turned slightly better, “I have already gone through the Consolidating Equipment of today, and was cultivating to restore my Heavenly Energy. I did have some experience and understanding after today’s try. You must repeatedly feel and try to understand the energy contained within the Scroll when you go through Consolidating Equipment, when you just start, failure is inevitable, but once we deepen our understandings, we can succeed quickly.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned as he shrugged, saying: “But, I have already succeeded!”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er said exasperatedly: “Do not blow hot air*. You being shameless is one thing, but I really hate people who just talk big without results.”</p>
 <p><em>*TL – 吹牛 literally translates to ‘Blow Cow’, means to boast and brag about something that they did not do – the reason why I wrote the literal translation here is because he makes a pun about it in the next paragraph which is impossible to translate properly so I’ll just do it literally.</em></p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said with an innocent expression: “Even if I must blow, I’ll also blow you, not blow cows*. Alas, I do not have sufficient Heavenly Energy currently, or I would release my incomparably suave Overlord Bow for you to see.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er said with disbelief: “You really succeeded in Consolidating Equipment?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing stuck out his chest and said: “Of course! Having such a talented genius husband, aren’t you very proud?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er was so full of shock that she did not even notice Zhou Weiqing taking advantage of her with his words as usual, muttering to herself: “That’s impossible! Since when is it possible to succeed on the first try of Consolidating Equipment. Did Feng Yu senior help you with some special method?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head, and explained everything that occurred earlier in detail to her, including his Darkness and Evil attributes superimposing together to aid his Consolidating Equipment. His Heavenly Jewel was awakened due to Shangguan Bing’er’s sacrifice, and he did not want to conceal anything from her. If Shangguan Bing’er wanted to be do anything disadvantageous to him, even a hundred of him would have died by now. Therefore, after after leaving home, the person he trusted the most was her.</p>
 <p>Listening to the entire process that Zhou Weiqing related in detail, Shangguan Bing’er’s eyes couldn’t help but reveal a tinge of envy, but she said: “You take too many risks. The secret of your Alexandrite Cat’s Eye, the fewer people who know it the better.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said helplessly: “We used his Consolidating Equipment Scroll for free, if I did not reveal to him, with my teacher’s stingy personality, he will probably not allow us to leave so easily! Furthermore, with his oath by his Elemental Jewel, we do not need to fear anymore.”</p>
