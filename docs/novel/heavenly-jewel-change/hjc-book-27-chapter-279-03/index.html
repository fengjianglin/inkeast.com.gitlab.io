<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style="color:black;">Even the Heavenly God’s Celestial Territory&nbsp;</span><a href="#_msocom_1" id="_anchor_1" language="JavaScript" name="_msoanchor_1" onmouseout="msoCommentHide('_com_1')" onmouseover="msoCommentShow('_anchor_1','_com_1')"></a><span style="color:black;">was limited to a specific area. However, the dazzling starry sky seemed to be boundless. Of course he was shocked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">“It’s over.” Zhou Weiqing took a step in the air and waved his <span style="background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;">Legendary Dual God Strength&nbsp;</span>Hammers at the same time. As he was waving them, two rays of starlight shone down from the sky directly on the <span style="background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;">Legendary Dual God Strength&nbsp;</span>Hammers. Zhou Weiqing’s hammers started sparkling - it was as though two stars had transformed into his hammers. A chill ran up his spine as a result of the surge of overwhelming and terrifying energy ripples. The black sword erupted at full force, transforming into a black tornado, attempting to block Zhou Weiqing’s attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">However, there was no way that Zhou Weiqing, a fellow Heavenly Emperor with the Nebula Saint Energy, would give him the opportunity to do that.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">There weren’t any loud rumbling sounds this time, only a ‘ding’ sound. Something strange happened. The black distorted light surrounding the man in black had suddenly vanished. The black sword in his hand had also shattered into countless pieces, scattering all over the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">Zhou Weiqing’s movement did not seem fast. However, whenever he executed a simple movement, a ray of light in the sky would shine onto his body, boosting his Nebula Saint Energy in an instant. The nebula light at Zhou Weiqing’s chest became extremely strong; the original reddish golden light had started to become whitish gold in color.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">After a ‘bang’ sound, the black sword shattered into pieces. The man in black no longer had any weapon he could use to defend himself against Zhou Weiqing. Out of helplessness, he had to go all out, engaging his strongest skill against Zhou Weiqing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">His body flew once again. This time, he was not escaping. At the same time, a dense aura erupted from his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">At the Heavenly Emperor Stage, it was not as simple as the mere spurt of blood. Zhou Weiqing’s attack had directly jolted his body violently. Fine cracks had even started to appear on his Legendary Set. Of course, if it wasn’t for his Legendary Set acting as a shield, he would have suffered serious injuries from that attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">“Stop!” shouted the man in black. The light in his hand flashed and a beautiful little girl appeared. He attempted to use her body as a shield.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">Zhou Weiqing’s hammer that was about to strike him stopped immediately. Wasn’t that the Sidhe Princess?</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">At this time, the Sidhe Queen had already rushed over. The moment she saw her daughter, she broke out in a cold sweat immediately.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">The little girl was still unconscious. It was apparent that the man in black had locked her up in a storage of sorts. Of course, she was still alive, as the Sidhe Queen and Zhou Weiqing could sense her life aura.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">The man in black gasped for air. He could not understand why Zhou Weiqing could become that strong in such a short period of time. What frightened him was that the powerful attribute that he had always relied on could no longer sense the presence of any other energy elements in the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">Even when he was within the Sidhe Queen’s Nature Celestial Territory, he could still sense Nature Attributes - it was only difficult for him to maneuver around. However, at this very moment, he could not sense any other attributes and at the same time, all his attributes were being suppressed, or else they would not be that passive. He could not even exhibit eighty percent of his cultivation at its peak. Without a doubt, everything was caused by the dazzling starry sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">He could not comprehend what was going on at all, particularly the fact that he had used all of his power in his last few attacks! However, the end result was still as such. He simply could not accept what happened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">Zhou Weiqing stared coldly at him, “What do you have to say now? Hand the little girl over and I will consider sparing your life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">The man in black said ferociously, “Dream on. If I were to hand her over, you would not let me off. Stop talking and move out of the way. Get rid of whatever that is happening in the sky and let me go. Or else, I will shred this girl to pieces and take her to the grave with me.” He was very sure that he was unable to escape under the dazzling starry sky that Zhou Weiqing set up. However, he could vaguely guess that Zhou Weiqing had exhausted a massive amount of energy by using such an ability - he could not possibly maintain it for a long period of time. Hence, buying time was his most effective move at the moment. Furthermore, with the Sidhe Princess in his hands, he was able to prevent Zhou Weiqing and the Sidhe Queen from attacking him, as they would be afraid of endangering the princess. This was also the reason why he had maintained his composure earlier.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">The Sidhe Queen clenched her fists tightly out of anger; her beautiful face went pale. Looking at her daughter in his hands, one could well imagine how furious she was. However, at this moment, she did not dare to act blindly without careful consideration. Even though she had full confidence in killing the enemy before her eyes, the opponent was after all a Heavenly Emperor - he could easily kill the Sidhe Princess in an instant, before she got to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">The man in black was very cunning - he chose to reveal the Sidhe Princess before he suffered any significant damage. In doing so, he was able to flee for his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">“Did you guys hear what I just said? If you don’t listen to me, I will tear her arm apart.” As the man in black spoke, he lifted her lotus root-like arm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">The Sidhe Queen instinctively shouted, “Don’t!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">Zhou Weiqing’s pupils contracted immediately. Tian’er had already been conceived with his child; he was about to become a father soon. Looking at his opponent’s despicable act, he was seething in anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">After taking a deep breath, Zhou Weiqing slowly put down both hammers and said in a low voice, “I can remove the starry sky, but you have to leave the child behind. Or else, I’d rather kill indiscriminately than let a bastard like you go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">The man in black laughed, “Brat, weren’t you very arrogant earlier? Do you think I will stay, just because you don’t want me to leave? Sidhe Queen, this is your child. Could it be that the both of you had committed adultery and conceived this child? If you want her to be alive, kill the fella next to you. Or else, hehe.” As he spoke, he had already straightened the Sidhe Princess’ arm - he only needed to exert a bit of strength to tear it apart.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">“He was right, you are indeed a scum and a beast.” The Sidhe Queen could no longer control her emotions. Her body was writhing in anger as she continuously released strong life aura from her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">A light flashed. Zhou Weiqing kept the <span style="background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;">Legendary Dual God Strength&nbsp;</span>Hammers in his hands. He placed his hand on the Sidhe Queen’s shoulder, “Don’t be rash. For the sake of the child, we have to let him leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">As he spoke, Zhou Weiqing lifted his hand and gestured it towards the dazzling starry sky. The stars in the sky slowly became dimmer, as though they were gradually disappearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">The man in black rejoiced in his heart. He could gradually start sensing the presence of the external elements that were previously blocked. Clearly, Zhou Weiqing had stopped using the Celestial Territory-like ability.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">The starlight in the sky became dim and something strange happened after. All the starlight seemed to become more distant. The dazzling starry sky had also quickly vanished - the boundless night sky had gradually shrunk into a small ball. A light flashed, and it fell from the sky right into Zhou Weiqing’s palm. It was as though Zhou Weiqing had captured the starlight in the sky. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">Even though the Sidhe Queen was not emotionally stable, she was still stunned upon seeing that.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">At this time, Zhou Weiqing suddenly glared angrily at him and shouted, “Didn’t you say you wanted to kill her? Do it then. Let me help you.” As he spoke, he abruptly lifted his hand and struck towards the Sidhe Princess’ body. A strong whitish golden light penetrated his palm and headed directly for the Sidhe Princess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">The sudden change happened too fast. As Zhou Weiqing was speaking, he had already began gesturing; even the Sidhe Queen next to him could not stop him in time. Furthermore, the man in black was completely taken aback by his words. However, he would not try to dodge for fear that Zhou Weiqing’s attack might land on him instead.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">People are selfish by nature. Naturally, the man in black would choose to use the Sidhe Princess as a shield. Additionally, a thought flashed across his mind: <em>Since this fella had the guts to strike the Sidhe Queen’s daughter, they would end up fighting each other. Even if the Sidhe Princess dies and my mission fails, at least I will be able to escape here alive.</em></span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">The whitish golden light accurately struck the Sidhe Princess’ body. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">“Scoundrel, you……” The Sidhe Queen was completely shocked. Her eyes went red and she struck Zhou Weiqing without any hesitation. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">A loud sound was heard and Zhou Weiqing’s entire body flew across the sky, spurting out blood. Golden and gray light rays were flashing alternately on his body. His body flew more than a thousand meters before finally stopping.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">A Heavenly God was very strong and powerful. She had used her full strength to hit him, under extreme anger. Even though Zhou Weiqing had the protection of the <span style="background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;">‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set, as well as the Immortal Deity Shield, Demon God Protective Body, and Dragon-Tiger Transformation, it was still hard for him to take the Sidhe Queen’s full blow without using any other defensive mechanism. Ever since he became a Heavenly King, it was his first time getting injured.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">The right arm piece of Zhou Weiqing’s <span style="background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;">‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set was entirely shattered. Cracks had appeared on the entire Legendary Set as well.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">The Sidhe Queen’s anger had already reached its maximum. After she struck Zhou Weiqing, her eyes widened in the next moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="color:black;">That was because she clearly saw that the Sidhe Princess, who was still in the hands of the man in black, had entirely become whitish gold in color. The specks of starlight looked exceptionally dazzling and beautiful, as though countless starlight gems were carved from a sculpture made from white gold.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><em><span style="color:black;">What’s going on?</span></em><span style="color:black;">&nbsp;The Sidhe Queen thought to herself. On the other side, the man in black had also noticed that something was amiss, as he clearly felt that a repulsive force had erupted from the Sidhe Princess’ body. Additionally, the Attribute Energy within his body started pouring out in a frenzy, injecting into the Sidhe Princess’ body, as though the little girl’s body became a bottomless hole. It was certainly a terrifying problem for him.</span></p>
