 <p><b>Chapter 227 Mine, All Mine! (1)</b></p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing held onto Tian’er’s hand as both of them used their ‘Lightness’ movement skills, swiftly moving towards the direction Zhou Weiqing had determined earlier.</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>As compared to Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er, the other Battle Team members who entered the Lustre Spatial Realm were not so lucky. The raging flames all about the Lustre Spatial Realm left them at a loss. In fact, just to endure the searing flames and temperature, they had to constantly use their Heavenly Energy to protect themselves.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, some of the weaker members had run out of Heavenly Energy and were forced to use their Lustre Gem to escape.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Of course, Tian’er and Zhou Weiqing would not meet into such a problem. With their large Saint Energy whirlpool, they could still easily draw in the fire attribute energies to replenish themselves, something none of the others could do. Furthermore, with their current physiques, even if they did not use Heavenly Energy to protect themselves, the flames were not sufficient to actually injure them.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s speed was extremely fast, especially with the wings behind his back supporting him, it was as if he was flying along at ground level, especially since he did not even bother dodging around those burning trees. Instead, with his powerful Heavenly Energy and the defense of the Immortal Deity Shield, he just smashed through in a straight line flight. At this point, he had just started carrying Tian’er in his arms to maintain the large Saint Energy whirlpool between them.</p>
 <p>Slowly, the surrounding temperature around them began to rise, and Zhou Weiqing knew this was because they were getting ever so close to the Dragons. However, he still could not understand why the Dragons would release such powerful Fire Attribute energies without a care in the world, pretty much attacking anything indiscriminately in the Lustre Spatial Realm.</p>
 <p>Time passed… second after second, minute after minute. Soon, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er had flown for more than two whole hours before he was actually forced to stop. The surrounding temperature was just too high, and the terrifying heat was so massive that even their Heavenly Energy expenditure was starting to take its toll, and they needed to stop to rest slightly.</p>
 <p>After all, they were about to face a possibly insane Dragon or worse, and if they were not in top condition, it could possibly lead to their deaths unnecessarily.</p>
 <p>Tian’er asked worriedly: “Should we really continue? Is it too dangerous?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head resolutely, saying: “No, we must at least go over and have a look, I must try my best to help. The Dragons have helped me a lot, if not for the Solidified Dragon Spirit and the bloodline of dragons that he passed to me, allowing me to complete my Dragon-Tiger Transformation, I could never have beaten Gu Yingbing at that time in the Heavenly Snow Mountain. From a certain perspective, you could say that the Dragon was our matchmaker and benefactor. Now that they are in trouble, possibly in danger, how could I possibly sit back and ignore it?”</p>
 <p>Tian’er nodded and said: “Very well, I’ll listen to you.”</p>
 <p>In truth, Zhou Weiqing’s heart was extremely worried. He was a very intelligent person after all, and though he had much gratitude and goodwill towards the Dragon Family, he knew that in this Lustre Spatial Realm, the Dragons were definitely the top of everything, with ultimate power within. With such a terrifying Heavenly God Tier power, what could possibly anger them so much? To cause them to become so crazy? It definitely had to be a major matter, could it be that their child had once again gotten into some trouble… worse than the previous time?</p>
 <p>Yet... in the Lustre Spatial Realm, who or what could even threaten the child of the Dragons? This was especially so since the Lustre Spatial Realm had the age restriction of thirty, and no powerhouses could enter! Ordinarily speaking, the Dragons should have more than enough capabilities to defend and protect their children.</p>
 <p>With such analysis and thoughts, Zhou Weiqing could conclude that something else… strange… had definitely happened within the Lustre Spatial Realm.</p>
 <p>Perhaps this situation … even the Heaven’s Expanse Palace would not be clear about. That meant… the possible danger might even be worse than he had imagined. Do not think that just because the Lustre Spatial Realm is a separate realm from the Boundless Mainland that it could pose no threat to the Heavenly Jewel Island. In truth, it was in an almost overlapping space with the Heavenly Jewel Island, and once this Spatial Realm broke apart, then it would be an absolute disaster for not just the Heavenly Jewel Island, but also the ZhongTian City right below.</p>
 <p>Although Zhou Weiqing had never identified himself as a good person, but if the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and ZhongTian Empire suffered such great trouble, then it would also greatly influence the future development of his own Heavenly Bow Empire. Without the support of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, how could he defeat the Blood Red Hell? All that aside, it was also the home of his loves, the Shangguan Sisters!</p>
 <p>As such, since he had already come in, then no matter what he would give it his best, to try and find out what was the true problem behind the current Lustre Spatial Realm.</p>
 <p>After a short rest, the duo had recovered their Heavenly Energy back to their maximum. Although the heat around them was extremely uncomfortable, the thick and pure Fire Attribute energy was actually beneficial to their cultivation.</p>
 <p>After all, no matter what type of Attribute energy, the large Saint Energy whirlpool was able to draw in and transform it, and this pure fire attribute energy was naturally no different, perfect for their needs. Not only did they recover their Heavenly Energy, even their Saint Energy was slowly growing once more in this environment. If not for the fact that this was the Lustre Spatial Realm, and that there were possible major troubles ahead of them, Zhou Weiqing might even want to stay here to just cultivate as long as he could.</p>
 <p>Once again, the pair continued their journey ahead, and the temperature resumed its constant rise as they did so. Due to the sheer heat, their sight of the environment around them was hazy and illusory, the warping of the air around them like ripples in a patch of water. As they walked on, the couple almost felt as if they weren’t walking in a jungle, instead more like walking underwater.</p>
 <p>The terrifying energy flow and ebb swirled around them in the air, but Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er continued walking forward resolutely.</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, Zhou Weiqing abruptly stopped. Due to the aid of the large Saint Energy whirlpool, the Ice Cold Perception that he entered when he was in the Dragon-Tiger Transformation had been raised to the max, and he suddenly sensed that not far ahead from them, there were signs of life.</p>
 <p>Whatever Zhou Weiqing could sense, Tian’er who was sharing the large Saint Energy whirlpool with him could naturally sense as well. Exchanging glances, they did not hesitate to release their Legendary Sets.</p>
 <p>The ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set and God Vanquishing Heavenly Spirit Legendary Set appeared around them respectively. The power of the God Tier Consolidated Equipment was indeed extraordinary, and the energy reverberations that they gave off as soon as they appeared forced the fiery hot Fire Attribute energy to part before them.</p>
 <p>The Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation appeared below Zhou Weiqing’s feet, and as he lifted his left hand, a thick green light flew out, warping into a large gust of wind, blowing apart the Fire Attribute energy and flames in a path towards the source of the life energy, as the pair looked in that direction.</p>
 <p>Although they had not met any Heavenly Beasts since they entered the Lustre Spatial Realm, that did not mean they did not exist. Any Heavenly Beasts that could survive in such conditions definitely had respectable cultivation stages, and they needed to be very careful.</p>
 <p>However, as soon as Zhou Weiqing’s eyes landed on the life forms that he had sensed earlier, he was overjoyed.</p>
 <p>Three beautiful figures entered his sight, a layer of white icy mist covering the three figures as they stood still in the midst of the ocean of fire. However, the surrounding flames did not seem to be able to approach a five metre radius of them.</p>
 <p>It was the three Shangguan Sisters!</p>
 <p>At the same time, the Shangguan Sisters also discovered their presence, and both sides rushed towards each other.</p>
 <p>“Xue’er, Fei’er, Bing’er, you all have come too.” Zhou Weiqing quickly greeted them.</p>
 <p>Currently, they were all surrounding by the sea of fire, and though the four girls meeting had a slight awkwardness, under such a unique environment, it was no time for argument.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er said exasperatedly: “Why did you run so fast! I was planning to have you both join us in entering the Lustre Spatial Realm.”</p>
 <p>Only then did Zhou Weiqing see the small icy blue pearl in Shangguan Xue’er’s palm, and it was this pearl that was emitting a faint icy mist that was isolating them from the surrounding flames and heat.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing held onto Tian’er’s hands as they walked into the range of the icy mist. Instantly, a cooling feeling spread across them, extremely comfortable as if washing off their entire body of raging heat.</p>
 <p>The Heaven’s Expanse Palace truly lived up to their name. This precious pearl in Shangguan Xue’er’s hands was definitely a top level treasure.</p>
 <p>“It is great to meet up with you all… where are the rest?” Zhou Weiqing asked curiously.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er said: “The rest of our team have dispersed in the teleportation. I was only able to protect Fei’er and Bing’er using this Ice Heart Pearl Treasure to ensure we did not separate. Furthermore, the rest of the team would not be of great use. By now, you should have guessed, the changes in the Lustre Spatial Realm should be linked to the Dragons right?”</p>
 <p>Sudden inspiration struck Zhou Weiqing and he said: “The Heaven’s Expanse Palace knew about the situation? You can speak about it now right, what is actually going on?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er replied: “We only know very little about the situation, and are not clear about what actually happened. A few months ago, there was a sudden violent energy reverberation from the Lustre Spatial Realm, catching our attention. When we dispatched a team to investigate, we discovered that the Lustre Spatial Realm had already turned into such a state. The Lustre Spatial Realm was built up with a large number of Spatial Attribute Gemstones as a foundation, as well as an incomparable amount of Heavenly Energy to maintain it. It must have taken at least four Heavenly God Tier powerhouses working together to create such an existence.”</p>
 <p>“The Lustre Spatial Realm was created long before our Heaven’s Expanse Palace existed, and ordinarily speaking, it would be able to continue its existence in a stable state in the future, ensuring the existence of the realm. However, the current situation is extremely different… with such an explosive raging energy within the Spatial Realm, especially if it’s only a pure Fire Attribute, if this continues, it could possibly lead to the collapse of the entire Spatial Realm. Currently, in the massive formation that maintains the Lustre Spatial Realm, some of the Spatial gemstones have already started to show some cracks, and our Heaven’s Expanse Palace have actually been constantly swapping in the gemstones when some reached their limit… only then has it barely been able to continue lasting so long. However, this is definitely not a long term plan, and we can’t keep going on like this… after all, the number of Spatial gemstones that we have is limited. If this continues, in less than a year’s time, the Lustre Spatial Realm will definitely collapse.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing drew a deep breath, staring fixedly at Shangguan Xue’er as he said: “If the Lustre Spatial Realm really collapses… what will the fallout be?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er’s expression turned grave. “If the Lustre Spatial Realm collapses, then the Heavenly Jewel Island will be finished as well. That is because the Spatial Formation not only maintains the existence of the Lustre Spatial Realm, it is also the core formation of the Heavenly Jewel Island. For such a massive island like the Heavenly Jewel Island to remain floating in midair, it is not possible just to be supported by the few pillars, and it is actually the powerful Spatial energy that is allowing it to balance so. Furthermore… right below the Heavenly Jewel Island is the ZhongTian City, with tens of millions of citizens living there. If the Heavenly Jewel Island falls, it could possibly smash right into the ZhongTian City. That would be a disaster that could spell the destruction of the ZhongTian Empire. When that happens, it is not just our Heaven’s Expanse Palace that will no longer exist, perhaps the entire government of the ZhongTian Empire will be in deep trouble.</p>
