 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When they saw his face muscles twitching, it was as if their hearts stopped beating as they held their breaths, watching unblinkingly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The most nervous was naturally Zhou Weiqing, his mother and Di Lingfeng. To them, Admiral Zhou’s safety was of utmost importance. If he failed in saving Admiral Zhou, then what was the meaning behind all Zhou Weiqing had done? He had already done his utmost, exhausting all of his abilities, and was truly afraid it would all come to naught. If that was so, he was afraid he would not be able to take it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Admiral Zhou’s face muscles twitched once more. Soon after, his body began to tremble lightly. Upon seeing that, Zhou Weiqing held onto his mother tightly, almost not daring to continue watching. After all, his father’s body had pretty much fully broken down from the Fate Denying Seal, and under such a circumstance, how could the recovery be so easy? He had done all he could with the Astral Saint Energy, filling his father’s body with the Power of Creation. Whether or not it would actually help his father, even he was not clear, so how could he not be nervous?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Xuuu…” Admiral Zhou seemed to take a long breath as the trembling of his body stopped. Slowly, his eyes opened, a faint layer of black air emitting from his body, as a pure Darkness Attribute energies began to revolve around his body, as his nine set of Heavenly Jewels appeared around his wrist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was only at this point that Zhou Weiqing could finally heave a sigh of relief, and the expressions of those surrounding also eased up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Admiral Zhou’s eyes were still hazy and confused. Looking around at the surrounding people, he was stunned for some time before he finally said in a hoarse voice: “Where is this? Am I still alive?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Father, this is our Heavenly Bow Empire! Of course you’re still alive, we all are still alive.” Zhou Weiqing let go of his mother, taking two quick steps forward. With a thud, he knelt down before his father, holding onto his leg as he burst into tears.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His emotions had been repressed for just too long, and he had finally accomplished the task he first set out to do, saving his father, and saving all of the officials of the Heavenly Bow Empire. As his emotions finally relaxed out, the suppressed sorrow, depression bottled up in his heart was released all at once. Even though he had been so strong just a second ago, able to kill a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse, but currently he was just an ordinary young man who had finally found his parents again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Admiral Zhou truly lived up to his name as Admiral Zhou, recovering quickly. Looking at his son, now taller and bigger, hugging his leg and crying, his face darkened, and he grabbed onto Zhou Weiqing’s shoulder and pulled him up. “What are you crying about, Your Father, I, have not died yet. Tell me, what happened?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His heart was filled with uncertainty and confusion, just like all the others who had just been released from the Fate Denying Seal. In fact, knowing that he had unleashed the Fate Denying Seal, he should have died, but not only was he alive now, his son had also returned. What was going on?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Old fool, can’t you be gentler? Without our son bringing people to save us, we wouldn’t be alive right now. My son is the hero of the Heavenly Bow Empire.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Looking at Admiral Zhou treating Zhou Weiqing in the same old way, Ling Zihan instantly protested, stalking in front in anger, as if forgetting how she was almost crying in worry for her husband just a few moments ago.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bringing people to save us? Weiqing, you little brat, tell me what happened? Didn’t your father, I, taught you before that good men will bleed before they cry right?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Being scolded like this by his father, Zhou Weiqing could no longer continue crying. Currently, his heart was just too filled with happiness and joy; perhaps even if his father gave him two slaps now, he would feel extremely comfortable.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Father, it’s like this. Originally, I was still in the Heavenly Jewel Island when I learned about our Heavenly Bow Empire being vanquished, and I went to the ZhongTian Empire. After that, I returned to our Heavenly Bow Empire to reform our army, gathering our original Heavenly Bow Empire soldiers and finally counter attacking the Heavenly Bow City. With everyone’s help, we attacked and reclaimed the city, vanquished our enemies and also took down your Fate Denying Seal.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing used the shortest, simplest summary of these last few years. Just a simple description, but how could it show all that he had gone through, the trials and tribulations he had forged his way through; but he was indeed unwilling to do so.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he spoke, Zhou Weiqing pulled his father to the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya, saying: “Father, let me introduce you. This is my Master, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor, known as the strongest under the Heavenly God Stage, Master Long.” Naturally it was not proper etiquette for him to speak out his master’s full name, and he could only speak as such.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Long Shiya had already withdrawn his Heavenly Energy, he was still a Heavenly Emperor, and the quality of aura he displayed was definitely incomparable. Admiral Zhou was after all already a nine-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, and he could clearly sense Long Shiya’s terrifying power. Quickly, he bowed down respectfully, saying: “Many thanks Senior for rescuing our Heavenly Bow Empire from our troubles and disaster.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A Heavenly Emperor powerhouse. Just these words alone were more than enough to shock all of the Heavenly Bow Empire officials. They had never met any powerhouse of such levels before!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Shiya laughed heartily, saying: “You have a very good son indeed. Since I am his teacher, let us speak as one of the same generation. You do not need to call me Senior, this old fellow is called Long Shiya.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To be honest, Admiral Zhou was not familiar with the name Long Shiya, in fact it was the first time hearing of it. After all, with his cultivation level, in the past he did not have the qualification to know of the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Even so, many thanks Senior for rescuing us all.” Admiral Zhou bowed once more. He was not doing so for himself, but for his Emperor, and his son as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Shiya’s massive body disappeared in a flash, not accepting this bow. “Admiral Zhou, you are mistaken. It is not this old man who rescued you all, but someone else.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Admiral Zhou heard those words, he started. Was it not this old senior here? However, he knew the power of his own Fate Denying Seal, even a Heavenly King powerhouse would have difficulty taking it down. Since Zhou Weiqing was able to invite a Heavenly Emperor here, it should clearly be this Senior who rescued them! Looking around, he could not see anyone else who had the power to break through his Fate Denying Seal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Senior, please do not joke around with me. Besides you, who else could rescue our entire Heavenly Bow Empire from the disastrous state we were in?” Admiral Zhou said uncertainly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Long Shiya laughed heartily, saying: “Isn’t that simple? As the saying goes, Much water runs by the mill that the miller knows not of. It is your precious son! This old man did not do much, and he pretty much single handedly rescued your Heavenly Bow Empire. If you want to thank someone, you can thank him. Truthfully speaking, your entire Heavenly Bow Empire really needs to thank him properly.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Weiqing?” Admiral Zhou’s face was filled with disbelief, and he couldn’t help but think inwardly:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This son of mine, how could I not know what he is like? That little brat, although he has become a Heavenly Jewel Master, what cultivation can he be now? How could he possibly break my Fate Denying Seal?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, Di Lingfeng had walked to Admiral Zhou’s side. “Big brother, let us not speak of this now, they are still fighting outside. Let us finish dealing with all matters first before we chat about it.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Admiral Zhou nodded hastily, saying: “Weiqing, bring me to the battlefield.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily as he said: “Father, do not worry, I have already arranged everything. This fight, you do not need to take action already. You have only just been released from the Fate Denying Seal, and the most important thing for you to do now is to rest and recover. Godfather, why don’t you get the guards and servants to tidy up the palace first? After that, you just need to wait for our warriors to finish up and return with news of our resounding victory. Ohh, right! My dear wives, come quickly, greet your father-in-law and mother-in-law.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three Shangguan Sisters and Tian’er quickly walked forward, curtseying towards Admiral Zhou and Ling Zihan. “Greetings, Uncle, Aunty.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Admiral Zhou stared with jaw agape at the four young absolute beauties in front of him, in that moment he was totally unable to react. Lifting his hand to point at Zhou Weiqing, he said: “Stinking brat, they… they are all your…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing grinned wickedly and said: “Heh heh, that’s right Father, they are all mine. That is, they are all your daughter-in-laws. How is it, your son is great right?”&nbsp;</span></p>

When all of this is over, I will entertain you all.”&nbsp;</span></p>

Curtseying once more, they moved back to the side.&nbsp;</span></p>

Luckily, all of the high ranking officials of the Heavenly Bow Empire were gathered here, along with large numbers of guards and servants who had still been in the palace. Furthermore, the entire Palace had been Sealed, and was not damaged at all, and tidying up was no trouble at all.&nbsp;</span></p>

Although the Kalise and Bai Da combined forces had started trying to react, their first thought was that it was the internal Heavenly Bow City which was in trouble. However, the ranking army officers all knew that there were so many powerhouses guarding the palace, and thus they had not been too worried at first.
