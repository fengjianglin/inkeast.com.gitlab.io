 <p><b>Chapter 107 Breakthrough! Heavenly Shen Energy Third Stage! (2)</b></p>
 <p>Sensing the energy fluctuations from Zhou Weiqing’s Dantian, Shangguan Tianyang and Tianyue immediately focused their attentions on him. At their level, they did not need to be in contact with his body to be able to sense every minute change in his Heavenly Energy.</p>
 <p>When Zhou Weiqing circulated that immense amount of Heavenly Energy and charged it in a straightforward fashion towards the Jiuwei Death Acupuncture Point at the chest area, they could sense the massive energy surging forth like a herd of wild horses, with no hint of hesitation. Even Heavenly Emperor Stage powerhouses like Shangguan Tianyang and Shangguan Tianyue couldn’t help but stare at each other in shock. Such a thing, even they would not dare to easily try.</p>
 <p>*Poof* Zhou Weiqing’s body was like an air balloon which had been pierced through, and a vast amount of Heavenly Energy burst forth from his Jiuwei Acupuncture Point. At the same time, fresh blood spurted out from his mouth, and his entire body began trembling violently, his Heavenly Energy spewing out from that breach in his meridian channels.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyang and Shangguan Longyin did not move, as cold logic told them that since Zhou Weiqing had dared to do that, he had his own reasons. No one would toy with their own life like that so simply.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, it was Shangguan Tianyue, who had always seemed so cold, and hostile towards Zhou Weiqing, couldn’t help but lifting a hand in an attempt to aid him. As the saying goes, once one cares about something, logic goes out of the window. After he knew about the relation between his daughter and Zhou Weiqing, he had already treated the youth as half a son-in-law in his heart, though he would never show it out to the young man directly.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyang grabbed hold of Shangguan Tianyue’s hand, motioning for him to remain calm. At the same time, he continued focusing his senses in on the detailed movement of Heavenly Energy of Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>It was barely the short time of a few breaths, but already Zhou Weiqing’s clothes were totally soaked with sweat, and his face was pale and ashen. That alone showed how much pain he was in, but he gritted his teeth and did not make a sound, enduring the intense pain as best he could.</p>
 <p>In his mind, Zhou Weiqing could only continually utter the words to keep himself sane: <i>For Bing’er!</i></p>
 <p>Indeed, in order to be together with Bing’er as soon as possible, no matter how much he had to go through, it was definitely worth it. This was the conviction in his heart that supported him through all the pain, bringing his endurance up several notches. With the last dredges of his consciousness, he willed his remaining Heavenly Energy to circulate through the requisite circulation paths, forcibly preventing too much from escaping via the broken Death Acupuncture Point.</p>
 <p>The hidden reserve powers that he had not absorbed after his second evolving was once more activated, and once again, that familiar biting cold spread throughout every inch of his body. Currently, the two Shangguan brothers could sense that it was as if Zhou Weiqing’s blood was literally boiling, his entire body as if on fire, burning away at his blood, soul and even life. All of this was happening in some strange fashion.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, they could clearly sense that this was not under Zhou Weiqing’s control. Just like he had said earlier, this was a sort of self-rescue arising from his own bloodline. In that instant, a ferocious killing aura emanated from Zhou Weiqing’s body, and the black tiger tattoos appeared once more on his skin.The black undulating stripes seeming to rush crazily towards his chest, gathering there to form a strange dark whirlpool.</p>
 <p>By this time, Shangguan Tianyang and Shangguan Tianyue revealed slight despondent looks. They knew that Zhou Weiqing had not lied; besides all that, they could also clearly sense the fourteen energy whirlpools drawing in energy into his body, exactly just as described in the Immortal Deity Technique. At this point, the two of them instantly thought of the Demonic Change; despite all of their experience, they could not imagine any other reason besides the Demonic Change aiding Zhou Weiqing in successfully cultivating this suicidal technique.</p>
 <p>Time passed minute after minute. Zhou Weiqing’s trembling finally started to slow down, but no one noticed that at the center of his back, a dim red light was spreading out, following the tiger tattoos and seeping deep into his body. The red scale that was originally covering more than a third of his back slowly disappeared into his body.</p>
 <p>Hot. Unbelievable heat. That was the feeling that Zhou Weiqing was currently feeling, as if his entire back was being flayed and burnt, yet it was strangely not painful at all. Instead, the reverse was true as that heat seared through his body, causing the intense pain in his chest to diminish slightly, aiding him in suppressing it. In addition to the Dark Demon God Tiger’s bloodline awakening in him after the second evolving he had gone through, this time his breakthrough actually seemed easier than any of his other times! Not only was the pain lesser, the time he had to endure the pain was also reduced.</p>
 <p>Of course, Zhou Weiqing did not know that in this time that he was breaking through to the fifteenth stage of Heavenly Energy, the second Death Acupuncture Point of the 3rd portion of the Immortal Deity Technique, something had already merged into his body.</p>
 <p>As the time passed by slowly, the three powerhouses of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, Shangguan Tianyang, Shangguan Tianyue and Shangguan Longyin, stood by patiently, waiting silently at the side. At the same time, they closely examined every single change within Zhou Weiqing’s body. Even so, they were still unable to sense the large dragon’s reverse scale seeping into and merging with Zhou Weiqing’s body.</p>
 <p>There could only be one reason that something like this could happen - their cultivation level was not up to speed yet.</p>
 <p>The dragon was a Heavenly God Stage powerhouse; although the Shangguan brothers’ combat power was able to equal a Heavenly God Stage powerhouse due to their Legendary Set Equipment, but just in terms of cultivation level alone, they were still at quite a distance from that stage. As such, they were not able to sense what the dragon had branded onto Zhou Weiqing’s back.</p>
 <p>As for the dragons in the Lustre Spatial Realm, they could do nothing about them. No matter how powerful the Heaven’s Expanse Palace was, that restriction of entering set to thirty years of age and lower was something they could not surpass. Barring any surprises like during the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, they could pose no threat to the dragons. As such, they currently had no idea that the male dragon had been filled with guilt and gratitude after suspecting Zhou Weiqing’s motives after saving its wife, and had given him an unbelievable gift due to that.</p>
 <p>“Big brother… how? That Immortal Deity Technique of his seems to be real, but if we actually go through that trade with him, it is a big loss to us!” Shangguan Tianyue said to Shangguan Tianyang.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyang glanced at his brother before saying exasperatedly: “You do not need to help that little rascal test the waters, don’t I know already know what you are thinking? With our Heaven’s Expanse Palace position and status, could we still break our word to such a little fellow? Since that Immortal Deity Technique can truly be cultivated, he has already proven himself; if we aren’t able to cultivate it, it is our own lack of prowess, and there is no reason for us to renege on the agreement now. However, I will have to bring up an additional request to him.”</p>
 <p>Just as Shangguan Tianyue was about to ask what additional request that was, Zhou Weiqing suddenly awoke from his cultivation.</p>
 <p>After breaking through his fifteenth Death Acupuncture Point, it gave Zhou Weiqing the feeling that all of his previously existing energy whirlpools were strengthened and larger. In an analogy to a game of go chess (weiqi), after having placed fourteen pieces down, the fifteenth piece was a masterful play that was not just a simple addition of one. In terms of improvement, not just the amount of Heavenly Energy he had, the quality, as well as the energy whirlpools itself and their radius of effect; all of which was improved greatly. The amount of liquified Heavenly Energy circulating within him was also clearly increased. Although there was a still a distance between fully flooding his meridian channels, Zhou Weiqing knew that he had definitely taken a huge firm step forward in his cultivation. At least, he would be safe until his next break through point. Taking a deep breath, Zhou Weiqing stood up shakily from the ground; although his clothes were all sticky and uncomfortable, breaking through once more gave him an immense joy.</p>
 <p>“How is it, future father in law, uncle? What are your thoughts about my Immortal Deity Technique?” Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily as he smoothed his hair, which was matted with sweat.</p>
 <p>Shangguan TIanyue gave a cold humph, saying exasperatedly: “This Immortal Deity Technique of yours is akin to suicide, are you trying to make my daughter a widow when she is still young?? I have decided, unless you complete breaking through all thirty Death Acupuncture Points, you can forget about marrying my daughter.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing had been feeling a little smug, patting himself on the back for successfully tricking the Heaven’s Expanse Palace into giving him such a good trade. Alas, upon hearing Shangguan Tianyue’s words, his jaw dropped, as his heart tightened in shock. Could this be the legendary saying ‘When the cup of happiness overflows, disaster follows!’</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyang chuckled, then said with a hint of emotion: “Indeed, behind every success is an untold amount of suffering and hard work… that is just too true no matter in what field. No wonder you are able to unleash such powerful combat skills at just the three-Jeweled cultivation level, especially that sustainability. Just in terms of this cultivation technique of yours alone, it can be considered unmatched amongst all cultivation techniques. Alas, it is just too difficult to cultivate, and the basic requirements to do so is nearly impossible to reach. To any ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master, it is truly tantamount to suicide to attempt to cultivate it.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing immediately put on a pitiful look, saying softly: “Uncle, the Heaven’s Expanse Palace won’t renege on the agreement right?”</p>
 <p>Of course, Zhou Weiqing had chosen his words wisely, saying ‘the Heaven’s Expanse Palace reneging’ instead of ‘Shangguan Tianyang reneging’, naturally that was to put pressure on them not to do just that.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyang was not so easily irritated, and he smiled faintly as he said: “I have already said that your Immortal Deity Technique is truly an outstanding and unparalleled technique indeed. Since that is so, why would we renege on the agreement? At least, we now know that there is such a technique in the world. Although currently no one in our Heaven’s Expanse Palace can use this cultivation technique, that does not mean that no one in the future will be able to succeed. That is the meaning of a Great Saint Lands, sometimes a legacy is more important. In any case, our trade will be completed as previously agreed. However, I do have one additional request I hope you can agree to.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing narrowed his eyes, smiling as he said: “Senior, please do state your request; if it is within my means, I will definitely agree.” His words sounded beautiful, but in truth he had left a large loophole to give himself leeway. Shangguan Tianyang suddenly had the strange impression that the person in front of him bargaining was not a young man, but a wily old bird.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing might only be at the young age of seventeen, but he carried with him the legacy of Mu En and all of his worldly experience.</p>
