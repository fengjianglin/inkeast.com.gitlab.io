 <p><b>Chapter 53 Beautiful Lady Principal (3)</b></p>
 <p>“In a battle, what’s the most important thing? Opportunity, favourable terrain, and the people. For the first two, it’s still possible to determine using your experience and knowledge, but the last is not possible. The person who holds the hearts of people will rule the lands. Let me tell you one thing for certain - although Ming Yu is a famous general, he will never be granted the highest accolades and awards, nor will he ever become the Commander-in-chief. That is because for him now, no matter where he goes, he brings fear, not just the enemies but even our own countrymen. Those that remember his victories are few, but many call him an executioner and slaughterer. Alas, despite all his abilities and military talent, he will never be a loved general.”</p>
 <p>Hearing Cai Cai’s strict and serious words, only then did Zhou Weiqing finally realise the situation. It seemed he had been taking the hit for someone else! Ignoring the rumour about their possible relation, it was likely that Cai Cai and Ming Yu had many differences regarding their outlook on military command. Although deep in Zhou Weiqing’s heart, he was more agreeable to Ming Yu’s way of thinking, he could also hear some reason in Cai Cai’s words. Just like the debate whether might is right versus winning people over with benevolence is better, it was never a debate that could be resolved easily with a simple answer.</p>
 <p>“Principal, wait a minute, how about letting me say something?” Zhou Weiqing said helplessly.</p>
 <p>Cai Cai resumed her previous smiling poise, though there was a hint of stern coldness in her eyes.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled bitterly and said: “Principal, let me be honest. In truth, that day while going through the exam. i was totally writing rubbish. I have never ever attended any official military training in my life, let alone a military academy.”</p>
 <p>“Who knew that I would coincidentally have the same answer as General Ming Yu. I am here just for that, to learn! I am not set in any ways, nor am I close to commanding any battles any time soon. To say that I will end up like General Ming Yu is way too early. As such, you do not have to worry so much, after all I still have four years of studying and learning to go through. Isn’t that the purpose of the academy, to let me know all the possible ways and methods to approach various problems, even to resolve without bloodshed? I can only say that you are thinking too much. No one can be a copy of another person. I will not be a second Ming Yu. To put things bluntly, I wouldn’t even want to be him, he is not worth it for me. [1. I translated this not-literally, as the literal meaning is ‘attracted to him’. As you can see in the joke below.]”</p>
 <p>As he said that, Zhou Weiqing’s rogue-ish nature was revealed once more. He was rather exasperated and speechless, it was noon and lunch time, and yet he was just called in to be scolded for nothing? What was that all about?</p>
 <p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, Cai Cai suddenly burst out laughing, yet without destroying any of her noble grace, instead adding a vivacious charm to her.</p>
 <p>“You are a man after all, how could you be attracted to another man?” Cai Cai said passively. Her voice remained calm and peaceful despite the wide smile on her face, and Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help to stare at her. If not for the fact that he had indeed seen many beauties, he might have been enamoured by the sight.</p>
 <p>“You do not have to explain anything to me. My words earlier were just to tell you that you shouldn’t learn too much from Ming Yu’s example. Next, let’s talk about you. During the opening ceremony yesterday, I shall not pursue the matter about you hitting another student any further. You are a 3-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master, and not even seventeen years of age yet. You are also a Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Master. What I really want to know is why did you choose our Fei Li Imperial Family Military Academy instead of the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy?”</p>
 <p>Cai Cai’s gaze seemed to turn sharp as she focused upon Zhou Weiqing’s face, as if she could see right through him.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said rather helplessly: “I did not choose it! That was all arranged by my family back home, and I didn’t really have a choice. Furthermore, it’s always good to learn something else, I will probably have to join the army eventually, so it’s good for me to learn something about military matters now. Furthermore, doesn’t our academy teach us regarding Heavenly Jewel Masters as well?”</p>
 <p>Cai Cai shook her head gently, saying: “You are here because your father is the commander in chief of the Heavenly Bow Empire. As his son, and a Heavenly Jewel Master yourself, you will probably have to succeed him in the future. In truth, this academy may not really be suitable for you. Although your father is one of the few people in the world today that I admire, I still have to tell you this.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was stunned in his heart. “You know my father?!”</p>
 <p>Cai Cai said passively: “We’ve met once in passing. It was just an easy matter for me to know who you really were, after all the Heavenly Bow Empire is allies with us Fei Li Empire. However, these few years, due to the pressure from the Wan Shou Empire, we have not been able to aid your Heavenly Bow Empire as much as we would like to. Regarding this, I have to give my apology. Under such a circumstance, if not for your father Admiral Zhou holding his ground, I’m afraid the Heavenly Bow Empire would have fallen long ago.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing furrowed his brow and said: “In that case, it is even more imperative that I learn more about military matters, to go back home and help my father, and ease his load.”</p>
 <p>Cai Cai said: “There is a phrase called ‘Do not bite off more than you can chew’. It’s always good to learn new things, but it is usually related for the sake of survival. In your case, that isn’t true. After all, you have an amazing talent in other matters. A Consolidating Equipment Master of less than seventeen years of age, how often is that seen? According to Dean Xiao, you definitely have much talent in that area, and aren’t just someone who had just barely made it to the rank. Add on to that your Spatial Heavenly Jewel Master status… If you spend too much time and effort on military matters, you might disrupt your progress in being a Heavenly Jewel Master or Consolidating Equipment Master. Do you understand what I mean?”</p>
 <p>As she spoke up to this point, Cai Cai paused a moment before continuing gracefully: “If not for the fact that you are Admiral Zhou’s only son, I would be trying my best to persuade such a talent like you to join our Fei Li Empire. Alas, that is obviously not going to be possible. To be honest, to your Heavenly Bow Empire, an outstanding Consolidating Equipment Master is much more meaningful and important than another outstanding general or commander. I think you should understand what I mean. Furthermore, your father is still in his prime, and should not require you to succeed him in the next twenty years or so. If you are willing, I can write you a letter of recommendation to the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy and have you transfer over. Not only are they more well versed in training Heavenly Jewel Masters, they also have a specialised course for Consolidating Equipment Masters, and the teacher in charge is even a Consolidating Equipment Grandmaster.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s eyes glittered. He was rather unsure of what Cai Cai’s actions meant. With his status as a Consolidating Equipment Master, shouldn’t she be more than happy to leave him in the academy? Why did she seem like she was trying to chase him away?</p>
 <p>Cai Cai looked at him steadily and smiled. “I know what you are thinking. I can tell you directly. Indeed, you are correct, I do not want you to continue staying in the academy. The reason is simple, I do want to wait for your graduation to see you pull all the commoner students to the Heavenly Bow Empire.”</p>
 <p>As soon as Cai Cai said those words, Zhou Weiqing felt a chill run down his spine and his heart sink. He had never expected that all his actions would be so easily read. Without question, before calling him here today, this Principal had looked into all his actions in detail, from the second he had entered the academy.</p>
 <p>Another scarily intelligent person. Perhaps, in terms of power, Cai Cai might not be a match for Ming Wu. However, the impression she gave Zhou Weiqing was even more terrifying. The sort of pressure that she gave him with just a few simple words, the feeling of her having everything in her grasp, that was undeniable, without giving Zhou Weiqing any room to manoeuvre.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing drew in a deep breath, suppressing his fear and rage within his heart. His gaze also turned icy, far different from his usual easygoing manner.</p>
 <p>He had barely stepped into this academy for two days, and had barely shown himself to be above average, yet he had already met with so many problems. Without even speaking about the problems from other students, just the problems from the Heavenly Demon Sect and from the academy itself now, it was quickly eroding his patience. Do not forget that after all the Zhou Weiqing now was no longer the youth that hadn’t Awakened his Heavenly Jewels a few years back. All these years, he had steadily been absorbing and bonding with the black pearl he had swallowed. At the same time that he had gotten all the various benefits, his character was also subtly influenced. He was originally the sort of person to lash out harder the more pressure he was under, and under such a threat, he no longer wanted to hold back.</p>
 <p>“Principal Cai Cai, let me show you something.” Zhou Weiqing said calmly. As he said that, he took out a sheet of paper from his Spatial Necklace, passing it to Cai Cai.</p>
 <p>Cai Cai started a little. She had originally thought she had everything under control. In her view, Zhou Weiqing would either have to leave, or to back down and compromise with her. She had not expected him to have this reaction instead.</p>
 <p>Taking the paper from Zhou Weiqing, Cai Cai held it before her. When she looked upon it, her calm and peaceful figure actually shuddered violently, her eyes revealing her shock.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing stood up, pressing his hands to the table, looking down onto Cai Cai. “Principal Cai Cai, this design… With your intelligence, I’m sure you can tell what it is.”</p>
 <p>Cai Cai struggled hard to control the shock in her heart, saying coldly: “A God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll Design.”</p>
 <p>Indeed, what Zhou Weiqing had passed to her was a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll design. Of course, he wasn’t foolish, and the one he passed to her was the twin hammers that he had already Consolidated. Even if Cai Cai tried to forcefully steal it, he wasn’t afraid. Furthermore, he was rather confident that she would not do so, or would not dare to do so.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said proudly: “Indeed, you are right, it is a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll design. Now… do you still think I need a Consolidating Equipment Grandmaster to teach me?”</p>
