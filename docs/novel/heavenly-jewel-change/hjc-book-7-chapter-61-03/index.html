 <p><b>Chapter 61 Since I’m willing to bet, I’m prepared to lose. (3)</b></p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing furrowed his brow and said: “Thanks for the warning Senior. However, isn’t our lady Principal the Princess? How could these nobles dare be so arrogant?”</p>
 <p>Ye Paopao couldn’t help but laugh as he said: “Junior, you are an intelligent person, how could yo say something like that. If not for the fact that it was Her Highness, the Principal, at the head personally settling things, these people would not be waiting outside for you, and would have long since stormed inside to find you. However, even with our Principal’s status, facing so many nobles, it will be tough for her to withstand such pressure. Junior, you need to prepare yourself. However, I still believe that the academy will be able to deal with the situation. After all, they have already announced their decision, and it is unlikely they will change their tune suddenly.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said impassively: “Thanks so much for Senior for taking the trouble to come here to inform me about the situation. I will not forget this favour.”</p>
 <p>Ye Paopao waved his hand and said: “I did not come here to warn you in order to get any favour. Did you think any ordinary person is worthy of my time to warn? I did not come here to get a debt from you. In my eyes, I consider you the dangerous sort, especially your future, it is just too danger. I do not want to be an enemy to someone so dangerous… as such, I can only try to be your friend.”</p>
 <p>Their eyes met, and Zhou Weiqing smiled and nodded. Extending his right hand, he said: “From now on, we are friends. However, my principles will not waver, do not think you can get any of the commoner students from me.”</p>
 <p>Ye Paopao laughed and said: “Since we are friends, those commoner students are considered under you, what big difference is there if they are under me. I have heard that you have proclaimed that you will definitely become a High Level Consolidating Equipment Master within the next four years. I am looking forward to that! In the future, if you have any Consolidating Equipment Scrolls for sale, do remember to look for me, I will definitely give a good price. Come on, let’s go, I’ll bring you to the side to enter. These people are fools, as if blocking the main entrance will be of any use, and we can’t just vault over the wall.”</p>
 <p>To be honest, Zhou Weiqing did not really want to be friends with Ye Paopao, at least not at this point in time. That was because he was unable to read this person, and he felt that he posed almost as much danger as Ming Hua. However, right at this moment, he did not have any choice. After entering the Fei Li Military Academy for just barely a few days, he had already made so many enemies. If he made another enemy for no purpose, that was just being foolish. Furthermore, he was extending a friendly hand now.</p>
 <p>After detouring around the main entrance, the three of them entered from the sides. It had to be said that the Fei Li Military Academy walls were actually extremely high, almost six metres tall, with sharp metal spikes on the top as well. This was highly difficult for any ordinary person to scale, but to powerful Jewel Masters like them, it was not much of an obstacle.</p>
 <p>Ye Paopao pointed above and smiled, saying: “Let’s enter from here then.” As he said that, he lifted his right hand, and a dim blue light shone forth from his palm, and an ice pillar coalesced. An amazing sight followed, as the ice pillar continued growing larger, bringing Ye Paopao’s body along with it. In a matter of moments, it had grown past the six metre mark, and Ye Paopao quickly stepped off over, dropping down beyond the wall.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er exchanged a rather surprised look. Both of them had sensed that when Ye Paopao created the ice pillar, he had not used any skill. WIthout question, his Elemental Jewel was water, and he had made use of water to form ice just with his Heavenly Energy and Attribute. That sheer control and amount of Heavenly Energy was rather impressive. From that, it was clear that he was likely of higher cultivation level than them, perhaps about the same as Ming Hua, a four-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master. The reason why he was most likely a Heavenly Jewel Master was because only they would have the purity of Element to be able to change water to ice so easily.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing held Shangguan Bing’er by her slim waist, and striking the ground with his right foot, a muffled *Bang* sounded out, and the two of them flew all the way above the six feet wall to the other side. With this, he totally used only physical strength, and was also carrying another person to boot. With that, he slightly showed down Ye Paopao. Of course, this was due to the power of the Demonic Right Leg, but since Ye Paopao had already showed some of his power, how could Zhou Weiqing back down. To be friends with a person like Ye Paopao, one had to prove to be his equal, otherwise the friendship might turn into something else.</p>
 <p>“Junior has indeed much skill.” Ye Paopao praised him, a flash of surprise crossing his eyes. Although he did not personally look at Zhou Weiqing jumping, he could still tell from the energy in the air that Zhou Weiqing had not used any Heavenly Energy at all.</p>
 <p>“Senior is also extremely powerful, even if you were to be in the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy, I estimate that Senior will be one of the top echelons.” Praise was after all free, and who didn’t know how to dole it out freely? However, not everyone had the great acting skills of Zhou Weiqing, who made it sound so sincere.</p>
 <p>Hearing his words, Ye Paopao shook his head bitterly and said: “Junior, the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy is not as simple as you think. To be brutally honest, in our academy, there are few who can compete with me. However, if we compare it to the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy, I would be hard pressed to squeeze into their top 50 ranks, out of their mere student population of only slightly more than a hundred. The Principal of the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy is our Empire’s top strongest Heavenly Jewel Master, he has broken past the Zong Stage and is the only ten-Jeweled King Stage Heavenly Jewel Master in our Empire. Furthermore, their focus is on fighting capabilities, and they have a lot of combat experience, while a lot of our studies and focus is on military knowledge, how could we possibly match them. Without any exaggeration, I would probably be unable to beat a three-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master student of theirs.</p>
 <p>“King Stage Heavenly Jewel Master?” Both Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er drew sharp breaths when they heard that. It might sound like a mere set of Jewels from 9 Jewels to 10 Jewels, but it was not as simple as that. High Level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Masters were already extremely rare, but you could probably still find more than twenty or so in the entire Fei Li Empire. However, there was only the one single King Stage Heavenly Jewel Master, and that was already a whole new power level. To put things in perspective, a single Low Level King Stage Heavenly Jewel Master could easily take out ten High Level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Masters.</p>
 <p>Ye Paopao smiled faintly and said: “There is no need to be so surprised, Junior. The Principal of the Heavenly Jewel Master also has another status, which is our Fei Li Empire’s Skill Storing Palace Master, and is also our Empire Premier Master, and he is already a Mid Level King Stage Heavenly Jewel Master.”</p>
 <p>Once a Heavenly Jewel Master reached the King Stage, the High, Medium and Low Levels were no longer according to the number of Jewels, but according to Heavenly Energy cultivation level. Just from that alone, one could tell how difficult it was to increase in power at that point.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing took a deep breath and said: “I never thought that the Heavenly Jewel Master Academy would be so powerful, and have such a background.”</p>
 <p>Ye Paopao gave a cold smile and said: “No matter how powerful a Heavenly Jewel Master is, they are still a single individual. How can they compare with us, who will become great generals in the future? No matter how powerful an individual is, they will never be able to compete with an entire large army. After all, there is a limit to the amount of Heavenly Energy one can have, and it will run out eventually.”</p>
 <p>“Alright, I’ve said enough. Junior, I have to head back to my class. If you have any issues, do come and look for me. However, I might have to leave in a few days time. If possible, I suggest that you do not leave the academy in the near future, and just stay in the dorms for a while for your own safety. With our Princess as our Principal, no one will dare to come into the Academy to look for trouble. After yesterday’s fight, your commoner class one has already gained their reputation, and it is likely that any of the students will cause more trouble.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled and said: “As long as Senior doesn’t come looking for trouble with me, I am not afraid of anyone else.”</p>
 <p>Ye Paopao laughed heartily and waved towards Zhou Weiqing, before turning to leave.</p>
 <p>When Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er reached their classroom, they immediately felt that the atmosphere was rather strained.</p>
 <p>The class was extremely quiet. Ming Hua had already arrived, and was seated at the front with her brow furrowed slightly. When Zhou Weiqing entered, everyone turned to look at him, and some of the students even stood up.</p>
 <p>“Boss, are you alright?” At least a dozen concerned voices sounded out instantly.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed and said: “What is up with you all? It’s just a small matter, how could anything happen to me?”</p>
 <p>Ming Hua said exasperatedly: “You have caused trouble with more than a dozen noble families, of which there are two Dukes, six Marquis, and nine counts, the rest being viscounts. Is that still considered a small matter? Even the Principal is having trouble dealing with them, and you are treating it as nothing?”</p>
 <p>One of the other classmates stood up abruptly, exclaiming: “Monitor, yesterday’s incident was done by all of us. Damn it, since a young age, I have never experienced such a great feeling. If the academy punishes you, count me in, I will share the responsibility.”</p>
 <p>As soon as he said that, it resonated with all the commoner students, and instantly a commotion arose in the entire class.</p>
 <p>“That’s right, boss! We will all share responsibility! Didn’t you say before, we are an entire family. All for one, and one for all!”</p>
 <p>Seeing his classmates’ excited expressions, Zhou Weiqing felt a warmth in his heart. He knew that his efforts over the past few days had not gone to waste. Not only had they approved of him, their competitive spirits and fighting spirits had also been sparked. This was the most important gain.</p>
 <p>Even Ming Hua stared at the entire class, stunned. She had after all been through the student phase, but she had never seen a class so united, a single student so respected and beloved by everyone. This was just a few days from the start of school, what was going on? If this went on for a longer period, would these commoner students be even willing to die for him?</p>
 <p>At this moment, Ming Hua suddenly felt that her father’s insight was indeed clear. Zhou Weiqing was not just a simple sly, cunning and powerful person. He had a strange leadership quality that just could not be described. Unlike her big brother’s leadership, Zhou Weiqing’s was the sort that could make his followers crazy, perhaps leading them in some ‘bad’ ways. Ming Hua was unable to describe the feeling, but she could clearly feel that it was just like her father had said, they could no longer afford to antagonize him further, to make him an enemy of their Sect.</p>
 <p>“Alright, alright. Everyone quieten down.” Zhou Weiqing raised his hands, motioning for silence. With a faint smile, he said: “Enough said. Yesterday, our Principal has already announced her decision, and there will not be any further changes. Furthermore, even if anything crops up, I do not need you to share the responsibility. After all, that is what the monitor is for. Do you think you call me Boss for nothing? The Boss is there to take the pressure!”</p>
