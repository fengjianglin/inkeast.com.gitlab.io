 <p><strong>Chapter 11 Fei Li Empire Flying Hill City (4)</strong></p>
 <p>After a while, Zhou Weiqing managed to scrounge up some sweet potatoes, and roasted them to eat with Shangguan Bing’er; in his hands even the simple roasted sweet potato also turned into a delicacy. After removing the slightly burnt skin, he scattered a bit of salt on the roasted sweet potato, and the flavor was unexpectedly extremely good.</p>
 <p>What made Zhou Weiqing the saddest was that Shangguan Bing’er still did not let him hunt, throughout the whole 12 days of travelling he had been a vegetarian, he almost felt he was quickly becoming a sweet potato himself.</p>
 <p>“Battalion Commander, didn’t you say earlier that we will be reaching Flying Hill City in a few dozen miles? Why don’t we have a good meal in the city?” Zhou Weiqing said discontentedly as he gnawed on his sweet potato.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er shot a look at him, “Eating a meal in the city is free? One less meal there will save us one meal’s cost.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing rolled his eyes and said, “Forget I said anything. I must make a lot of money in the future, otherwise I’ll be starved to death by you.”</p>
 <p>“Humph.” Shangguan Bing’er did not continue speaking, completely not allowing that rascal the opportunity to continue.</p>
 <p>These past few days had actually been a good training for Zhou Weiqing, the unceasing use of his Wind Attribute Heavenly Energy allowed him to be a lot more familiar with the usage of Heavenly Energy, although he was still unable to wield it like Shangguan Bing’er who could use it like her own arm, but at least he no longer needed to take the time to gather it up before usage.</p>
 <p>The Immortal Deity Technique was slowly starting to display its superiority, Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy upper limits had increased very obviously; if we likened the maximum volume he had at the start to the size of a pigeon egg, it currently was quickly reaching the size of a chicken’s egg. Hurrying along without stopping every day also caused the whirlpools at the 4 Death Acupuncture Points which he had broken through to continuously draw energy at full speed constantly, and that had a great effect on cultivating his total Heavenly Energy. However, it was still quite a distance from breaking through the next stage of the Immortal Deity Technique, to breakthrough the Yongquan Acupuncture Point.</p>
 <p>Yongquan Acupuncture Point, being the last of the Death Acupuncture Points in the first level of the Immortal Deity Technique, it was definitely a lot more difficult to breakthrough, and the meridian route for it was also a lot more complex. Zhou Weiqing had tried one time, but the Heavenly Energy he had currently was unable to even reach the Yongquan Acupuncture Point, and it was clear that he needed to continue cultivating a lot more before he could.</p>
 <p>After an hour, a huge city entered Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er’s eyes.</p>
 <p>The broad city walls that did not seem to have a boundary in their sight, and was about 40 meters tall. Any human standing before the city seemed to be as tiny as an ant in comparison. On top of the city there stood the Fei Li Empire’s national symbol, a pair of Crossed Saintly Sword which was black with gold layers, on a flag which was fluttering in the breeze, showing the formidable empire’s elegant demeanor.</p>
 <p>Three drawbridges gave access to the 50 metre wide moat surrounding the Flying Hill City, connecting to the three giant arched city gates, with the name of the city carved in bold strong characters above the center city gate. The bustle of people entering and leaving the city was endless, and even though they had not entered the city yet, they could already sense the bustling and prosperous scene within.</p>
 <p>It was clear that it was not Shangguan Bing’er’s first time here, as she brought Zhou Weiqing through the central hanging bridge, walking with familiar ease into the depths of the city.</p>
 <p>Within Flying Hill City was a picture of busy, heavy traffic, and Zhou Weiqing looked around unceasingly, feeling as though he could not take in all the sights. This was truly the sign of a great nation! Although the Heavenly Bow City was also quite prosperous, but compared with the Flying Hill City, it really fell short.</p>
 <p>“Battalion Commander, where are we headed to?” Zhou Weiqing lowered his head to have a look at his own rather dirty Heavenly Bow Empire Attire, and said with a rather painstaking look on his face.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er said: “We’ll go to the Skill-Storing Palace first.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing brightened, “Elemental Jewel Skill Storing?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er shook her head, but did not explain further, instead hastening her steps towards the depths of the city. Although she was no longer rushing as they did in the wilderness, but she still moved rather rapidly, causing Zhou Weiqing to be unable to look around at the shops that lined the path, and he could only follow closely beside her.</p>
 <p>The Flying Hill City was really too huge, and the both of them walked for almost an hour before Shangguan Bing’er finally slowed down, and as Zhou Weiqing followed her gaze to look ahead, he saw that not far off to the front there was a large building that seemed like a grand palace. Although he was not familiar with the Flying Hill City, he could tell that this should be the central business district of the City. The Palace in front was several tens of meters high, with 12 huge white columns supporting the building. Right in the center position, a huge golden Cross Saint Sword symbol stood out strikingly. Just with a quick look with the naked eye, it was rather difficult to judge exactly how big the palace was.</p>
 <p>Behind the 12 great columns stood a large gate, and stationed in on both sides of the gate were eight soldiers who were all dressed in shining silver armor, their weapons were heavy swords, which were one and a half meter long and almost a foot thick thick! The heavy swords were rested on the ground, with their both hands grasping the sword hilt, as their ice-cold gazes kept a constant look out on every passing pedestrian. The 50 meters surrounding radius of the palace was void of any average pedestrian, as none dared approach it, clearly showing its status in the city.</p>
 <p>After Shangguan Bing’er had paused for a while, she brought Zhou Weiqing and headed towards the palace building; obviously this was the Skill Storing Palace that she had mentioned earlier.</p>
 <p>“Halt.” The two outermost silver armored soldiers simultaneously shouted in a low tone, the two heavy swords lifted off the ground and blocking Shangguan Bing’er and Zhou Weiqing paths. From the col looks that were focused on them, Zhou Weiqing could feel a clear killing intent.</p>
 <p>These soldiers were clearly elite infantry soldiers who had been forged in the fires of the battlefield, and their Heavenly Bow Empire did not have any such elite infantry soldiers, as the cost to build such an army was really too high. Yet, in the Fei Li Empire, they were actually used as palace guards!</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er stopped immediately, and lifted her right hand, with a bright flash of light, her two pale green pure Dragonstone Jade Physical Jewels appeared above her milky white wrists, sparkling brilliantly.</p>
 <p>With 2 loud clangs, the two heavy swords fell back to the ground, and the silver soldiers’ said respectful: “Welcome, Mid Level Heavenly Shi Master, please enter.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er nodded, and turned to Zhou Weiqing: “Show your Physical Jewel.”</p>
 <p>“Oh.” Zhou Weiqing gave the silver armor an envying look as he moved his Heavenly Energy while lifting his right hand, at the same time he was secretly thinking that the defense of the silver armor should be really good, if he could just wear it, arrows shot from a distance would probably not be able to penetrate it, such a good thing!</p>
 <p>A pure Icy Jade Physical Jewel appeared around Zhou Weiqing’s right wrist as he showed it to the silver armored soldiers; the gleam in the Physical Jewel seemed as a layer of icy fog was about to erupt from the Jewel.</p>
 <p>“Low Level Heavenly Shi Master, please enter.” Previously they had only set down their heavy swords, but after seeing the pure Physical Jewels on Zhou Weiqing’s right wrist, which meant he was also a Heavenly Jewel Master, the two silver armored soldiers simultaneously took a step back, making a path for them to enter.</p>
