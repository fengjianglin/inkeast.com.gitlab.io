<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>The look in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes started to change, and all the changes corresponded with the look in Shen Bu’s eyes. His gaze was first gentle, then pitiful, followed by worry and finally sorrow and regret. He passed the hammer in his right hand to his left hand. It seemed as though he could no longer control himself - he leapt down from the sky. He extended his right arm, pouncing towards Shen Bu.</p>
 <p>Shen Bu remained calm, but she had a look of excitement on her face, as well as a yearnful look. However, her eyes were filled with bashfulness and joy. Being able to cultivate the Charm Attribute to such a level meant that she had reached the stage where it was her true self.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Finally, Zhou Weiqing had arrived before her; both of their bodies coincided in the sky. The right arm that Zhou Weiqing had extended earlier reached out to hug Shen Bu. Shen Bu appeared cute and helpless-looking, snuggling up against his chest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, in the midst of the bashfulness and joy in her eyes, her right hand that was hidden within her sleeve had already became black - every finger was like a black pointed awl. Even though they appeared to be gently stroking Zhou Weiqing’s chest, nobody could tell that her hand was extremely deadly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She was waiting; waiting for Zhou Weiqing to hug her. And in that moment, when his emotions were being manipulated by her Charm Attribute and his heart was at its most tender and loving state, she would take the opportunity to kill him. Unfortunately, she did not have enough time. Or else, she would be able to do what she enjoyed most - waiting for a man to reach the peak of his happiness as he was all over her, before taking his life. The indescribable pleasure achieved from that was what Shen Bu loved the most.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Was Zhou Weiqing truly going to hug her? Indeed, he had hugged her. Unfortunately, what he hugged was not Shen Bu’s body.</p>
 <p>His right hand had evaded Shen Bu’s line of sight; in the moment when he was about to place his hand on her slender waist, Zhou Weiqing’s hand suddenly changed its direction and placed itself gently on Shen Bu’s neck.</p>
 <p>His gentle voice rang in Shen Bu’s ear, “If I were you, I would keep those demon claws to myself.”</p>
 <p>At this moment, Shen Bu’s right hand was less than three inches away from Zhou Weiqing’s chest. It was only three inches - a negligible distance to a Heavenly Emperor powerhouse such as herself, yet she was unable to complete her attack.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Disbelief filled Shen Bu’s eyes. She could not believe that Zhou Weiqing was able to escape the crutches of her Charm Attribute. Furthermore, all the indicators from before had clearly shown that he was already completely under the control of her Charm Attribute.</p>
 <p>There was a reason accounting for her self-confidence - even someone like Fen Tian would similarly be unable to resist her Charm Attribute without prior preparations!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The males present could only feel 1% of the effects of her Charm Attribute, and its effects should have impacted Zhou Weiqing the most. Discounting the fact that he was a young man, even if he was a frail old man, Shen Bu was confident of successfully seducing him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“This is impossible!” Shen Bu screamed almost immediately. Her scream had caused the people watching below to get startled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>This fight appeared to be the mildest one, but everyone knew that the killing intent on either side could erupt at any moment. How did Zhou Weiqing turn things around at the last moment? The members of the Blood Red Hell in particular were in disbelief with regards to what had happened.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing tightened his Yang Giant Spirit Palms on Shen Bu’s smooth and glowing neck that was akin to silk. Even though he did not exert much strength, he managed to stimulate the skin on Shen Bu’s neck to shiver. She was very clear that if Zhou Weiqing wanted to take her life, he could do it easily without any effort.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“How did you break out of my Charm Attribute?” asked Shen Bu, who was extremely reluctant to accept reality. She was a psychologically warped woman, and that was the reason why she had been able to cultivate the Charm Attribute to such a level. One could say that the Charm Attribute was her everything - it was even more important and precious to her than the Heavenly Energy was to a Heavenly Jewel Master. She had a type of perverted narcissism towards the Charm Attribute. It was impossible for her to accept the fact that the Charm Attribute was that easily broken by Zhou Weiqing. In her eyes, this blow that she suffered was even more painful than death.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing squeezed Shen Bu’s neck, as the look in his eyes went back to its normal state. He looked down towards the Hell Lord of the Blood Red Hell, Fen Tian, and mocked him, “It was not that hard - no matter how powerful your Charm Attribute is, it doesn’t change the fact that you’re an old witch. All I had to do was tell myself that. If an old witch in her seventies tries to seduce me, I will feel very disgusted. So, how could it be possible for you to control me? Never did I expect the Blood Red Hell to stoop so low to the point of sending an old witch like you to use sex appeal against your opponents! Tsk tsk tsk……”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Splat ——” Shen Bu spat out a mouthful of blood. Every single one of Zhou Weiqing’s words hammered her heart with force, especially when he used the words “old witch in her seventies”. She felt as though she was about to die from anger.</p>
 <p>Relentless energy ripples suddenly erupted from Shen Bu’s body. As she spat out blood, she had chosen to detonate her Heavenly Core Nucleus. She wanted to use her blood to wash away the humiliation. At this very moment, there was no longer a gentle and amorous look in her eyes - only hysteria.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, at this moment, Shen Bu suddenly felt Zhou Weiqing’s right hand, that was grabbing her neck, tremble for a bit. The look in his eyes had suddenly became brighter, as though he had been vindicated. Immediately after, his right hand slid down and sliced into Shen Bu’s body from her back, forcefully intercepting the detonation of her Heavenly Core Nucleus.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“You ——” Shen Bu looked dumbfoundedly at Zhou Weiqing, while chaos ensued below. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the moment when Shen Bu chose to detonate her Heavenly Core Nucleus, Shen Mo had already charged out and headed towards the sky, wanting to pounce in the direction of where Zhou Weiqing was. However, he was being stopped by the Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya. On the other hand, Fen Tian thrusted his palm in the air, sending Wu Yunyue flying upon impact before spitting out a mouthful of blood. Ling Dang flew out from where the Peerless Sect was gathered at. She extended both hands, temporarily blocking Fen Tian’s attacks.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shen Bu did not seem to notice the chaos that was happening below. She glared at Zhou Weiqing and said, “You……you actually were under my control……am……I right?” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded. There was a tinge of awkwardness on his face.</p>
 <p>Shen Bu laughed; she actually laughed at this very moment, “I…… knew…… it. I……knew it. …… nobody can resist…… my……Charm……Attribute, you are……not an exception either……Even though……I don’t know how……you did it, but, I……did not lose. My……Charm Attribute……did not lose… ——” Once again, she spat out a mouthful of blood. At last, the seductress met her demise.</p>
 <p>Indeed, Zhou Weiqing could not be immune to Shen Bu’s Charm Attribute. The Hell Lord of the Blood Red Hell, Fen Tian, could not be immune to it, despite possessing the Destruction Attribute. Zhou Weiqing, who possessed the Saint Attribute, was the same.</p>
 <p>Even though Shen Bu’s heart was completely warped, in truth, she was considered a genius - the Charm Attribute that she created on her own was extremely powerful. Her charm that was in unity with the worldly logic was absolutely one of a kind. A Heavenly God could not be immune to it either. After all, she was already a Heavenly Emperor. Upon merging with the Destruction Attribute, enhancing her Charm Attribute, it had never failed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Furthermore, just like what Fen Tian had predicted before, a young man would possess a much greater desire towards a woman, compared to old fellows like them. Hence, when Zhou Weiqing and Shen Bu exchanged glances, he had already been trapped by the Charm Attribute.</p>
 <p>Of course, just like what Tian’er had mentioned before, even if Zhou Weiqing was trapped by Shen Bu’s Charm Attribute, it was impossible for him to lose the fight. That was because Shen Bu’s main ability was the Charm Attribute - her offensive power could not break through his ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Set, as well as the defense put in place by his&nbsp;Dragon-Tiger Demon God Transformation.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing knew for a fact that he was unable to resist Shen Bu’s charms the moment he first looked into her eyes. Indeed, he had given himself a psychological cue - but it was not a cue for him to directly resist it. If that was the case, he would definitely reveal signs of struggle, and it would be difficult for him to deal with Shen Bu. After all, she was a Heavenly Emperor. If the fight was prolonged, Zhou Weiqing’s will might not be able to last for that long.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing had always been a very careful person - naturally, he had done all prior preparations, right when Shen Bu was about to launch an attack. Regardless of how powerful the Charm Attribute was, at Zhou Weiqing’s current cultivation base, the Saint Energy would instinctively protect his body the moment it was subjected to external attacks. At the same time, his body would form a powerful resistance. The psychological cue that Zhou Weiqing had given himself was activated in an instant and caused him to promptly attack Shen Bu, not giving her a chance to continue charming him with the Charm Attribute. Hence, he managed to win the fight.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>If everything went according to Zhou Weiqing’s plans, the chances of victory were rather high. After all, Zhou Weiqing did not make any major errors in his judgment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, some people did not want Zhou Weiqing to be that passive. Hence, before Zhou Weiqing was being charmed by her, a bout of energy that stealthily came from the Peerless Sect had freed him from Shen Bu’s Charm Technique.</p>
 <p>After all, the Charm Attribute was not invincible, just like how everything in this world had something that could be used against them. Hence, he had an unfair advantage in this battle. Of course, only Zhou Weiqing knew that. Shen Bu only saw the truth at the last moment when she looked at Zhou Weiqing’s face. Unfortunately, this Charm Technique of the seductress was now a lost art. There was nothing wrong with the attribute, if it was used in the right way.</p>
 <p>Looking at how Zhou Weiqing had killed off Shen Bu, Shen Mo seemed to have gone berserk - the Heavenly God erupted at a low altitude, causing the other Great Saint Lands to have no other choice but to create a joint defense barrier that was made from the Heavenly Energy in order to protect themselves.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fen Tian’s eyes burned with anger, but he did not continue to follow through with his attack. Instead, he shouted towards Shen Mo, “Come back.”</p>
 <p>Although Shen Mo was a Heavenly God, coupled with the fact that he was extremely infuriated, the moment he heard Fen Tian’s voice, he ultimately restrained his impulses and descended back to the ground. On the other hand, the Six Ultimate Heavenly God Long Shiya looked rather unhappy. The other party’s series of tempestuous-like attacks had caused him to be put under a tremendous amount of pressure.&nbsp;</p>
