 <p><strong>Chapter 246: Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s Uncertainty (3)</strong></p>
 <p>“Why aren’t you dodging anymore?” Dreamwake said coldly.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said angrily: “You are at least at the Heavenly King stage or higher. Being able to dodge once is already a miracle, but can I keep dodging? Furthermore, this is in a Spatial area of your choosing… no matter what, the final result is death, right? In that case, I might as well die in a straightforward fashion instead of wasting time. Come on then, kill me.”</p>
 <p>Closing his eyes with his head held high, hands behind his back, Zhou Weiqing looked the picture of a heroic martyr accepting his death bravely.</p>
 <p>Dreamwake said coldly: “Don’t you want to know why I wish to kill you?”</p>
 <p>Naturally, Zhou Weiqing would not fall for such a tactic. His eyes remained close as he retorted: “Dying is dying, what is the point of knowing all that? Hurry up, make it quick and painless.”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the stabbing pain on his skin vanished.&nbsp;Zhou Weiqing opened his eyes once more, only to see that the sword-light in front of him had vanished without a trace.</p>
 <p>Dreamwake stared at him hatefully.&nbsp;“Zhou Weiqing, you bastard.&nbsp;You dared to molest me!&nbsp;Even if I can’t kill you, I’ll definitely make you pay a price for what you did.&nbsp;Don’t say I gave you no chance at all.&nbsp;I’ll only use the six-Jeweled cultivation level to fight you.&nbsp;If you can beat me, I’ll send you out of this place.&nbsp;Otherwise, I really will kill you.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing actually calmed down when he saw that angry look in her eyes.&nbsp;As he had thought, it was because of what had happened the other day.&nbsp;She hadn’t discovered his true identity after all.&nbsp;It made sense!&nbsp;He didn’t make any mistakes at all; how could she have discovered who he was?</p>
 <p>“Then what if I win?”&nbsp;Zhou Weiqing’s eyes spun craftily as he said this.</p>
 <p>Dreamwake said coldly, “If you win, then we’ll just forget about what happened the other day.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing snorted.&nbsp;“If you only use the six-Jeweled cultivation stage, you probably won’t be a match for me.&nbsp;However… who can guarantee that you won’t cheat?&nbsp;Your cultivation stage vastly surpasses mine, after all.”</p>
 <p>Dreamwake was enraged.&nbsp;“What type of a person do you think I am?&nbsp;I’ve never gone back on my words before!”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing didn’t hesitate at all.&nbsp;“Swear an oath!&nbsp;If you cheat and use more than a six-Jeweled cultivation base, you have to spend a night with me.”</p>
 <p>“You…!”&nbsp;Dreamwake was so enraged she nearly vomited blood.&nbsp;“You bastard, you shameless bastard!&nbsp;I completely misjudged you.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing shrugged.&nbsp;“And how am I shameless?&nbsp;You want my life.&nbsp;All I’m asking for is your body.&nbsp;Actually, come to think of it, it feels like you are the one taking advantage of me!&nbsp;And besides, you are the one who instigated this fight.&nbsp;If you aren’t willing to swear an oath, that’s proof that you are already planning on cheating.”</p>
 <p>“Fine!&nbsp;I’ll swear the oath!&nbsp;Zhou Weiqing, I’m definitely going to kill you today.&nbsp;This ‘bet’ is nothing more than me giving myself an excuse to do just that.&nbsp;I, Dreamwake, swear that if I use more than the six-Jeweled cultivation stage in my upcoming duel against Zhou Weiqing, then… then…”&nbsp;She repeated the word ‘then’ twice, her face turning red.&nbsp;She finally gritted her teeth and spat it out: “Then I’ll spend a night with him.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing roared with laughter.&nbsp;“Come on, then!&nbsp;Don’t regret what you just said.”&nbsp;While speaking, he leapt off the ground and retreated backwards while a dark-gold aura suddenly emanated from his body.</p>
 <p>Even though Dreamwake had already guessed that he definitely had access to a God Tier Consolidated Equipment set, when she actually saw those six pieces of dark-gold light flicker she couldn’t help but narrow her eyes.&nbsp;But of course, she didn’t know that Zhou Weiqing actually had a total of seven pieces of Consolidated Equipment, with the final piece being the Overlord’s Bow.</p>
 <p>The Dual Legendary Hammers appeared within Zhou Weiqing’s hands.&nbsp;Zhou Weiqing felt as though his entire body was filled with absolutely terrifying power.&nbsp;The two hammers, the Yin-Yang Giant Spirit Palms, the breastplate with pauldrons, and the layered war kilt which protected his waist came together to form the six pieces of his Hate Ground No Handle set.&nbsp;Powerful dark-golden light gleamed from him, causing his entire body emanate an aura of weighty power.</p>
 <p>Dreamwake let out a cold snort as six beams of dark-golden light suddenly shone from her body as well.&nbsp;The aura, however, was completely different from the mighty, overbearing aura of Zhou Weiqing’s ‘Hate Ground No Handle’ set.&nbsp;Her Legendary Set was more like a set of scales.</p>
 <p>The breastplate was the first to appear, and at its center was a series of outwards-protruding diamonds, with a dark-red diamond-shaped rune imprinted at the middle.&nbsp;The pauldrons were long and sleek, stylized to have draconic heads appear to each side which completely covered her fragrant shoulders.&nbsp;The scaled armor stretched to cover her arms all the way to her hands, which now appeared like a pair of sharp draconic claws.&nbsp;Not just that – the armor also stretched down her flank to cover both her legs as well.</p>
 <p>It could be said that aside from her head, Dreamwake’s entire body had been covered by this Legendary Set.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing stared wide-eyed.&nbsp;How was this possible?&nbsp;This was just a six-piece set of God Tier Consolidated Equipment.&nbsp;How could it cover her entire body?&nbsp;He also had six pieces, but his legs remained uncovered.&nbsp;Unless… unless…</p>
 <p>Dreamwake slowly lifted her right hand up.&nbsp;Zhou Weiqing’s heart instantly clenched.&nbsp;Her Jewels were actually the same as Shangguan Fei’er’s; they were Dual Physical Jewels!&nbsp;They granted flexibility and strength.&nbsp;No wonder her Legendary Set was able to cover such a wide area!&nbsp;Even though she only had six pieces, it covered her entire body.&nbsp;If she managed to get all ten pieces of her Legendary Set, then… the seventh piece would be the helmet, but what would the rest be?&nbsp;All weapons?&nbsp;But her draconic claws were already weapons!</p>
 <p>Dual Physical Jewels and Alexandrite Cat’s Eyes.&nbsp;This girl’s innate gifts were every bit as amazing as his own!&nbsp;No wonder she was so confident that she could defeat him even if she limited herself to the six-Jeweled stage.</p>
 <p>However… when Zhou Weiqing saw how powerful she was, his competitiveness was stimulated.&nbsp;Both of them were limiting themselves to the six-Jeweled stage.&nbsp;Was he really supposed to be inferior to her?</p>
 <p>He slammed his Dual Hammers together in front of him, producing a deafening explosion as the light of the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation spread out, transforming into a six-pointed star that appeared beneath his feet.</p>
 <p>Dreamwake narrowed her eyes, but her movements didn’t slow down.&nbsp;She didn’t use any techniques at all, simply shooting forward lightning-fast to pounce towards Zhou Weiqing with explosive speed and strength, revealing the power contained in her body.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but feel his heart shudder when he thought back to how he had once held his arm around her soft, almost boneless waist.&nbsp;So her gentle, supple body actually was capable of unleashing such terrifying levels of strength?</p>
 <p>However, Zhou Weiqing didn’t let his thoughts slow down his movements.&nbsp;He knew that if he lost this battle, even if the enraged Dreamwake didn’t kill him, she’d tear him to shreds.</p>
 <p>Faced with Dreamwake’s attack, Zhou Weiqing took a step forwards with his left foot, sweeping upwards with his Dual Hammers while roaring, “Open!”</p>
 <p>His Dual Legendary Hammers were absolutely enormous.&nbsp;When Zhou Weiqing made this movement, his hammers struck in succession in a way which completely blocked and sealed off Dreamwake’s attack zone.</p>
 <p>Dreamwake’s draconic claws almost instantly fell upon the two enormous hammer-heads of the Dual Legendary Hammers.</p>
 <p>“Eeeeeek?!”&nbsp;A surprised squawk rang out as her body almost instantly begun to spin in midair.&nbsp;She wasn’t doing this on purpose; it had happened because of the tremendous power the Dual Hammers had applied to her.</p>
 <p>Dreamwake had originally simply wanted to test Zhou Weiqing’s power.&nbsp;Although she was merely using the six-Jeweled cultivation level, that wasn’t factoring in her physical strength and might.&nbsp;The fact that she had dual Physical Jewels had given her tremendous confidence in her physical strength.&nbsp;She felt that she didn’t need to use any techniques at all; Zhou Weiqing definitely wouldn’t be her match!&nbsp;However, when she had reached out with her draconic claws towards Zhou Weiqing’s hammers, something completely unexpected had happened.</p>
 <p>The laughing-face hammer had avoided her full-strength claw attack, while the crying-face hammer had unleashed a terrifying amount of power which completely surpassed her expectations.&nbsp;One side had been ‘empty’, while the other side had been ‘real’.&nbsp;This disparity in force and momentum sent Dreamwake’s body spinning uncontrollably through the air.</p>
 <p>How could Zhou Weiqing give up such a fine opportunity?&nbsp;He lashed out with his right leg like a whip, sending it sweeping towards Dreamwake.&nbsp;At the same time, he activated his Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation, unleashing a hundred Lightning Pearls without any notice at all and sending them towards the path which the still-spinning Dreamwake was sure to take as she descended.&nbsp;His opponent was a true Heavenly King; there was no way Zhou Weiqing could hold back against her!&nbsp;Now that he was lucky enough to seize the initiative, he was going to follow his normal combat style and press the assault until he won.</p>
 <p>However, right at this moment, Dreamwake revealed her own formidable skills.&nbsp;She almost instantly seized control over her body, managing to curl into a ball as she flew through the air while kicking out with her leg.&nbsp;Her kick intersected with Zhou Weiqing’s own kick, and as this happened a layer of blue light suddenly burst out of her body.&nbsp;The light was extremely soft and gentle.&nbsp;It didn’t go ‘block’ the Lightning Pearls, but instead ‘covered’ them and then tossed them far away.&nbsp;In doing so, it completely severed the connection between them and Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p><em>What powerful control!</em> Zhou Weiqing was secretly impressed. Right at this moment, their two legs clashed viciously against each other.</p>
 <p>BOOM!&nbsp;An explosion rang out, and it was still Dreamwake who was the worse for the wear.&nbsp;Her curled-up body was kicked over thirty meters away by Zhou Weiqing, and when she landed she had to stumble seven or eight steps back before stabilizing herself.</p>
 <p>Dreamwake stared at Zhou Weiqing, a stunned look on her face.&nbsp;Naturally, she couldn’t accept this outcome.&nbsp;Her Physical Jewels included the strength attribute, and she had dual Physical Jewels!&nbsp;By all rights, she should be stronger than Zhou Weiqing, especially with her legs being covered by her Legendary Set while Zhou Weiqing’s right leg was unprotected.&nbsp;And yet, she had actually lost this test of strength.&nbsp;Her own right leg actually felt numb.&nbsp;How could she not be shocked?</p>
 <p>When Zhou Weiqing saw that stunned look on her face, he knew what had her puzzled.&nbsp;He chuckled: “Dreamwake, have you forgotten my background?&nbsp;I come from the Legacy of Strength.&nbsp;The word ‘strength’ isn’t just for show!&nbsp;I’ll be honest and tell you the truth – my Legendary Set is named ‘Hate Ground No Handle’ and focuses exclusively on increasing strength.&nbsp;Each additional piece will cause my power to double.&nbsp;Six pieces means that I am now sixty-four times stronger!&nbsp;Even in a normal fight with you using Heavenly King-level strength, I still wouldn’t fear you in a test of pure strength, to say nothing of right now with you having restrained your own cultivation level.”</p>
 <p>But of course, this was also with Zhou Weiqing suppressing his own cultivation level. Otherwise, if he poured his Saint Energy into his real strength, he would dare to fight even Heavenly Emperor powerhouses in a head-on collision.</p>
