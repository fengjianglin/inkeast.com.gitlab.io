 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Zhou Weiqing didn’t hide anything from me. I also voiced my suspicions and asked him why he did it. He said he didn’t know why… but, that he had no regrets.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She took another deep breath, glistening teardrops appearing in her eyes, “Elders, your worries were correct. Zhou Weiqing came with a goal in mind, the Spatial Teleportation Gem. However, has he done anything to harm our palace? No, on the contrary, he saved all of us. And us? &nbsp;We’ve suspected him and even acted against him. &nbsp;I can’t accept something like this… and I have given him the gem already.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four Grand Elders became aghast after hearing the last sentence. &nbsp;Dong Fang exclaimed: “What!? You actually gave him the gem? Hanyue, how could you do this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dongfang Hanyue answered calmly, “Why can’t I? At the very least, I am still the Palace Master right now. According to the rules, the Master can use all of the palace’s resources. Think about it, how old is Zhou Weiqing right now? Moreover, he isn’t like me, who relied on inheriting legacy to gain power. &nbsp;He only relied only on his own cultivation talents. Yes, he is from the Boundless Mainland and will return there for sure. But, isn’t befriending someone who is almost guaranteed to reach the Heavenly God realm in the future far better than keeping a gem that can’t be used many more times? I hope to befriend him. &nbsp;Who knows what kind of support he will give us in the future? &nbsp;By choosing to capture Bing’er, you’ve ruined all of my sacrifices and plans. Maybe I can’t convince everyone here but you can’t convince me either. I can accept no longer being the Xuantian Palace Master, but if you wish to act against Zhou Weiqing I absolutely refuse to take part.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her eyes became quite fierce as she added, “One last thing. &nbsp;Zhou Weiqing didn’t get the gem for free. He gave a part of his Saint Energy to me, and I can feel that with its magical power, the bottleneck from father’s inheritance shouldn’t be a problem any longer.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With that, she stood up and left decisively in order to find and talk to Shangguan Bing’er.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The faces of the five people remaining turned ugly after seeing her leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dong Fang sighed and said, “A girl’s heart eventually leaves home! This foolish girl, does she not know that they can’t become a couple?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Water Elder smiled wryly, “It looks like we need to carefully consider our Palace Master’s words. We can’t lose our relationship to her over a stranger. &nbsp;Besides, it’s not like she didn’t make sense! Maybe she is the one with the better vision.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A musing glimmer appeared in Dong Fang’s eyes. &nbsp;“If Hanyue could actually reach the Heavenly God level, that would be far more valuable than a Spatial Teleportation Gem.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing naturally didn’t know what has transpired back at the palace as he used his fastest speed to return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could already see the distant mountain range where the Xuantian Palace was located, and his fury burned brighter and brighter. &nbsp;He had repeatedly tried to communicate with Bing’er to no avail. That seed of anxiety had transformed into a fiery rage. &nbsp;For the sake of his love, he wouldn’t mind doing battle against the entire world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Alas, regardless of his current mood, he just couldn’t find it in him to be angry at Dongfang Hanyue. What was he going to do now?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sneak into the citadel? No, that’s virtually impossible</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If the people from the palace have captured Bing’er, they would be expecting me to come rescue her secretly. With their numerical advantage as well as the Tenebrous Demon Dragon, a secret rescue would impossible. If that’s the case, then I might as well act a bit more brashly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Having thought to this point, Zhou Weiqing didn’t slow down and continued flying towards the citadel. The Saint Energy seemed to be boiling inside his body. With his current cultivation, flying long distances in the winged Dragon-Tiger form wasn’t a great burden on his body. The Saint Energy remained ‘full’ from start to finish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The palace eventually appeared in sight. &nbsp;Right at this moment, shouts rang out, and over a hundred shadows rushed into the skies in order to stop Zhou Weiqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wasn’t too clear on just how powerful Xuantian Palace was in combat, but as the only Great Saint Land in the Xuantian Continent, how could they not be strong?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He stopped in the sky and looked down carefully. Those who were flying up weren’t just Heavenly Jewel Masters, they were riding Heavenly Beasts as well. The beasts’ cultivation varied but they were all powerful flying creatures. The weakest was around the Zun Stage while the masters were all at the five-Jeweled level and above. Clearly, they had immediately rushed up after detecting Weiqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He calmly floated there and let this aerial ‘army’ surround him without moving. &nbsp;He shouted towards the citadel’s direction, “Dongfang Hanyue, come out here or don’t blame me showing no mercy.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Energy came from his dantian to empower this shout. With his Saint Energy and nine-Jeweled cultivation, the flying beasts in front of him all were all blasted backwards, one after another. The overbearing and furious voice resounded across the valley and echoed back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These Heavenly Jewel Masters still haven’t attacked him… because some of them recognized him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When joining the palace, Zhou Weiqing had revealed his brilliance during his welcoming banquet and shocked all of the upper echelon members. These commanders of the aerial army had participated in that party as well, so they naturally recognized him as Consecrated Zhou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The palace has been keeping Shangguan Bing’er’s matter a strict secret, and so these people didn’t know what has happened between Zhou Weiqing and their sect.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Consecrated Zhou, what are you saying? Please calm down first.” A nine-Jeweled master controlled his mount and flew before Weiqing. He respectfully saluted him and smiled. At the same time, his eyes were full of amazement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The large wings behind the Dragon-Tiger Transformation spread out wide, and his skin was covered with violet draconic runes which pulsated with dominating power. More importantly, Zhou Weiqing no longer hid his number of Jewels. &nbsp;He had nine Jewels in each hand! This was an immense difference compared to the five Jewels he had back at the party. How could these experts not feel shocked?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing smiled calmly. &nbsp;“This isn’t your problem. As long as you don’t attack me, I won’t hurt you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The commander felt a bit speechless. He couldn’t help but think to himself, “We have more than one hundred men on top of supporting Heavenly Beasts. Even if this guy is as strong as nine oxen, how could he hurt us?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite thinking this, he didn’t dare to issue a command to attack. Who knew why this was happening? What if it was only a misunderstanding? If they hurt Consecrated Zhou, how were they going to report this to their superiors? Moreover, he was a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master as well. Everyone wanted to be on his good side for further benefits!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing’s loud shout was effective. Within the citadel, at least ten more Heavenly Jewel Masters all came out. Among this cluster were Dong Fang and the four Grand Elders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing’s expression sank after seeing this. His rage surged even more.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dongfang Hanyue still won’t come out to see me? Is she feeling guilty?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Consecrated Zhou, please come down and talk.” The masked Dong Fang beckoned at Weiqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Surrounded by the aerial army, Zhou Weiqing slowly descended. &nbsp;He stared at the other side of the abyss, staring towards Dong Fang and the others. &nbsp;He said coldly, “Are you the fake or real palace master? The only person I want to talk to is the person who is in charge?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Dong Fang frowned slightly. “Consecrated Zhou, calm down first. We are very appreciative of your help during the crucial moments of the disaster. What are you trying to do right now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing smiled brightly. “Appreciative? Really? Then where is my wife? Your way of repaying me is to capture her? I’ll have you know, if even a strand of hair from Bing’er is missing, I will bathe the Xuantian Citadel with blood and and erase your palace from this continent.”</span></p>

She had originally discussed this over with the four Grand Elders previously and decided to repair their relations with Zhou Weiqing for her daughter’s sake. Moreover, they thought that Hanyue’s perspective made sense as well. The Spatial Teleportation Gem was already in his possession. If he actually chose to abandon Shangguan Bing’er, not only would they lose him, but they would also have made an enemy out of this young man, who would definitely become a peerless powerhouse in the future. Thus, it was simpler to return Bing’er to him in order to improve their relationship and let him leave quickly. He had to return to the Boundless Mainland anyhow, so even if he caused trouble it wouldn’t be here at the Xuantian Continent.</span></p>

Dong Fang might not be the real Palace Master, but given her position, she was only below one person and above all others at the Palace. Given her prestige, she has never been yelled at so aggressively by anyone. Not even Hanyue would dare to do so!</span></p>

You brat, you aren’t even a Heavenly King yet. &nbsp;You dare to boast about bathing the Xuantian Palace in blood?</span></p>
