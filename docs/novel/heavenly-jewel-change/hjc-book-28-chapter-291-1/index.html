<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>After he had launched that attack, the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor’s face had turned pale; even the black flames that were raging around his body, an amalgamation of the Destruction Attribute and Fire Attribute, became a lot dimmer instantly. This attack was the most powerful attack launched by condensing his own Heavenly Core Nucleus, with the Fire Attribute burning Life flames. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wu Yunyue snorted coldly. He swung the Sword of the Demonic Emperor in the air; the crystal clear sword flew right out of his hand, transforming into a crystal-like ray of light, charging ruthlessly towards the black crescent-shaped Destruction blade light.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Pssst ——</p>
 <p>This time, their collision did not create any loud exploding sound. When the gray and black light collided in the sky, it was akin to butter coming into contact with a hot knife, creating an odd ear-piercing sizzling sound.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Be it the black or the gray light - both visibly melted quickly. Ultimately, both of them counteracted each other at the same time in the air.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was apparent who the victor and the loser were. Even though the Demonic Emperor had lost his Consolidating Weapon, and at least within a short period of time he would be unable to use the Sword of the Demonic Emperor, the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor had drained a lot more energy in comparison - he had consumed his own core essence energy. One must not underestimate that attack - if it had landed on a mountain that was less than a thousand meters tall, it would have instantly cut it into halves.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“We concede defeat.” Fen Tian shouted as soon as both parties had collided.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, would Wu Yunyue stop right there? Of course not.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>While he tossed out the Sword of the Demonic Emperor, Wu Yunyue began to make his move. The Blue Rain Hibiscus Mutabilis stealthily appeared behind the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor. It was impossible for it to restrict his movements, but the Blue Rain Hibiscus Mutabilis wound around from behind, causing the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor’s body to become slightly rigid.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>That was good enough for the Demonic Emperor. A ray of blue light wound around his legs from below; Wu Yunyue felt his body was being dragged hard, causing him to sink downwards abruptly. The moment he had sunk five meters below, he was being dragged upwards once more by a blue thread in the opposite direction. His entire being formed a polygonal line with distinct corners.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor’s body was becoming rigid, Wu Yunyue had already arrived before his eyes.</p>
 <p>Naturally, the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor was not going to sit idly, waiting for death to come. However, he was not able to dodge. At the crucial moment, the only thing he could do was to defend himself as much as possible. He thrusted both fists at the same time - erupting what was left of the Destruction Attribute without holding back at all, in a bid to resist against Wu Yunyue.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Wu Yunyue had already revealed his formidable Demonic Emperor self. Without dodging at all, and without using any skill or technique, he similarly thrusted both fists.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The four fists collided, as a dull thud was heard, the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor groaned, before his body flew out. At the same time, both arms were twisted backwards, they had already been fractured.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, a blue thread that came from the Blue Rain Hibiscus Mutabilis had quietly appeared. Both ends of the thread tied themselves to Wu Yunyue and the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor’s waists respectively.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor got flung away, the blue thread had dragged Wu Yunyue along with him. The Demonic Emperor took the opportunity to thrust his palm on the chest of his opponent as hard as he could.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>An ear-piercing exploding sound erupted in the air. The Legendary Set on the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor’s body broke into pieces, scattering all over. The last layer of protection on his body had subsequently vanished.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Stop right there.” Fen Tian’s admission of defeat had rang out quite some time, but the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue continued to launch attacks on his opponent, as though he did not hear his voice. It was impossible for him not to be mad - his figure flashed and leapt into the sky. Terrifying Destruction will, akin to violent waves, swept towards Wu Yunyue in the sky.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Hell Lord, I don’t think that’s something you should do, right? Zhou Weiqing’s sluggish voice was heard. Immediately after, a layer of black curtain of light that was mixed with bright white light unfolded in the sky, obstructing Fen Tian’s Destruction will.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The black light curtain was similar to a huge cloth. In the moment it unfolded, countless bright starlight started scattering down from the middle of it, obstructing Fen Tian’s Destruction will entirely.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>When Fen Tian’s Destruction will exploded, his entire being had already soared up into the sky. Even though his will was being obstructed, it did not stop him from flying in the sky. And as Zhou Weiqing released his Astral Celestial Territory, he had also relied on Spatial Law to arrive there.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Blood Red Hell versus the Peerless Sect; Fen Tian versus Zhou Weiqing. They were exchanging blows, without holding back at all, in the sky.</p>
 <p>Fen Tian’s Destruction Energy was different from all the other powerhouses that Zhou Weiqing had encountered, who also possessed the Destruction Attribute. If those powerhouses released the Destruction Attribute in one-faceted forms, then the Destruction Attribute released by Fen Tian could be described as countless swift knife edges. Not only was every ounce of Destruction Energy filled with Destruction aura, at the same time, it was filled with extreme destructive power, to the extent that ripples appeared within Zhou Weiqing’s Astral Celestial Territory due to its impact.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fen Tian’s right arm instantly swelled up the moment he rose to the sky. When he was approaching Zhou Weiqing, his arm had already become nearly doubled. His solid fist had completely turned into a dark shade of red. Also, the inner energy within the flickering ruby luster gave people a frightful feeling, as though it was going to tear the starry skies open.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing attacked Fen Tian with his leg instead of his arm - his right leg, to be specific.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He lifted his right leg up high, like a whip, he ferociously struck Fen Tian, smashing onto his enormous fist.</p>
 <p>Bang ——</p>
 <p>The violent exploding sound that was like a bolt from the blue caused everyone on Heavenly Snow Mountain to temporarily lose their hearing. The snow that was collected near the peak of Heavenly Snow Mountain were thrown around by the violent rumbling sound before smashing hard onto the ground, causing a large amount of avalanches to roll down from all directions.</p>
 <p>The tyrannical collision caused everyone on the scene to be shocked. Fen Tian descended to the ground and had also withdrew all the Destruction will. When both his feet landed on the floor, his right arm had gone back to its original size, except that the part of his clothing that covered his right arm could not be restored. Everyone could clearly see that Fen Tian’s veins that were bulging on his arms were actually black in color, as though his blood was black. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>The most powerful people, in terms of cultivation base, could clearly see that in the moment when Fen Tian’s two feet had landed to the ground, both his feet had completely submerged into the ground. That was also to say that in the process of of falling from the sky, he did not manage to counter the power from Zhou Weiqing’s leg. However, this happened within a split second. Fen Tian quickly removed his feet from beneath the ground - as though the ground was being pulled up. Based on his cultivation base, transforming the ground below his feet was an entirely easy feat.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing, who was in mid-air, rose upwards to about a hundred meters or so. Nonetheless he still looked calm and composed - he was beaming with glee.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Were they evenly matched?</p>
 <p>Upon seeing what happened earlier, several spectators swallowed their saliva hard. Earlier when Zhou Weiqing just arrived and announced that the Peerless Sect was going to be a Saint Land, several people had underestimated them and waited to humiliate them. Even after the other Great Saint Lands had temporarily acknowledged the Peerless Sect as a Saint Land, several people, including Fen Tian and Huang Xingyun, felt that even though Zhou Weiqing was gifted with innate skills and that he was an outstanding powerhouses of the young generation, when it came to the Peerless Sect, he was mainly relying on the power of both the Six Ultimately Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya and the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However at this moment, everybody’s perspective had changed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Without a doubt, the power of the attack that Fen Tian had erupted in the sky was on the same level as a Max Level Heavenly Emperor’s attacks. Furthermore, his attack one with the Destruction Attribute as its foundation.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, Zhou Weiqing had managed to block his attack that easily, and had proven that he was evenly matched with Fen Tian. That was also to say that, in any case, Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation base had to be at least at the Max Level Heavenly Emperor Stage. In that earlier attack, both parties were not equipped with their Consolidated Equipment Set. In everyone else’s eyes, the Peerless Sect was practically a brand new concept to them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Yingbing looked dumbfounded at Zhou Weiqing - he was completely stunned. When he managed to finally raise his cultivation base to the Heavenly King Stage after putting it a lot of hard work, he was full of self-confidence. Upon reaching the Heavenly King Stage, it was a huge leap in terms of his power and performance. This was something that every Heavenly Jewel Master was clear about. He wanted to challenge Zhou Weiqing once again for his honor and dignity.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, at this moment, he had suddenly realized that apart from the fact that the difference between Zhou Weiqing and him did not become less even though his cultivation base had risen to the Heavenly King Stage, it had even became bigger - just like the huge difference between a Heavenly King and a Heavenly Zong Jewel Master, the difference between a Heavenly King and a Heavenly Emperor was extremely huge as well! He had never expected that the present Zhou Weiqing actually had the ability to challenge Fen Tian. Gu Yingbing knew that in this lifetime, it was impossible for him to contend against Zhou Weiqing, as he was not able to close the gap between them, even if it took forever.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Right after Fen Tian descended to the ground, two thuds were heard, followed by two corpses smashing onto the ground right before their eyes. The two corpses belonged to the same person - Wu Yunyue’s opponent, the Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing managed to obstruct Fen Tian at the right time, allowing Wu Yunyue on the other side to catch up with his opponent. The Blood Red Hell Heavenly Emperor, whose Consolidated Equipment Set had been smashed to smithereens by him, was akin to a young lady with both legs spread wide open - he no longer had the ability to defend himself. Wu Yunyue had waited for this day for too long. Each of his hand grabbed hold of each leg of the opponent, tearing him into halves in the sky.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing seemed to land at the same time as Wu Yunyue. Before he landed, he discreetly patted Wu Yunyue on the back. In the past couple of battles, Wu Yunyue had given his all, consuming large amounts of energy. Zhou Weiqing’s pure Nebula Saint Energy was his best supplement.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Zhou. Wei. Qing.” Fen Tian said his name with pauses in between. Overbearing killing intent swept towards the Peerless Sect.</p>
