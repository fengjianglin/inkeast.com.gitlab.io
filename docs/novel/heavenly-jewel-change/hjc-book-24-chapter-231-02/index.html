 <p>Duo Si nodded towards Zhou Weiqing as she slowly closed her eyes. Despite her exhaustion, her gratitude was clear.</p>
 <p>The three Shangguan Sisters stood at the side, their cheeks blushing furiously. At the other end, Tian’er was smiling radiantly at them.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at the four girls, and even he was slightly embarrassed as he said innocently: “What are you all looking at me for? Hurry up and cultivate… after gaining so much Saint Energy, you should fully integrate it into your bodies as quickly as possible.”</p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shangguan Fei’er giggled and said: “You thick skinned rascal, you also know how to be embarrassed? Hmph, just now when you were kissing us all, we could not see any bit of that oh?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing immediately said uprightly: “Of course that was for the sake of Devouring the destructive energies. I’m going to cultivate now!” He knew that he was now one against four, and trying to argue would always be a losing position. As a result, he just sat down right away and began cultivating.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Saint Energy in their bodies were already full, yet the Saint Core Nucleus did not form like they had expected. To Zhou Weiqing, this was a major problem. At this moment, the energy whirlpools of his Death Acupuncture Points were whirling as usual, full of Saint Energy, but he dared not continue drawing upon the atmospheric energy, otherwise he would face the same problem with being full to bursting point. That was to say… if he did not solve his current situation, he would not be able to continue cultivating.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Naturally, Tian’er was facing the same problem as Zhou Weiqing, and she also sat down in a cross-legged meditation position to start cultivation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing was not too impatient or agitated about the current situation, after all in a worse case situation he could just use some Saint Energy, and he would once again have ‘cleared space’ again. Of course, that was a last resort solution… it was such a rare opportunity that they had been able to gain three thousand drops of Saint Energy each, how could he possibly be willing to give it up just like that!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The energy whirlpools of his Death Acupuncture Points continued whirling. Even though Zhou Weiqing did not dare draw in more atmospheric energy, it was enough to just keep his Immortal Deity Technique running.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his DanTian, the originally tiny personal Saint Energy whirlpool had grown several times over, almost comparable to the original size of the large Saint Energy whirlpool that was formed between him and Tian’er. However, this personal Saint Energy whirlpool was not able to produce ‘new’ Saint Energy on its own, let alone forming the Saint Nucleus Core.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing tried circulating the Saint Energy, and there were no issues. However, it still did not solve the problem of being unable to cultivate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He attempted several different methods, but he was still unable to find a good solution for the problem. Slowly, he opened his eyes and looked towards Tian’er.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he looked at Tian’er, he couldn’t help but start in surprise, staring in shock.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this moment, Tian’er was totally surrounded by a layer of thick Divine Light, the strong divine aura around her making her seem like a Saintess. That aura of divinity and inviolability caused even Zhou Weiqing to feel a sense of pressure.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing discovered that Tian’er was actually cultivating, and the sheer amount and speed of her drawing in atmospheric energy could be described as terrifying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had actually found the method to continue cultivation? How did she do so? Zhou Weiqing was instantly surprised.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Right in that moment, Zhou Weiqing abruptly noticed that the Heavenly Jewels around Tian’er’s wrists which had been spinning rapidly suddenly slowed down. As a faint glow began to light up around her hands, coalescing into a solid form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that moment, Zhou Weiqing felt as if he had been struck by a bolt of lightning as he instantly understood, slapping his own thigh hard, he exclaimed: “Right! How could I be so stupid, such a simple solution, why didn’t I think of it!?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, Zhou Weiqing felt like slapping himself hard. Such a simple principle, yet he had overlooked it, instead overthinking things too much. In truth, the solution to their problem was the easiest and most straightforward one.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, both Tian’er and his own Saint Energy was totally full, but that was just for their meridian channels, not their entire body. More importantly, even though their Saint Energy was full, their own cultivation level and state of attainment was still far from being able to consolidate a Core Nucleus. As such, what they needed to do now was not increase their Saint Energy, but to use their Saint Energy to breakthrough to the next level! Only after reaching the Upper Level Zong Stage would they have the chance to consolidate the Saint Core Nucleus.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as he thought of it, Zhou Weiqing suddenly felt fully refreshed, quickly returning back to cultivating, silently going through his Immortal Deity Technique once through, circulating his Saint Energy to begin breaking through his twenty ninth Death Acupuncture Point.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Different cultivation techniques would have different methods of breaking through, and naturally some were difficult and some were easy. Of course, in terms of ‘simplicity’, there was likely no other cultivation technique that could compare with the Immortal Deity Technique, as all that was needed was to breakthrough the required Death Acupuncture Point.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of the previous times that Zhou Weiqing had broken through his Death Acupuncture Points, even for the twenty eighth one, he had used Heavenly Energy to do so, and he had never tried directly using Saint Energy to do so. After all, before today, his Saint Energy had been always at an extremely low amount, and he was unwilling to use it up for breaking through! However, now that his body was only left with Saint Energy, he naturally could only use Saint Energy to do so.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Under Zhou Weiqing’s control, the silver white Saint Energy began to circulate around his meridians according to the Immortal Deity Technique, heading directly for the twenty ninth Death Acupuncture Point.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The fourth portion of the Immortal Deity Technique was targeting the Death Acupuncture Points in the head to neck area. The first Death Acupuncture Point which he had already broken through earlier was the RenYing Acupuncture Point, situated about one and a half inches from the throat area. Now, he was about to attempt to breakthrough the second Death Acupuncture Point at his head area.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">FengChi Acupuncture Point. https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%A3%8E%E6%B1%A0%E7%A9%B4/1978338</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his Saint Energy circulating at full speed in his meridians, the narrow and closed meridians were easily smashed through by the powerful Saint Energy without any delay. Furthermore, with the creation power of the Saint Energy, it continually healed up, fortified widened and strengthened the meridians, causing Zhou Weiqing to have no worries about breaking through the Death Acupuncture Point.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing also realised that when he began circulating his Saint Energy to breakthrough the Death Acupuncture Points, the ‘full’ feeling he had was beginning to dissipate as Saint Energy was being used up. Although the expenditure was not large, at least it was being used in the cultivation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">*Puuu*</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a suspense-less, swift sweep, the FengChi Death Acupuncture Point was broken through in no time. Much to Zhou Weiqing’s shock, when his Saint Energy broke through the Death Acupuncture Point, he actually did not feel any pain at all, instead feeling his entire body lighten. In that instant, the Saint Energy within his body surged wildly, and an energy whirlpool formed in the FengChi Acupuncture Point fully formed of Saint Energy. Unlike all the previous times, there was no vent leakage of Heavenly Energy causing his own core energy to be dispersed, let alone any other danger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This… it was complete just like this?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing could only stare in shock as his twenty ninth Death Acupuncture Point succeeded in breaking through. Looking at the large amount of Saint Energy entering the Death Acupuncture Point and its energy whirlpool, he could sense that it was further improving his body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A whole three hundred drops of Saint Energy, vanishing just like that. At the same time, the full and bloated feeling that had plagued Zhou Weiqing had also vanished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">So… using Saint Energy to breakthrough was such a simple thing? Could it be… this Immortal Deity Technique of mine is created specially for Saint Energy?!&nbsp;</span></p>
