 <p><strong>Chapter 233: Hui Yao’s Revival (3)</strong></p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was in front, smiling. Except, he clearly looked different than when he had entered before. With their cultivation the two brothers could sense in the moment he appeared before them an intimidating aura. This was a shock to them. No doubt, this kid had had some adventures in the Lustre Spatial Realm.</p>
 <p>Their eyes swept over Zhou Weiqing and landed on the three Shangguan sisters. Shangguan Tianyue teared up when he saw they were unharmed and he was before them in a flash, arms wide open, hugging them close.</p>
 <p>“You all finally made it out. You worried your father to death.”</p>
 <p>The deep worry in Shangguan Tianyang’s eyes was swept away and he smiled at Zhou Weiqing. “You bum, you have some luck. Looks like you made out okay this time!”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed. “You could say we helped Heaven’s Expanse Palace resolve a big problem. You can count it as a dowry for Xue’er, Fei’er, and Bing’er.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyang laughed. “You sly dog, you’re just not willing to pay the hundred million in cash, right? Okay. If the Lustre Spatial Realm’s danger has been averted then I’ll let you off.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled wryly. “It’s not completely settled.” He has just left the Lustre Spatial Realm, yet it was still very serious and he didn’t want to delay, so he quickly told Shangguan Tianyang all that had happened while they were in there.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyue soon came over and joined in listening to Zhou Weiqing’s story. The more they heard the more troubled they became, especially when he came to the part about the Nether Realm. They knitted their brows.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, Father-in-law,” Zhou Weiqing said, “have you been to the Nether Realm? Does it really exist? It all sounds so mysterious to me.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyang frowned. “That gigantic dragon is not lying. Our Heaven’s Expanse Palace elders mentioned the Nether Realm in their ancient records, but there was not much detail. We never thought anything of it before. If it’s really like that dragon says, then we’re in for some trouble.”</p>
 <p>“The Nether Realm is still far from us,” Zhou Weiqing said. “So let’s not worry about that for now. First let’s talk about the problem with the Lustre Spatial Realm. The dragon gave us three years, but that’s not really very long. Have either of you heard of a Spatial Teleportation Gem?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyue shook his head, at a loss. Shangguan Tianyang, however, looked to be deep in thought. “I think I have read of it in some classical record. Well. You all go rest while I think carefully about where I read about it.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded. After all that time in the Lustre Spatial Realm, they really did need a rest.</p>
 <p>This time Zhou Weiqing didn’t stay in the Heavenly Jewel Island Hotel, but stayed in the Heaven’s Expanse Palace instead. However, perhaps by the three Shangguan sister’s arrangement, Tian’er was dragged off by them, and our dear Zhou Little Fatty had to stand guard in his room all by his lonesome.</p>
 <p>Despite that, Zhou Weiqing didn’t show the slightest sign of dissatisfaction with regards to this point. Instead, he’d worn a lascivious leer when he parted from the four girls.</p>
 <p>It was no wonder he did so. After all, one had to know that he’d already completed Shangguan Tianyang’s demand.</p>
 <p>After reviving Hui Yao, the dragon had offered to let Zhou Weiqing Devour his energy. As he continuously Devoured the dragon’s incredible power as well as the atmospheric energies within the Lustre Spatial Realm, not just his own, but even Tian’er and the three Shangguan sisters were completely filled with Saint Energy. The four ladies had broken through in their cultivation once again. Tian’er had reached the eight-Jeweled Stage and was close to creating her own circulation path.</p>
 <p>The three Shangguan sisters didn’t possess any of the Saint Attributes and thus couldn’t create a similar circulation path for Saint Energy like Zhou Weiqing. However, since Shangguan Tianyan’s demands had already been met, Zhou Weiqing now had the right to marry the three sisters. This time, he was going to take them with him no matter what. It was only that he’d just left the Lustre Spatial Realm and hadn’t had time to bring it up to Shangguan Tianyang yet.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing already had his plans and although he no longer needed to Devour Heavenly Beasts, he still needed to make a trip to the Heavenly Snow Mountain after departing from here.</p>
 <p>According to Hui Yao’s words, and his experience with the terrifying destructive power in Hui Yao’s body previously, Zhou Weiqing had some speculations about the Nether Realm. Previously, when they’d been on the Heavenly Snow Mountain, Tian’er’s mother Phelia had gifted Zhou Weiqing the the Nether State Skill. More importantly, from the conversations he had heard, she seemed to be keeping watch over a place, some sort of guard… and it was very likely connected to this Nether Realm. The Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord was the foremost powerhouse in the world, the only Heavenly God Tier amongst humans. He was definitely the most likely one to know about the existence of the Nether Realm.</p>
 <p>As for the Spatial Teleportation Gem, Zhou Weiqing currently did not think of looking for it by himself. After all, with his just his own strength alone, it was akin to finding a needle in a haystack. It was more reliable to just ask the Heaven’s Expanse Palace to bring all its considerable resources to search for it. While they did so, he could still head to the Heavenly Snow Mountain and request the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord to help as well. If the two greatest Saint Lands in the world couldn’t find the Spatial Teleportation Gem, then it was likely it was even more impossible for him to find it on his own. If he really couldn’t find it, the only thing they could do would be to evacuate the citizens of the ZhongTian City. Although the destruction of the Heavenly Jewel Island would be an enormous blow to the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, the preparation period of three years should allow them to deal with it properly.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Early next morning, disciples from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace came to invite Zhou Weiqing to meet up with Shangguan Tianyang.</p>
 <p>It was still that familiar palace, the ethereal white mist making it seem like a celestial realm on earth. The Shangguan Brothers, Shangguan Tianyang and Shangguan Tianyue were both present. The three Shangguan sisters and Tian’er were off to the side, looking rather close and familiar with each other, putting Zhou Weiqing at ease.</p>
 <p>“Uncle, father-in-law.” Zhou Weiqing was quickly getting familiar with calling out these titles.</p>
 <p>Somewhat to his surprise, his future father-in-law didn’t seem to reject these titles this time. However, the two Heaven’s Expanse Palace Masters had somewhat stern expressions on their faces.</p>
 <p>“Have there been no clues?” Zhou Weiqing frowned.</p>
 <p>“We have found some clues, but things will be a bit troublesome,” Shangguan Tianyang responded.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s heart gripped as he snapped to attention. Shangguan Tianyang was after all the First Palace Lord of Heaven’s Expanse Palace, one of the Great Saint Lands in the mainland. If even he felt things were tricky, it could only mean that the Spatial Teleportation Gem could not be so easily obtained.</p>
 <p>“My memories were correct,” Shangguan Tianyan recounted grimly. “There is indeed a record of the Spatial Teleportation Gem in my Palace’s ancient tomes. A Spatial Teleportation Gem once appeared, and it is the utmost treasure of the Xuantian Palace.”</p>
 <p>“Xuantian Palace? What kind of place is that?” Zhou Weiqing was rather lost and confused. The five Great Saint Lands of the Boundless Mainland were the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, Heavenly Snow Mountain, Passion Valley, Blood Red Hell and Heavenly Demon Sect. He had never heard of this Xuantian Palace. However, if this place wasn’t one of the Great Saint Lands, why would Shangguan Tianyang place such importance on it?</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyang continued: “Even I wouldn’t be too familiar with this place, let alone you… If I hadn’t looked through the historic archives, I would not even have remembered this place.” Pausing for a moment, he continued solemnly. “That is because the Xuantian Palace isn’t even on the Boundless Mainland.”</p>
 <p>“Ah?” Zhou Weiqing looked at Shangguan Tianyang in surprise and bewilderment.</p>
 <p>“In truth, apart from our continent, in this world, there is another smaller continent far out on the seas, called the Xuantian Continent. Very few people know of it because of its great distance from the Boundless Mainland. The only reason we know about it is because their people once came to our lands and conflict erupted. That was was the reason why our archives recorded it. They also seem to have organizations similar to our Great Saint Lands, and the XuanTian Palace is their strongest one. The first time they came, they were defeated by an alliance between all five of the Great Saint Lands, but we could not cause them any serious problems because of the Spatial Teleportation Gem. In the end, we finally set a treaty that the two continents would not interfere with each other, and that powerhouses from the Great Saint Lands of each continent wouldn’t set foot on the other. However, this was a millennia ago, so even amongst the Great Saint Lands, very few know of the existence of the Xuantian Continent now.”</p>
 <p>“There’s another continent entirely?” Zhou Weiqing asked. “Is there a map? The oceans are so different from land. Setting aside the question of how many Heavenly Beasts there may be in the oceans between us, how can we even begin to attempt to reach the Xuantian Continent across the vast oceans if we don’t know where it is?”</p>
 <p>“For that at least, you do not need to worry about it,” Shangguan Tianyue responded. “We once seized a detailed maritime map from their hands and the position of the Xuantian Continent is clearly labeled. It’s a large landmass after all, not a mere island, so it shouldn’t be too difficult to locate. Even so, it is tens of thousands of miles away from us, so it won’t be easy to reach. Not to mention that the treaty we made is still in effect. If we send someone to find that Spatial Teleportation Gem, it would not only worsen relations between the two continents, it could possibly start a war. We already have many matters to attend to in the Boundless Mainland, and it might be unwise to make more enemies.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was quick witted and immediately understood what the ramifications of what the brothers were saying, as well as their subtle hidden meaning. He chuckled and cut straight to the chase. “I’ll go. I’m not part of any of the Great Saint Lands, and my goal is more humble. Even if I can’t steal or rob them, I can still try to borrow it right?”</p>
 <p>Of course, in his mind, there was no difference between this ‘borrowing’ and taking without a word.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyue was quite satisfied with this response and revealed the trace of a smile. Although his future son-in-law wasn’t a match for his daughter in the looks department, there were few peers in the younger generation that could measure up to his abilities.</p>
