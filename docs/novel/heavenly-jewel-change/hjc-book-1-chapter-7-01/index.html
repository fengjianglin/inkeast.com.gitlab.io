 <p><strong>Chapter 7 Three-Point Covenant (1)</strong></p>
 <p>After crying for half a day, Shangguan Bing’er still had not stopped. Zhou Weiqing looked at the brightening skies, and couldn’t help reminding her: “Battalion Commander, isn’t it time to head back? If we don’t head back, we might be discovered by others.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er naturally knew that this fellow had come back just now, and she raised her head, looking at him with her tear stained face, “None of your business. I thought I asked you to get lost?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was exceptional at reading expressions and cues, and he could tell that after the long cry, the anger and hate in Shangguan Bing’er’s eyes had considerably lessened. Although her voice was still severe, there was no longer any killing intent.</p>
 <p>“I’ll get lost immediately now!” Seeing that Shangguan Bing’er had stopped crying, Zhou Weiqing took off and ran away. Although her anger had lessened considerably, but it was still likely she would give him a beating.</p>
 <p>Looking at Zhou Weiqing fleeing in a sorry state, Shangguan Bing’er bit her lip before standing up slowly and returning to the camp.</p>
 <p>When Zhou Weiqing returned to his tent, he was given a fright. Previously when he had just awakened, he had been distracted by Shangguan Bing’er as well as the threat to his life, and had not looked around at the scene in the tent closely. Now, in the daylight, he couldn’t help but feel a chill down his spine, feeling glad it was the kind Shangguan Bing’er last night.</p>
 <p>The tent was a total mess, with torn clothes strewn everywhere – mostly the purple clothes that Shangguan Bing’er had been wearing last night as well as her underclothing. There was blood on the mattress, showing how crazy last night had been.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing quickly gathered up the mess around, then wrapped them in the bag he had earlier. He then carefully tore out the bloodstain on the mattress, folded it up and stowed it away carefully. This was after all a symbol of their consummation and he wanted to keep it. If Shangguan Bing’er was willing to accept being with him in the future, he would give it to her. Of course, whether she would accept it or not was another matter.</p>
 <p>After he had finished clearing up, Zhou Weiqing had broken out in cold sweat, as he had not been able to find his Immortal Deity Technique Manual; it had likely been taken by Shangguan Bing’er. It was not that he was unwilling to give it up, but he was actually afraid that Shangguan Bing’er would follow him in trying to learn it. When he was cultivating the Immortal Deity Technique last night, he had realised how domineering the Technique was, how nigh impossible it was to learn it. If it had not been for the black pearl helping him, he would probably have died long before Shangguan Bing’er had came. No, this would not do. He had to find a chance to warn her not to train this technique. Although, even if she wanted to learn it, it would likely be after 2-3 days, since she had to recover first.</p>
 <p>As Zhou Weiqing looked at the Jewels on his wrist that had not disappeared throughout the whole time, he was slowly overcome by a bout of sleepiness, and gradually fell into a deep sleep.</p>
 <p>As the recruitment was still going on, and furthermore Shangguan Bing’er had assigned him to such a remote area to punish him, thus he was not disturbed by anyone. Zhou Weiqing slept all the way til the sun was setting.</p>
 <p>“En… so comfortable.” He stretched lazily, hearing a soft creaking sound from his bones, and he felt a comfortable feeling, as if he was fully suffused with strength and free of inhibitions. As he looked down, the Heavenly Jewels were still around his wrist, doing a slow orbit.</p>
 <p>“Why am I unable to retrieve the Heavenly Jewels back into my body like others do? How do I do that?” Since Zhou Weiqing had been considered a trash since young, he had not studied in a Jewel Master school, and thus only had a very basic understanding of the profession, and as a result he now did not know what to do.</p>
 <p><em>Nevermind, I shall not care about that now, time to eat first before thinking further.</em> After sleeping for a whole day, coupled with his ‘exertions’ last night, he had totally been awoken by his hunger. Putting on the army uniform, he covered his arms with the sleeves to hide his Heavenly Jewels, before running to the mess to have a large meal.</p>
 <p>Having filled his stomach, he was now filled with spirit. Zhou Weiqing was pleasantly surprised to find out that he seemed to have grown in stature. He was originally around 1.7m tall, which was already extremely tall for his 13 years of age. However, after last night, he seemed to have grown a few centimetres taller, and his entire body’s muscles also seemed to have developed further.</p>
 <p>Besides feeling heart-pain for Shangguan Bing’er, his mood today was actually pretty good. He had finally gotten his own Heavenly Jewels that he had dreamed of for so long. Not to mention his legendary Elemental Jewel, even an ordinary Heavenly Jewel Master status would let him be extremely satisfied. If not for Shangguan Bing’er, he might have just gone home immediately to tell his dad this good news, and also let Difuya who had always looked down on him know that he was already a Heavenly Jewel Master.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing returned to his tent in a good mood, but as soon as he opened the flap, his heart was suddenly alarmed, and he shouted out: “Who’s there?”</p>
 <p>That sense of alarm was totally subconscious, and he didn’t even know what was happening. At this moment, the sky was darkening, and he did not have vision into the tent.</p>
 <p>However, Zhou Weiqing’s expression quickly changed into a fawning one as he saw the person in the tent. With a foolish grin on his face, he said: “Oh it’s you, Lord Battalion Commander, why are you here?” As he said that, he only stepped one foot into the tent, the other foot was refusing to step in. How knows what Shangguan Bing’er came here to do.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er had by now changed to a set of blue attire, which was very matching to her azure hair. Zhou Weiqing saw that his uniform had been folded neatly onto his bunk, and when he entered the tent, she had been staring at the bunk blankly.</p>
 <p>“Come in.” Shangguan Bing’er said coldly.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing looked around, just verifying that she had no weapons on her, before entering the tent gingerly. Still, he didn’t dare to step too far in, just near the entrance and he looked at her in a bashful expression – almost as if he had been the one taken advantage of.</p>
 <p>Looking at that rascal’s expression, Shangguan Bing’er blushed, scolding in her heart, How could I have been taken advantage of by this damn rascal!</p>
 <p>“Where’s the cloth?” she asked curtly.</p>
 <p>“What cloth?” Zhou Weiqing did not understand.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er was flushed red in embarrassment, and she glanced at the bunk. Zhou Weiqing instantly understood, and said carefully: “I kept it… as a momento.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er’s shapely bosom rose and fell more rapidly, “You... give it here.” She was afraid she would not be able to control herself and kill that rascal.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing reluctantly took out the few pieces of cloth that he had kept carefully, and passed them to Shangguan Bing’er. Of course, she couldn’t bear to look at such a shameful thing now, so she quickly stashed it away. Little did she know that the sly rascal Zhou Weiqing had kept a piece still.</p>
