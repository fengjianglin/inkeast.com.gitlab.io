 <p>Dreamwake was momentarily speechless, then said angrily, “Stop worrying about my business, alright?&nbsp;I’m not going to marry him.&nbsp;Did we really come all the way here to talk about this?”</p>
 <p>The Tenebrous Demon Dragon actually seemed to be slightly afraid of Dreamwake.&nbsp;It hurriedly said, “Fine, fine.&nbsp;Let’s deal with the Terror Sea Dragon first.&nbsp;Are you ready?”</p>
 <p>Dreamwake took another deep breath, then slowly nodded.&nbsp;An aura of tremendous power suddenly burst out from her, followed by rays of dark-golden light shining from her body.&nbsp;She went directly into the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation.</p>
 <p>Although Zhou Weiqing had flown very far away, he was still able to clearly make out Dreamwake’s figure atop the Tenebrous Demon Dragon.&nbsp;He watched as enormous dragon wings emerged from Dreamwake’s back as she put on the Legendary Set she had displayed before him previously.</p>
 <p>The pieces of dark-golden scale armor appeared in front of her.&nbsp;Soon, all six pieces had appeared.&nbsp;The seventh piece, as he had guessed, was the helmet.&nbsp;Her helmet looked like a dragon’s maw.&nbsp;It didn’t have any feminine beauty at all, but it was filled with an aura of might.&nbsp;It completely covered her beautiful features.&nbsp;Alas, Zhou Weiqing was so far away that he couldn’t see her face at all.&nbsp;If he could, he would’ve realized that her mask was actually identical to that of Xuantian Palace Lord Dong Fang’s.</p>
 <p><em>Seven pieces.&nbsp;This Legendary Set already had seven pieces</em>.&nbsp;However, this clearly wasn’t Dreamwake’s limit.&nbsp;Moments later, the eighth piece appeared as well.&nbsp;The eighth piece sprouted out from her waist, and it flashed with powerful dark-golden light.&nbsp;The eighth piece actually wasn’t to be worn per se; rather, it connected her to the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s draconic horn which was behind her, securely latching her to the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s head.&nbsp;The dark-golden armor continued to ripple downwards, actually connecting together with the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s head.</p>
 <p>A terrifying Tenebrous Attribute energy swept out from the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s body.&nbsp;A furious, dense flood of Tenebrous energy flowed out of the horn and into Dreamwake’s body.</p>
 <p>A ninth beam of dark-golden light appeared.&nbsp;This time, the piece of armor actually appeared on the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s back.&nbsp;Now, the dark-golden armor reached down from Dreamwake’s legs to securely ‘lock’ her legs atop the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s head.&nbsp;The scales spread downwards across the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s neck, covering the reverse scale at the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s lower neck, which was its weak spot.&nbsp;It then continued to spread downwards until the entire neck was covered.</p>
 <p><em>Good heavens! What type of Legendary Set&nbsp;</em>IS <em>this?</em></p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing stared stupefied at this sight.&nbsp;He could hardly believe what he was seeing.&nbsp;There was actually a Heavenly Jewel Master whose Legendary Set allowed her to completely merge together with a Heavenly Beast, and a great dragon at that?!&nbsp;Right now, Dreamwake and the Tenebrous Demon Dragon looked as though they were a single entity.&nbsp;The only thing Zhou Weiqing could sense was a single, awesome Heavenly God aura.&nbsp;No other energy ripples were present.</p>
 <p>He swallowed hard.&nbsp;If he hadn’t seen this personally, he never would’ve believed or imagined that this type of Legendary Set could be created.&nbsp;Dreamwake’s ninth piece could clearly only been released when making use of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s energy.&nbsp;Otherwise, there’s no way it could’ve covered such an enormous area.&nbsp;In addition, the Tenebrous Demon Dragon was now much safer now that its ‘reverse scale’ had been covered, and its combat power had undoubtedly increased dramatically.</p>
 <p><em>The ninth piece.&nbsp;Was it over?</em> Of course not. How could this mysterious, dazzling Legendary Set possibly have just nine pieces?</p>
 <p>The tenth beam of dark-golden light flared.&nbsp;This time, the dark-golden light flew out from Dreamwake’s head, and accompanying it was a long, leisurely draconic roar from the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s mouth.&nbsp;The powerful draconic roar caused enormous waves which were three hundred meters high to rise within the seas around them.</p>
 <p>The dark-golden pillar of light soared upwards. Dreamwake lifted her right hand, and as she did so an <em>eleventh</em> beam of dark-golden light appeared! The eleventh beam of dark-golden light shone from her entire body!</p>
 <p>A giant dark-golden longspear had appeared in front of her.&nbsp;The longspear was roughly seven meters long, and it was thick in the middle but sharp at both ends.&nbsp;It was completely black but covered with the carvings of two giant coiling dragons, with a dazzling red gem located between the dragons where their bodies intersected.</p>
 <p>Dreamwake lifted her right draconic claw, gripping the entire double-headed longspear by the center.&nbsp;Boom!&nbsp;An enormous rumble spread out, causing the entire sea to groan as an utterly terrifying aura burst forth from the combined entity that was Dreamwake and the Tenebrous Demon Dragon.</p>
 <p>A dazzling, blood-red light instantly replaced all of the dark-gold light.&nbsp;A blood-red spear, blood-red scaled armor… even the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s horn had become blood-red in color.&nbsp;What did this mean?&nbsp;This meant the Legendary Set was complete.&nbsp;Eleven.&nbsp;This was an eleven-piece set!&nbsp;An unbelievable eleven-piece Legendary Set!</p>
 <p>Even in the Boundless Mainland, only the number one Legendary Set, the ‘Boundless Infinitum’ set, was comprised of eleven pieces.&nbsp;In the Xuantian Continent, however, Zhou Weiqing had the chance to once again witness an eleven-piece set coming together, the Tenebrous Demon Dragon set.&nbsp;This was truly the Tenebrous Demon Dragon set, and it required one to join together with a Tenebrous Demon Dragon in order for its full power to be released.</p>
 <p>From a certain perspective, the Tenebrous Demon Dragon set was slightly inferior to the Boundless Infinitum set, as it required the Tenebrous Demon Dragon to be used.&nbsp;However, in terms of actual power it probably actually surpassed the Boundless Infinitum set… because the set’s master was riding a Heavenly God Tenebrous Demon Dragon!</p>
 <p>Dreamwake, in her current state, would probably be a match for even the lord of Heavenly Snow Mountain.&nbsp;Although Zhou Weiqing had sparred against Dreamwake and had a very high opinion of her skills, when he actually saw her transform into a dragon rider he finally realized that he had still underestimated her.</p>
 <p>Dreamwake was at a level of power where even without the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s help, Zhou Weiqing probably wouldn’t be a match for her.&nbsp;No wonder even Xuantian Palace Lord Dong Fang had chosen to enter the Tenebrous Demon Sealing Formation while letting her remain outside and stand atop the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s head.&nbsp;She was actually their ultimate combat power in this battle, as her strength had become one with the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s strength.</p>
 <p>A terrifying burst of energy exploded across the surface of the sea, while the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s draconic roar grew louder and louder.&nbsp;This was a challenge, an incomparably powerful challenged aimed at the Terror Sea Dragon.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing flapped his wings, sending himself a bit higher into the air so that he would have a better vantage point for this battle.&nbsp;A valuable experience like this was priceless for his future cultivation, but he didn’t want to end up becoming collateral damage to the shockwaves.</p>
 <p>After briefly feeling stunned, he actually felt a bit disappointed.&nbsp;The power demonstrated by the merger of Dreamwake and the Tenebrous Demon Dragon, especially when reinforced by the trickery of the Tenebrous Demon Sealing Formation, meant that even if the Terror Sea Dragon was a bit more powerful than the Tenebrous Demon Dragon, it was still probably going to end off the worse for the wear.</p>
 <p>Given the situation, it seemed likely that there would be no need to use the Spatial Teleportation Gem.&nbsp;How was he supposed to accomplish his goal?</p>
 <p>But of course, he couldn’t change things just by wishing it.&nbsp;All he could do was keep watching and hope for an opportunity to arise.</p>
 <p>The Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s enormous wings were flapping hard, keeping its ponderous bulk aloft in the air above the sea.&nbsp;It blasted out its invincible aura without holding anything back, and its originally-clear draconic roar became thunderous and keening as its terrifying draconic might swept out to cover the world.</p>
 <p>The distant Zhou Weiqing was nearly knocked out of the air by the might of this draconic roar.&nbsp;For an instant, it seemed as though the entire world was filled with dark Tenebrous Demon Clouds that were all filled with Tenebrous energy.</p>
 <p>Was this the power of a Heavenly God?&nbsp;Even though Zhou Weiqing had previously seen the great dragon Hui Yao and the lord of Heavenly Snow Mountain, he had never before seen what a Heavenly God who was preparing to do battle looked like.&nbsp;As the Tenebrous Demon Dragon released the full weight of its might, Zhou Weiqing gained a brand new understanding of what it meant to be a Heavenly God.</p>
 <p>Right now, he felt as though the Tenebrous Demon Dragon had already become the master and ruler of all it surveyed.&nbsp;Even the sea before it had to submit to him.&nbsp;Everything, from the heavens to the seas, seemed to have transformed into an incomparably vast pool of Tenebrous energy, with the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s great form serving as the center of this pool.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing felt that he himself was tiny in comparison.&nbsp;If he didn’t release his Saint Energy, his body could be torn to pieces at any moment.&nbsp;Even a glance from the Tenebrous Demon Dragon would be enough to destroy anything around it.</p>
 <p>As for Dreamwake, who proudly stood atop the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s head, she was even more dazzling to behold.&nbsp;The blood-red light completely covered her body, and she held the seven-meter dragon spear up high.&nbsp;Her location was actually where the Tenebrous Demon Dragon was releasing the most terrifying amount of energy.</p>
 <p>They were issuing a challenge to the Terror Sea Dragon, demanding it come to them!&nbsp;Although this was a simple, almost clumsy method, it was actually quite effective against Heavenly Gods.</p>
 <p>All Heavenly Gods were incomparably proud.&nbsp;They viewed their dignity as being more important than anything else.&nbsp;The sea was the domain of the Terror Sea Dragon, and there was no way it would not respond to a challenge issued within it.&nbsp;If it really failed to come, then in the future it would never be able to raise its head up proudly within the seas.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing grew inexplicably nervous.&nbsp;How could he not be?&nbsp;Heavenly Gods were about to do battle before him.&nbsp;Although Xuantian Palace had made ample preparations, this was still the ocean.&nbsp;The Terror Sea Dragon wouldn’t be easy to deal with… and Zhou Weiqing himself had to be ready to seize the Spatial Teleportation Gem at all times.&nbsp;What discomforted him the most was that Xuantian Palace had treated him very well, especially Dreamwake.&nbsp;He had taken advantage of her, and although she had tried to take ‘revenge’ upon him, Zhou Weiqing could sense that she cared about him.&nbsp;Even after he had assaulted her chest in that special Spatial zone, she had never truly evinced the desire to kill him.</p>
 <p>And so, Zhou Weiqing’s ideal outcome was to somehow acquire the Spatial Teleportation Gem without harming Dreamwake or these other people.</p>
