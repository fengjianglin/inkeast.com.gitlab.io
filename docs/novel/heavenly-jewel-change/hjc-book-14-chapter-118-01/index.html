 <p><b>Chapter 118 Tian Bei City (1)</b></p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er stood at the side watching, and she suddenly sensed a cold aura emitting from Zhou Weiqing, especially from the right leg he was using to step on the Silver Emperor’s body, a spine chilling sensation. Soon after, the entire atmosphere around them seemed to warp around them, as the Silver Emperor, originally white-silver turned colour drastically.</p>
 <p>The unconscious Silver Emperor was immediately jolted awake, but it did not have any strength within to resist, instead shuddering violently as three lights intertwined around its body. Black, Grey and Blue, and it could sense its own life draining away swiftly.</p>
 <p><span style>It was originally already heavily injured, and with this new attack, it knew it was almost at the end of its life. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Without question, what Zhou Weiqing had used on it was the </span><span style>Dark Demon God Lightning plus </span><span style>Time Interrupt </span><span style>combo he had used before, causing the three attribute poison to enter the Silver Emperor’s body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter what living creature, when it met with a threat to its life, it would feel a sense of panic, despite its power. The Silver Emperor was no exception. This was especially so since this unique venom was something so strange that it had not experienced before. Its remaining shreds of Heavenly Energy was low, and no matter what it tried, there was no effect on the poison. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The &nbsp;Tri-Attribute Venom of the </span><span style>Dark Demon God Lightning was extremely overbearing, so much so that even powerful Heavenly Energy could not force it out. Even the Heavenly King Stage powerhouse Shangguan Longyin had failed to do so previously. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing grinned, stepping harder on the Silver Emperor as he said: “Little thing, you can sense the threat of death right. If you want to live, then you better cooperate with Your Father, I. When I start Sealing you, you better not resist at all, otherwise, you can just wait for your death. This Tri-Attribute Venom of mine… the feeling is not too good right?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>This was not the first time he had tried out this Tri-Attribute Venom, and not only was it fatal, but it was relatively slow acting and extremely painful. Previously, Shen Little Demon had not been able to take it, even with the Heavenly King Stage powerhouse Shangguan Longyin helping her to alleviate the pain with his Heavenly Energy. Alas, this Silver Emperor did not have such help. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Sometimes, death was not the most scary thing. This sort of incomprehensible pain, that made one want to beg for death but being unable to die… that was the most terrifying thing. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As he said that with a big grin, Zhou Weiqing did not forget to place a hand on the Silver Emperor’s body, continuing to Devour its Heavenly Energy. After a while, he bit on his other hand, squeezing out a drop of blood, before starting to unleash a </span><span style>Blood Rites - Seal of Darkness on it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the Demonic Change State, Zhou Weiqing could truly release the aura of the </span><span style>Dark Demon God Tiger to its maximum, especially from his Demonic Right Leg. Using his right leg to step on the Silver Emperor was not just to release the Dark Demon God Lightning, but also in order to let it sense that aura. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shangguan Fei’er stood at the side, watching all of that. Originally, she had thought that she was familiar with all of Zhou Weiqing’s abilities, but now watching him threaten the Silver Emperor, she felt a mixed feeling. On one hand, she found it amusing, doing actions that in her eyes were futile. On the other hand, she had a strange sensation, as if Zhou Weiqing was doing something to the Silver Emperor, some unique hidden ability that she did not know about. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop dreaming already. Threatening the Silver Emperor… you can still think of such a thing. This little thing is not just savage, but it is also very stubborn. If you do not overpower it when Sealing forcefully, you won’t succeed. You just wait, soon you’ll be my horse!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Shangguan Fei’er was from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, she was after all not a Heavenly Beast, and she could not sense that powerful, intense pressure that only Heavenly Beasts could. If this Silver Emperor was at the Heavenly King Stage, then it would not be too susceptible for this pressure at this moment. Alas, it had not yet successfully evolved. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The bloodline of the </span><span style>Dark Demon God Tiger was no lesser than the Divine Heavenly Spirit Tiger, one of the top in the Heavenly Beast world. From the perspective of a Heavenly Beast like this little Silver Emperor, it would be submitting to a powerful Heavenly Beast of greater bloodlines, not a human. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, it stopped struggling. The </span><span style>Blood Rites - Seal of Darkness symbol on its forehead stabilizing under the blood drop of Zhou Weiqing. Its body started shuddering violently again, as if wanting to struggle, but not daring to do so. Its little eyes just happened to look right into Zhou Weiqing’s bloodshot eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At this point, in the eyes of the Silver Emperor, Zhou Weiqing was definitely no human. The law of the jungle of the Heavenly Beast world, in addition to Zhou Weiqing’s tri-Attribute Venom and the suffering it brought, finally caused it to submit. Given reason, no one would be willing to sacrifice their own life. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The bloodline pressure from the </span><span style>Dark Demon God Tiger was such a higher level that the Silver Emperor had to look up to, even though it knew Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation level was still far beyond its own. It was the same like itself, not having broken through to the Heavenly King Stage yet. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the bloodline pressure was of extremely high importance to Heavenly Beasts, and at least allowed it to accept Zhou Weiqing. If it were any human, without an absolute power difference, it would definitely not choose to submit, no matter torture or death. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, the last shreds of its Heavenly Energy was drained away, along with the torturous venom. It still continued trembling, but much lighter now, as the venom had all been drained away as well. The dark red symbol on its forehead flashed brightly once, then disappeared into its body. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Its head dropped down to the side, and the Silver Emperor lapsed back into a deep unconsciousness. Zhou Weiqing did not place it into his own Spatial Ring, instead hugging it into his bosom, a smug look on his face. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When the dark red symbol flashed across the Silver Emperor’s forehead, Shangguan Fei’er was totally stunned. She could not believe what was happening before her eyes. </span><i><span style>How could this Silver Emperor actually submit like that? This Zhou Little Fatty was only at the Four Jeweled Stage! What basis did he have to let such a powerful and stubborn Top Level Zong Stage Heavenly Beast submit to him? How could this be? How could this be?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Oei, I know I am very handsome and suave, but if you keep staring at me like that, I will be shy.” Zhou Weiqing flashed a teasing grin at Shangguan Fei’er as he said that. At the same time, his gaze swooped down to her buttocks once more. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You? Shy?” Shangguan Fei’er was so angered by his words that she almost laughed. “Your skin is so thick to almost an invincible point.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing sighed and said: “Haiz, although you are from the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, you are after all a woman. Our bet is already set, if you really renege on it, I won’t be surprised, but just feel sorry for the Heaven’s Expanse Palace.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shangguan Fei’er looked at him, blinking her beautiful eyes. All of a sudden, she laughed. “Zhou Little Fatty, you’re trying to provoke me? Nope! The one who represents the face of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace is my sister, not me. You are right, reneging is the right of women, and that’s exactly what I’m going to do. What are you going to do about it? Did anyone see me betting with you? Who can prove it? No one right? Heh heh, that is to say, we never placed such a bet.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh?” Zhou Weiqing stared at Shangguan Fei’er with his mouth agape. Originally, he thought that by provoking her like that with the name and reputation of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, she would never renege on the bet. Who could have imagined that this Little Demon Girl of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace was so tough to deal with, and she did the reverse instead. Furthermore, his own strength was no match for hers… Zhou Weiqing was immediately vexed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at his depressed look, Shangguan Fei’er laughed happily, skipping joyously towards the camp. “Ahhh, today’s weather is so good. It feels so good to infuriate someone. I have decided to reward myself by eating more today!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing her retreating figure, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but twitch in his heart, thinking to himself: </span><i><span style>Both are from the same mother, but why is there such a huge difference in character? This Shangguan Fei’er and my own Bing’er, they are just too different indeed. </span></i><span style>Thinking back to the time when he had teased Bing’er ages ago, the way she had reacted so innocently and at a loss, Zhou Weiqing’s gaze suddenly wandered into the distance. How great it would be if Bing’er were here with him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter the first time when Shangguan Bing’er had became his Sacrifice in his first Demonic Change, or his ‘adult ceremony’ in the Heavenly Jewel Island… Both were memories that Zhou Weiqing would never forget, ingrained deep within his heart. This was also why no one could ever be more important than Shangguan Bing’er to him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Shangguan Sisters were just too similar, and though Zhou Weiqing did not really want Shangguan Fei’er to follow him, but somewhere deep in his heart, seeing Shangguan Fei’er every day by his side was like seeing Bing’er as well, and it was this conflicted deep thought, along with the fear of Shangguan Fei’er talking bad about him in front of Bing’er, which was what made him keep her by his side. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The difference in character did not detract from Shanggaun Fei’er’s beauty, but displaying a totally different sort of beauty. Lively, youthful, spirited, things that Shangguan Bing’er did not display, while Shangguan Fei’er did not have Bing’er’s soft, quiet beauty. These two sisters could be said to be different but equal. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The sounds of the birds and insects in the forest was forming a moving melody. Life in the forest was never quiet. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to the Silver Emperor’s sudden ambush, Zhou Weiqing asked Lin TianAo to arrange a schedule of guards for the night, with the twenty one of them split into groups of guards, with the original Fei Li Battle Team members each leading a guard duty. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The truth was proven that this Silver Emperor was indeed an exception. Through the rest of the night, besides a few weak little Heavenly Beasts disturbing them, they did not meet with any other troubles. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Dawn. A simple meal of dry rations, and the party gathered up their belongings before leaving once more. Once again, Zang Lang’s group of twelve showed their high skill and grit, taking barely fifteen minutes to take down everything swiftly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As they continued on their travels, Zhou Weiqing asked Shangguan Fei’er: “Fei’er, are you sure there are Ghost Demon Horses here?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shangguan Fei’er glanced at him, saying: “I am also not certain. They definitely do live here, but in the past decades they have been hunted so much, that I’m not sure if we can find any more wild ones.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing widened his eyes. “Are you joking?! If not for the fact that you told us there were these Ghost Demon Horses here, we would not have taken this route!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shangguan Fei’er nodded vigorously, saying: “They definitely live somewhere in this forest, but whether or not we meet with them depends on our luck. After all, the forest is extremely massive, and these wild Ghost Demon Horses are already much rarer now, and we might not come across them.” </span></p>
