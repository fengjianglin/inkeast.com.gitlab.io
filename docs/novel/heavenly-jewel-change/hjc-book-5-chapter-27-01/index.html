 <p><b>Chapter 27 Zhou Weiqing’s Sixth Attribute (1) </b></p>
 <p>“Do you want to take your own life, or do you want me to take action personally?” His future mother-in-law had dragged Shangguan Bing’er to his doorstep, and the first line she said was this, causing Zhou Weiqing to be unbelievably shocked. Although he had guessed that his future mother-in-law would be extremely angry after finding out what had happened to Shangguan Bing’er, he had not expected her to be so intrepid, and come knocking.</p>
 <p>When Zhou Weiqing’s mother Ling Zihan saw Shangguan Bing’er’s mother, it was as if she was struck by a bolt of lightning, and she stood there shocked and silent, with an obviously strange expression on her face.</p>
 <p>“Mom!” Shangguan Bing’er quickly rushed in front of her mother with a harried expression on her face. “Mum, listen to me! It was all a misunderstanding, it wasn’t Little Fatty’s fault!” Although she knew Zhou Weiqing’s real identity, but she was still used to calling him Little Fatty.</p>
 <p>Today, when she returned home, when her mother had taken a look at her, she had already discovered that she had transformed from a young girl to a young woman. The normally gentle and kind mother had been extremely furious, forcing her to say what had happened. After which, she had been dragged all the way to the Admiral’s Manor.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er’s mother said coldly: “Accidentally killing someone, isn’t it still killing someone? Who are you that you can use my daughter’s virtue as your Sacrifice to Awaken your Heavenly Jewels? Zhou Weiqing, if you are a man, you better commit suicide in front of me, and take responsibility for your actions.”</p>
 <p>Listening to her words, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but get angry as well. “Aunty, you do not have to worry, I will definitely take responsibility for Bing’er, and I will definitely not shirk it. No matter what the reason was, I have indeed taken her virtue, but I mostly definitely will not commit suicide in front of you; that would be irresponsible and cause more harm to Bing’er. I will spend my life to repay her, love her, and take care of her.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er’s mother said scornfully: “You? You think you deserve my daughter?”</p>
 <p>“Mum!” Shangguan Bing’er was rather anxious in her heart; one side was her mother, and the other side was the man she had accepted; being stuck in the middle was extremely painful for her.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at her, not backing down a whit. “You’re right, I know that with my looks, I probably do not deserve Bing’er. But what can those good looking men do for her, does that really mean they will treat her well? I can be like a bear; on ordinary days, I’ll be lying down, acting foolish yet cute, and she can hug me for warmth or use me as a pillow. In a harsh winter when there is nothing to eat, I am willing to sacrifice myself as food reserves; and in times of danger, I will stand tall and become the most ferocious Heavenly Beast.” When Shangguan Bing’er heard Zhou Weiqing’s words, she was dazed with sentiment, her eyes turning red as her eyes grew resolute.</p>
 <p>When Shangguan Bing’er’s mother heard his words, her body trembled a little, and her expression changed, the fierce gaze seeming to waver a little, as if she was remembering something unpleasant. Subsequently, an unbelievably terrifying aura spread out from her, the likes of which Zhou Weiqing had never felt before.</p>
 <p>“What a glib tongue you have boy, let me see, what can you rely on to give my daughter happiness.” As she said that, her eyes flared up, and with a wave of her left hand, Shangguan Bing’er stumbled to the side and found herself unable to move. She was extremely shocked as she did not even know that her mother had such a terrifying power.</p>
 <p>The next moment, the beautiful middle aged lady appeared right in front of Zhou Weiqing, her hand hurtling towards his shoulder. Although she was very fierce in her words, she knew her daughter was now having a relationship with this young man, and despite her needing to vent her anger on him, she did not overdo things.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing had been training hard these last few weeks, and being attacked suddenly, the Immortal Deity Shield hidden beneath his skin immediately came into effect, and his five energy whirlpools started spinning at top speed, his Heavenly Jewels already appearing around his wrists. With a silver flash of light, he subconsciously used Blink, barely dodging the Shangguan Bing’er’s mother’s blow.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing felt the hairs on his entire body standing as a chill ran down his spine. He had the feeling that if the he had been hit by that blow, he would have taken a huge injury. That beautiful middle aged lady looked rather frail, but the stress that she gave to him was unprecedented, even compared to when his father was seriously trying to beat him.</p>
 <p>“Ehh? Blink?” The middle aged lady looked at Zhou Weiqing with some surprise, after all it was definitely not easy to dodge that blow of hers, which could easily change directions.</p>
 <p>“Wait!” At the same time, another voice sounded out, as Ling Zihan finally awoke from her shocked trance. With a step forward, she stood before her son, saying with an excited expression on her face: “You… you’re Tang Xian Elder Sis?”</p>
 <p>When Ling Zihan said those words, everyone started, especially Zhou Weiqing; as from appearance, his mother looked at least 7-8 years older than the middle aged lady. More surprising was the fact that they knew each other! Tang Xian looked puzzlingly at Ling Zihan, saying: “You are…?”</p>
 <p>Ling Zihan said enthusiastically as she rushed forward: “Tang Xian Elder Sis! Look carefully, it’s me, Zihan! Those years ago, you and Shangguan Elder Brother saved me at the Dragonpit Riverside. You also stayed at my house for over a month, and at that time you said you liked the environment of my house. I was still a little girl at that time, and Shui Niu was studying at the Jewel Master Academy.” Tang Xian’s eyes showed surprise and happiness as she said: “You’re little Zihan? It seems just like yesterday, yet already twenty years have passed.”</p>
 <p>Ling Zihan held onto Tang Xian’s hand and said: “Yes, it’s me! It’s been twenty years, and I’ve grown so old, but Tang Xian Elder Sis, you’re still just as beautiful as you were.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s mouth twitched; he had never expected that his mother and his future mother-in-law would know each other. It was lucky that they knew each other too, this future mother-in-law seemed unbelievably powerful, and if his mother did not intervene, he would have been in serious trouble.</p>
 <p>As he thought about that, he silently sidled to the side and helped up Shangguan Bing’er from the ground. At this point, she had also recovered her ability to move, and both of them exchange strange looks. Tang Xian’s eyes suddenly changed and she whipped her head around to stare at Zhou Weiqing: “Zihan, this little brat, who is he to you?”</p>
 <p>Ling Zihan knew Tang Xian’s power very well, and quickly gripped her hands tightly, saying: “Tang Xian Elder Sis, this is my son; mine and Shui Niu’s son. He is our only son, if he has done any wrong, please punish me instead Elder Sis.”</p>
 <p>Tang Xian drew a deep breath, and slowly released it, as she continued glaring at Zhou Weiqing: “Zihan, if it were any other thing, I would have easily forgiven him. However, this son of yours took my daughter’s virtue. How could I possibly let him go?”</p>
 <p>“Ah? He just returned home, I’m also not sure what is going on. Weiqing, get over here now and kneel down to your Aunt Tang Xian.” Ling Zihan said furiously at Zhou Weiqing, although Shangguan Bing’er, who was standing beside him, could clearly see her giving him a signal with her eyes.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing braced himself as he walked forward, thinking to himself: <em>Kneeling to my mother-in-law, that isn’t so bad. At least it’s not some outsider.</em> Lowering his head, he walked to the front and kneeled down.</p>
 <p>Ling Zihan said: “Tang Xian Elder Sis, we haven’t met for so many years, where are you staying now? Where’s Shangguan Elder Brother? Is he good?”</p>
 <p>“Don’t mention him.” Tang Xian revealed a angry and suffering face. “I brought Bing’er to the Heavenly Bow City, but I never expected that you to be here, nor did I expect that the Shui Niu you mentioned years ago would actually turn out to be the Admiral Zhou of Heavenly Bow Empire.</p>
 <p>Ling Zihan gave her son a kick and said: “Little brat, speak now and tell us what happened?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing once again told his tale, and Tang Xian’s face remained icy, while Ling Zihan was totally dumbfounded.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Shangguan Bing’er also stepped forward to Zhou Weiqing’s side and knelt down in front of her mother. “Mum, I also like Little Fatty. What happened in the past was a mistake, and wasn’t his fault. After that, on the battlefield, Little Fatty saved my life twice, and was even willing to sacrifice his life for me when we were surrounded by the Forest Direwolves, attempting to let me escape. Mum, I will not like another man in my life again. If you kill him, then you must kill me as well.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er’s words caused both Zhou Weiqing and Ling Zihan to be visibly moved, and the shock and excitement in Zhou Weiqing’s heart almost caused him to lose his composure. This was the first time Shangguan Bing’er had actually admitted verbally that she liked him, and especially that line that she would never like another man again, it struck the softest spot in Zhou Weiqing’s heart. At the same time Ling Zihan was very touched, thinking to herself: That little girl doesn’t seem to have inherited her mother’s fiery temper, that’s lucky, that’s lucky.</p>
 <p>“You…” Tang Xian’s brow furrowed, before she sighed and said: “Grown girls are hard to keep at home… grown girls are hard to keep at home [1. That’s the literal translation of 女大不中留, usually used as a lament by parents as their daughters grow up and need to be married off into another family. In chinese culture, the female is married into the male’s family, so they ‘lose’ their daughter in that sense.] Sigh, never mind, this little brat Zhou Weiqing shall have the advantage… show me your Heavenly Jewels.”</p>
 <p>Tang Xian originally brought her daughter here because she was angry, but also as a bluff, a show of strength. As a mother, how could she not see that her daughter really liked that Zhou Weiqing, but as a mother, she also wanted to vent her anger and also test that little rascal as well. Zhou Weiqing’s performance had satisfied her, and with Ling Zihan mediating, he was saved the beating as well. After all, he was a Heavenly Jewel Master, one with the Spatial Attribute, and could be considered a decent match for her daughter. She just wanted to verify what attribute his Elemental Jewel was.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing showed his wrists dutifully, and when Tang Xian saw the blue-green Cat’s Eye Jewel around his wrist, her face changed instantly and she grabbed Zhou Weiqing’s left hand, saying in shock: “Alexandrite Cat’s Eye?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing felt Tang Xian’s hand like a vice around his wrist, causing it to hurt, and he gave a bitter smile as he nodded: “Yes! Aunty, that is an Alexandrite Cat’s Eye.”</p>
 <p>Tang Xian seemed stunned as she said rather absentmindedly: “What attributes?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “Wind, Lightning, Spatial, Darkness, Evil…” As he said up to there, he paused a moment, then continued resolutely: “And one more attribute that I haven’t been able to identify.”</p>
 <p>This time, even Shangguan Bing’er was surprised; she had not known that Zhou Weiqing still had a sixth attribute.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at her apologetically, nodding his head. He did not want to hide anything further from Shangguan Bing’er, her words just now had touched him deeply.</p>
