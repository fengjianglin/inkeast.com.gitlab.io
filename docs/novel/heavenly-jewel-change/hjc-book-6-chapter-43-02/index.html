 <p><b>Chapter 43 Flower of Hades’ Underworld (2)</b></p>
 <p>The large fellow Ma Qun was staring at Zhou Weiqing with a strange look on his face, though he was no longer giving his usual honest naive act. As for Kou Rui, he was looking at Zhou Weiqing with a fiery, passionate, adoring gaze. With a *swoosh*, he had jumped off from his bunk.</p>
 <p>“Boss! I want to be your subordinate, let me follow you from now on!” Kou Rui said directly.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing started. “Why? Wasn’t it a mistake earlier? That Zang Lang fellow is actually protecting the other commoner students? Why do you want to follow me? Is that fellow okay?”</p>
 <p>Kou Rui said: “That day, he awoke not long after you left, he did not sustain any heavy injuries. When he left, he did not say anything. Perhaps what the rest of the seniors said is true, and that he has always been protecting the commoner students. However, to me, all I saw was that when we were being bullied, you were the only one in our dormitory who stood up to defend us. You are a Spatial Attribute Heavenly Jewel Master, I can still recognize the Blink skill… Furthermore with three sets of Jewels and Consolidated Equipment to boot. We commoner students are already being suppressed, so I am more than willing to follow you during our study period. I believe that if we meet something similar again, you can do a lot better than Zang Lang.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Good. I’ll take care of you in future, I like intelligent fellows like you.” As he said that, he grabbed the quilt from his bed. “However, I will not be staying in the dormitory in future, I’ll see you all in class tomorrow.”</p>
 <p>Kou Rui started. “Boss, you are moving out to stay?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing nodded his head, saying: “I already rented a house, Kou Rui. Oh yes, are you a Physical Jewel Master or a Elemental Jewel Master?”</p>
 <p>Kou Rui said rather gloomily: “I’m a Physical Jewel Master, 2-Jeweled, without any Consolidated Equipment. My attributes are half agility and half coordination, one of the most useless combinations of Physical Jewel Masters, without any form of attacking capabilities. If not for that, I would have rushed to fight with them as well.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head, saying: “There are no such thing as useless powers or abilities, it is just a matter of finding your path of training. We can speak more about that in the future, I have to go now to confirm my new lodgings. I’ll talk to you when we meet back up in class.” As he said that, he headed out towards the exit. From start to end, none of the other roommates spoke a single word to him. Besides Ma Qun, the other five were looking at him with obvious fear and hesitation.</p>
 <p>When Zhou Weiqing reached the entrance of the dormitory building, Shangguan Bing’er was already waiting for him. With exit permits in hand, they managed to leave the school. After walking for several minutes, crossing a small path, they finally reached the room that Zhou Weiqing had found.</p>
 <p>As they neared the entrance, they heard the sound of an argument.</p>
 <p>“No, I’m sorry young lady, that is not possible. I have already accepted another person’s deposit. Even if you pay more, I cannot break my word, I’m sorry.”</p>
 <p>Another voice sounded out: “Uncle landlord, look at me, a lone girl, could you bear to kick me out all alone into the streets? At most… I’ll pay double of your asking price.” The voice was extremely soft and seductive, yet with a strand of coldness within, extremely unique and intriguing.</p>
 <p>“Uhhmm....”</p>
 <p>“No, double the price will not do! Don’t you understand the meaning of first come first serve?” Zhou Weiqing pushed open the door and said as he entered the house.</p>
 <p>The landlord was a middle aged man of almost fifty years of age, with an awkward look on his face showing the dilemma he was facing. In front of him stood a young lady dressed in white.</p>
 <p>Looking at the young lady, Zhou Weiqing started, thinking to himself: <em>Isn’t that Ming Yu’s little sister? Why isn’t she staying at home instead of trying to rent this room here?</em></p>
 <p>Indeed, the person who was bargaining with the landlord was Ming Hua.</p>
 <p>When Ming Hua spotted Zhou Weiqing, she was obviously startled as well. Looking at Shangguan Bing’er beside him, her mouth curled in an amused smirk.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing took a peek at Ming Hua’s voluptuous, sexy body, ripe as a peach, and couldn’t help swallow a gulp of saliva. <em>Damn, she is hot!</em></p>
 <p>Ming Hua looked to be about 20 years old or so. Compared to Shangguan Bing’er, her beauty was the sort that was displayed out and more mature looking, a contrast with Shangguan Bing’er’s sweet, quiet and graceful beauty.</p>
 <p>“You are the ones who want to rent this place?” Ming Hua’s eyes shone with a seductive gleam as she smiled faintly and said in a soft tone. “How about letting me have the place instead please?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was almost dazed by her look, and almost agreed to it when he felt a sharp pain on his waist as Shangguan Bing’er pinched him. “No, we were the ones who rented this first. Little Fatty, pay the rent.” It was indeed a rare sight to see Shangguan Bing’er so resolute and firm, clearly Ming Hua’s beauty gave her a sense of danger.</p>
 <p>Ming Hua gave a faint smile, looking at Zhou Weiqing who was standing at the side swallowing saliva in several large gulps, and she said once again in a softer, more gentle tone. “Won’t you let me have it please?” As she said that, she thought to herself. <em>Brother said this little fellow is dangerous, but it seems that despite his abilities, looking at his character, he doesn’t seem to be much.</em></p>
 <p>“No way. If my wife says no then of course the answer is no.” Just as Ming Hua was full of disdain towards Zhou Weiqing in her heart, the lustful looking rascal suddenly seemed to morph instantly into a gentleman, speaking suavely. The speed of him changing face was indeed impressive.</p>
 <p>Ming Hua started faintly, though the expression on her face did not change. She was not called the Flower of Hades’ Underworld for nothing. “What if I do not want to leave?”</p>
 <p>“Errr…” Zhou Weiqing turned his head to look at Shangguan Bing’er with a troubled look on his face. Although he liked beauties, without question Shangguan Bing’er’s place in his heart was unshakable, which was why he was able to change faces so quickly. However, looking at Ming Hua’s expression of ‘not giving a damn’, he was at a loss on what to do.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er couldn’t stand Ming Hua’s seductive look and said solemnly: “This lady, please control yourself and think of your own reputation. If you aren’t willing to leave yourself, then we will have to ask you to do so personally.” As she said that, she lifted her right hand, and in a flash of green light, her three Dragonstone Jade Physical Jewels appeared around her wrist.</p>
 <p>Ming Hua’s eyes revealed a hint of surprise.<em> Another 3-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master? How surprising! This year’s crop of commoner freshmen students are indeed impressive! Even the Fei Li Heavenly Jewel Master Academy might not even have 3-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Master freshmen.</em></p>
 <p>Upon seeing Shangguan Bing’er release her Physical Jewels, the landlord’s face turned pale. Such a pure white colour surely meant she was a Heavenly Jewel Master! He did not dare to offend any Heavenly Jewel Master. His last shred of hesitation disappeared, and just as he was about to open his mouth to ask Ming Hua to leave, she also lifted up her right hand. With another flash of light, four milky white waxy Jade Jewels appeared around her wrist - denoting the Flexibility Physical Jewel.</p>
 <p>This time, it was Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er’s turn to be shocked. Shangguan Bing’er couldn’t help but cry out in surprise: “Lower Level Zun Stage Heavenly Jewel Master?!”</p>
 <p>Ming Hua’s beautiful face blushed with a tinge of embarrassment, making anyone who looked at her feel an urge to protect her. “I have to protect myself right?”</p>
 <p>“Masturbate… [1. pun / wordplay 自卫 &amp; 自慰 both read as (zi wei)，the former meaning self protection and the latter is self pleasure *ahem*]” Zhou Weiqing felt a rush of blood to his head and nearly bled out from the nose as he stared at Ming Hua with a strange expression on his face.</p>
 <p>Ming Hua blushed fully red, this time it was for real. How could she not hear what Zhou Weiqing meant. “Hmph, you’re only sixteen years old, so young, yet what is in that head of yours! What a pity this beautiful young lady is with you. Fine, I won’t act with you anymore, I am definitely renting this house. If you have the capability, you can defeat me and I will let you have it instead, if not, it is mine!”</p>
 <p>The landlord had by now retreated far away. Both sides were Heavenly Jewel Masters, and he certainly did not want any part in this argument, and letting both sides resolve the matter between themselves was the wiser choice on his part.</p>
 <p>Hearing Ming Hua’s words, Zhou Weiqing asked puzzledly: “How did you know I am sixteen years old?”</p>
 <p>Ming Hua gave a cold humph and said: “If I know means I know, stop talking rubbish. If you want to rent this house, you’ll have to defeat me first. Aren’t you so good at fighting eh?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing stared at her speechless for a while, before finally saying: “Beautiful lady, aren’t you being unreasonable?”</p>
 <p>Ming Hua laughed enchantingly: “Are you asking a lady to be reasonable? You must be dreaming.”</p>
 <p>As she said that, she sashayed towards Zhou Weiqing, her slim waist moving like a slim tree in the wind, as if about to break at any time.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at her voluptuous figure with another gulp, before thrusting out his chest, acting in a bold manner. “Fine, fight it shall be! As if I will be scared of you!? Bing’er, move aside a little.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er made a slight sound of agreement, moving to the side. Although she had warned Zhou Weiqing earlier not to cause trouble, she knew that if someone was looking for trouble and being unreasonable, they had no choice but to act as well. After all, she was kindhearted, not stupid. Furthermore, from the look of Ming Hua’s Heavenly Jewels, it was likely that she was no match for Ming Hua. However, it might be different for Zhou Weiqing, as Shangguan Bing’er was very clear how much power her Little Fatty had now, especially after breaking through to his third set of Heavenly Jewels, she herself was no match for him already. It could be said that, with his six attributes and that Demonic Right Leg, Zhou Weiqing was unbeatable amongst anyone of equal level. Even with four sets of Jewels, Ming Hua might not be able to defeat him. Basically, for the Heavenly Bow Unit to let the two of them out half a year early, they indeed felt that there was nothing more they could teach the two of them, most especially Zhou Weiqing.</p>
