 <p><b>Chapter 26 If I let go of you, I won’t have a wife anymore! (1)</b></p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing naturally did not know that his father was still laughing maniacally to himself behind. Escaping a beating this time, he was already very satisfied. Without any delay, he rushed back to his tent; he did not have much to pack up anyway, and thus he jumped into bed to have a good sleep.</p>
 <p>Right at this moment, he heard an almost ghostly voice from outside: “Zhou Little Fatty, you’re back?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing got a fright and quickly jumped off his bed: “Who’s there? It’s late at night, don’t scare me!”</p>
 <p>As the tent flap raised up, Shangguan Bing’er entered, dressed in a cotton outfit. Her expression seemed very peaceable, without the usual cold mask she wore, but without knowing why, the Shangguan Bing’er of today caused Zhou Weiqing to have a very uneasy feeling in his heart. “Bing’er, what’s wrong?” Zhou Weiqing asked with trepidation.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er stopped about two metres away and said passively: “You’re not Zhou Little Fatty, you’re Zhou Weiqing right? You’re Admiral Zhou’s only son.”</p>
 <p>At this time, Zhou Weiqing could no longer hide the truth, saying in embarrassment: “Yes, but my childhood nickname was really Zhou Little Fatty.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er nodded her head gently and said: “Good, very good. I should have known earlier, no wonder you were so familiar with Xiao Se. How foolish of me… Zhou Little Fatty… Zhou Weiqing… My mom always said, the worst men in the world are those who lie to you. [1. Technically, he did hint to her earlier and said he won’t tell her because he didn’t want to lie to her iirc =(]. You’re good, very good.” As she said that, she turned and walked away.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was just about to chase her, but she suddenly turned around and whipped out her sword, saying in a severe voice: “Do not follow me, or I’ll kill you!” After saying that, she turned around and left once again, in a very resolute manner.</p>
 <p>Staring dumbfoundedly at the closing down before him, Zhou Weiqing felt on the verge of weeping but no tears came. How could you blame me for that? If I had told you who I was earlier, would you have allowed me to stay in the army camp?</p>
 <p>Right at the moment, there was a loud *Swish*, and the tent flap opened once more. Just as Zhou Weiqing was delighted that Shangguan Bing’er had changed her mind and returned, he saw it was his dad.</p>
 <p>“Little brat, I forgot to ask you something just now. Since you’re together with Bing’er now, what about the princess?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said uncertainly: “Princess Difuya? Didn’t I ask you to turn down the marriage?”</p>
 <p>Admiral Zhou gave a loud humph: “Turn down the marriage? Don’t tell it to me, go tell your godfather that. If you have the ability to persuade him, your Father, I, will be happy to oblige.”</p>
 <p>Having said that, Admiral Zhou turned around to leave, but just as he lifted the tent flap, he stopped and said with his back to Zhou Weiqing: “A man should chase 2 but ensure 1, before going for 4,5,6,7! [2. Lolwut] Our Zhou Family has very few members, and no matter how many wives you bring home, our house can support them. Damn it, you little brat, you’re not even 14 and you’ve already done it. When Your Father, I, was 14… I.... Ahem. Tomorrow you better hurry up and get lost. Anyway, here’s a birthday present.”</p>
 <p>With that, a black object flew in front of Zhou Weiqing, and by the time he had caught it, Admiral Zhou had already disappeared.</p>
 <p>The black object was very light and soft to the touch, and as Zhou Weiqing brought it closer to the lamp light to look, he realised it was a black tight fitting sleeveless vest, extremely soft like silk, but its black surface had a rather dim silvery glow.</p>
 <p><em>He still remembered my birthday…</em> Zhou Weiqing suddenly felt his eyes grow moist, and he had the urge to chase out after him. In the end, he did not do so. “Dad, thanks. I will definitely make you proud in the future, so that you can be known as Zhou Weiqing’s father, and not me as Admiral Zhou’s son.”</p>
 <p>“Hmm, oh yes, I need to say goodbye to Ru Se Elder Sis as well.”</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Dawn.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er was carrying her bags, a dark cloud over her face as she walked out from the army camp. As soon as she exited the camp, she saw a smiling Zhou Weiqing with his backpack shouldered as well, standing there outside waiting. “What are you doing here?” Shangguan Bing’er stopped in her tracks, looking very unapproachable.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing grinned and said: “Of course, it’s to go with you to the Heavenly Bow Unit. I said before, no matter where you go, I’ll follow you.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er gave a cold humph: “This is the army, how dare you leave on your own accord? Aren’t you afraid of being punished?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “It’s my dad who asked me to go with you to the Heavenly Bow Unit.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er started a little, and a self mocking expression appeared on her face: “Oh yes, you’re Admiral Zhou’s son.” As she said that, she spun around and released her Heavenly Jewels, shooting forth at top speed.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing did not dare delay, moving the attribute wheel to the Wind Attribute and focusing Heavenly Energy into his right leg, and just like that, the two of them left the main army camp one after the other.</p>
 <p>As their figures disappeared in the distance, Xiao Ru Se’s figure appeared at the exit, her face carrying a smile with a hint of melancholy. She softly muttered to herself: “Good luck to you two, Little Wei, Elder Sis will be waiting for you two here.”</p>
 <p>As she said that, she turned around and in the air, resounded her melodious voice: “You were not there when I was born, I was old when you were born. I regret that you were late born, You regret that I was early born... [3. This is an adaptation of a very <a href="//zhidao.baidu.com/question/38923619.html”">famous Tang Dynasty Poem</a>, which describes of an unrequited love of an older man and a younger woman.]”</p>
 <p>As his cultivation level of Heavenly Energy had risen, along with the completion of the first portion of the Immortal Deity Technique, Zhou Weiqing’s speed had raised by quite a substantial amount. However, he was still highly dependent on his Demonic Right Leg’s immense strength to propel him forward, and only by doing so could he barely keep up with Shangguan Bing’er. After all, she was a full agility type Heavenly Jewel Master, and it was only because his energy regeneration had nearly doubled after completing the first portion of the Immortal Deity Technique, that he was able to just keep up.</p>
 <p>However, this time, it seemed that Shangguan Bing’er was really angry, as soon as she saw that Zhou Weiqing was keeping up with her, she gave an angry humph and her Elemental Jewel flew discreetly into the socket of her Wind Wielding Boots. In an instant, her speed had a sudden increased burst, and she shot forward like a shooting star in the skies.</p>
 <p>Seeing that she was about to increase the gap between them once again; at this critical moment, Zhou Weiqing did not care any further, and his left hand extended out towards Shangguan Bing’er, and instantly and Fetters of Wind fell upon her.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er did not expect that Zhou Weiqing would use a skill on her, and instantly her body froze in place as she was controlled. Due to inertia from the sudden stop, she fell and rolled onto the floor.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing displayed the fruits of his labour, the result of the many days of practicing with complementing skills. As the green light of the Fetters of Wind flashed, another black light followed almost instantly. The black light denoting the Touch of Darkness wrapped around Shangguan Bing’er, pulling her back and saving her from the fall, slowing her speed. Alas, the sheer speed from the Wind Wielding Boots Fusion Skill was just too fast, and even though the Touch of Darkness managed to slow her down by a large margin, but the impact caused it to break.</p>
 <p>However, in that short span of time, Zhou Weiqing had managed to catch up to her, and when he was barely a few metres from her, he immediately activated his Blink skill, appearing right below Shangguan Bing’er. As she fell down from the sky, she landed right on top of him. *Bang*!</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er fell onto Zhou Weiqing with a loud crash, and was immediately embraced by him. Although she was very light, but slamming down on him like that with such great impact, Zhou Weiqing’s face turned pale in pain, but his arms did not lessen his grip, as if saying that he would never let go.</p>
 <p>In this scenario, the advantage of the Strength Physical Jewel was put into play. Although Shangguan Bing’er was at the tenth level of Heavenly Energy, and had two sets of Heavenly Jewels, but her strength was no match for Zhou Weiqing with his strength buff.</p>
 <p>“Let go of me!” Shangguan Bing’er said angrily.</p>
 <p>“No! I won’t let go! If I let go of you now, I’ll lose my wife forever!” Zhou Weiqing said stubbornly.</p>
 <p>“You…” Shangguan Bing’er’s face was cold and furious: “If you don’t let go of me, I’ll die right in front of you now.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was stunned for a second, and he carried her up and let go of her.</p>
 <p>As soon as he let go, Shangguan Bing’er had taken off the Purple Dawn Bow from her back, and instantly nocked an arrow and drew it to maximum capacity, aiming at him. Zhou Weiqing said with a bitter smile: “Even if you proclaim the death sentence on me, shouldn’t you give me a chance to explain?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er said coldly: “Explain? What’s there to explain? Do you think I’m a fool? Do you think I do not know about Admiral Zhou’s only son, who has had Princess Difuya betrothed to him since young? Viscount Zhou… Prince Zhou [4. Referring to him as the Emperor’s to-be-son in law], please do not follow me from now on, or I will kill you.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing thought to himself: Although Bing’er may seem very gentle, but when she is resolute, her inner nature is extremely unyielding. It seems like, words will not solve anything.</p>
 <p>Taking a deep breath, looking at the cold glint of the arrow pointed at him, Zhou Weiqing flipped his hands, and drew an arrow from his own quiver.</p>
 <p>“I do not need you to take action. I did hide my identity from you. That is my fault, and I will take action myself.”</p>
 <p>As he said that, without any hesitation, he took up the arrow and slammed it into his left shoulder. *Pshh* Instantly, fresh blood spurted out, turning the arm of his uniform entirely red. Zhou Weiqing did not make any sound, biting his lips as his body shuddered.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er was stunned by the scene in front of her, and she subconsciously loosened her hold on the bow. “You… are you crazy??”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said solemnly: “I’m not crazy now, but if you leave me, I will really become crazy. As long as I can keep you by my side, no matter what price I have to pay, I am willing.” As he said that, his hands flipped to the side again, as he took out another arrow. He was not shamming or putting up an act; as he spent more and more time with Shangguan Bing’er, he had found that he had truly fallen for her. Her light, her innocence, her gentle character, the resoluteness in her bones, all of that combined to draw him like a top grade wine. Although Zhou Weiqing was still young, but having inherited the black pearl’s senses, he had the feeling that if he let her leave this time, it would likely be forever. As such, no matter what, he had to leave her here, to explain things to her. He did not want to let happiness slip from his hands just like that. Holding the arrow in his hands pointed to himself once again, he asked her: “Bing’er, will you give me the opportunity to explain myself?”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Bing’er stared at him, tears involuntarily falling down from her eyes. At the same time, the Purple Dawn Bow and the arrow fell from her hands, and her body shook and trembled as she looked at Zhou Weiqing in tears, her heart trembling within as well.</p>
