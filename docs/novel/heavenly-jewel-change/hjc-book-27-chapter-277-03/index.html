 <p>Immediately after, a human-like smile appeared on the Demon God’s exceedingly handsome face. Coupled with his strange features, it gave off a very demonic vibe.</p>
 <p>A green light flashed in the hand of the woman decked in a long green dress, and a scepter that was much taller than her appeared within it. She swung it lightly, sweeping away all the sidhe on the ground, leaving no one behind except for her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Mother Nature?” The Demon God’s cold demonic voice was heard. He was standing there the whole time with his hands behind him, without any weapon. However, judging from his crushing aura, the Demon God clearly had the upper hand. After all, Mother Nature was of a much lower rank when compared to the Demon God. Nonetheless, the current stalemate before them could only prove one thing - the individual who summoned Mother Nature was a lot stronger than the person who summoned the Demon God.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“A human who can summon the real Demon God and merge himself with it actually exists - even the Heavenly Demon Sect of the human world is not able to pull this off. Give me back my daughter and I will let you go. Or else the sealed grounds will be your burial ground.”</p>
 <p>Without a doubt, the Sidhe Queen was the one who summoned Mother Nature. At this moment, Zhou Weiqing, who was currently controlling the phantom image of the Demon God, was completely shocked. After all, he had only succeeded in summoning the Demon God with the help of his Saint Energy. The Sidhe Queen must have had some special ability in order for her to summon Mother Nature as well, and it was such a formidable power! If she had forcefully summoned Mother Nature by virtue of her cultivation base, then perhaps Mother Nature’ cultivation base was higher than that of Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord. She might even be on par with the great dragon Hui Yao.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Let me say this for the last time, we did not abduct your daughter. We came here with no ill intentions, or else this place would have been strewn with dead corpses before your arrival, with just my strength alone. Furthermore, I don’t owe you any explanations. Even with your strength and power, I’m afraid you might not be able to keep us here.”</p>
 <p>A trace of human emotion was seen on Mother Nature’ face. Her brows furrowed slightly and her blue eyes stared at the Demon God across from her.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Indeed, you did show mercy earlier. However, if you think that you can succeed in getting what you want by using my daughter to threaten me, you have thought wrong. Did you think that you could use the Demon God to threaten me? It’s true that the Demon God might be stronger than Mother Nature, but I’m afraid you haven’t fully grasped his ability yet. The more powerful its projection is, the more strength is needed on your part. Relying solely on its aura for dominance is not sufficient. After all, this place is our sealed grounds - we are backed by an endless life aura. If I say that you’re not allowed to leave, you definitely will not be able to leave.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing felt helpless, “Are the sidhe really that single-minded and stubborn?</p>
 <p>The Sidhe Queen snapped, “Hand me my daughter and stop everything that you are doing now. Or else, don’t blame me for being merciless.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was rather annoyed. He replied coldly, “Attack me then. I do want to see how merciless you are.” Since the situation was as such now - if he could not use power to subdue his opponent, it seemed to him that regardless of what he said, the other party would not listen to him anyway. Even if he could not defeat the Sidhe Queen, at the very least he wanted her to know that his powers were not so easily crushed.</p>
 <p>In an instant, the sealed grounds transformed - an exuberant green world appeared behind Mother Nature, while a demonic gray world appeared behind the Demon God. Even the plants were engulfed by a layer of faint demonic aura. Zhou Weiqing had already tried his best to minimize the impact on the surroundings. After all, he truly fancied the sealed grounds, and had no desire to wreck it.</p>
 <p>Mother Nature slowly raised the scepter in her hand; an intense green light of Life Energy gushed towards the Demon God, engulfing him.</p>
 <p>Her goal was very simple - she wanted to exhaust Zhou Weiqing’s energy via the massive Life Energy present in the sealed grounds. As long as Zhou Weiqing could no longer maintain the energy needed to summon the Demon God, he would naturally lose to her.</p>
 <p>The coldness in the Demon God’s eyes intensified; a gray brilliance flashed in his eyes and in the next moment, his long robe swayed, despite the absence of wind. Without any prior warning, a gray light blade appeared in mid-air, even though the Demon God did not make a single movement.</p>
 <p>A faint ‘puff’ sound was heard and the green band of light flew all over the sky, like butterflies. The gray blade light had brought about a long rainbow with a heinous demonic aura, charging towards Mother Nature.</p>
 <p>Mother Nature’ facial expression changed; she lifted the scepter high up in her hand, facing the gray blade light head-on. After a ‘clash’ sound was heard, energy ripples spread through the air. Mother Nature’ body swayed slightly, but the Demon God did not budge at all.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the Sidhe Queen was filled with astonishment and shock. She had never expected Zhou Weiqing to be that strong. When she had arrived at the scene, Zhou Weiqing was only about to summon the Demon God. At that time, Zhou Weiqing had yet to merge himself with the Demon God. Even an ordinary sidhe possessed the Qi Observation Technique, let alone the Sidhe Queen, whose Qi Observation Technique was naturally much stronger, as part of the royal lineage. At one glance, she was able to tell that Zhou Weiqing was a Mid Level Heavenly Emperor.</p>
 <p>Without a doubt, his cultivation base would have qualified him to be one of the top players in the human world, but within the Sidhe Tribe, it was not considered formidable enough to cause a stir. From the Sidhe Queen’s point of view, Zhou Weiqing must have had used a hidden technique to summon the Demon God’s projection. Even though the projection was so shockingly clear, it did not mean that the Demon God possessed any combat skills. With regards to this, the Sidhe Queen was much stronger than all the other enemies that Zhou Weiqing had dealt with in the past, because she could summon Mother Nature via a secret technique. Naturally, she was much more knowledgeable with regards to such an ability.</p>
 <p>However, looking at the current situation, the Sidhe Queen realized that her judgment might have been wrong. Not only did the Demon God have actual combat powers, they all came from the true Demon God himself! <em>How could a mere Heavenly Emperor achieve that?</em> She was very puzzled. It was no wonder he had the audacity to kidnap his daughter. He was that powerful.</p>
 <p>As the saying goes, ‘first impressions are the strongest’. The Sidhe Queen assumed that Zhou Weiqing’s intention was to kidnap her daughter first, before negotiating a deal with her.</p>
 <p>This was also the reason why Zhou Weiqing was unwilling to launch an attack until he was forced to.</p>
 <p>Mother Nature scoffed before waving the scepter once again. The long and slim scepter transformed into a long whip before it lashed towards the Demon God. The dense life aura in the air transformed into a long river; countless green light spots headed towards the Demon God’s body, along with the long whip.</p>
 <p>A strong binding force appeared around the Demon God’s body.</p>
 <p>A frosty look flashed in the Demon God’s eyes once again. This time, he finally moved - his enormous body took a step forward in the sky. At the same time, his right hand clawed into the thin air, causing something strange to happen. A layer of gray stream of air brought about countless dazzling starlight. The moment the green binding light came into contact with the starlight, they dissipated immediately. Some of them even merged with the gray stream of air.</p>
 <p>Cold and gloomy light rays erupted abruptly. Vaguely, a tinge of anger could be seen in the Demon God’s eyes from the provocations it had suffered.</p>
 <p>Seconds later, within the void, a long sword slashed the space above the Demon God’s head open.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“The Sword of the Demon God?” Mother Nature cried out in shock. Fear could be detected in her voice.</p>
 <p>Just like Mother Nature’ scepter was her weapon, the Sword of Demon God was his. However, the Demon God was still ranked way above Mother Nature. The Mother Nature that the Sidhe Queen summoned was the enlarged version of herself - everything was under her control.</p>
 <p>However, it was different for the Demon God. As one of the most formidable gods, even a mere projection of it could not entirely be controlled by the person who summoned it. Hence, the anger displayed by the Demon God earlier was not the embodiment of Zhou Weiqing’s emotions. It was the actual wrath of the higher being incurred by the puny Nature Goddess’ provocation.</p>
 <p>Therefore, the Sword of Demon God, which Zhou Weiqing had absolutely no power over, appeared.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Zhou Weiqing was similarly in extreme agony. This was because of the terrifyingly rapid consumption of the Nebula Saint Energy within his body. Fortunately, he had his five ladies by his side. Apart from Little Witch, the other four women had already condensed their Saint Core Nucleus. Furthermore, Tian’er’s Saint Core Nucleus was also just as pure as his Saint Core Nucleus. With their support, Zhou Weiqing was able to withstand the rapid consumption of his Nebula Saint Energy. At the same time, he was constantly relying on his Saint Energy to absorb the Nature Elemental Energy to replenish his body.</p>
 <p>The Sword of Demon God was not very long, just slightly shorter than Mother Nature’ scepter. It did not land directly into the Demon God’s hands either; it was simply hovering in the air.</p>
 <p>Once the Sword of Demon God appeared, Mother Nature’ long whip broke into pieces and transformed into countless light spots in the sky. Ultimately, they pieced themselves back together to form a scepter before falling back into the hands of Mother Nature.</p>
 <p>The frosty demonic aura in the air erupted in an instant. At this moment, everything between heaven and earth became a horrifying shade of gray.&nbsp;At this moment, even Zhou Weiqing could sense the terrifying suppressive aura. Even though he was the one who summoned the Demon God, he was already starting to feel out of breath.</p>
 <p>The projection of the Demon God was already out of his control - he was clueless with regards to what was going to happen next.</p>
 <p>Nobody would have expected an unforeseen situation as such, but Zhou Weiqing was speechless because even though the Demon God had launched the attacks out of its own free will, he consumed Zhou Weiqing’s energy instead!</p>
 <p>However, this was not entirely unfavorable to Zhou Weiqing. He had realized that when the Demon God was absorbing his Nebula Saint Energy and transforming it into Demonic Energy, he was also using the Nebula Saint Energy to assimilate the surrounding energy. Without a doubt, it was a lot more effective than Zhou Weiqing’s method of controlling the Nebula Saint Energy, even though it seemed rather strange. Otherwise, it was impossible for him to manipulate the Demon God’s weapon by solely relying on his cultivation base, even though he possessed the Saint Energy.</p>
 <p>The only thing Zhou Weiqing could do right now was to silently remember the trajectory, and also pray for the Sidhe Queen at the same time. He had come here without the intention of harming or killing anyone!</p>
