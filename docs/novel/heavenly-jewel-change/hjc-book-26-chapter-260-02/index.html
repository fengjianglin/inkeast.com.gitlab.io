 <p>When he saw how easily Zhou Weiqing had deflected his pressure aura, Shangguan Tianyue’s eyes flickered with a hint of approval. &nbsp;His right hand gestured in midair, causing a stream of fog to condense into an arrow which then shot out towards Zhou Weiqing’s chest.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyue was using the purest Heavenly Energy for his attack. &nbsp;It had no Attribute at all, but it was incredibly compressed.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was very calm. &nbsp;He didn’t move, just lifted up his hands and then slowly pushed out in front of his chest. &nbsp;A halo of faint golden light spread out from his palms, forming an extremely slender translucent light barrier before him. &nbsp;Pop! A soft sound rang out, and the arrow actually transformed back into mist after hitting the shield, then began to dissipate.</p>
 <p>This didn’t seem to be an especially remarkable clash, but after the mist dissipated and swept outwards a series of howling sounds filled the entire drill grounds. &nbsp;Shangguan Tianyang had to wave his hand and establish a barrier in order to block the chaotic, distorted mist. This was proof as to just how powerful that attack was.</p>
 <p>“Ehhh?” &nbsp;Shangguan Tianyue let out a surprised sound. &nbsp;In the next instant, he appeared in front of Zhou Weiqing. &nbsp;He struck out with both hands with an attack that seemed neither fast nor slow, and which didn’t seem particularly fierce… but space for dozens of meters around him and Zhou Weiqing suddenly began to twist and distort.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s face turned much more solemn. &nbsp;Golden light flashed, followed by a pair of faint golden wings unfurling behind his back. &nbsp;The wings spread out to wrap around him, covering him and protecting him. He had finally been forced to use the Dragon-Tiger Transformation.</p>
 <p>However, those who were familiar with Zhou Weiqing’s abilities would be able to tell that his Dragon-Tiger Transformation had undergone an absolutely overwhelming transformation. &nbsp;Aside from gaining a pair of wings and the gold light emanating from his body growing a bit brighter, he didn’t seem to have changed at all. He no longer had any of that powerful, dominating appearance he possessed in the past.</p>
 <p>Boom! &nbsp;Shangguan Tianyue’s twin palms slammed unhesitatingly upon Zhou Weiqing’s wings. &nbsp;Instantly, Zhou Weiqing shot backwards as though he had been fired out of a cannon. &nbsp;Even in midair, he still emanated that aura of golden light.</p>
 <p>This time, Shangguan Tianyue’s face actually tightened. &nbsp;If the earlier attack had been nothing more than a test, this last one had contained 60% of his Heavenly Energy. &nbsp;Even though he didn’t use any Consolidated Equipment or any special Attributes and techniques, it still represented a tremendous strike from a Heavenly Emperor!</p>
 <p>And yet, he could clearly sense that when he launched this attack, its power had been deflected in waves by Zhou Weiqing’s wings. &nbsp;It looked as though Zhou Weiqing had been sent flying, but in reality he hadn’t been able to injure Zhou Weiqing at all.</p>
 <p><em>What sort of power was this?</em>&nbsp; This was the first time Shangguan Tianyue had encountered such a freakishly powerful defense. &nbsp;He felt certain that not even his own big brother would be able to withstand an attack like this head-on without counter-attacking to weaken the strike!</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing’s body flew nearly a hundred meters backwards before coming to a halt in midair. &nbsp;His wings were completely unfurled, and a hint of a smile appeared on his face. His foe was his father-in-law; thus he had already held back for three stances to show courtesy, fully relying on his freakishly strong defenses alone. &nbsp;It looked to Shangguan Tianyue as though Zhou Weiqing had endured the attack with ease, but in reality he had endured quite a bit of pressure from this attack.</p>
 <p>He himself didn’t know what was the maximum amount of punishment he could take. &nbsp;The experience he had gained from the last few attacks let him know that although he knew he had reached a very high level of power after consolidating his Astral Saint Core Nucleus, he had still underestimated himself. &nbsp;In other words, his current level of strength was even stronger than what he thought it would be.</p>
 <p>“Be careful, father-in-law.” &nbsp;Zhou Weiqing’s voice rang out. &nbsp;Clearly, he wasn’t injured at all. &nbsp;His hands came together before his chest, each drawing out a triangle. &nbsp;Moments later, the Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation had formed beneath his feet.</p>
 <p>Unlike the past, the current Six Ultimate Godly Light Formation had more than just six Elemental Jewels appearing six different corners. &nbsp;There were also the four remaining Jewels hovering above Zhou Weiqing’s head, gleaming with breathtaking light.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing was quite crafty. &nbsp;He wasn’t going to use his Legendary Set, as his Hate Ground No Handle set was still incomplete. &nbsp;As such, it absolutely could not compete against Shangguan Tianyue’s full Legendary Set. So long as he himself didn’t use his own Legendary Set, given Shangguan Tianyue’s status, the man naturally wouldn’t release his own Legendary Set either. &nbsp;That way, the massive difference in power between the two would be slightly lessened.</p>
 <p>It had been three attacks already. &nbsp;Zhou Weiqing wasn’t going to hold back any further. &nbsp;Being able to rely on his physical defenses alone to endure three attacks had already stunned everyone present, but this was just the start. &nbsp;Zhou Weiqing pointed with his right hand, causing the strange Image of a feline Heavenly Beast to flicker before him, then bound towards Shangguan Tianyue. &nbsp;He didn’t seem to need to first accumulate power at all.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Tianyue waved his sleeves. &nbsp;Now that Zhou Weiqing had used a technique, he himself wasn’t going to be overly courteous any longer. &nbsp;A icy blue longspear shot out and flew straight towards that feline Heavenly Beast.</p>
 <p>Was this a Heavenly Skill Image? &nbsp;No. Zhou Weiqing’s technique didn’t have the aura of a Heavenly Skill Image at all.</p>
 <p>Something marvelous happened. &nbsp;When the feline Heavenly Beast collided against the icy longspear, its body twisted slightly… and in the next instantly, the icy spear actually flew through it. &nbsp;The feline, however, was landing in front of Shangguan Tianyue.</p>
