 <p><b>Chapter 186 Shameless… with good intent? (2)</b></p>
 <p>“For… my… sake… Tian’er … was even willing… to give up… her life…, I cannot… abandon… her… Help me … apologise… to Bing’er… and Fei’er… Please… Also… to you… I sincerely… apologise as… well… I truly… did not… know it was… you… I did… not mean… to violate you… like that…”</p>
 <p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s words and seeing his feeble state, no matter how much hate Shangguan Xue’er had for him violating her, she couldn’t possibly flare out now!</p>
 <p>She truly did not mean to kill him!</p>
 <p>“You… you… why didn’t you dodge! I didn’t mean to kill you!” Shangguan Xue’er choked out through her dry sobs, tears welling up in her eyes and threatening to fall.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing ‘forcefully’ squeezed out a smile, almost a grimace… such an amazing performance indeed, with just a faint hint of sorrow, with the right mix of apology, and a thick unwillingness to part with the world. In a soft voice, he said: “It was of my own will. I know, in your heart, I have never been a good person. I am not worthy of Bing’er or Fei’er. Just now, I even violated you... That sword, count it as a repayment to you. This way, I do not owe you anymore. Furthermore, now that I have won… you can’t interfere with me and Bing’er or Fei’er anymore right?”</p>
 <p>“You can’t even keep your own life anymore, what’s the point of speaking about all that?” Shangguan Xue’er couldn’t help the tears starting to fall down quietly.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head slightly and said: “Of course there is meaning… Bing’er and I are already man and wife intimately. Please do not tell her that you were the one who killed me… just say that I have let them down, and that I took my own life. As for Fei’er, please help her find a person who loves her more… I have not actually been fully intimate with her. As for you, although you made an oath just now, that was just me provoking you so that I can defeat you. Originally, I thought I could still survive, haha, I did not realise how much blood I had lost…”</p>
 <p>“Don’t speak anymore… in such a circumstance, you can still laugh.” Unknowingly, Shangguan Xue’er was holding Zhou Weiqing’s body tightly as tears streamed down her cheeks, her entire body trembling violently. In her entire life, this was the first time she had such a violent emotional fluctuation.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing continued laughing foolishly as he said stubbornly: “Let me finish speaking. If I do not get this off my chest, I am afraid I may not have the chance to say it in the future. Xue’er, I am sorry, can you accept my apology? You are a very good person and wonderful lady, Bro Zhan LingTian seems to like you a lot, you can consider him in the future. Alright, I am done… you can go now, please let me lie here to silently leave the world? I wish to leave my last time with my girls, let me think of them as I drift away…”</p>
 <p>“No, no, you can’t die like this.” Shangguan Xue’er’s heart trembled, her emotions veering out of control. She circulated whatever Heavenly Energy she had with all her might, trying to infuse it into Zhou Weiqing’s body. Alas, she had already spent so much Heavenly Energy in the fight, and at the end Zhou Weiqing had been just too thorough when using his Devour Skill earlier. Furthermore, only a short time had passed since she had awakened, and her emotions had been in such turmoil and turbulence since, how much could she have recovered?</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed and said: “Don’t waste strength anymore, Xue’er. Please don’t forget the words I said and help me pass them on. As for Tian’er, I…” Zhou Weiqing stopped at that point, pain flashing in his eyes as the glint of tears showed, the deep orbs filled with unwillingness and sorrow. In Shangguan Xue’er’s eyes, the sight caused her heart to ache so much that she found it difficult to breathe.</p>
 <p>“I… I will not marry anyone else. I have already lost the bet, and I will keep that oath. I will be your wife as well. If you die, I will also accompany you in death. Leaving me alone here… how could I possibly face Bing’er and Fei’er? The words you said… I’m sorry, I cannot pass them on as well.” Shangguan Xue’er burst out crying as she fell upon Zhou Weiqing’s body. Luckily, she was not able to release her Boundless Infinitum Sword now, otherwise who knows if she might even kill herself.</p>
 <p>If Zhou Weiqing really died at her hands, how could she possibly face her two sisters, and even that Tian’er? She would never be able to get past that in her heart. To her, the easiest choice would be to follow Zhou Weiqing into death, with no other problems to face. At this point, Shangguan Xue’er set her resolve. Holding tight onto Zhou Weiqing, feeling his body grow colder, she thought to herself - as soon as he passed, she would follow suit.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er did not see that Zhou Weiqing’s head suddenly turn slightly to the side, waggling his eyebrow as he threw a significant look in signalling.</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, a sombre voice rang out of nowhere. “What are you two little fellows doing? What is going on?”</p>
 <p>A flash of light, and a massive figure descended from the skies, landing beside them. It was the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya!</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er was given a fright by his sudden appearance, before she was filled with joy. She immediately cried out: “Senior Long, quickly save Weiqing. He is almost dying. Please save him!”</p>
 <p>Looking at Shangguan Xue’er’s worried eyes, Long Shiya almost burst out laughing. Almost dying? That little brat was still brimming with life. Shangguan Xue’er might not be able to see it, but how could he not?</p>
 <p>In truth, when Zhou Weiqing had won Shangguan Xue’er, Long Shiya had already arrived. With such strong Heavenly Energy reverberations during their fight, others might not have sensed it, but how could the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor not sense it? Long Shiya had long since returned to the Peerless Battalion, just that he had not shown himself much, staying together with Duan Tianlang and helping him with his Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. With his status, he normally did not mix around with the others too much.</p>
 <p>Just as he arrived, he had witnessed Zhou Weiqing’s wretched hands on Shangguan Xue’er’s buttocks moving around. However, the blood all over Zhou Weiqing had also given him a fright, and he quickly did voice transference to ask Zhou Weiqing. Upon hearing that his Master had arrived, Zhou Weiqing had quickly come up with a new plan, hence the scene that had occurred since. Long Shiya’s timely appearance now was naturally to ‘save the day’ and rescue him from death’s door.</p>
 <p>Of course, this was all part of Zhou Weiqing’s master plan!</p>
 <p>With a grave look on his face, Long Shiya unleashed a powerful Angel’s Blessing Skill. A thick gold light enveloping Zhou Weiqing’s entire body. Bathed in the gold light, Zhou Weiqing’s expression relaxed instantly, taking a favourable turn. Beside him, even Shangguan Xue’er felt her Heavenly Energy recovering quickly.</p>
 <p>Watching Zhou Weiqing with a nervous and anxious look on her face, Shangguan Xue’er had never felt her heartbeat race so quickly before. The abrupt rise and fall in her emotions caused her to feel so tired, but her feelings for Zhou Weiqing had undergone a total upheaval, turned upside down altogether.</p>
 <p>In her eyes, a person so close to death was definitely speaking the truth, for there was no reason to lie. These words that Zhou Weiqing spoke to her had to be from his heart. Although this fellow was quite the playboy, and shameless to boot, but his feelings for those girls were all true and strong. The hate in Shangguan Xue’er’s heart had evaporated, and as she thought how he had violated her, as well as the oath she had taken, a strange feeling rose in her heart.</p>
 <p>It did not take long before Long Shiya slowly dispelled his Skill, taking Zhou Weiqing from Shangguan Xue’er’s hands. He breathed a loud sigh of relief, saying: “Luckily this old man came in time. How did Little Fatty sustain such a heavy injury? What were you two doing?”</p>
 <p>Long Shiya’s voice was filled with anger, eyeing Shangguan Xue’er as if he was feeling enraged at her.</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, Zhou Weiqing opened his eyes weakly and said ‘anxiously’: “Master, don’t blame Xue’er. It was my own fault for being careless when we fought, and I was injured by mistake. It is not her fault.”</p>
 <p>Long Shiya gave an angry humph, glaring at Zhou Weiqing exasperatedly: “You little bastard, can’t you rest a bit. Previously, you already brought back one from the Heavenly Snow Mountain, and now you are provoking a new one. Hmph!” These words were at least extremely heartfelt.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Xue’er flushed deeply and she said softly: “Senior, it is my fault, I was the one who hurt Weiqing. Will he be alright?”</p>
 <p>Long Shiya said solemnly: “His wounds have basically healed, but at a toll to his vitality. It will take a while for him to fully recover, but he is no longer in any danger. You guys, since you are duelling, why did you use the Boundless Infinitum Sword? Don’t you know the power of your own Boundless Infinitum Sword? Alright, you head back first, I’ll still need to finish healing him, at least to ensure he recovers some vitality.”</p>
 <p>Upon hearing that, Shangguan Xue’er heaved a sigh of relief. She asked sincerely: “Senior, can I stay to help take care of Weiqing?”</p>
 <p>Long Shiya glanced at her and said: “No need, having me here is enough. You head back first, if you want to take care of him, wait until he returns to the camp to rest.”</p>
 <p>Seeing Long Shiya’s distant look, and Zhou Weiqing’s apologetic look at her, Shangguan Xue’er sighed before turning to leave. She did not rush off, looking back several times as she did so, as if imprinting Zhou Weiqing’s looks in her mind.</p>
 <p>When Shangguan Xue’er finally disappeared into the distance, only then did Long Shiya dump his ‘precious’ disciple on the ground huffily. He couldn’t help but scold angrily: “You little brat, bringing disaster to yet another good girl!? This old man is going to be angered to death by you in the future! Next time, don’t look for me to act like this! Such a good girl like her, how can you lie to her like that?!”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing smiled bitterly and stood up. “Haiz, I had no other choice, otherwise I would have been unable to get past that stage! Xue’er is the elder sister of Bing’er and Fei’er, and of the three of them, she is the one who truly represents the Heaven’s Expanse Palace.”</p>
 <p>“If she does not give her consent, not only will my relationship with Tian’er be in deep trouble, even Bing’er and Fei’er will be extremely troublesome. Only if I gain her approval, can there be a resolution.”</p>
 <p>Speaking to that point, Zhou Weiqing suddenly turned shameless once more. “Furthermore, Master, don’t you think it is a great thing to marry triplets? Your disciple will be marrying the Heavenly Snow Mountain Lord’s daughter and the Heaven’s Expanse Palace Master’s daughters! Heh heh, two Great Saint Lands!”</p>
 <p>Long Shiya couldn’t help but laugh as well. “You little brat, with those acting skills of yours, let alone that little girl, even I was given a big scare. If I had not gotten the voice transference from you, I would have known that you were totally fine so easily. Well… what now? Keep up the act?”</p>
