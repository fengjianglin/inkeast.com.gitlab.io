Tears began to stream down Zhou Weiqing’s face involuntarily. Currently, he could clearly see the tall, large figure barely five metres from the front of the palace, hovering in midair.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The broad shoulders, the straight and proud stature, the pitch black armour, and that strong spirit that would never admit defeat. That was his father, the once-strongest powerhouse in the entire Heavenly Bow Empire. Admiral Zhou, who had been willing to give everything for his homeland, his country.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In the faint black shield of light, there were still many other people. Next, Zhou Weiqing saw his mother, Ling Zihan. She was not far from her father. He then saw his godfather, the Emperor of the Heavenly Bow Empire, Di Fengling. However, currently Di Fengling was in a position that left Zhou Weiqing in utter disbelief. He was actually kneeling down before his own father. At the same time, those kneeling down included Xiao Ru Se’s father, the Prime Minister of the Empire, the Finance Minister Xiao Yun, and all the other upper echelons of the Heavenly Bow Empire. They were all kneeling down in front of his father in prayer.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Astral power abruptly stopped its dissolving of the Seal. In a flash, Zhou Weiqing appeared in front of his frozen father.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even when facing three Heavenly Kings and a Heavenly Emperor, Zhou Weiqing had been calm and unflurried. However, at this point, his entire body was trembling uncontrollably.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As soon as the darkness of the Fate Denying Seal approached his body, the Astral Saint Energy around him would automatically take care of it. His father was right in front of him, eyes still filled with unyielding determination. Abruptly, Zhou Weiqing opened his arms and embraced his father.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tian’er!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A call rang out into the skies, filled with choking of sobs. In the next instant, the entire heavens and earth were filled with a brilliant, blinding gold light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The instant Zhou Weiqing embraced his father, his Astral powers circulated at full strength. The darkness brought by the Fate Denying Seal had totally disappeared. In the next instant, the stars in the skies faded away, replaced by a massive gold illusory Angel.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Six wings flapping, a thick gold light mixed with silver-white Saint Energy descended from the skies. The palace hall which had been covered in the pitch black darkness for several years, filled with a dark gloomy aura, was now covered with a layer of Divine gold light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Divine energy reverberations flowed in the air, forming sparks of gold starlight spreading down to all those below, causing them to be covered with a layer of gold mist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Divine energy slowly fused into their bodies, slowly removing the Darkness Attribute energies in their bodies due to the Fate Denying Seal. The Saint Energy filled with the power of creation slowly nourishing and replenishing their bodies, reinvoking their life force.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was only one exception. Admiral Zhou, who was still in Zhou Weiqing’s tight embrace.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Admiral Zhou’s Elemental Jewel was originally of the Darkness Attribute, and it had a certain aversion and repulsion towards the Divine Attribute. Furthermore, as the person who had actually cast the Fate Denying Seal, under normal circumstances, as soon as the Seal was broken, the others might still be alright, but he was supposed to definitely die. With Tian’er’s cultivation, she was still unable to save this father-in-law that she had seen for the first time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If it had been Long Shiya, his cultivation would have been more than sufficient. Alas, his Attributes were even worse off. The Healing of the Light Attribute would be like poison to one with the Darkness Attribute, tantamount to accelerating his death. As for the Water Attribute, perhaps it might be able to extend Admiral Zhou’s life for a while, but as for how long it would be tough to say. At least, Admiral Zhou would become a cripple.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As such, Zhou Weiqing definitely had to take action personally. With the Astral powers, there still remained a chance at least.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that instant that he had protected his father, Zhou Weiqing had dispersed all of his other Attributes, leaving only the purest Astral Saint Energy which slowly and carefully infused into his father’s broken down body, clearing out the negative energies from the Fate Denying Seal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Currently, Admiral Zhou was like a building crudely made from wooden blocks, tilting precariously and on the verge of breaking down at anytime. At the same time, Zhou Weiqing’s Astral Saint Energy was like a cover, tying the wooden blocks together and not allowing them to move about or change shapes, thus forcefully preventing the breakdown.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was not all; the Astral Saint Energy continually infused into Admiral Zhou’s body, this purest energy and Power of Creation helping him rebuild his body from ground up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed. It was rebuilding, not healing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Admiral Zhou had unleashed the Fate Denying Seal, his body could be said to have already begun breaking down. To be able to maintain this current state was because he was fully in the Seal. Now that the Seal had vanished, he was about to vanish from the world. The only reason Zhou Weiqing had the chance to rebuild his body was because Admiral Zhou’s soul was still there for now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Tian’er was still in the midst of releasing the Divine energies, but she could clearly sense a massive amount of atmospheric energy welling towards Zhou Weiqing, even including her own energy she was releasing. At the same time, Zhou Weiqing’s own Astral Saint Energy was being expended at an astonishing rate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was not a simple matter like ‘creating’ the Hell’s Angel in energy form when unleashing his Skills. It could be said that Zhou Weiqing was currently building an entire new body for a soul!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although it was with Admiral Zhou’s original body as a base and blueprint, but this entire creation process was fully powered by his Astral Saint Energy alone. Only by doing this would he prevent leaving any terrible side effects behind. For his father’s sake, how could Zhou Weiqing hold anything back just to conserve his power?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three thousand Peerless Regiment elites had already found and stationed themselves in proper defensive spots. With the Royal Palace as their defensive ‘fort’, they would be defending externally.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was not the only thing. As Tian’er had risen up so high in the skies, even the Heavenly Bow Empire armies in the distance could see her, let alone the Kalise Empire and Bai Da Empire troops.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Divine Faith power that could compare with the Devour Skill was beginning to come into effect. In midair, Tian’er continued to transform the power of faith into the purests Divine Attribute energies, spreading it down to continue healing the Heavenly Bow Empire officials. At the same time, she was supporting the massive energy drain of Zhou Weiqing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The three Shangguan Sisters were currently with the rest of the Peerless elites. However, the Kalise and Bai Da Empire soldiers did not seem to show any signs of wanting to attack. As such, they did not feel any pressure at present.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The order had actually been given previously by the Heavenly Emperor Meng Gui, that no matter how much activity there was in the palace grounds, the ordinary soldiers were not to intervene. In truth, those who could cause a stir in the area had to be at least Heavenly Kings or higher, and ordinary soldiers attacking would only be marching to their senseless deaths. As such, his order was not wrong at all. Of course, that just meant the warriors that Zhou Weiqing had brought along could only relax.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shangguan Xue’er nodded towards Shangguan Fei’er and said: “Give the signal.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shangguan Fei’er nodded in agreement. Lifting her right hand, a ray of light shone into the skies. As it reached the highest point, it burst into brilliant fireworks. This was the signal they had agreed upon to show that the battle to rescue the Royal Palace had succeeded. As for how the rest of the army would undergo the siege, how the military forces were deployed, that was up to the Heavenly Bow God General Ming Yu!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shangguan Xue’er looked up into the skies at Zhou Weiqing, who was fully focusing on saving his father, her expression slightly vacant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was not so long ago that his cultivation level was far below mine! Yet, now… he has already reached a degree that I can only look up to. A Heavenly King… several years younger than I am, but he has already become a Heavenly King… one which has the Saint Core Nucleus!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shangguan Bing’er had already told Shangguan Xue’er regarding the bet between Zhou Weiqing and the brothers Shangguan Tianyang and Shangguan Tianyue.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Shangguan Xue’er learned about how Zhou Weiqing had to face such pressure for a sake, actually winning such a fight, finally even succeeding in removing that burden of responsibility that had always weighed upon her shoulders… she couldn’t help but stare blankly for several hours, stunned.&nbsp;</span></p>

Her emotions were in turmoil, and she did not know how to face him. Perhaps, there was some self blame. For the sake of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, she had once thought of giving up this love between them! Amongst the three Shangguan Sisters, her time together with Zhou Weiqing was the shortest, but that did not mean her feelings for him were any less than her two sisters.&nbsp;</span></p>

Now that Zhou Weiqing had left a trace on it, then, on that white paper, there was no longer any other space.</span></p>

However, what had she done in the past? She had only been running all the time, accepting the fate that her father and uncle had given her. For the sake of that responsibility, she had thought of leaving him several times… but he had never given up on her.&nbsp;</span></p>

Perhaps only when she had thought through everything and straightened herself out would she be able to walk out from that guilt.&nbsp;</span></p>

Now, she wanted to place all of her heart and mind on her man. Wherever he went, she would follow.&nbsp;</span></p>

All of the military officers, even all the soldiers, burst out in deafening cheers. Even if they alerted the defending Kalise Army soldiers, they did not care at this point.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">An hour ago, Ming Yu had given the order that the rescue operation was under way. At the same time, he had informed all of the military officers that once the fireworks signal was shown, it meant the rescue was a success. The officers had naturally passed down the information as well.&nbsp;</span></p>

They did not directly launch their attacks, instead spreading their formations as they passed through the Stars Forest, slowly advancing upon the Heavenly Bow City.</span></p>
