 <p><b>Chapter 108 Solidified Dragon Spirit and ‘Hate Ground No Handle’ Set! (1)</b></p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing did not walk up directly. He knew that not only were the God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters of high status, they themselves were extremely powerful Heavenly Jewel Masters in their own right. Angering them would not be a wise decision indeed.</p>
 <p>Due to his previous breakthrough to the fifteenth stage of Heavenly Energy, Zhou Weiqing’s clothes had all been soaked through with sweat. He was currently feeling rather uncomfortable, as he had not had the time to change as Shangguan Longyin had brought him here directly after that.</p>
 <p>Since he was already here, he was no longer in a hurry to get things done, and decided to make the most of his time here. Looking around, he quickly spotted a place which looked like a toilet, and he stepped quickly towards it.</p>
 <p>As he had guessed, there was a large jar of clean water in that small room, and our dear Zhou Little Fatty quickly stripped himself down and wiped himself clean. After which, he took out a fresh set of clothing from his Spatial Necklace and changed into them, before walking out refreshed. Stretching lazily, he did not interrupt the three God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters, who were still in the midst of their discussion, and sat down silently on the floor to cultivate while waiting.</p>
 <p>Although that previous breakthrough of his had been easier than most of his other times, but the Immortal Deity Technique was after all a cultivation technique that went against the norm, against the heavens itself, and the act of breaking through had drained his vitality and sustained some internal injuries. Furthermore, much of Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy had also been dissipated, and it was a good opportunity for him to rest and recuperate. His thinking was extremely simple; he could only learn the best from the three Masters only if he was in tip top condition.</p>
 <p>“Haha… little brat… you are very calm indeed!” A loud, clear voice rang out, startling Zhou Weiqing from his cultivation.</p>
 <p>Lifting his head, he saw that the three Masters had stopped their discussion and had turned to look at him. The more surprising thing was that Zhou Weiqing realised he recognized two of them!</p>
 <p>The first one was the old lady whom he had helped in growing the Gold Fur Nether Jade Grass in the lower level of the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion previously, named Wei Yang. Previously, she had even gifted him with a ring, which was currently on Zhou Weiqing’s finger.</p>
 <p>The one who had spoke was also one he recognized, the purple clad old man named Ye Ruichen who had fought with Wei Yang that same day. He was currently looking at Zhou Weiqing with a heated gaze.</p>
 <p>Right between the two of them was another old man, with white beard and hair. Compared to both Wei Yang and Ye Ruichen, he looked about at least twenty years older, almost as if he was one foot into his grave. However, his set of bright eyes seemed to belie that as they shone with a deep wisdom.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing bowed down deeply and he said respectfully: “This Junior Zhou Weiqing greets my three God Tier Seniors.”</p>
 <p>Wei Yang smiled faintly and said: “Little friend, we meet again. After that day, I specially went to inquire about where you were from, and only then did I find out that you were here for the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, and more so that you are the trading partner of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace this time. Three Legendary Set pieces… little fellow, your appetite sure isn’t small!”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Of course I have also given up a sufficient price in return! Otherwise, how could the Heaven’s Expanse Palace possibly agree to such a trade? Furthermore, this is also a great benefit to three Seniors right.”</p>
 <p>Wei Yang looked at him with interest and she said: “Oh? Do say, how is this of a great benefit to us?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said: “Three Seniors are all God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters, and are undoubtedly already standing at the pinnacle of the world. It is unlikely that anything much can interest either of three Seniors… Besides those rare treasured materials, only those unique Consolidating Equipment Designs passed down as long lost legacies could possibly interest the three of you. Coincidentally, this time, the three God Tier Consolidating Equipment that I have requested are all with myself providing the designs. With the Legendary Set designs in hand, it will definitely save three Seniors much time, effort and spirit. Furthermore, being able to reference other God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master’s designs, I’m sure it will be able to provide three Seniors with some inspiration.”</p>
 <p>Ye Ruichen laughed out heartily, saying: “Little fellow, you are rather smart aren’t you. Of course, if not for that, the three of us might not have agreed to help with that trade. After all, between our own experiments and creations, we do not have much spare time at all. Your name is Zhou Weiqing right? I’ll call you Weiqing then. In the entire mainland, there are only four known God Tier Consolidating Equipment Masters; besides us three, there is one more in the Heavenly Snow Mountain. I hear that you are also a Consolidating Equipment Master, then you should also know that in order to reach the God Tier stage, just training hard by yourself is not enough. You will also need sufficient materials as well as a good teacher. This old man has been immersed in this field for dozens of years, and I am well experienced in this area. If you are willing, I am willing to take you as my disciple, and let you inherit my legacy. How about that?”</p>
 <p>Although Ye Ruichen had already mentioned something like that previously when they had met in the Heavenly Jewel Consolidating Equipment Pavilion, Zhou Weiqing had not expected him to be so directly. They had just met once more, and he had already started talking about taking him as a disciple. In that moment, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but start momentarily, at a loss for words.</p>
 <p>At the side, Wei Yang was infuriated, crying out angrily: “Bullshit! Ye Ruichen, don’t you have any sense of shame at all? I was the one who discovered this child first, and you already have a disciple, and you still want to snatch with me? Do you even know anything about this child? Even if he wants to take a Master, it should be me!”</p>
 <p>Ye Ruichen remained calm as he said with a grin: “I might not trust anyone else, but how can I not trust Wei Yang Sis’ eyes? For you to take a fancy to anyone, how bad can he be eh? It’s true that I have some disciples, but they are just token disciples, not a true disciple at all, it’s totally different. I need someone to carry on my legacy!”</p>
 <p>“You too, be quiet.” The white haired old man in the middle finally spoke, the raspy low voice holding a strange magnetism, easily leaving a deep impression.</p>
 <p>The two went silent, though Wei Yang glared at Ye Ruichen, who returned it with a cheeky grin. However, his own gaze was also unrelenting.</p>
 <p>“Child, come here.” The white haired old man beckoned towards Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing walked forward almost subconsciously, as if the white haired old man had some sort of magic in his voice, and he could not go against what he said.</p>
 <p>Walking slowly forward, Zhou Weiqing stepped in front of the white haired old man, who extended a skinny hand and said: “Give me your left hand.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing extended his left hand, and the old man’s withered hand grasped his wrist firmly.</p>
 <p>To Zhou Weiqing, the strangest thing was that although the old man’s hand was scrawny and withered, when his hand grasped his own wrist, it had a strange soft and flexibility, almost as if his fists did not have bones within.</p>
 <p>A soft Heavenly Energy entered his body through his hands, giving Zhou Weiqing a lazy warm feeling as it circulated around. Instantly, Zhou Weiqing felt his spirits lifted, his previously dissipated spirit and Heavenly Energy recovering swiftly. Just this measure of cultivation level alone was startling indeed.</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, the old man’s eyes seemed to gleam as he stared into Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, making a soft sound of curiosity. “Ehh, six Attributes… You actually have six Attributes! Wind, Lightning, Spatial, Darkness, Demonic and Time. No wonder… no wonder Wei Yang will take fancy to you.”</p>
 <p>Hearing the old man’s words, Ye Ruichen at the side widened his eyes in surprised, exclaiming: “Six Attributes?! Even the Shangguan brothers only have four attributes, yet this little fellow actually has six?! More so… with the Wind, Spatial and Time Attributes, the three greatest attributes for Consolidating Equipment Masters. Wei Yang, your luck is indeed just too good, to be able to meet such an unbelievable prodigy like this.”</p>
 <p>The gleam in the white haired old man’s eyes disappeared, and he lifted his other hand to grasp at Zhou Weiqing’s other wrist. “Strength Attribute Physical Jewel… Hmmm… Ehh? What is this? This… this... … !?”</p>
 <p>Abruptly, he revealed a shock that was way beyond his previous surprise, almost to the point he forgot himself and lost his composure.</p>
 <p>Both Wei Yang and Ye Ruichen was equally shocked. In their memories, they could not recall anything that could cause this white haired old man to be so shocked.</p>
 <p>“... Dragon Spirit… Solidified Dragon Spirit! It’s actually a Solidified Dragon Spirit! That’s just too inconceivable! How is this possible!?” The white haired old man muttered to himself, though Zhou Weiqing could not understand what he was saying.</p>
 <p>Curious, Zhou Weiqing asked: “Senior, what is a Solidified Dragon Spirit?”</p>
 <p>The white haired old man’s gaze grew fierce, and he clutched tightly onto Zhou Weiqing’s wrists as he said solemnly: “Where did you meet dragons? Where did your Solidified Dragon Spirit come from?!”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing knew he had no chance of resisting, and said with a bitter smile: “Senior, I have seen a dragon in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, but about that Solidified Dragon Spirit… I don’t even have any idea what that Solidified Dragon Spirit is, how could I possibly reply you?”</p>
 <p>The white haired old man relaxed his tight grip as he furrowed his brow, saying slowly: “The Heavenly Jewel Tournament? Lustre Spatial Realm? Little friend, can you tell me the whole process about how you met the dragon once through?”</p>
 <p>Many people already knew what had happened in the Heavenly Jewel Tournament finals, and Zhou Weiqing did not think he needed to hide anything. As such, he described the entire process of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament and the times he had met the dragon. Of course, he did not mention about Little Witch and Tian’er.</p>
 <p>Hearing Zhou Weiqing’s description, the white haired old man released his hands. From the words, tone, expression and bearing, he could easily tell that Zhou Weiqing was not lying. However, if that dragon did not give him anything, where did this Solidified Dragon Spirit come from?</p>
 <p>“Senior, you still haven’t told me what exactly this Solidified Dragon Spirit is?” Zhou Weiqing asked, burning with curiosity.</p>
 <p>The white haired old man said slowly: “The Solidified Dragon Spirit is tantamount to a dragon imbuing a power strength and solidifying it onto a human. You can liken it to the imbued Skill on a Consolidated Equipment, and it can be used at any time. However, such a situation has not been seen or even heard of in hundreds and thousands of years, and I have only read of it in some very ancient tomes.”</p>
 <p>“According to the records on the old tomes, there are only two types of people who can gain this Solidified Dragon Spirit. The first is someone who has submitted and sworn allegiance to dragonkind, while the other is someone who has done a great kindness to the dragon race. According to the situation you described, I guess you should be the latter. That dragon must have unleashed the Solidified Dragon Spirit upon you without you knowing it.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing said uncertainly: “Where is this Solidified Dragon Spirit? How did Senior manage to sense it?”</p>
 <p>The white haired old man said: “The Solidified Dragon Spirit is within your Physical Jewel. That dragon is a Heavenly God Stage powerhouse, and its cultivation level is beyond me. If not for the fact that I used my Heavenly Energy to examine your Physical Jewel closely earlier, I would not have been able to discover it.”</p>
