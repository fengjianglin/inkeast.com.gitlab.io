 <p><b>Chapter 225 Breakthrough! Saint Energy entering Death Acupuncture Point! (2)</b></p>
 <p>This time, having infused and fully merged a hundred drops of Saint Energy into his Immortal Deity Technique and Death Acupuncture Points, would he be that far from his next breakthrough? However, that also meant that his requirement of Saint Energy was going to be far greater.</p>
 <p>This entire experience also sparked a thought in Zhou Weiqing. As their cultivation level grew they drew more Saint Energy, his Heavenly Energy would also begin to take on more characteristics of the Saint Energy, as more and more of it was joined fully with him. Perhaps this might not actually increase his overall cultivation level, but with the same amount of Heavenly Energy, if it was mixed with some Saint Energy, or at least some characteristics, it would mean the power of any Skills used would increase dramatically.</p>
 <p>At last, Zhou Weiqing finished his cultivation. Slowly opening his eyes, he saw Tian’er looking at him with a concerned look.</p>
 <p>“How is it?” Tian’er asked.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing beamed as he said: “Success, beyond even my imagination! This Saint Energy is truly beneficial indeed, I love it so much! With it, my Immortal Deity Technique can now be cultivated without much danger. I have broken through the twenty sixth stage. Just one more stage, and I will have completed the third portion of my Immortal Deity Technique. Although at that point that will not reach the seventh Jewel yet, my overall power should still have quite some growth.”</p>
 <p>As such, Zhou Weiqing began to describe the entire process of how he broke through and all the sensations and inspirations he had to Tian’er, not hiding anything from her. Although Tian’er was not cultivating the same Immortal Deity Technique, Zhou Weiqing believed that when she broke through, she would meet with something similar in nature. This was the benefit of the Saint Energy after all.</p>
 <p>Tian’er paid full attention to Zhou Weiqing’s descriptions earnestly. This was yet another benefit for them cultivating together, especially since they shared the same source of the Saint Energy whirlpool, and they could exchange their thoughts and inspirations at any time. In this way, their understanding of the Saint Energy could grow at a much swifter rate.</p>
 <p>For the next few days before the Heavenly Jewel Tournament Finals would begin, Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er shut themselves in the room, cultivating all the time. Perhaps before this, they might not be just as hardworking, but the miraculous draw and feeling of the Saint Energy was just too attractive, so much so that they became twice as industrious as before.</p>
 <p>Two days later, Tian’er’s Heavenly Energy had also successfully broken through to the twenty ninth stage. Just like what Zhou Weiqing had expected, when her Heavenly Energy broke through, a hundred drops of Saint Energy also infused and merged into her Heavenly Energy. However, for Tian’er, the effect of the Saint Energy improving and evolving her body was even more obvious than for Zhou Weiqing. Although both of their cultivation levels only raised a single stage, their overall powers had an obvious and large growth.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>Heavenly Jewel Island.</p>
 <p>Early in the morning, the Heavenly Jewel Island Personnel who were in charge of receiving the guests were already fully prepared. This time, there were actually two dark horse teams in the top four teams. Besides the Heavenly Bow Battle Team, there was also the Hariott Battle Team from the Hariott Empire.</p>
 <p>The Hariott Empire was actually an Empire only slightly bigger than the Heavenly Bow Empire. However, for their team to be able to enter the finals as one of the top four, it was a totally different notion from the Heavenly Bow Battle Team. For them, it was truly due to some unbelievable good luck.</p>
 <p>All the way, they did not even meet any truly strong teams. Of course, at the same time, the Hariott Battle Team was also far stronger than it had ever been before, and the combination of power, skill and lots of luck had somehow brought them into the top four… definitely becoming the luckiest team in the entire tournament. Of the traditional four Great Saint Land Battle Teams, this time only the ZhongTian and WanShou Battle Teams had actually entered the finals, a result that had truly come as a surprise to most. Of course, the reason why this had happened was totally due to the Heavenly Bow Battle Team.</p>
 <p>In their entire procession up the Heavenly Jewel Island, Ma Qun’s mouth never remained idle. Indeed, as a youth who was experiencing such majestic sights for the first time, how could he not be astonished and amazed. In comparison, Yun Li was much better off, but the shock in his eyes could not be hidden. Of course, compared to the others, for Yun Li to ascend to the Heavenly Jewel Island, there was another purpose besides the Heavenly Jewel Tournament. Naturally, that was to pay a formal visit to Little Miss Muddle’s Master, the most famous God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master in the Consolidating Equipment Master world, Xing Tianyi. Only if he could gain this Master’s approval could he truly be together with Little Miss Muddle.</p>
 <p>The Heavenly Jewel Island was unchanged. Towards this area, Zhou Weiqing was almost familiar with it already. Led by their guide, they were soon brought coincidentally to the same location where the previous Fei Li Battle Team had stayed. Perhaps, this was also purposefully arranged by the Heavenly Jewel Island.</p>
 <p>As soon as they ascended the Heavenly Jewel Island, Zhou Weiqing no longer had any thoughts of cultivating. By his side, Tian’er could clearly sense his urgent feelings, clearly focused on a single name: Shangguan Bing’er.</p>
 <p>Three years. Three years without meeting, and they would finally meet, how could Zhou Weiqing not be anxious?</p>
 <p>After they had settled down, Zhou Weiqing quickly brought the team to the Heavenly Jewel Island Consolidating Equipment Pavilion. Clearly, this was the place that the entire team was most interested in.</p>
 <p>“Go on in and have a look, as long as there are sufficient funds, you can just buy whatever you all need. Yun Li, the place you want to go is at the top level. You know how to get up there?” Zhou Weiqing turned his gaze towards Yun Li.</p>
 <p>Yun Li nodded. This time, he had clearly made ample preparation. Little Miss Muddle had described everything to him so many times, and currently in his hands he had a plaque from her.</p>
 <p>Looking at Yun Li who was clearly very nervous, Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said: “Don’t worry, there is nothing to be afraid of. The three Senior God Consolidating Equipment Masters are all very nice. Your talents are no lower than anyone, and your feelings are there. You can definitely succeed, I believe in you. We will cheer for you!”</p>
 <p>Yun Li nodded. Of course, it was impossible for him not to be nervous at all, but this was something he had to go through. After waving to the rest, he stepped forward resolutely, heading towards the top of the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion.</p>
 <p>“You go too.” As they watched Yun Li leave, Tian’er said softly to Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing turned to look at her, an ashamed look on his face. However, he did not try to hide his thoughts. “Tian’er, I…”</p>
 <p>Tian’er giggled and said: “What! As if I do not already know about your playboy ways? Go then, you haven’t seen Bing’er for so long, how can I possibly stop you? Even if I stop you once, can I stop you forever? Since it is impossible, why not just let you go directly, lest everyone ends up uncomfortable. Go on, just remember to return.”</p>
 <p>Seeing the sincere smile on Tian’er’s beautiful face, Zhou Weiqing took a step forward and gave her a big hug. In front of everyone, he kissed her on her soft red lips before turning around.</p>
 <p>Seeing his leaving figure, still feeling the lingering warmth on her lips, the smile on Tian’er’s face did not disappear, growing richer instead. If she were to say she wasn’t jealous, that would be impossible, as Tian’er was extremely clear about the place Shangguan Bing’er held in Zhou Weiqing’s heart. However, so what if she was jealous? There was nothing she could do to stop it. However, Tian’er also had her own thoughts, just like he loved Shangguan Bing’er so much, didn’t that mean he couldn’t leave her as well? Although sometimes Tian’er might seem casual and careless outwardly, she was actually very sensitive inside. She could sense that Zhou Weiqing’s feelings for her were not much lesser than Shangguan Bing’er, and that was enough.</p>
 <p>…</p>
 <p>As he walked out of the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion, Zhou Weiqing drew a deep breath, a light in his eyes. Currently, he did not know how to describe his feelings. If he did not get to see Bing’er anytime soon, he felt he would go crazy.</p>
 <p><i>Bing’er, Bing’er, where are you!</i></p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing walked out of the Consolidating Equipment Pavilion, heading directly for the Heaven’s Expanse Palace at top speed. Without question, Bing’er should be there, and if they did not allow him to enter, he would yell outside like the previous time. He did not believe that Bing’er would not be able to hear him.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, he had reached the front of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace. However, before he could enter, he was once again stopped by the guards.</p>
 <p>“Halt.”</p>
 <p>“I am here to see Shangguan Bing’er.” Zhou Weiqing forcefully suppressed the urgency in his heart, but his expression was not good.</p>
 <p>Right at that moment, a low voice rang out. “Do you think you can see her just because you say you want to? Zhou Weiqing, defeat me first before we talk about that.” Zhan LingTian’s tall figure stepped out stealthily from Heaven’s Expanse Palace.</p>
 <p>Compared to the previous time they had met, Zhan LingTian’s expression was even uglier, as icy cold as the first time Zhou Weiqing had seen Shangguan Xue’er.</p>
 <p>“Bro Zhan, do not make things difficult for me. I am really not in a good mood now. I want to see Bing’er.” If it were the normal Zhou Weiqing, he would definitely not speak in such a stiff manner. However, he was just yearning for Bing’er too much, to be unable to see his beloved despite being so close to her. Three years! His feelings and emotions were rather unstable right now.</p>
 <p>Dark gold light flashed all about Zhan LingTian, and his Light-Dark Divine Spear appeared in his grasp. A strong enmity flashed in his eyes as he said: “I don’t care what mood you are in now, as if I am in a good mood? Who do you think you are, you already have Lady Bing’er’s heart, and its not enough for you? You actually still dare to provoke Fei’er and Xue’er? You should know my feelings for Xue’er, and I have waited so long for this opportunity. If you want to see Bing’er, you better defeat me first.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at Zhan LingTian, his aura suddenly surging out irritably. In his eyes, a faint red flashed, as his entire aura burst forth, in a brutal and overbearing fashion, causing all the nearby gods to pale in shock, stepping back subconsciously. Even Zhan LingTian was startled by the sudden fighting spirit that burst out of Zhou Weiqing, and his face changed.</p>
 <p>They had not met for a few years, and the current Zhou Weiqing was no longer the Zhou Weiqing of the past. These few years, Zhan LingTian had been training hard, and his cultivation level had improved. However, it was without a doubt that Zhou Weiqing’s improvement was far greater.</p>
 <p>“In that case, Bro Zhan, don’t blame me for being too hard on you too.” Let alone Zhan LingTian, if there was a Heavenly King Stage powerhouse in front of him, Zhou Weiqing would not hesitate to take action. In his heart, there was a fire burning. Zhan LingTian’s blocking was causing that fire to erupt.</p>
 <p>Thick dark gold light sprang out one after the other around Zhou Weiqing, and the Dual Legendary Hammers appeared in his hands instantly. As the ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set appeared around him, in a flash he charged towards Zhan LingTian without any flourishes. He wanted to end it as quickly as possibly, and he even released the Dragon-Tiger Transformation. The only difference was that the usually purple eyes were now bloodshot.</p>
