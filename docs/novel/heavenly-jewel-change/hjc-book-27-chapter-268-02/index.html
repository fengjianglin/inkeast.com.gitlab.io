The state of her body was clearly not in good condition, the meridian channels within her body entangled, and it was obvious she had just recovered from severe injuries.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing carefully infused Saint Energy into her body, helping her body regulate itself properly. Just as Zhou Weiqing was about to console her properly, his eyes abruptly changed and his gaze snapped outwards suddenly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A red glow shot in with lightning speed, as if a meteor slamming into the moon. Zhou Weiqing’s gaze turned cold, and the red light seemed to slam into a barrier, slowing down abruptly before coming to a stop in front of Zhou Weiqing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a letter, the entire piece of paper a fiery red. Right in the center of the of it was a ball of black flames, giving off a demonic and overpowering aura.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he was still embracing Little Witch, Zhou Weiqing did not rush off to chase after the person who had shot in the letter. However, his expression darkened considerably.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Witch quickly sensed something was wrong, and when she lifted her head, she noticed the letter. She instantly cried out in shock: “Blood Red Hell!”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing waved his hand, and the letter flew into his palm. The red paper with the black flame was indeed the symbol of the Blood Red Hell.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Opening the letter, he saw that it only contained a single sentence: Noon tomorrow, a final decisive battle outside the Heavenly Bow City. Otherwise, we will slaughter all in the city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A simple line, filled with an overpowering threat and pressure. The words were unrestrained and arrogant, and to make Zhou Weiqing feel this way, it definitely had to be written by a powerful Heavenly Jewel Master indeed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The light in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes turned ferocious. “They have come quickly indeed!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Little Witch let go of Zhou Weiqing, worry clear in her eyes as she said: “Weiqing, we have caused trouble to you. I never thought that the Blood Red Hell would come so quickly. What should we do now? We are no match for them. They are indeed ruthless, truly planning on exterminating us!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing embraced her once more as he said: “Do not worry, I will settle it. Who says that we are no match for them? This is the Heavenly Bow Empire, not the Bai Da Empire. Relax, I will handle the situation.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">How could Little Witch not be anxious? The impression that the Blood Red Hell left upon her was just too deep. She muttered: “Weiqing, you don’t know the extent of their power… they have many top powerhouses in the Blood Red Hell. That day, when they surrounded and attacked our Heavenly Demon Sect, there were three Heavenly Emperor powerhouses! Otherwise, we would not have lost so terribly. Since they have dared to come here, they must have full preparation. We… we…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing smiled passively as he said: “Of course I know they have come prepared. They are planning to end things here once and for all; they are not just here to finish off the rest of your Heavenly Demon Sect, they are also planning to crush the core of our Heavenly Bow Empire. With that accomplished, there will no longer be anyone left in the west that can restrain them. Their plans are lofty and high reaching indeed, but their calculations might not be too accurate. Can they really win?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing had long since guessed that once the war had reached a certain stage, the Blood Red Hell would make an appearance. Of course, he had not expected that they would actually reveal themselves so quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The arrival of the Blood Red Hell powerhouses also revealed a piece of news to him. That was the Dan Dun Empire was truly planning on moving against the ZhongTian Empire. Otherwise, they would not be in such a rush to finish off the Heavenly Bow Empire.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, these Blood Red Hell powerhouses had still chosen to uphold the honour and dignity as powerhouses, and they did not take action directly against the Heavenly Bow Empire armies, otherwise the consequences would be disastrous.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In that case, since they had already come, it was not a bad thing after all. The Blood Red Hell would not be able to focus all of the power here. That also meant that while it was a chance for the Blood Red Hell to exterminate their side, wasn’t it also a great opportunity for them to greatly weaken the power of the Blood Red Hell?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing naturally had his own thoughts and opinions. Previously, in the battle for the Heavenly Bow City Royal Palace, he had not allowed any of the six Blood Red Hell powerhouses to escape. The main reason for that was because he did not want the Blood Red Hell to have a proper understanding of the true power on their side. Even if they knew he had reached the Heavenly King stage, so what? The power range of a Heavenly King was just too huge, and it was unlikely that they could even imagine that he had already reached a stage where he was able to fight against a Heavenly Emperor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking up to this point, Zhou Weiqing turned to Little Witch and said: “Yuehan, hurry up, lead me to chase after father-in-law. We will need to plan properly. Since the Blood Red Hell powerhouses have come, there is no need for them to leave this place forever.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Wu Yuehan saw the confidence in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes, and her own emotions were soon influenced by him. She realised that this fellow who had been inferior to her previously had now come into his, growing into a true powerhouse that had his place in the world. The warm and gentle Saint Energy that Zhou Weiqing infused into her body had also helped her heart calm down. Nodding, she pulled on his hand as they walked out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, whether or not the Heavenly Demon Sect changed its name or not was not the important issue. They had to first deal with the threat of the Blood Red Hell first. Once the situation was resolved, if the Heavenly Demon Sect still survived, then everything was possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Zhou Weiqing held great anticipation for this upcoming battle. The chances for both sides were equal. If the Blood Red Hell emerged victorious, then the pieces would all fall into place for them, and they would not leave any of them alive. At the same time, if Zhou Weiqing’s side were to emerge victorious, he would be able to display his own power to the Heavenly Demon Sect powerhouses. Under such a circumstance, it would be easier for him to establish his own Great Saint Land and incorporate the Heavenly Demon Sect under him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A day passed just like that in the blink of an eye. When the sun rose to the center of the skies, the time for the agreement had arrived.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The weather was exceptionally fine today, the blue skies clear and cloudless. The bright sun shone upon the Star Forest, and though it had been ruined, it seemed to breathe fresh life into the forest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, in the midsts of the forests, there was a disharmonious colour.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">More than twenty people stood there, each of them dressed in a similar fiery red outfit. In the green of the forest, it was just too great a contrast.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These people were not young at all, on the surface even the youngest looked to be around forty years or more. Amongst them, there were four old men who were standing at the front, looking to be in their eighties. However, their age had not dulled their edge, and their eyes were filled with strong killing intent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The others stood behind them, giving prominence to the four old men’s status.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It is already noon. They actually dare not to come?” One of the four old men said coldly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">These four old men were the four Grand Elders of the Blood Red Hell. They usually lived deep in the Blood Red Hell for many years, and had not appeared in the mainland for a long time. However, their rank and status in the Blood Red Hell was extremely high, and even the current Blood Red Hell Lord was a generation younger than them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without question, these four were all at the Heavenly Emperor cultivation state, the mainstay pillar of strengths in the Blood Red Hell. Just a few months ago, two of them had actually been the ones who led the attack on the Heavenly Demon Sect.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The one who had just spoken was the Third Grand Elder. Amongst the four, his temperament was the most volatile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The First Grand Elder said passively: “If they dare to not show up, then they better be prepared to accept the consequences of our fury.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Fourth Grand Elder said: “Big brother, are we really going to slaughter the entire city? If we do so, we will definitely stir up discontent from both the Heaven’s Expanse Palace and the Heavenly Snow Mountain. It is not yet time for us to reveal all our cards.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The First Elder remained calm and unflurried as he said casually: “Do we have to be afraid of revealing our hand? Do you think that if we don’t take action, the Heaven’s Expanse Palace will not take action against us? As soon as we resolve the issues in the west, we can focus our attentions on the Heaven’s Expanse Palace.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Second Grand Elder gave a cold humph as he said: “That worthless trash Meng Gui, if not for him, would we need to make a trip all the way down here. Who knows if that trash ran off or was killed. Such outsiders like him are just too unreliable.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The First Grand Elder glanced at him and said: “Enough. Just do what we’re supposed to do. Do not underestimate the Heavenly Bow Empire. Meng Gui’s cultivation was not weak, and even with the support of the six Heavenly Kings, he was still defeated here in this Heavenly Bow City. They must have some secret hidden powers lying within the Heavenly Bow Empire.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Third Grand Elder said disdainfully: “It doesn’t matter what hidden powers they have. Since us four brothers have come, let alone a mere Heavenly Bow City, if we really wanted we could easily destroy the Fei Li Empire. I believe that the previous defeat of Meng Gui has to do with the Heavenly Demon Sect. Just the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor alone would not have been able to deal with so many at once.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At this point, the First Grand Elder said: “They are here.” As he spoke, his long fiery red brow raised up. Without any other instructions from him, the over twenty Blood Red Hell powerhouses behind them spread out, releasing their powerful auras without holding back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">One after the other, figures appeared in the sight of the Blood Red Hell powerhouses. There were three figures right at the front, but to the surprise of the Blood Red Hell powerhouses, amongst the three, the one in the center position was not the Demonic Emperor Wu Yunyue nor the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya, but a young man.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This young man looked to be only around twenty years old, dressed in black. On the surface, he looked just like an ordinary young man who had just become a Heavenly Jewel Master, and the Blood Red Hell powerhouses did not sense any threat from him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Six others followed behind them, all dressed in grey. These six were the last powerhouses of the Heavenly Demon Sect, six Heavenly Kings. In total, there were only nine of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On the side of the Blood Red Hell, besides the four Heavenly Emperors, the rest were not all Heavenly Kings. Eight of them were Heavenly Kings, the rest were nine-Jeweled and eight-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After all, even if the Blood Red Hell had been preparing for a long time, it was not that easy to groom a Heavenly King powerhouse. The threshold of Heavenly King and the Heavenly Core Nucleus was just too difficult to pass.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was not that the Heavenly Demon Sect didn’t have any eight or nine-Jeweled Heavenly Jewel Masters left. However, none of them had appeared this time, and only these nine had come.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The four Grand Elders of the Blood Red Hell had very ugly expressions currently. Since only these nine had come, did that mean they were underestimating them? Or had the subordinates of the Heavenly Demon Sect already fled?</span></p>
