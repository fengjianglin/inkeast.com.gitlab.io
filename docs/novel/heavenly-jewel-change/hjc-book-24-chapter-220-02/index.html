 <p><b>Chapter 220 Creation! Silver Emperor! (2)</b></p>
 <p>In his eyes, the only person in the entire Heavenly Bow Battle Team that could enter his eyes and let him pay attention to was just Zhou Weiqing, and he totally ignored the others. They had already lost the first round, and the Dan Dun Battle Team could not afford to lose another round. His pride would not allow the Dan Dun Battle Team to be behind by two to zero, not even for strategy’s sake. Furthermore, Zhou Weiqing had already fought, and in his eyes, it was a certain victory for his little brother TianMa in any one versus one situation.</p>
 <p>As for the two versus two fight, naturally that was even more of an assured victory to him, since he would be participating personally. Although Zhou Weiqing had given him some surprises when he had fought in the first match, to TianFeng the overall result could only be a 3 to 1 victory for the Dan Dun Battle Team.</p>
 <p>As soon as TianMa ascended the stage, with a swooshing sound, a pair of wings spread behind his back. His wings looked very different from Zhou Weiqing’s, smaller and thinner, more like a pair of bat wings. The tips of his wings were sharp, looking to be lined by something like bone spikes, causing the entire edge of the wing to be extremely sharp.</p>
 <p>Looking coldly at Zhou Weiqing who was preparing to walk off the stage, TianMa said coldly: “If not for the rules of the Tournament not allowing you to fight again, I would kill you this match.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at him with a warm smile, but his mouth was just as evil as ever. “I’m so afraid! Come and bite me then? Oh, no, that’s not right, someone like you should have too many diseases. Later I’ll send you a little tortoise and you can slowly play with it and bite on it.”</p>
 <p>“Bastard!” TianMa was enraged, and in a flash he pounced towards Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>However, the only thing that met him was a thick layer of Heavenly Energy blocking him. Shangguan Longyin stood in the distance, his face stern as he said: “No breaking of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament rules. Heavenly Bow Battle Team, send your second fighter to the stage.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, Senior Shangguan.” Zhou Weiqing replied honestly, but as he did so he still pointed a middle finger towards TianMa before jumping off the stage lightly.</p>
 <p>The brothers TianFeng and TianMa were the representative of the younger generation in the Blood Red Hell, just like how Shangguan Xue’er and Zhan LingTian were for the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, or how Tian’er and Gu Yingbing were for the Heavenly Snow Mountain. Naturally, they had a similar status as well. From young, they had been cultivating hard, but that also meant they did not have much worldly experience… how could they have met such a situation and face such low brow mockery? Instantly, TianMa was further enraged, but unfortunately for him, Shangguan Longyin was there blocking him, and he couldn’t lash out no matter how much he wanted to.</p>
 <p>Returning to their Rest House, Zhou Weiqing gave a signal to Ma Qun, who gave a wicked grin. This time, he did not wear his Heavy Armour, just leaping up onto the stage immediately.</p>
 <p>Seated at the side, Yun Li muttered out loud: “I have decided, no matter what I will not offend you in the future. You are just too evil.”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing looked at him innocently: “You can’t blame me for that, who asked the Dan Dun Empire to act so overbearing in the south. More importantly, having such connections with the Bai Da Empire? Against enemies, we can never be merciful, sweeping them away with all our might, like the autumn wind sweeps away the withered leaves.”</p>
 <p>...</p>
 <p>Ma Qun’s massive body appeared on the stage once more. For the entire Heavenly Bow Battle Team, if one were to think about who had the most appearances on the stage, it would be him and Xixi, who had fought almost every single round.</p>
 <p>Seeing Ma Qun ascend the stage, Shangguan Longyin couldn’t help but furrow his brow. Having placed much importance and attention to the Heavenly Bow Battle Team, he naturally knew the power of this huge youth in front of him. Although he had managed to sneakily kill the Bai Da Battle Team Leader, that did not mean he had the equivalent power. Perhaps this youth had much potential within him, but at his current state, he could not compare to TianMa at all.</p>
 <p>After releasing his wings, TianMa also revealed his Heavenly Jewels. Seven sets. Low Level Zong Stage Heavenly Jewel Masters. Furthermore, with Shangguan Longyin’s senses, he could naturally tell that this TianMa was already at the later stages of the seven-Jeweled stage, not too far from reaching the eight-Jeweled stage. One could imagine his power. Furthermore, his Physical Jewel was the Agility Type, while his Elemental Jewel was Alexandrite. That meant, he had at least two Attributes to work with. That was not even counting the possibility of the Destruction Attribute. With such an overall power, how could Ma Qun and his four Jeweled cultivation level face up against him?</p>
 <p>However, rules were rules. Since the Heavenly Bow Battle Team had already sent Ma Qun to fight, Shangguan Longyin could not intervene in a personal fashion to force them to change their fighter. In a solemn tone, he said: “Both sides, introduce yourselves.”</p>
 <p>Ma Qun grinned and said casually: “Heavenly Bow Battle Team, Ma Qun.”</p>
 <p>TianMa’s cold eyes were filled with the light of bloodlust as he snarled: “Dan Dun Battle Team, TianMa.”</p>
 <p>Just as Shangguan Longyin was about to proclaim the start of the fight, Ma Qun suddenly lifted a hand in a ‘stop’ gesture. “Senior Shangguan, please hold on a moment. I have something important to say.”</p>
 <p>Shangguan Longyin asked: “Does it have something to do with the tournament?”</p>
 <p>Ma Qun laughed heartily and said: “Of course, it definitely has a strong link.”</p>
 <p>Only then did Shangguan Longyin nod and say: “Alright then, speak up quickly. Don’t waste time.”</p>
 <p>Ma Qun bowed respectfully towards Shangguan Longyin and thanked him, before he turned his gaze to TianMa. He then proceeded in an action that both Shangguan Longyin and TianMa did not understand - his hands to his hips, taking a deep breath.</p>
 <p>In the next moment, Ma Qun’s voice boomed out from the stage like a machine gun firing, the volume of his voice was so much that the surrounding battle team members in their rest houses could all hear it.</p>
 <p>“Your name is TianMa right? Why aren’t you called ZhongMa [1. Stud Horse] instead? Look at you, as tall and beautiful as a jade tree, so handsome and suave, such a playboy style, everyone would fall for you upon looking at you, even the flowers would bloom as you walked past… I’m sure you are the top quality amongst all trash, beasts amongst the beasts. Furthermore, according to my keen observations, you must have been lacking calcium since a young age, growing up to look like you lack love, even your grandmother doesn’t love you, your uncles do not love you. Your left face is asking to be slapped, your right face asking to be brutally stepped upon. Even a donkey would feel like kicking you, a pig would feel like stomping on you. You are born to be like a cucumber, to be beaten! Yet, you have grown up to be like a walnut, to be ground to dust! Look, look, look, your little face is so skinny, like a pig! If we threw you into a toilet bowl now, even the toilet bowl would vomit. If we threw you into a Spatial Rend, the Spatial Rend would commit suicide and blow up! Siighhh, look and see what you have done, this Great Young Master wants to teach you to use the knife, but you just insist on learning the sword, but you don’t learn the sword properly, instead always using the ‘down sword’[2. 下贱 vs ‘下剑’ homonym pun. The former is being ‘low’ or degrading, while the other is literally ‘down’ and ‘sword’]. There are so many styles of your ‘down sword’, yet you insist on learning the ‘Drunken Sword’ [3. homonym - slang to acting lewdly while drunk], instead of the ‘Gold Sword’, you learn the ‘Silver Sword’ [4. homonym - being a slut]! I think you can just learn the ‘Drunken Silver Sword’[5. I don’t think there’s an exact meaning, he just combined the two lol]! You could have been a sword saint, or a sword immortal, alas you cried and insisted on being a ‘sword man’ [6. ‘Little bitch’]! Really… there is no need for you to do so. Even though your looks are like that, you should live on with courage! Even so, you do not need to use your buttocks to cover your face! I wanted to see you speaking, but why did you bury your face in your buttocks? Oh? I am so sorry, I did not know that is your actual face, then where are your buttocks? Why are your buttocks so red? Are you a monkey? Sigh… in truth, living is a waste of air for you, but if you die you are also wasting earth to bury you, staying at home you are wasting gold for your family, how how how? You might as well urinate into a pool and drown yourself in it?”</p>
 <p>After saying that entire long sentence, Ma Qun took an abrupt deep breath. He had rattled it all off without even taking a breath, and his entire face was now red from lack of oxygen, but he still stuck his chest out in a righteous look, as if he was a great hero who was speaking the truth of the world, sacrificing himself to save the citizens from a great evil.</p>
 <p>After finishing all of that, he looked towards TianMa and Shangguan Longyin, who were both staring at him, stunned silly. Bowing towards Shangguan Longyin, he said: “I surrender.” After which, he turned around in a suave fashion, walking off the stage.</p>
 <p>In Ma Qun’s rapid fire speech earlier, his words had been spewed out at an unbelievable speech. Since when had TianMa seen anyone speak like that before? By the time he came to his senses, his entire mind was filled with the mass of chaotic nonsense that Ma Qun had rattled off.</p>
 <p>What was a state attained… scolding without any curse words, this was a true attainment of state. In this entire rapid fire speech of Ma Qun’s, he rambled on about so many different things in scolding TianMa, but he had not uttered a single curse word</p>
 <p>“Bas… Bastard!” TianMa did not know how to scold others, truly. From young, he had grown up in the Great Saint Lands, and in there, who would dare to scold others? Let alone in front of him? By the time he recovered his senses, he was in such a rage that he felt like his lungs were about to burst.</p>
 <p>A thick gold-red flames with an astonishingly brilliant hue of purple smashed crazily towards Ma Qun.</p>
 <p>*Puuu*</p>
 <p>The thick Heavenly Energy shield appeared once more, forcefully blocking TianMa’s attack. No matter how powerful TianMa’s Destruction Attribute was, the gap between Zong Stage and Heavenly King Stage was just too immense, not something they could cross so easily.</p>
 <p>In truth, when Shangguan Longyin blocked this attack, his eyes were twitching uncontrollably. Even he had the urge to smash Ma Qun with a single palm himself, let alone the target of the scolding, Ma Qun. Disgusting, that was just too disgusting. That big fellow had clearly just come up here to tease TianMa, scolding him before instantly surrendering. No wonder… no wonder Zhou Weiqing would send a mere four-Jeweled little fellow against TianMa! Zhou Weiqing ahhh Zhou Weiqing, you are truly shameless to the utmost degree!</p>
 <p>Another *Puuu* sounds, and TianMa vomited out a mouth of fresh blood. His eyes were bloodshot as his entire body shuddered violently. He pointed towards the Heavenly Bow Battle Team Rest House, but he could not speak a single word.</p>
 <p>That mouthful of blood was not because of the backlash from Shangguan Longyin’s blocking of his attack. As the head judge of the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, Shangguan Longyin would never do such a thing. It was clearly because he had been just too angered by Ma Qun and Zhou Weiqing!</p>
 <p>Back in the Heavenly Bow Battle Team rest house, Crow was staring at Zhou Weiqing with her jaw agape. “Boss, this… this… you taught Ma Qun that?”</p>
 <p>Zhou Weiqing stood with arms crossed, calm and at ease, as if he was a lofty presence in the wind. “This is called strategy. Sigh, I also did not wish for this to happen. Who asked him to be the second to fight? In truth, I was just doing an experiment, I needed to test if the old saying ‘Angered to death’ can really be true? Alas, the facts have proved themselves, we have failed. Look, that fellow didn’t die right?”</p>
 <p>Tian’er and Xixi were clutching their stomachs, laughing helplessly at the side. On the other hand, Yun Li was covering his face, as if ashamed to be seen together with Zhou Weiqing.</p>
 <p>*PENG* Ma Qun had jumped down from the stage, an excited look on his face. “Ahhhh, that felt good, so good! Boss, you are truly a genius! I will definitely memorise those words so I can use them in the future! Ahhh! No, I forgot!”</p>
