 <p><b>Chapter 135 Peerless Training! (3)</b></p>
 <p>As Zhou Weiqing listened to her, he furrowed his brow several times. According to what she said, the difficulty was just too great. In the first place, entering the WanShou Empire was already especially dangerous, and if they had to face a Heavenly King Stage Heavenly Beast, the chance of returning was pretty much zero. Furthermore, there was no guarantee they could even find those particular Heavenly Beasts even if they tried. Yet, if his plan would be to put to the fullest use, it would be best to pull this off as soon as possible.</p>
 <p>Shangguan Fei’er continued: “It’s not totally impossible… but it would depend a lot on luck. If our luck is good, for example like how we met Little Red Dot previously, a Heavenly Beast that isn’t fully grown, then both of us together should be able to barely deal with the such. If we have few others to aid us, our chance of success would be higher. Still, no matter what, it will be a very dangerous attempt.”</p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing thought for a moment, then said slowly: “Perhaps it is worth a try… after all, we still have Little Red Dot. Its power is no weaker than yours, and more importantly, its speed is almost incomparable, and the key would be it scouting out danger for us. I’m actually more worried about the other dangers we face after entering the WanShou Empire. After all, the WanShou Empire is an enemy to our human Empires, we might not be able to get far into the borders…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shangguan Fei’er giggled and said: “You little fool, I see you have not tried to inquire clearly about the WanShou Empire at all. Who told you that humans would definitely be in danger in the WanShou Empire?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing started in surprise. “Isn’t that so?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shangguan Fei’er said: “Of course not. In fact, you have it in reverse, it is the WanShou Empire tribesmen who are in danger when they enter our human Empires. Do not forget that it is always them who are invading us, trying to rob us. Yet, towards human traders and merchants, they are extremely welcoming. Of course, the premise would be that you are able to cross the borders and actually enter the WanShou Empire. Ordinarily, as long as you show your merchant status and enter via proper routes, and register for a trading plaque with the WanShou Empire, then we will be safe in there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing stared at her, jaw agape. “That’s even possible?! So… how do we procure that trading plaque?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shangguan Fei’er giggled once more and said: “That would be even simpler. Didn’t that Legion Commander Shen Ji say that you could look for him for anything? He should be able to help you with that. As a matter of fact, although the WanShou Empire always starts the war with us every year, in truth they lose far more than us.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“After all, every time our merchants and traders enter, the profits they bring back are far beyond whatever they loot and plunder. Most of the tribes in the WanShou Empire, with the exception of a few unique tribes, are all plain and simple. As such, it is rather easy to trade with them. Towards merchants and traders, our Empire naturally taxes them… so… there are naturally some that attempt to smuggle things secretly for massive profit.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing’s gaze turned strange as he said: “Indeed, there is no real right or wrong in the world after all. It is all a matter of perspective. In a way, the invisible plunder you all indulge in is even more savage than the WanShou Empire’s!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shangguan Fei’er gave a humph and said: “It’s not just us ZhongTian Empire. Do you think the Fei Li Empire and Bao Po Empire wouldn’t do the same? Besides the severe lack of food, the WanShou Empire could be said to be an amazing treasure trove. They are filled with various rare, precious treasures, minerals and ores. In fact, more than ninety percent of the rare Heavenly Beasts live there. If not for the fact that most of them are simple in mind, and they do not know how to make full use of their resources, plus the constant suppressing from the various human Empires, perhaps the WanShou Empire would have conquered the whole world by now.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>What sort of intelligence did Zhou Weiqing have? With Shangguan Fei’er’s words, he quickly understood some of these secrets of the land. It was obvious that these so-called trades were the humans using frilly but useless things to exchange for the treasured resources of the WanShou Empire. Naturally, in the trades, they would not sell food or weapons to the WanShou Empire. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“If that is the case, it might be worth a try…” Zhou Weiqing muttered to himself. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shangguan Fei’er continued: “It will be best to wait two to three months. When the weather is warmest, and the WanShou Empire does not lack food, that is the time they have the best attitudes to humans. Furthermore, that is also the most prosperous time of that land.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing smiled faintly and said: “Indeed, it would be best to wait. Anyway, we have quite a lot of things to prepare before we set out on such a venture. Fei’er, what do you think about my power? Or perhaps more accurately, what do you think I am lacking in?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Without hesitation, Shangguan Fei’er said: “Your combat experience is decent, but your flaws are also clear. You are too reliant on your many Attribute Skills. When you are fighting, you often do not hesitate to use your Demonic Change and just throw a whole bunch of Skills to beat down your foe. However, have you thought about it. If when you fight an enemy and do not succeed in Devouring Heavenly Energy to replenish yourself, at your current cultivation level, how long do you think you can last?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me give a simple example. If you do not have such a disgusting Skill like that Dragon Silencing Seal, then against that Legion Commander Shen Ji, you would not have any chance at all. He would not give you any chance to Devour any of his Heavenly Energy, and even if he didn’t destroy you outright, he would be able to slowly wear you down just with the sheer advantage of Heavenly Energy. Even if you use the Dragon Silencing Seal, his Heavenly Energy is just too far above yours, you might not even be able to break through his plain Heavenly Energy protective shield. You have so many Skills, but are you really able to use all of them well? To most Heavenly Jewel Masters, we only have a few Skills, and each and every one of them are extremely precious, and we refine their usage over and over like a beaten metal in a forge. In this, you are still lacking much, especially the art of maximising your offensive power with the least possible usage of Energy. Conserving Heavenly Energy in battle, finding an opponent’s weak points, those are not your strong points at the moment.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing Shangguan Fei’er point out so many problems without hesitation, Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but stare in a daze, exclaiming sadly: “Do I have that many problems?!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shangguan Fei’er gave a humph and said: “Good medicine usually tastes bitter, and helpful words often grate upon the ear. All I have said is the truth. From my perspective, you have just too many problems at this moment, a lot to grow. With the power of your Skills currently, if you use them well, in theory I should not be a match for you. Yet, if you actually fight with me now, i have a seventy percent confidence of beating you, ninety percent confidence of killing you.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The chance of killing being higher than the chance of beating him was naturally due to the difference when one can fight without holding back. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing said in a dissatisfied tone: “Don’t I have any good points at all…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shangguan Fei’er giggled and said: “Well, that’s not true, your archery is not too bad. However, you still aren’t up to your masters’ standards, but with all your many powerful Skills, perhaps you are slightly stronger than them.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing lowered his head, silent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shangguan Fei’er looked at him from the side for a while before saying quietly: “Have you suffered a major blow?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing glance at her and grinned, saying: “Your husband, I, have a very thick skin, how could I be taken down just like that? I was just thinking, in the next three months, how am I going to improve on all those problems you mentioned. I need to come up with a concrete and complete cultivation and training plan. In any case, before we enter the WanShou Empire, I need to grow much stronger.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Shangguan Fei’er gave him a roll of eyes, and before she turned to go, she said: “That’s it then, I’m heading off first.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Zhou Weiqing watched her leave with a faint smile on his lips. He could tell that she truly cared for him, though she still could not pass that barrier in her heart. Zhou Weiqing did not think of himself as an indiscriminate rake, just one who had more love in his heart. Since she was not ready to accept it, then he would not press her and let her think things through on her own. However, no matter what, he would not give up on her. Ever since that day she had given up her life for him, Zhou Weiqing had resolved that he would not do so. </span></p>
 <p><span style>At this point, to Zhou Weiqing, the most important thing was still to increase his own power. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that he had completed and delegated most of the work, he could concentrate fully on cultivating and training. His own power was perhaps even more important than the Peerless Battalion. Simply put, if he was a Heavenly King Stage Heavenly Jewel Master now, he could just walk into the Heavenly Bow Empire now and free his father and godfather without any problems. In such a case, would he need to wait ten years? Need an army? Furthermore, the deterrence and threat that an absolute powerhouse brought was far beyond that of any army. If the Peerless Battalion wanted to have a name in the mainland, and they wanted to revive the Heavenly Bow Empire, they would need such an absolute powerhouse to lead them. In this case, Zhou Weiqing had no choice but to try to step up to that position. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As compared to love and relationships, training was far more important to Zhou Weiqing now. Although Shangguan Fei’er had been rather insulting to him, the words had pierced to the heart of the matter. Some of it had actually been known to Zhou Weiqing himself, but some were things that he had not been clear about. With the words of her as his guide, he was able to straighten his thoughts. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Without a doubt, she was right. He had more than enough Skills, but he was still not able to use them to their maximum potential, to wield them together as a cohesive unit. Without question, the first thing that Zhou Weiqing thought of was the Three Thousand Tempering Training method. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Combat experience, fighting skills and the ability to use Elemental Skills in such fights could be learned in actual fighting training. However, that had to be with a base of absolute understanding of that Skill. The Three Thousand Tempering Training method might be one that was tough and painful that made one want to die, but Zhou Weiqing had experienced its impressive effects as well. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He had previously used the Three Thousand Tempering Training method on a few Skills, and after that, the usage of that Skill had reached a whole different level. Now that the Peerless Battalion had stabilized, their training would undoubtedly bring the Peerless Battalion to greater strength. It was time for him to go through that once more. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As compared to the previous time he had underwent the Three Thousand Tempering Training method, he was now at the four Jeweled cultivation level. Without question, he would now be able to complete more Tempering in a shorter period of time. </span></p>
