 <p>“Have you finished investigating it?”</p> 
 <p>In a luxurious room, a person sitting facing the windows turned around slowly and looked at the young man who was standing in front of him wearing glasses.</p> 
 <p>“Boss, here is all the information on Xu Jiaojiao.” The man with the glasses then handed over a thin folder to the person sitting before the window.</p> 
 <p>If Sheng Jiaoyang were here, then with just a glance she would recognise that the man sitting on a luxurious chair was Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p>During the next fifteen minutes, the only sounds in the room were the ones of pages being flipped through.</p> 
 <p>With only a few thin sheets of paper, it didn’t take Shen Zhining long to finish reading it all.</p> 
 <p>“Is this it?” Shen Zhining didn’t make any excessive movements, leaving only his slender index finger to tap on the information. His tone was flat and sounded partially imposing.</p> 
 <p>“That girl is too ordinary,” said the man with glasses.</p> 
 <p>“If she was ordinary, would I have ordered you to investigate her?”</p> 
 <p>The man with glasses choked. He didn’t think that he’d missed anything as all he could find was documented on those sheets of paper. This world was filled with thousands of shy girls like Xu Jiaojiao, so there wasn’t much information to gather. It was only due to her personality becoming much more cheerful recently that a few more sheets of paper were able to be added to the pile. Otherwise, everything about her life would easily have fit on one piece of paper.</p> 
 <p>Seeing that the other person hadn’t yet realised his error, Shen Zhining slightly narrowed his eyes, his expression becoming a little more severe.</p> 
 <p>“What did I tell you before when I ordered you to investigate this person?”</p> 
 <p>“Her style of painting is the same as that of Sheng Jiaoyang’s style. She can also play Sheng Jiaoyang’s favourite piano piece, and her behaviour is similar to that of Sheng Jiaoyang,” the man with glasses said as he recalled the order.</p> 
 <p>“Then, what is it that you investigated for me? Do you want me to read it to you?”</p> 
 <p>“Xu Jiaojiao used to be too shy and had no friends, so no one really knew her. Perhaps, she’s a fan of Jiaoyang?”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining laughed slightly in annoyance before he stressed, “In the future, don’t tell people that you graduated from Harvard.”</p> 
 <p>“Why?”</p> 
 <p>“It will make people question the standards of Harvard.”</p> 
 <p>“…” The man with glasses blinked innocently. What had he done wrong?</p> 
 <p>“Get out and tell Weinan to come in.”</p> 
 <p>“Yes!” The man with glasses stared at Shen Zhining for a moment before he walked out of the room.</p> 
 <p>As he left the room, the man with glasses quietly spoke to the tall guard standing by the door, “Brother Nan, be careful; Boss is in a bad mood today.”</p> 
 <p>Jing Weinan wordlessly glanced at the man with glasses. He’d heard the conversation in the room just now. <em>Who’s fault is it that Boss is now in a bad mood?!</em></p> 
 <p>Ignoring the man with glasses, Jing Weinan entered the room.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining looked calmly at the man for a while before he said, “Weinan, tell me what you’re thinking.”</p> 
 <p>“This Xu Jiaojiao has many doubtful points. Before, she’d always been a nerd who only knew study. No one knew that she could draw, and nobody knew that she could play the piano. Moreover, her growing environment didn’t accord her the opportunity to acquire these skills. Even if she had an aptitude for those things, Rome wasn’t built in a day. Where did she learn those skills? This is the first doubtful point.”</p> 
 <p>“Why did she imitate Miss Jiaoyang out of so many people? And, coincidentally, let you notice that on top of everything? This is the second doubtful point.”</p> 
 <p>“The third doubtful point is related to the second doubt. According to our investigation, Xu Jiaojiao was the one who caused Miss Jiaoyang to fall into a coma. I’ve checked the surveillance video. At that time, she rushed in front of Miss Jiaoyang’s car. There were so many cars on the road, yet why did she choose Miss Jiaoyang’s?”</p> 
 <p>“After a detailed analysis, we’ve discovered that everything about this person is suspicious. Xu Jiaojiao is very questionable. That is to say, the current Xu Jiaojiao’s behaviour is extremely suspicious.”</p> 
 <p>Jing Weinan reported everything in a measured tone.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining didn’t comment, and instead, he lowered his gaze and looked at the document beneath his hand. From his expression, no one knew what he was thinking.</p> 
 <p>“There are all sorts of coincidences in this world, but it’s impossible for them to occur with the same person continuously. If it does occur, then it mustn’t be a coincidence,” Jing Weinan concluded.</p> 
 <p>“Do you think that this is some kind of game?” Shen Zhining’s finger that had been rubbing on the edge of the paper paused.</p> 
 <p>“There’s another possibility.” The man with glasses suddenly poked his head in at the door. “Xu Jiaojiao is Sheng Jiaoyang!”</p>
