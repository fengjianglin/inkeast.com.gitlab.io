 <p>“Next! Wang Wei!”</p> 
 <p>In the gym, the contestants were currently wearing short sports uniforms and lined up in three rows. In front of them, there was a monitor. One person at a time would stand in front of it for one second, and all of their physical data would appear on the connected computer.</p> 
 <p>“Wang Wei, your weight when you registered was only 48 kg, but now it’s gone up to 52.6 kg. I’m curious, what on earth did you do to gain nearly 4 kg in just one week?”</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan held a list compiling all of the contestants' information. Looking away from the computer, he walked towards Wang Wei as he spoke to her; his voice contained a hint of teasing.</p> 
 <p>“How much do you eat every day?” Someone sighed.</p> 
 <p>Wang Wei had a square face and small eyes, and when she heard that random remark, her face flushed bright red. With her skin tone slightly resembling the colour of wheat, it was usually unnoticeable whenever she blushed. However, this time, everyone could clearly see the embarrassment that she was currently feeling.</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t eat that much. I was just a little too happy after the first auditions were over,” Wang Wei said resentfully.</p> 
 <p>Some of the contestants couldn’t help but laugh.</p> 
 <p>“Remember, if you want to have nice shapely legs, you must first control your mouth. When the fashion world considers fat to be beautiful, then you can be unaware of how much you consume,” Zhuo Yiyan said to Wang Wei, at the same time sweeping his eyes towards the other contestants.</p> 
 <p>Wang Wei dejectedly returned to her position in line.</p> 
 <p>“Alright, the next person is…” Zhuo Yiyan flipped over the page on his list. “Xu Jiaojiao.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang moved closer to the automatic testing machine.</p> 
 <p>“Your registration weight was 47 kg. Now…” Zhuo Yiyan glanced at the computer screen. “Your weight hasn’t changed. That’s good. Return to your position in line.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang returned to her position under everyone’s disdainful gaze.</p> 
 <p>“Next…”</p> 
 <p>After the test was completed, Zhuo Yiyan once again stood in front of everyone. He wasn’t a tall man, and he was shorter than most of the contestants, but he stood in front of them all seeming larger than life with his ample confidence spread out around him like a cape.</p> 
 <p>“As of now, this part of the test is finished. But, before we move on, let me tell you all a few of my opinions and suggestions,” Zhuo Yiyan said. “The majority of you have managed to maintain a good weight, and I believe that not all of you have the type of physique where you can eat all you want without gaining an ounce of fat. It shows that your self restraint is superb, congratulations! Unfortunately, for those that seem to have a fluctuating weight--”</p> 
 <p>When Zhuo Yiyan mentioned the part about ‘fluctuating weight’, all the contestants laughed.</p> 
 <p>“Everyone here is an adult, oh…except the two girls that have yet to turn eighteen; Tan Shuang and Xu Jiaojiao. Anyway, after the past twenty years, everyone should now be clear about what kind of physique your body resembles. Behind every successful public figure is knowledge, not just chance. So, if you want to make it into the finals, you must first be strict with yourself and control your body’s appearance.”</p> 
 <p>“This week, the only thing all of you will need to do is exercise; tempering your bodies into the best shapes they can be. There’ll be two Fitness Instructors for each team who’ll guide you in your training, and they’ll also be the ones who’ll judge your final fitness results.”</p> 
 <p>“Good luck, ladies!”</p> 
 <p>After Zhuo Yiyan finished speaking, he retreated to the side and let the Fitness Instructors introduce themselves.</p> 
 <p>The four Fitness Instructors were all tall and robust looking; their defined muscles causing the eyes of the girls’ to twinkle with lust. After introducing themselves, they gave a brief demonstration of their skills which resulted in the girls squealing like a bunch of fan-girls.</p> 
 <p>The two Fitness Instructors assigned to Sheng Jiaoyang’s team were called Gao Yao and Li Tianyi. Unfortunately, while the Fitness Instructors’ names were refined, once they started the workout sessions they resembled demons! Initially, all the contestants had wanted to get closer to them, but once training had begun, they’d ended up crying bitter tears as they struggled to keep up.</p> 
 <p>On the other hand, the viewers watching the live broadcast couldn’t have been happier.</p> 
 <p>[Pfttt! Those girls’ screams are so miserable 2333333~~]</p> 
 <p>[2333333+1]</p> 
 <p>[Girls, ganbatte! <span id="footnote-ref-e806"><a href="#footnote-e806">[1]</a></span> Do it again without having the Fitness Instructor guide you!!]</p> 
 <p>[Isn’t it just 50 sit-ups? Why are they screaming like the world will soon end?]</p> 
 <p>[I feel that the girls who are training with the most ruthless methods are the ones who’d been so joyful in the beginning. I can’t be the only one who’s thinking this, right?]</p> 
 <p>[The Fitness Instructor’s inner voice: <em>Hmph! I dare you to try and seduce me once more. If something is meant to be, then it will happen on its own.</em>]</p> 
 <p>[WAHAHAHA…]</p> 
 <p>The netizens spoke freely in the comments, while the contestants were still facing an endless abyss of suffering with their training.</p>
