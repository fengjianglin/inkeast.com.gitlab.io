 <p>In all the stores they left their address, and asked the stores to send the clothes to their home. Sheng Jiaoyang then grabbed Xu Qing and went empty-handed to a beauty salon.</p> 
 <p>After pushing Xu Qing towards the hairdresser, Sheng Jiaoyang sat on the sofa, straightened her legs, and started flipping through a magazine.</p> 
 <p>Suddenly, her phone started ringing.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at her phone and saw that it was an unfamiliar number.</p> 
 <p>“Hello?”</p> 
 <p>“Xu Jiaojiao, you actually blocked my number?!” A boy’s voice was heard from the phone’s speaker.</p> 
 <p>“Who are you?” Sheng Jiaoyang tilted her head as she asked.</p> 
 <p>“Your boyfriend!”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang hung up, then proceeded to add the number to her blocked list.</p> 
 <p>Not even two minutes passed before her phone rang with another unfamiliar number.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the matter with you? Didn’t you just take part in a stupid competition and now you’re acting like you don’t know me? Back then, you didn’t act like this when you received gifts from me!” These words came through as soon as the call connected.</p> 
 <p>“How much?” Sheng Jiaoyang asked impatiently.</p> 
 <p>“What?”</p> 
 <p>“How much was the stuff that you bought me worth? I’ll return it to you!”</p> 
 <p>The phone was silent for a moment before the boy spoke again in a calmer tone, “I’m not calling you for that; I don’t care about that little bit of money. Where are you now? I’ll pick you up.”</p> 
 <p>“Didn’t we already break up?” Sheng Jiaoyang asked tentatively.</p> 
 <p>Since his number was blocked, then this boyfriend should just disappear already.</p> 
 <p>She suddenly remembered the day when Xu Jiaojiao had rushed in front of her car. She seemed to recall that Xu Jiaojiao had been crying at that time. <em>Is it possible that she’d been dumped that day and had been so shocked that she’d run into oncoming traffic?</em></p> 
 <p>“We haven’t broken up yet…”</p> 
 <p>“Then, let’s break up!” Sheng Jiaoyang said before hanging up the phone once more.</p> 
 <p>The phone rang again.</p> 
 <p>She watched the caller ID flash across the screen in amusement. <em>Should she get justice for Xu Jiaojiao?</em></p> 
 <p>When the phone stopped ringing, and then immediately started back up again, she answered the phone.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, listen to what I want to tell you until the end. That day, you just heard half of it. Yes, it’s true that I started chasing after you because I had a bet going with my buddies, I’ll admit it. But, you dare to say that I didn’t use my heart when I chased you?! Didn’t you agree to be my girlfriend because you felt my sincerity? Don’t be mad at me anymore, okay? Let’s go out and meet up.”</p> 
 <p><em>That’s all lies!</em> Sheng Jiaoyang pursed her lips.</p> 
 <p>She was well aware of the virtues of those second-generation Young Masters, all of whom were idle enough to flock together to do stupid things. <em>Xu Jiaojiao sure was unlucky! A good student like her actually ran into such a pest.</em></p> 
 <p>Perhaps because she didn’t respond, the boy’s voice became even kinder.</p> 
 <p>“You have a right to be angry with me, but don’t you miss me? Tell me where you are and I'll pick you up.”</p> 
 <p>“Where are you?” Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t answer and instead asked a question of her own.</p> 
 <p>The boy on the other end of the phone was silent for a moment. “I’m at An Yuan Arcade City."</p> 
 <p><em>Huh, what a coincidence.</em></p> 
 <p>“Then, come to the fountain at An Yuan plaza.” She really wanted to see for herself what that playboy who’d played Xu Jiaojiao for a fool looked like.</p> 
 <p>“You’re also in An Yuan Plaza?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was too lazy to talk nonsense with him, so she hung up the phone.</p> 
 <p>She then informed Xu Qing that she was going to meet a friend, and that Xu Qing was to call her after she was done.</p> 
 <p>Just as Sheng Jiaoyang exited the salon and turned a corner, she suddenly felt a sharp pain on her nape before passing out.</p> 
 <p>Meanwhile, An Yuan Arcade City, a boy said to the people around him, “Dudes, I’ll go pick up her.”</p> 
 <p>“Go, go! I can’t wait to see the ugly duck after her transformation.”</p> 
 <p>The guy laughed, retrieved his phone from his buddy’s hand, and walked out of Arcade City, heading towards the fountain at An Yuan Plaza. When he got there, he waited for a long time and called Xu Jiaojiao many times, but to no avail…no one picked up.</p> 
 <p>After waiting for half an hour, he was sure that he’d been stood up.</p> 
 <p><em>Damn you Xu Jiaojiao, you sure are gutsy!!</em></p>
