<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Suddenly, the sharp ringing of a cell phone echoed in her vicinity.</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang froze, and glancing at her cell phone; she noted that the screen was displaying an unsaved number. Hesitating, she struggled with indecision before finally answering the phone.</p>
 <p>“Hello?”</p>
 <p>“Jiaojiao, your university admission notice arrived at the school yesterday, but I haven’t been able to get through to your cell phone for the last two days! In the future, you must remember to make sure that your cell phone is working, or else you’ll miss important information. Anyway, come to school; I’ve been in the office for the past few days.”</p>
 <p>“...Oh, okay.”</p>
 <p>After hanging up the phone, Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly realised a severe problem; she had absolutely no idea which school Xu Jiaojiao had graduated from!</p>
 <p>At that moment, she could only return to the place she now lived to see if she could find any useful information.</p>
 <p>After turning the small bedroom upside-down, Sheng Jiaoyang became bewildered when she realised that she couldn’t find anything concerning school. Not to mention diaries, there wasn’t even a hint of textbooks or homework.</p>
 <p>This room was indeed too small, but for it to be devoid of books even though it was a place where a student lived was beyond comprehension!</p>
 <p>After searching for such a long time, to the point where she was covered in sweat, Sheng Jiaoyang still couldn’t find the information she wanted. Frustrated, she considered re-creating the car accident to see if she could return to her original body. This was only a momentary thought though, as she was too afraid to gamble with such high stakes.</p>
 <p>Opening the wardrobe, Sheng Jiaoyang silently ridiculed the taste of her body’s former owner. Flicking through the choices, she pulled out a white t-shirt with a random pattern on it and opted for a pair of knee length jeans instead of loose-fitting casual pants.</p>
 <p>Next, by using a pair of scissors, the t-shirt and jeans gradually changed shape.</p>
 <p>The high neck of the t-shirt was cut to become a deep scoop-neck, while the bottom hem of the shirt was shortened with horizontal cuts placed half a finger length apart to form fringing. With the knee length jeans, she cut them into a pair of denim shorts.</p>
 <p>As for underwear, she had asked Xu Qing to buy her a few new sets when she was still in the hospital. Even though it was the clothing of her body’s previous owner, she absolutely refused to wear such personal clothing like someone else’s panties.</p>
 <p>When she entered the bathroom, it was only to discover that it was so simple and plain that there wasn’t even a water heater!</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was nearly frantic by now as this environment was considerably challenging her ability to bear with everything. Every time she thought she’d seen the worst of it, something would appear that was even worse.</p>
 <p>On the ash coloured wall there hung a half meter tall mirror, and currently, it was reflecting Sheng Jiaoyang’s depressed appearance. Yet under her thick bangs, her face was actually quite pretty; with long eyelashes framing big eyes, a straight nose, and delicate pink lips. The shape of her small face was similar to Xu Qing’s, but unlike her sharply pointed chin, Sheng Jiaoyang’s chin and cheeks still carried a trace of baby fat.</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang narrowed her eyes as she examined her current appearance in the mirror. Raising her hand to lift the somewhat disliked bangs, she decided that although her appearance wasn’t bad, this hairstyle ruined half of her current body’s appeal. And while her eyes were beautiful and expressive, due to body’s original owner suffering from myopia, she now had to squint to see things.</p>
 <p>In total, the only things that pleased her about her new body were that it was healthy and tall. To her, these were two essential qualities that she’d always wanted because, if she’d had Xu Jiaojiao’s height, she wouldn’t have needed to hate the heavens. Her own body was only 1.6 metres tall, and she’d always been surrounded by tall foreign girls, as well as groups of schoolgirls who’d despised her height.</p>
 <p>Recalling the tricks and sarcasm that she’d suffered through up until now caused Sheng Jiaoyang to still feel unhappy; so much so that just remembering it all would ignite her anger. Of course, letting that anger pile up in her heart was harmful to the body, so since she’d been unable to alter her height, she’d focused her attention on other areas like academics, forming connections, and more. As well as refining her taste in things like music, literature, fashion, and food. Studying hard, she’d watched on as the gazes of those who once mocked her became glares of envy and jealousy.</p>
 <p>“Like this, it seems that even in the most unfortunate of circumstances that not everything is bad.”</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang mumbled to herself as she bowed her head to stare at her perfectly straight long legs, revealing the hint of a pleased smile.</p>
 <p>Her gaze glanced briefly at the clothing within her hand, and her expression stiffened. She felt an excruciating headache starting to flare.</p>
 <p>Hot water...</p>
