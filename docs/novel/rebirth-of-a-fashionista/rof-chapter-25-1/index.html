<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Meanwhile, Sheng Jiaoyang, who’d escaped from the bathroom, couldn’t be bothered about finding Jiao Enhui to borrow menstrual pads anymore. She just wanted to find Xu Qing quickly before leaving this place. Shen Zhining’s craziness was making an appearance again, so she was better off avoiding him.</p> 
 <p>She didn’t need to find Jiao Enhui anyway, because if Xu Qing had found her, she would’ve come back long ago. She must’ve taken a detour in the backyard and gotten lost.</p> 
 <p>In reality, the Jiao family’s garden wasn’t large, it’s just that there were too many twists and turns.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang had only turned two corners before she spotted Xu Qing.</p> 
 <p>In front of Xu Qing there stood a middle-aged man in a suit. The man was saying something, and Xu Qing was wiping away her tears.</p> 
 <p><em>Who is that man?</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was annoyed. Even she couldn’t bear to make Xu Qing cry, yet what was that man doing?!</p> 
 <p>She walked over to them aggressively.</p> 
 <p>Xu Qing was standing opposite Sheng Jiaoyang, so she saw her daughter at a glance as she approached them, and her complexion abruptly paled.</p> 
 <p>The middle-aged man took notice of Xu Qing’s expression. When he turned around and saw Sheng Jiaoyang approaching, his complexion changed as well.</p> 
 <p>“You have a child? Didn’t you say that you didn’t get remarried after our divorce? You actually dared to lie to me! Yinyin was right, you approached me with ulterior motives. To think that I still felt an ounce of guilt towards you. Stay away from me from now on! I must have been blind back then, or else why would I have fancied a woman like you?!” The man’s anger for being deceived was written all over his face as he glared at Xu Qing.</p> 
 <p>There was no need to question how he knew that the two of them were mother and daughter. Their facial features alone were very similar; specifically their eyebrows and their eyes.</p> 
 <p><em>Pak!</em> Xu Qing was startled once she realised that she’d slapped him.</p> 
 <p>“You dare to hit me?!” The man was enraged. He then raised his hand and was about to slap Xu Qing back, but before his palm could land on her face, he was forcibly pushed to the ground.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang stood in front of Xu Qing and towered over the man with a cold expression on her face.</p> 
 <p>“My Mother hates men that would dare to raise a hand against a woman. You’re so unmanly!” she subconsciously said the words that Mei Niu liked to use.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao…” Xu Qing tugged on Sheng Jiaoyang’s sleeve.</p> 
 <p>“I haven’t said anything to you yet.” Sheng Jiaoyang swept her gaze across Xu Qing. “What were you talking about with this man here?”</p> 
 <p>Xu Qing was dumbfounded.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go, we’re heading home!” Sheng Jiaoyang pulled Xu Qing towards the lobby.</p> 
 <p>“Stop! Stop right there!” the man yelled in a flustered voice behind them.</p> 
 <p>Xu Qing stealthily looked back and saw that the man had apparently sprained his ankle and was currently jumping on one foot.</p> 
 <p>She then turned back to look at her daughter’s tall figure, her heart feeling particularly peaceful.</p> 
 <p>The unlucky man whose face was slapped, who was shoved to the ground, and had even sprained his ankle, was left glaring at the mother and daughter pair. He was almost burned to death by his anger. For so many years no one had dared to embarrass him so much, especially women!</p> 
 <p>He wanted to chase after them, but his right foot ached terribly as soon as he stepped on it. He flung his hands in the air in reluctant defeat. When he turned around and was about to call someone to help him, his gaze caught on someone standing nearby.</p> 
 <p>“P-president Shen?” He didn’t see what just happened, right?</p> 
 <p>“President Pan, do you need help in calling someone over?” a fake smile was pasted on his face as he asked.</p> 
 <p>“No, no need. I’ll help myself.” At this moment, Pan Zihui really wanted to roll back time.</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining turned to leave, but after barely taking two steps, he suddenly stopped.</p> 
 <p>“What is the relationship between the two of them and you?” he turned his head and asked.</p> 
 <p>Pan Zihui was caught off guard, and his expression looked awkward as he replied, “One is my ex-wife, and the other is her daughter.”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining nodded, and said meaningfully before leaving, “President Pan, hitting a woman is really unmanly.”</p> 
 <p>Pan Zihui’s expression froze.</p> 
 <p><em>Damn it, how humiliating to lose face in front of a client!</em></p>
