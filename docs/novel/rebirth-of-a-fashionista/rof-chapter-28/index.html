 <p>“Jiaojiao, are you feeling any better?” Xu Qing asked as she walked into Sheng Jiaoyang’s room.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang nodded, her eyes not straying from her phone.</p> 
 <p>“What are you looking at?” Xu Qing moved closer to see.</p> 
 <p>“Mei Niu’s new product launch conference,” Sheng Jiaoyang answered without raising her head.</p> 
 <p>“Mei Niu? Who’s Mei Niu?”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was silent for a moment before replying, “A celebrity.”</p> 
 <p><em>Is there a celebrity called Mei Niu?</em> Xu Qing caressed Sheng Jiaoyang’s head as she said, “Go have a meal first. You didn’t eat breakfast.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang hummed in agreement, then picked up the phone and followed Xu Qing out of the bedroom.</p> 
 <p>The dishes on the table consisted of meat, vegetables and soup. They were colourless, making anyone lose their appetite.</p> 
 <p>Xu Qing looked at the dishes that she’d prepared and remembered the food that she’d eaten for lunch yesterday; she suddenly felt ashamed.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, the food that Mother has prepared isn’t delicious. Just put up with it as you mustn’t starve yourself. If you want to eat something else, Mother will go out and help you buy it later.”</p> 
 <p>“It’s fine, let’s eat this first. We’ll go out for a stroll in the afternoon.” Sheng Jiaoyang smiled at Xu Qing and started eating.</p> 
 <p>In terms of culinary skills, they were quite similar to each other and had zero talent. No, that’s not true…Mother Xu could still cook better compared to Sheng Jiaoyang; it was so bad, she was afraid to step into the kitchen.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, these years, I’ve made you suffer so many hardships. I’m useless! Even my cooking is atrocious,” Xu Qing said mournfully.</p> 
 <p><em>Everything was all right a moment ago, so how did it abruptly become so depressing?</em></p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang raised an eyebrow, and picking at a dish with her chopsticks, she put a piece of food into Xu Qing’s bowl. “Eat it. The sooner we finish eating, the sooner we’ll go out to have fun. Ever since I’ve returned from the hospital, we haven’t gone out shopping together.”</p> 
 <p>“Does your stomach still hurt?”</p> 
 <p>“It’s much better now. You don’t have to worry, I know my body the best. Eat quickly!”</p> 
 <p>Xu Qing stared at the food that her daughter had placed in her bowl, and a happy smile couldn’t help but spread across her face.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looking at the woman before her that was easy to satisfy, a smile gleaming in her eyes as well.</p> 
 <p>After lunch, the two of them walked hand in hand out of the neighbourhood.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, where are we going?”</p> 
 <p>“It’s hot today, so we’ll go to the mall.” Sheng Jiaoyang lead Xu Qing to the nearest subway, and from there, they went to An Yuan Plaza.</p> 
 <p>Once they entered the huge shopping mall, Xu Qing lost all confidence. But, thinking that she’d only come for a stroll, and not to buy anything, she calmed down. It was difficult for her to find the time to windowshop with her daughter, so she especially cherished times like this.</p> 
 <p>Unfortunately, Sheng Jiaoyang hadn’t come here just to walk around. After moving into their new home, she’d originally wanted to bring Xu Qing shopping, but because she’d received a phone call from the production crew, she’d had to focus on preparing her daily necessities for the competition. During this, Xu Qing had only had two or three sets of clothing to wear, so her heart was feeling quite upset. Therefore, even though she still felt a little unwell, she wanted to go out with Xu Qing.</p> 
 <hr> 
 <p>“This isn’t bad. Go and try it on!”</p> 
 <p>“This skirt suits you too. Try it and show it to me!”</p> 
 <p>“Those are really nice. Here, change your shoes.”</p> 
 <p>“Oh, you’re still missing a purse. Here, carry this one.”</p> 
 <p>“Perfect, just carry it like this. The bill please!”</p> 
 <p>“Wait!” Xu Qing, who from the beginning had thought that she was just on a stroll, quickly pulled Sheng Jiaoyang to a stop.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, these things are so expensive. Forget it wanting to buy any of it, we’ll just go to the old city’s…”</p> 
 <p>“No!” Sheng Jiaoyang held both of Xu Qing’s shoulders as she tried coaxing her. “Isn’t money made to be spent? Since I now have to dress up, I want you to wear the best clothes too. Why on earth do you want to buy ordinary clothes? Alright, from now on, you don’t need to worry about anything. At home, just leave it to me to be responsible for earning money to support the two of us. As for you, just be as lovely as a flower, that will do.”</p> 
 <p>Xu Qing was amused and laughed at Sheng Jiaoyang’s words, but worry was still visible on her face.</p> 
 <p>With the big and small shopping bags swaying next to each other, Xu Qing’s worries turned into helplessness, and eventually, helplessness to numbness.</p> 
 <p>She decided not to think about trivial matters anymore, and she didn’t try to persuade her daughter not to buy more. From beginning to end, she only tried on the clothes.</p>
