<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Both people looked at the doorway as one, noticing a girl peeking her head around the doorframe. When the girl saw that the two people in the room were looking at her, she walked in before they could say anything.</p> 
 <p>“I suddenly felt the urge to play the piano, so I came up here. What were the both of you just talking about?” The girl asked as she approached.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at Zhuo Yiyan while sneering in her heart.</p> 
 <p>At the same time, Zhuo Yiyan had been subtly watching Sheng Jiaoyang and saw her expression change minutely. Without her having to say it out loud, he knew that she was disgusted by his ability to attract people, no matter where he was.</p> 
 <p>“Since you’re going to play the piano, I won’t disturb you,” Zhuo Yiyan said, maintaining his gentle attitude.</p> 
 <p>“Eeh? Teacher Zhuo, can you wait for a while before you go? I recently learned a piano song especially for you and wanted for you to hear it,” The girl blinked her eyes as she looked at Zhuo Yiyan pitifully, as though if he didn’t agree she would cry.</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan remained unmoved and just said, “Then you should play it.”</p> 
 <p>The girl’s eyes lit up as she ran a little to the piano, saying to Sheng Jiaoyang who hadn’t yet moved, “Sorry, I’m going to play the piano, so can you step aside?”</p> 
 <p>A corner of Sheng Jiaoyang’s lips lifted, and carrying her glass of wine, she moved aside two steps and pointed the piano with her chin as she said, “Please, play it.” Compared to Zhuo Yiyan’s gentle tone, her tone was too indifferent and came across a little arrogant.</p> 
 <p>The girl secretly glared at Sheng Jiaoyang and thought of her as quite the eyesore.</p> 
 <p>Taking a deep breath, the girl lifted the piano cover, and then placed her hands on the ivory keys. After turning her head to smile at Zhuo Yiyan, she then began to play a song that she’d practised many times.</p> 
 <p>The melodious sound of the piano echoed in the spacious room, and the lively tune lingered in their ears.</p> 
 <p>Once the song was finished, the girl hastily turned to Zhuo Yiyan and asked expectantly, “Teacher Zhuo, how was it?”</p> 
 <p>“Not bad, keep it up,” Zhuo Yiyan said comfortingly. Then, he nodded to the two girls and turned around to leave.</p> 
 <p>“Teacher Zhuo, my name is Qi Hua!” The girl shouted at Zhuo Yiyan’s retreating figure.</p> 
 <p>“I remember,” Zhuo Yiyan threw out before continuing to walk out of the room.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang laughed lightly, then sipped her cocktail to cover it.</p> 
 <p>“You and Teacher Zhuo know each other?” Qi Hua slowly turned her head and stared fixedly at Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>“No.”</p> 
 <p>Once she’d heard this answer, Qi Hua’s expression changed. She looked at Sheng Jiaoyang with hate and said, “What were you just laughing at? What qualifications do you have to laugh at me? Since the beginning of this competition, I knew that every move you made was carefully calculated, yet I didn’t expect you to also be so shameless! Even daring to privately hook up with Teacher Zhuo!”</p> 
 <p>“Yeah, I just laughed at you! Bite me if you don’t like!” Sheng Jiaoyang’s tone was particularly annoying.</p> 
 <p>“You-!” Qi Hua stood up and prepared to start a fight.</p> 
 <p>“Please pay attention to your image. The cameras are still recording,” Sheng Jiaoyang’s remark caused Qi Hua to restrain her emotions quickly.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang smirked and moved closer before swiftly shifting the wine glass to her left hand, and with her right hand, she stretched past Qi Hua. From the viewers perspective, it looked like she lightly tapped the piano, while in fact, she bounced her fingers on the keys and caused a very short tune to play.</p> 
 <p>Other people who heard it might be unaware, but Qi Hua’s complexion changed instantly.</p> 
 <p>“Keep it up, girl!”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang whispered in Qi Hua’s ear devoid of meaning before walking away without a second glance.</p> 
 <p>Qi Hua’s face was mottled a horrid shade, and she glared at Sheng Jiaoyang’s back as she stamped her foot in anger.</p> 
 <p>Bitch!</p> 
 <p>Qi Hua looked at the camera in the room before she also hurriedly left the piano room.</p> 
 <p>For the viewers watching the live broadcast, this scene was somewhat unclear. The comments page was abruptly filled with questions.</p> 
 <p>[What’s going on?]</p> 
 <p>[Can anyone tell me what happened just now?]</p> 
 <p>[Looking for an answer +1.]</p> 
 <p>[Why did the tune that Xu Jiaojiao play sound a little familiar? Did I hear things?]</p> 
 <p>[I wonder what the meaning was for the short-haired girl to play it.]</p> 
 <p>[If anyone out there can play the piano, help us by telling us what it means!]</p> 
 <p>[+1 for an ID number.]</p> 
 <p>At the same time, in a particular female dormitory, two cute girls were engaging in an enthusiastic discussion.</p> 
 <p>“What did Goddess Xu do?” Cute girl number 1, Liu Lu, was somewhat dumbfounded.</p> 
 <p>“I think she was correcting Qi Hua on where she played the piano wrong,” Concluded cute girl number 2, who was the roommate who’d remained watching.</p> 
 <p>“But didn’t Goddess Xu learn how to paint?” Liu Lu continued, completely dumbfounded.</p> 
 <p>“Is there a rule that says a person can only learn how to draw?” Roommate three asked calmly as she pushed her glasses further up her nose.</p> 
 <p>Liu Lu blinked and looked utterly confused. “Can one person master two complicated things at the same time?”</p> 
 <p>“That’s wrong! It’s three things,” The roommate corrected.</p> 
 <p>“Three? Oh right, she also can mix cocktails,” Liu Lu nodded.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t judge a book by its cover. There’s no lack of talented people in this world,” The roommate stated.</p> 
 <p>Liu Lu wailed in defeat before she finally sighed, “F*ck! I have such a hard time studying for a final exam, yet she’s already learnt so many skills.”</p> 
 <p>“That’s enough! Both of you!”</p> 
 <p>“So you still remember that you have a test to do? Hurry up and study!!!”</p> 
 <p>Roommate one and roommate two had finally had enough and chastised the two girls who were busy gossiping.</p> 
 <p>The two cute girls hunched their necks in silence, turned off the phone, and began preparing for the exam.</p>
