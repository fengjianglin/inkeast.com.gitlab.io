 <p>“I suppose we won’t receive any more guidance from Lina now,” Said Luo Yi, the Captain of short dress team.</p>
 <p>“Why?”</p>
 <p>“What did Lina’s assistant say?”</p>
 <p>“Did you understand what she said?”</p>
 <p>Everyone suddenly surrounded Luo Yi and bombarded her with questions.</p>
 <p>Luo Yi waved her hands. “I heard enough to get a rough idea, but I understood the first part of what was said; she said that Lina’s Mother was in an accident.”</p>
 <p>“Eeh? No wonder Lina’s expression was so dark.”</p>
 <p>“You’re so awesome, Captain! I didn’t know what she was talking about at all, yet you were actually able to understand.”</p>
 <p>“Then, did you understand what Lina said before?” Someone asked as they recalled the indecipherable words that had previously burst out of Lina’s mouth.</p>
 <p>“She wasn’t speaking in English, so I don’t know what she said,” Luo Yi responded with a shrug.</p>
 <p>“Jiaojiao, I saw you smiling when Lina was speaking to you. Did you understand what she said?” When Xiao Yang pointed this out, everyone focused their attention on Sheng Jiaoyang.</p>
 <p>“Who are you?”</p>
 <p>“Hey, how can you be like that when Yang Bao asked you nicely?? If you don’t want to answer, then fine. But what’s with your uncalled for rudeness?” Before Xiao Yang could respond, Xiao Yang’s partner had jumped out to defend her friend from suffering an injustice.</p>
 <p>“That’s right!”</p>
 <p>“She only mentioned Lina’s name; what’s so great about it!?”</p>
 <p>All of a sudden, Sheng Jiaoyang became the target of everyone’s condemnation.</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang sneered, and said “Didn’t all of you want to know what Lina was saying? After translating what Lina said, that’s what she asked me.”</p>
 <p>Uh…</p>
 <p>The training room instantly fell silent.</p>
 <p>Everyone looked at each other in dismay. Obviously, nobody had expected the truth to be like this.</p>
 <p>“You didn’t translate what she said wrongly, right?” Someone questioned.</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang swept her gaze over the person who spoke, then turned and walked to the handrail attached to the wall, ignoring everyone in the room.</p>
 <p>People who were aloof and had status were naturally those with a moral character, while those who were aloof but without status were usually unsociable. It was clear to the other contestants that Sheng Jiaoyang belonged to the latter category.</p>
 <p>Because of this, everyone consciously avoided her. In other words; Sheng Jiaoyang was isolated.</p>
 <p>Not long after, the event organiser entered the room.</p>
 <p>“Today’s training will end here. A situation has occurred within Lina’s family, so she has already rushed to the airport. In a moment, all of you will need to collect your belongings and follow staff to the bus. From there, you will be transported to the place where you’ll be living for the duration of the competition.”</p>
 <p>“Will Lina return?” Sheng Jiaoyang couldn't help but ask.</p>
 <p>“This isn’t something that you need to worry about. If she returns, then you will, of course, be informed at that time.”</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang lowered her gaze, closed her mouth, and didn’t say anything else.</p>
 <p>After getting on the bus, Sheng Jiaoyang found an unoccupied seat by a window and closed her eyes as soon as she sat down.</p>
 <p>“Hi!” A chirpy voice was heard as a person sat beside her.</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang opened her eyes and glanced at the person next to her, only to see that it was the Captain of the other team, Luo Yi, who was looking at her with a smile on her face.</p>
 <p>“I believe what you said before,” Luo Yi winked at Sheng Jiaoyang.</p>
 <p>“And?” Sheng Jiaoyang raised an eyebrow in speculation.</p>
 <p>Luo Yi looked around cautiously before lowering her voice and asking, “Can you tell me; what exactly did you say to Lina that made her react that way?”</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang also lowered her voice as she answered, but there was a hint of ridicule in her tone. “What do you think I said?”</p>
 <p>“Uhh…” Luo Yi choked on her words. Then, pouting like a spoiled child, she said, “Don’t be like this; I want us to be friends!”</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang lightly laughed and said, “I told her that I know her secret.”</p>
 <p>“What secret?” Luo Yi’s eyes widened.</p>
 <p>“It’s a secret,” Sheng Jiaoyang answered mysteriously as she winked at Luo Yi, refusing to say anything else.</p>
 <p>Luo Yi was extremely curious, but no matter how much she begged, the other girl wouldn’t budge at all.</p>
 <p>In order to discover this secret, even after stepping off the bus, Luo Yi followed closely behind Sheng Jiaoyang.</p>
 <p>“When did their relationship become so good?”</p>
 <p>“Luo Yi is the Captain of our team; how can she get so close to a member of the other team?”</p>
 <p>“You’re right!”</p>
 <p>The other contestants discreetly discussed between themselves.</p>
 <p><em>‘Pa pa’</em> the sound of hands clapping for attention came from the front of the group.</p>
 <p>The contestants looked over in succession and saw that the entrance of the villa had opened, revealing a person inside.</p>
 <p>The figure wasn’t all that tall, and he was wearing casual clothes suited to a young person. As he leisurely stood by the door frame, he firmly grasped everyone’s gaze.</p>
 <p>“Oh, my! It’s Zhou Yiyan!”</p>
 <p>“So handsome! He really suits my taste!”</p>
 <p>“My Prince--”</p>
 <p>All the contestants wore expressions of starry-eyed infatuation.</p>
 <p>Standing amongst a group of women who were all exclaiming in admiration and praise, Sheng Jiaoyang felt slightly ashamed to be near such love-struck fools.</p>
 <p>But, it had apparently been forgotten that it was impossible for her to be so infatuated.</p>
 <p>This was due to the belief that even if you hadn’t reached the point of obsession, in this whole world, who wouldn’t at least be smitten. Yet for Sheng Jiaoyang, she didn’t feel her heart skip a beat or find it difficult to keep her gaze steady at all when she was around Zhuo Yiyan. This was because he just wasn’t someone she felt attracted to.</p>
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan looked at the excited contestants, then spread both of his arms in front of his body as he smiled.</p>
 <p>“Welcome ladies! This is where you’ll be living for the next two weeks. You can call it - Supermodel House!”</p>
