 <p>The fish feast, as the name implies, used fish as its main ingredient. The table was filled with pan-fried, braised, steamed, and deep-fried dishes accompanied by various seasonal appetizers. This was truly a sumptuous sight to behold, as if they were at a dinner banquet.</p> 
 <p>In addition, all the fish used were raised in their pond. They were healthy and fresh, so the meat was delicious.</p> 
 <p>Treasure rice was a bowl of cooked rice, but there was more to it than meets the eye as this dish contained more than a dozen ingredients. Not to mention, the rice selected was the best of the best. Combining these ingredients was truly a test of one’s cooking skills as one had to make sure that the combination of ingredients didn’t affect the flavours of one another, while the rice stayed delicious and appealing to the eyes.</p> 
 <p>Xu Qing couldn’t stop picking up her chopsticks at all. She finally understood why her daughter didn’t seem to have an appetite lately. If she’d eaten this kind of sumptuous meal before, and had then suddenly had to eat the food she cooked again…if it were her, she would’ve also lost her appetite.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang ate until she was content. She’d finally gotten a ‘cure’ for her taste buds.</p> 
 <p>“Are you done? Do you want to try anything else?” Sheng Jiaoyang asked Xu Qing.</p> 
 <p>“No need, I’ve eaten so much already. How about you?” Xu Qing quickly replied.</p> 
 <p>“I’m full. I’m going to the bathroom, come along?” Sheng Jiaoyang stood up.</p> 
 <p>“I’m coming too.”</p> 
 <p>The toilets in the restaurant were set up separately. There is a one-story building behind the loft, and this part used to be a toilet, but it was later turned into a spacious lavatory.</p> 
 <p>Just as she entered the bathroom, Sheng Jiaoyang’s expression changed slightly. She pulled Xu Qing closer and whispered, “Do you have that thing?”</p> 
 <p><em>That thing?</em> Xu Qing was at first confused before she reacted.</p> 
 <p>“No, I’ll go and buy it for you.”</p> 
 <p>“No, there are no convenience stores around here. Help me find Jiao Enhui, she’s the owner’s granddaughter; borrow one from her.”</p> 
 <p>“Oh, okay.” Xu Qing hurriedly rushed out.</p> 
 <p>Once she’d left, Sheng Jiaoyang suddenly realised…would Xu Qing be able to find that person?</p> 
 <p>The layout of the Jiao family’s restaurant was a landscaped garden, and since this was the first time that Xu Qing had been here, it was easy to get confused.</p> 
 <p>Sure enough, Xu Qing didn’t come back even after a long time. Sheng Jiaoyang held her forehead and sighed. Fortunately, her period hasn't come yet, but the cramps were very strong, so it shouldn’t take long before it came.</p> 
 <p>Having no choice, Sheng Jiaoyang could only go search by herself.</p> 
 <p>Quickly stepping towards the bathroom exit, she accidentally bumped into someone.</p> 
 <p>“Sor…” the rest of the words stuck in her throat.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at the man with a frown and a cold expression. Her entire body felt unwell.</p> 
 <p><em>Why was the Demon King Shen here?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Doesn’t this guy mainly work in Germany? Half a month has passed since the last time they’d met. How come he hasn’t left yet?</em></p> 
 <p>“It’s you?” Shen Zhining narrowed his eyes at her.</p> 
 <p>“Yep, it’s me.” Sheng Jiaoyang lifted her chin, forcing herself to be tough in front of the Demon King. She didn’t do anything wrong, so she shouldn’t act like a cat meeting a mouse whenever she saw Shen Zhining.</p> 
 <p><em>Uhh…</em></p> 
 <p><em>Was something about that wrong?…</em></p> 
 <p>“Why are you here?” Shen Zhining asked as he stared at her coldly.</p> 
 <p>“Why can’t I be here? Who set the rule that I can’t come here?” Sheng Jiaoyang replied with a raised eyebrow.</p> 
 <p>A corner of his mouth twitched, and his expression darkened further.</p> 
 <p>“Was it you who was playing the piano in the loft before?” he abruptly asked.</p> 
 <p>At that moment, he only saw a faint silhouette from his memories.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was startled, but still replied, “It was me.”</p> 
 <p>Shen Zhining suddenly laughed, and slowly said, “Excellent…”</p> 
 <p>“Thank you for your compliment. I should get going first.” Feeling that something was weird, Sheng Jiaoyang immediately fled.</p> 
 <p>Silence filled the bathroom as the mirror on the wall reflected the dangerous glint in the man’s eyes.</p>
