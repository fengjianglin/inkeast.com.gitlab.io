 <p>“Tell me honestly: Who was that man who was going to hit you? What’s your relation to him?”</p> 
 <p>After they’d left the Jiao family’s restaurant, Sheng Jiaoyang immediately started questioning Xu Qing.</p> 
 <p>From her daughter’s willingness to protect her without the slightest hesitation, Xu Qing felt like she’d finally found a person to rely on. She could no longer treat her daughter as a child.</p> 
 <p>Her daughter had grown up, and some things couldn’t be concealed anymore.</p> 
 <p>“He’s your Father,” Xu Qing stated calmly.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang just blinked. Her mouth opened slightly as she wanted to say something, but she didn’t know where to start.</p> 
 <p>To sum it up, the scumbag who she’d pushed to the ground was the biological Father of this body?</p> 
 <p>“When your Father and I divorced, I didn't know that I was pregnant with you. Actually, I didn't know about it for a while. Later, I was admitted into a hospital due to depression, and it was then that the doctor told me that I was pregnant. After knowing about you, I finally accepted the situation and moved on. I thought that no matter what, I had to give birth to you and raise you well.”</p> 
 <p>“You didn’t tell that person?” Sheng Jiaoyang really couldn’t understand Xu Qing’s way of handling things. At the least, she could’ve been receiving child support from him. Seeing that man putting on airs, but also having a meal at the Jiao family’s restaurant, he must have a lot of money, right?</p> 
 <p>“At first, I wanted to tell him, but he wouldn’t agree to meet me at that time. Not long after, he married Jiang Yin.”</p> 
 <p>“So, he married another woman right after divorcing you?”</p> 
 <p>Xu Qing nodded with a sad expression on her face.</p> 
 <p>“Scum!”</p> 
 <p>After Sheng Jiaoyang had calmed down, she couldn’t help asking, “You must’ve been beautiful when you were younger, so why did you stay with someone like that?”</p> 
 <p>“He was my senior. At that time, he was very good to me. He was a meticulous and caring person, and also very popular in the school. My classmates envied me,” speaking until here, a smile graced Xu Qing’s face as she recalled her good memories.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang listened in silence. <em>As people once said, one must guard against fire, theft, and senior brothers.</em></p> 
 <p>“When he was about to go away for an internship, he proposed to me. He said that he wanted to solidify our relationship, and I agreed.”</p> 
 <p>“Wait, wait! You mean, you two got a marriage certificate before you’d even graduated?”</p> 
 <p>“Yes.”</p> 
 <p>“It sounds like he couldn’t wait to marry you. Since he liked you so much at that time, why’d he change later on?”</p> 
 <p>Xu Qing’s expression was gloomy, and she said with sadness, “He gradually changed after he started working. He would constantly go to dinner parties that would last until the early hours of the morning, so I tried to persuade him not to push himself too hard. When this happened, he became angry. Later on, he no longer told me anything about his work. One day, I went to a party with my classmates, and we were back quite late. When I arrived back to where we lived, I saw him sitting in Jiang Yin’s car. They…”</p> 
 <p>After speaking until here, Xu Qing suddenly stopped. The scene that she didn’t describe completely was obviously a significant blow to her.</p> 
 <p>Needless to say, Sheng Jiaoyang understood.</p> 
 <p>She understood how Xu Qing would’ve felt at that time. She saw the man she loved being affectionate with another woman right in front of her, and her heart probably felt like it fell into a pit of eternal suffering. She’d only ever loved her husband, yet she saw him having an affair.</p> 
 <p>“Jiang Yin must come from a wealthy family since she dared to hook up with a married man. Her brain must have problems!”</p> 
 <p>“During school, Jiang Yin also knew him, but at that time, he didn’t even look at her. However, in just a year, he was suddenly intimate with her. I don’t know what happened during that year, but it changed everything.”</p> 
 <p>“Was the company he had his internship with owned by Jiang Yin’s family?” Sheng Jiaoyang asked.</p> 
 <p>Xu Qing stared at her in a daze before nodding.</p> 
 <p>“Then, that’s it. A man can easily be changed by the environment when he enters society. He worked at a company owned by Jiang Yin’s family, and Jiang Yin was interested in him. It was just a matter of time before they engaged in an affair,” Sheng Jiaoyang said with her lips pursed.</p> 
 <p>Seeing Xu Qing’s distress, Sheng Jiaoyang held Xu Qing’s arm and said, “Not telling him about my existence was the right choice lest he comes to find you again and begs for your forgiveness once I get rich!”</p> 
 <p>“Mmh.” Xu Qing, who was becoming increasingly dependent on her daughter, had no rebuttal. Instead, she felt relieved. Now she wasn’t afraid to face anyone, because she has the support of her daughter.</p> 
 <p>“Let’s go; I feel that my period is coming soon.”</p> 
 <p>After buying menstrual pads at the convenience store, the two went back home.</p>
