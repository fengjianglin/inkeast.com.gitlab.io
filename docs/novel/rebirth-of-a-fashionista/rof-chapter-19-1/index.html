 <p>Like this, the ten minutes quickly passed.</p> 
 <p>When the five contestants returned to the bus, they were the centre of attention.</p> 
 <p>“Quickly tell us, what is the situation like inside the market?” the second group of contestants, who were ready to enter the market, anxiously asked them.</p> 
 <p>“Don’t ask me. Even now, I'm still shocked!” A contestant shook her head as she forced a smile.</p> 
 <p>Two other contestants were engrossed with drinking water, not bothering to answer them.</p> 
 <p>Another one said, “When you guys go in, I advise you not to wander. Just enter the first store you see, or else, you’ll have no time to choose and try on the dress.”</p> 
 <p>Xiao Yang looked at Sheng Jiaoyang, who had the calmest expression, and quickly asked, “Jiaojiao, what about you?”</p> 
 <p>“She’s right. Don’t think that the next store will have something better, because you don’t have enough time to be picky.” Sheng Jiaoyang paused before continuing, “If you want to buy a dress, enter from the left-hand side of the door. The right-hand side entrance is where the bags are. The innermost section is shoes and other accessories.”</p> 
 <p>Undoubtedly, Sheng Jiaoyang’s advice was helpful to the contestants who’d enter next. The way they looked at her changed due to this.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, thank you!” Xiao Yang said.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang shrugged as she walked back to her seat.</p> 
 <p>“What did you buy?” Luo Yi looked curiously at the bags in Sheng Jiaoyang’s hands.</p> 
 <p>“You’ll know tonight.” A corner of Sheng Jiaoyang’s mouth raised to keep the other girl guessing.</p> 
 <p>“Fine,” Luo Yi sighed, feigning disappointment.</p> 
 <p>By the time the two remaining groups had finished buying their stuff, nearly half an hour had passed.</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan didn’t ask how Xiao Yang’s team went buying their outfits. Instead, he took everyone to a restaurant and had a sumptuous lunch.</p> 
 <p>After lunch, everyone returned to the villa.</p> 
 <p>Once they’d returned, Zhuo Yiyan announced that the garden party would start at 7 pm before disappearing.</p> 
 <p>Unlike the opening show a week ago, when makeup artists had helped the contestants with their makeup, the contestants were required to do their own make-up for the party that night.</p> 
 <p>It didn’t matter if you couldn’t put on makeup, as someone else could help you. This time, it was to test a person’s ability to communicate.</p> 
 <p>Don’t think that having communication skills wasn’t important. Having good relationships with other people was an ability, as no one can work alone to achieve success.</p> 
 <p>As everyone began to ponder their evening makeup, only Sheng Jiaoyang seemed to be completely unconcerned. As soon as they’d returned to the villa, she immediately went for a nap.</p> 
 <p>When Luo Yi and Pu Mingyu went back to their room and saw that Sheng Jiaoyang had already rolled herself into a ball and fallen asleep, both of them looked at each other in dismay; helplessness and envy on their faces.</p> 
 <p>If they were to go to bed now, they wouldn’t be able to sleep. When they thought about how they would be judged on their outfits and style later that night, they were both nervous and excited. How could they sleep?!</p> 
 <p>As night gradually approached, everyone became restless as they carefully applied their makeup and styled their hair. Meanwhile, Sheng Jiaoyang finally woke up, utterly refreshed.</p> 
 <p>“You’re finally awake! Quick, quick, there’s still an hour and a half to get ready, so hurry up and get up. Do you want us to help you with your makeup?” asked Luo Yi, who just happened to enter the room.</p> 
 <p>“I can do it myself, but I want to borrow your makeup,” Sheng Jiaoyang replied while rubbing her fluffy short hair.</p> 
 <p>“Sure, just use it.” Luo Yi grabbed her cosmetic bag from the cupboard and handed it over to Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>“Thank you!” Sheng Jiaoyang accepted the makeup bag, and put it together with the stuff she’d bought in the morning. Then, she selected a change of clothes from her suitcase and left the room.</p> 
 <p>“Ehh, where are you going?” Luo Yi asked quickly, feeling that something was amiss.</p> 
 <p>“Bathing!”</p> 
 <p>“…”</p> 
 <p>Luo Yi supported her forehead with her hand. <em>Doesn’t this girl feel worried at all?</em></p> 
 <p>Time steadily passed, gradually inching closer to 7 pm. When the hour arrived, all the lights in the garden lit up.</p> 
 <p>A cheerful violin tune started playing, indicating that the party was about to begin.</p>
