 <p>A red carpet was laid out from the side door of the villa to the garden, and pots containing half-metre tall Chinese enkianthus lined the sides of the carpet. The miniature bell flowers radiated with multi-coloured light, which accentuated the uniqueness of the scarlet carpet at the centre.</p> 
 <p>The cameramen and staff were already busying themselves setting up, while the models were getting ready to present their outfits. The programme team, in collaboration with the video broadcast site, was now accessible to the public again after being discontinued for the entire afternoon to build a sense of suspense for tonight’s party. The main venue for tonight’s live broadcast was the villa’s rear garden.</p> 
 <p>The guests began to make their appearance one by one with the emcee giving each guest an introduction. The first guest to make his appearance was naturally Zhuo Yiyan, followed by a few familiar faces who were at the opening show. The top three winners of the first season were the last to arrive, holding each other’s hands.</p> 
 <p>“Teacher Zhuo, I’m so happy to see you once again~” The former second-runner up bounded over to Zhuo Yiyan’s side.</p> 
 <p>“I am happy to see all of you as well,” Zhuo Yiyan tactfully replied. By using ‘all of you’ instead of ‘you’, he would be able to avoid any misunderstandings from arising.</p> 
 <p>In contrast to the lively second-runner up, the champion appeared calmer, respectfully greeting every single guest with the first-runner up following behind her.</p> 
 <p>“Being able to see the three of them again, I really can’t help but lament at how fast time has passed!” Guiliana, one of the judges from the first season exclaimed as she looked at the three modern girls who’d cast away their inexperience.</p> 
 <p>“That’s right, three years have passed in the blink of an eye.” As the chief of the judging committee for the second season running, Zhuo Yiyan’s emotions were no less than what Guiliana felt. Three years ago, he was still an unrestrained, hot-blooded youth who spoke out at whatever he felt was incorrect. Many participants had been reduced to tears by his words. After three years, his personality had mellowed out significantly, and the maturity in his thinking had made him calmer.</p> 
 <p>“Yiyan, how are this season’s participants in comparison to the contestants from the first season?” Guiliana asked.</p> 
 <p>The surrounding people quietened down as though interested in Zhuo Yiyan’s reply.</p> 
 <p>“Those who participated in the first season were all very brave, and the aptitude of the ladies participating this season isn’t bad either,” Zhuo Yiyan replied objectively.</p> 
 <p>Those who were sharp instantly understood his words; it was obvious that this season’s participants were of a higher standard in comparison to their seniors.</p> 
 <p>No one present had a low EQ, so they naturally understood the meaning behind Zhuo Yiyan’s words.</p> 
 <p>Currently, the three warriors, correction, seniors were feeling upset. All of them had participated in the national supermodel competition before; on what grounds were the newcomers better than them? On what basis?</p> 
 <p>The three of them looked towards the villa. <em>They truly wanted to see just how good these newcomers were!</em></p> 
 <p>The main camera swivelled towards the crimson carpet that was brightly lit. With an utterance of “It’s starting!” from someone, the first figure made her appearance on the red carpet.</p> 
 <p>The girl that stepped out was dressed in a long, red, sleeveless dress that trailed to the floor. A slit in the side of her dress allowed for a glimpse of her thighs. The girl’s curls draped over her left shoulder, and her lips were as red as flames, radiating with charm.</p> 
 <p>“This is Luo Yi.” Zhuo Yiyan flipped over the name list provided by the crew, arriving at Luo Yi’s information at the very first page, and awarding her 8.5 points in the scoring bracket.</p> 
 <p>The other judges also began to give their scores, and it was clear that the overall results were high.</p> 
 <p>“This lass isn’t bad, and the way she carries herself is passable.”</p> 
 <p>“Based on the information given, she’s already been in the modelling industry for 3 years. No wonder she’s so unfazed.”</p> 
 <p>“It’s a pity she’s not pretty enough; I think that’s what’s holding her career back.”</p> 
 <p>A few of the judges began discussing the girls amongst themselves.</p> 
 <p>Luo Yi, who was the first participant, had already walked offstage awaiting further instructions under the crew’s direction.</p> 
 <p>The second person appeared on stage.</p> 
 <p>The runway’s order was determined by the order displayed on the namelist, so the judges didn’t need to know the name of the model and were only required to score them sequentially.</p> 
 <p>The models who appeared on stage first were all from Luo Yi’s group. Each one of them were decked out in high quality clothing. There were some that hadn’t selected clothes that complemented them, or clothes that matched poorly with their overall style, lowering the overall impression and resulting in them receiving mediocre scores from the judges.</p> 
 <p>“I heard that the contestants selected their clothing from two different locations today. One group even had to choose their clothing from wholesale distributors. By the looks of it, the ones coming out next should be that group, I really pity them,” a female judge commented while smiling.</p>
