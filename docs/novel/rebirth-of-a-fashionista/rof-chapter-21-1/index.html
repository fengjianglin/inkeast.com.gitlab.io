 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang looked at the girls wordlessly, noting that even Luo Yi had a look of joy on her face, visible at the corner of her eyes. She turned her head to evaluate the male celebrities; there were youths, and there were those of middle-age. There were celebrities who were tall and dashing, and there were those who looked like experienced, aged men.</p> 
 <p><em>Was this really necessary?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Must all of you be excited like this?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Even if you’ve seen your favourite idol, can’t you just sit at home silently and lick the screen???</em></p> 
 <p>Every one of them were behaving as though they were high on drugs, it was unbearable to watch.</p> 
 <p>She just couldn’t understand the idolatry that these young girls had.</p> 
 <p>→ _→ Someone had already forgotten that she was the youngest girl amongst the group!</p> 
 <p>Whilst everyone was clamouring to try and get close to the male idols, Sheng Jingyang was silently looking at everybody’s mystified expressions. When the camera lens swept towards her, her differing expressions and actions were instantly captured.</p> 
 <p>The cameraman had good reactions, and immediately zoomed in and gave a certain someone a close-up.</p> 
 <p>With the camera panning over, even pausing at her position for an instant, Sheng Jiaoyang couldn’t pretend to not notice even if she wanted to. Tilting her head upwards, her eyes seemed large and bright thanks to the contact lenses that she wore, and the corners of her mouth curled up as she winked at the camera.</p> 
 <p>Through the broadcast, online viewers who’d been ranting about wanting to see the male idols were instantly dazzled by her ‘seductive smile’.</p> 
 <p>[My goosebumps are rising~]</p> 
 <p>[Mummy, my little heart is being snatched away.]</p> 
 <p>[Bitch, she dares to rob the idols rice bowls!!]</p> 
 <p>[Hurry up and tell me, who is she, who is she, who is she?!!]</p> 
 <p>[Suddenly, I feel like an arrow just went through my heart.]</p> 
 <p>…</p> 
 <p>When the camera had panned over to where the contestants were, it was to capture their enraptured expressions and boost the charm of the male idols. Who could’ve expected an anomaly that not only was she unfazed by the male idols’ flashy entrance, she even looked down on the girls who fawned over them. That’s not all, she even dared to—</p> 
 <p>TO. TEASE. OUR. DEAR. AUDIENCE!</p> 
 <p>Cough cough!</p> 
 <p>The director immediately signalled for the main camera to move.</p> 
 <p>Tonight’s main focus are the male idols alright? The contestants could be seen anytime, but not the male idols. Especially if they’re coming as a group!</p> 
 <p>From the view of the cameras, the male idols had different personalities and styles, which satisfied the various tastes of the all ages crowd. In order to establish themselves as a heavyweight variety show, the production team had really spent a lot of money to invite them.</p> 
 <p>The reason the male idols were able to make it tonight was because they just so happened to be filming at a nearby beach. By making an appearance here, they would be able to use their super-high popularity to hype up the atmosphere.</p> 
 <p>There were seven male idols in total. Amongst the seven, Gu Zhou, the Movie Emperor, had been nominated as the best male lead in an overseas movie festival, and so he’d left the country yesterday. There was also a brat, correction, a youth, bursting with vigor who was absent due to his finals being held during these next two days.</p> 
 <p>However, it was good enough that the production team was able to invite five out of the seven of them. Just looking at the activity in the online broadcast chat, and the rapidly increasing view count, was enough to prove the irresistibility of the idols.</p> 
 <p>“Looks like we’re late,” said the eldest, Xu Yinuo, speaking first.</p> 
 <p>“No, you’re not. Our wild party is just beginning.” Zhuo Yiyan poured a few glasses of alcohol and passed them around.</p>
