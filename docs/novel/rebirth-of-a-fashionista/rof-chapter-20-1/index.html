 <p>The first half of the runway presented a slew of high-quality garments. Even if one of the girl’s had a poor aesthetic sense, the quality and style of the clothes could still be expressed should they have a good figure. However, it was a different story altogether for clothes that were bought from wholesale distributors.</p> 
 <p>Cheap things weren’t good enough, while good things weren’t cheap.</p> 
 <p>The clothes must be mass-produced if they were sold at wholesale distributors, and there’s a limit to how well mass-produced goods are made.</p> 
 <p>If someone with a bad fashion sense and style were to wear poor quality clothing with no style, they would only look worse.</p> 
 <p>It looked like Team Luo Yi was going to win tonight without much of a fight from Team Xiao Yang.</p> 
 <p>Almost everyone at the scene had the same thought.</p> 
 <p>The next few models that came on stage confirmed everyone’s speculations. There was no need to even make a comparison, as some of the models from Team Xiao Yang were dressed in attire that was painful to see.</p> 
 <p>As it was evident to everyone that the clothing was randomly selected, the models were instantly decimated by the elegance of Team Luo Yi’s clothing.</p> 
 <p>Why are my eyes always teary? It’s because I’ve been slapped hard by the cruel concept known as reality.</p> 
 <p>The contestants who’d had no choice but to wear the clothes they’d bought from the market in the morning were extremely put out. Regardless of how immaculately they’d done their makeup, it was all rendered useless in the face of their overly-casual runway attire.</p> 
 <p>The location where they’d picked their clothes was already bad enough. Coupled with the ten minute time limit, the task was simply too difficult for anyone to accomplish!</p> 
 <p>In order to be able to choose an entire set of clothes that matched and fit the model in the short span of ten minutes, one must really rely on their good luck.</p> 
 <p>Due to the short duration, the clothing that the models were wearing weren’t at all pleasing to the eyes. Some items were either too tight or too loose, some were too drab in colour, and others were too old-fashioned.</p> 
 <p>The judges had hand cramps from their literary onslaught of bad reviews.</p> 
 <p>Everyone in Team Luo Yi was all smiles; they were revelling in schadenfreude!</p> 
 <p>“Is this the end for their team?” There were some judges that didn’t wish to see anymore.</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan flipped to the back of the participant’s name list. There were three people left; Xu Jiaojiao was the second-last, while Xiao Yang was to follow her.</p> 
 <p>He didn’t know what kind of clothing they’d picked, but he could vaguely conclude that they wouldn’t amount to much judging by the harsh rules. Tonight’s event was intended to make use of a team’s terrible results to highlight the other team’s elegant clothing, advertising them by making use of visual contrast and impact.</p> 
 <p>The third last contender almost completed her catwalk in tears as the zipper at the back of her skirt was unable to be pulled up, awkwardly revealing the small of her back.</p> 
 <p>The judges’ faces turned ugly. Not only was it painful to the eyes if one were to see such unsightly things for too long, it was also uncomfortable being forced to see something that goes against one’s aesthetic senses.</p> 
 <p>While the neon lighting on both sides of the red carpet continued to shine, a beautiful pair of white, slender legs stepped onto the carpet.</p> 
 <p>The cameraman at the main camera took the opportune moment to bring the camera closer, panning it upwards from a long pair of legs wearing clogs, past her black slanted skirt, the gold belt around her waist that accentuated her slender figure, and up to her comparatively looser front-buttoned jacket. Then, it travelled to her slender, beautiful neck, and beyond that…</p> 
 <p>The broadcast screen was instantly flooded with comments from the online viewers.</p> 
 <p>[OMG, too pretty!!!]</p> 
 <p>[Who is she? Who is she?? Who is she???]</p> 
 <p>[Hubby, why are you inside my screen? Hurry up and come out~]</p> 
 <p>[What sort of demon is this? Hurry up and get into my bowl!]</p> 
 <p>[Now licking the screen…]</p> 
 <p>[F*ck, isn’t this breaking the rules?!!]</p> 
 <p>…</p> 
 <p>The judges present were taken aback as well.</p> 
 <p>Even Zhuo Yiyan was entranced by the sight. The girl who was walking over had combed her short hair back in a suave fashion, and her impeccable makeup skills allowed her soft facial features to appear more striking. The robe like skirt didn’t seem out of place due to her belt adding the final touches to her look, giving her a unique disposition. The girl, who was wearing a pair of plain clogs, looked completely ordinary from head to toe. Yet, it was this ordinariness that made her seem modernistic and outstanding.</p> 
 <p>The person who was languidly walking down the runway had used a classic matchup of colours and clothing style, and coupled it with makeup that gave her an androgynous appearance. Altogether she gave off a modernistic beauty that wouldn’t be brought down by cheap clothing.</p>
