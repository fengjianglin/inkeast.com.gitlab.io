 <p>In the past, Lin Na had wanted to return to her Mother’s hometown and take a look around, but she’d been busy with work. Unfortunately, before she was famous, she’d been busy pursuing her dream, and after becoming famous, she’d started a brand with her sisters; personally entering a research lab to develop new aromatherapy techniques. Even now, her schedule for this trip was utterly packed.</p>
 <p>If it wasn’t for her close sister’s accident, she wouldn’t have postponed her itinerary and accepted an invitation to be on this program. But since she had, she wanted to use this as an excuse to see how good this country was that her Little Sun<span id="footnote-ref-380b"><a href="#footnote-380b">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;<span id="footnote-ref-91b7"><a href="#footnote-91b7"></a></span>had bothered to visit and mess around in.</p>
 <p>Watching the girl called Xu Jiaojiao disappear behind the stage curtain, Lin Na slightly opened her red lips and answered Zhuo Yiyan, “She walks on the stage like my past self, and her name is also similar to that of my best friend’s childhood name.” <em>Unfortunately, my Little Sun didn’t have a good body constitution like this Xu Jiaojiao.</em></p>
 <p>“This is probably an excellent example of fate,” Zhuo Yiyan smiled as he responded.</p>
 <p>Lin Na slightly nodded and didn’t speak again.</p>
 <p>The show didn’t take too much more time before it finally finished, and by then, the audience had more or less formed impressions on the contestants. Especially the guest invited by the event organisers; they’d realised that she would undoubtedly play an essential part in the competition.</p>
 <p>Following the runway show, the contestants were divided into two groups.</p>
 <p>Those who’d been assigned to wear a long dress were placed in one group, while the other group was compiled of those who’d worn a short dress.</p>
 <p>“For the next fifteen days, both teams will be placed into training to prepare for the competition. In regards to team captains, we’ve chosen the two who we think will be up to the task after evaluating your performances on the runway. The captain of the long dress team will be Xiao Yang, while the captain of the short dress team will be Luo Yi. Your captains will be responsible for assisting the teacher in charge of discipline within the groups, as well as taking care of other issues. Next, we’ll introduce our special coach who’ll be helping all of you--”</p>
 <p>“Lina!” The host grandly pointed to the side.</p>
 <p>All the contestants whipped their heads over to look in the direction he was pointing. When they saw the tall and beautiful person slowly appear on the stage, all their faces’ contorted into various expressions of surprise.</p>
 <p>In recent years, Lina had become well known as a rising star in the international supermodel community. Since she had the face of an angel, yet the figure of a devil, not only was she successful within the modelling industry, she was also starting to build up a reputation in the film and television industry. Moreover, she’d managed to create a thriving brand in a short period, as well as be acknowledged by the fashion industry for having good taste.</p>
 <p>On top of all this, Lina’s identity as half-Chinese had helped her to catch the attention of Chinese people. Before she’d even come to China to advance her career, she would often appear in their entertainment headlines. There was no one in China who didn’t know her!</p>
 <p>After hearing the host’s shout, Sheng Jiaoyang, who was initially calm, suddenly opened her eyes wide. Quickly whipping her head over to look, she clearly saw the woman who was approaching.</p>
 <p>“Mei Niu!<span id="footnote-ref-beb8"><a href="#footnote-beb8">[2]</a></span>"<span id="footnote-ref-1633"><a href="#footnote-1633"></a></span> She subconsciously blurted out.</p>
 <p>The other contestants started laughing when they heard that.</p>
 <p>The host also couldn’t help laughing, but he immediately felt terrible and hurriedly said, “Miss, even if you’re shocked to see such a beauty, like you’ve caught sight of a celestial being, please calm down, okay?”</p>
 <p>Another burst of laughter echoed around the room.</p>
 <p>Only two people on the stage didn’t laugh. One was Sheng Jiaoyang, and the other was Lin Na.</p>
 <p>When Lin Na had heard that shout of ‘Mei Niu’, she’d almost thought it was her imagination playing tricks on her. But looking at the person who’d called her, she realised it was the girl named Xu Jiaojiao.</p>
 <p>How did she know the secret nickname that was given to her by Little Sun? Or, was it just a coincidence?</p>
 <p>“Lina, please give us a self-introduction!” The host said.</p>
 <p>Lin Na focused on what was happening around her and said flatly, “Hello everyone; I'm Lin Na. Currently, I only have enough time this afternoon to give all of you some pointers; how much you end up learning all depends on yourselves.”</p>
 <p><em>It’s really Mei Niu!</em> Sheng Jiaoyang’s mood improved, and she completely ignored anything more that the host had to say.</p>
 <p>She was eager to rush over, regardless of everything else, and make sure that it was definitely Mei Niu. Then, she wanted to tell her about all the unbelievable experiences that she’d gone through these past few days. Unfortunately, the rational part of her mind was in charge of her body, and she could only stare helplessly as Mei Niu walked off the stage. At the same time, Sheng Jiaoyang found herself moving to follow the other contestants to change clothes.</p>
 <p>“Yang Bao, I really want to be in the same group as you!”</p>
 <p>These words were spoken by a girl who had entered the competition with her best friend. Currently, the two girls were embracing in the dressing room, looking like a pair of lovers unwilling to part.</p>
 <p>As the other contestants walked past, they looked at the pair with strange gazes and felt that they were a bit too dramatic. Although they had now been split into two teams, both groups would be together during training. So, there was no need for the pair to act as if they were being separated.</p>
 <p>“Alright, now quickly go change your clothes. In the future, we’ll still be training together; it doesn’t matter if we’re not in the same group, right?” Xiao Yang comforted the girl in her arms.</p>
 <p>“Mhm, wait for me after you’re done changing clothes. Let’s go to the training room together.”</p>
 <p>“Okay!”</p>
 <p>Once Xiao Yang had found her locker, she noticed that the girl standing next to her was the one who everyone had just laughed at. So, deciding to take the initiative, she greeted her. “Hey, I’m Xiao Yang. I feel like you’re a little familiar!”</p>
 <p>“You were in front of me when you at the competition registration.”</p>
 <p>“Aah, yeah, I remember you! You seem to like Lina very much; you couldn’t take your eyes off her when she was on stage. Is she your idol?”</p>
 <p>“No,” Sheng Jiaoyang quickly changed her clothes and turned around to leave the dressing room.</p>
 <p>Another girl next to them curled her lips in disdain as she said, “Heh, so arrogant! You’re just a country bumpkin, and yet you dared to call out to Lina like that.”</p>
 <p>Xiao Yang chuckled before saying, “We should quickly change our clothes and go to the training room!”</p>
