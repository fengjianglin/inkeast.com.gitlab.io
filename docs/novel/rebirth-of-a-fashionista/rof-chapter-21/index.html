 <p>“Are you certain she’s from that team?!”</p> 
 <p>“I’m positive.” Zhuo Yiyan heard Guiliana’s exclamation and chuckled.</p> 
 <p>The contestants who’d finished their runway stood together, and they were taken by surprise when they laid eyes on the approaching Sheng Jiaoyang. Despite having met her inside the house, Sheng Jiaoyang seemed to be more imposing when she walked down the neon-illuminated carpet, which caused her gender to become even more indiscernible.</p> 
 <p>Those in her team: <em>Is she the same person who went with us to the market to choose her clothes?</em></p> 
 <p><em>Why was it that their clothes were instantly outed as low-quality goods, while Xu Jiaojiao was able to raise the quality of her clothing into seemingly high-end products?</em> Under the illumination, the black outfit appeared sleek and dazzling, and those not in the know would think that her clothes were made out of expensive materials.</p> 
 <p>If Sheng Jiaoyang hadn’t been followed by a cameraman while she was choosing her clothes, everyone present would probably suspect that she’d known the rules beforehand and had asked someone to prepare everything and wait for her in the market.</p> 
 <p>The terrible clothes from the previous models earlier seemed to have been prepared for her, so that she would stand out with the stark visual contrast. Sheng Jiaoyang’s appearance was like a street cleaner that cleansed the sand and dust in her path, returning clarity and cleansing the eyes of the audience.</p> 
 <p>“Wasn’t what she bought a sleeping gown for men…” the cameraman, who’d filmed Sheng Jiaoyang, mumbled to himself.</p> 
 <p>“Is she really wearing pyjamas?!” someone exclaimed after hearing the cameraman’s murmurs.</p> 
 <p>Others looked at the amazed bumpkin with condescending looks. What a pumpkin! There were so many people who walked down red carpets in pyjamas in this day and age, so why should you care about what she’s wearing? It’s alright if it's pretty!</p> 
 <p>“Xu Jiaojiao? I remember her. Her previous runway walk was too rigid, so I didn’t have much of a good impression then. She’s really changed a lot in the past week,” Guiliana said with an astounded look on her face.</p> 
 <p>The corners of Zhuo Yiyan’s mouth curled upwards slightly. If his judgement was poor, the past him would have already been beaten up by others a long time ago thanks to his antagonistic nature. This proves that once again, Zhuo Yiyan had a knack for talent spotting.</p> 
 <p>“This contestant is really remarkable to be able to appear so fashionable in cheap clothes. I’m giving her nine points; I’ll take away one point so that she won’t get too cocky.” Another judge piped in.</p> 
 <p>“I heard that the clothes and look were personally picked by the contestants themselves. This girl is smart, being able to exhibit her creativity so that she would stand out. It looks like she was able to pull it off successfully.”</p> 
 <p>“That is also a talent in itself.”</p> 
 <p>“Eh? This contender isn’t yet eighteen?” A judge took notice of her particulars in the namelist. “She’s still so young!”</p> 
 <p>“But she acts like a veteran! There’s no sign of immaturity in her at all.”</p> 
 <p>The judges engaged in fervent discussion, merely glancing at the last contestant and absentmindedly scoring her before continuing their earlier discussion.</p> 
 <p>The programme director noticed the situation, and hurriedly waved to Zhuo Yiyan to signal him.</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan nodded slightly before turning to speak to the judges, “Now that all of the contestants are here, would the judges please say a few words so that they’ll be able to improve?”</p> 
 <p>The judges stopped discussing amongst themselves and took turns to give their comments, praising a few contestants who were exceptional. Of course, Sheng Jiaoyang was one of those who was praised lavishly.</p> 
 <p>When the judges were done with their review, Zhuo Yiyan opened the champagne and began to pour it.</p> 
 <p>Once the mountain of wine glasses were all filled with champagne, everyone present took a glass.</p> 
 <p>“Cheers!” Zhuo Yiyan raised his glass to toast.</p> 
 <p>“We’re not going back till we’re drunk tonight!”</p> 
 <p>All of a sudden, the sound of car horns could be heard outside the courtyard.</p> 
 <p>As everyone turned towards the entrance, a few figures entered with the lights at their backs.</p> 
 <p>As they approached, the contestants erupted into an uproar.</p> 
 <p>“AHHHHHHH!!! God!!!!!”</p> 
 <p>“Qi An, it’s really Qi An!!!!”</p> 
 <p>“WTF, I actually get to see Xu Yinuo in the flesh!”</p> 
 <p>“Ye Fan, Jiang Liqing, Xu Yinuo, Qi An, and Zhou Zhiyu. The Five Gods are all here. Oh my god, the production team are so good to us!”</p> 
 <p>“AHHHHHHHHH!!!”</p> 
 <p>Excitement was high amongst the girls. If it weren’t for the fact that they had to take their image into account, they would have jumped at the guys a long time ago.</p>
