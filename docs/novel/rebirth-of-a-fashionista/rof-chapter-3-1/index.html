 <p>The next day, Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t go to her Uncle’s home with Xu Qing. Instead, she said that one of her classmates was looking for her to discuss something, and asked Xu Qing for a little money before going out.</p>
 <p>After checking for some information online, Sheng Jiaoyang went straight to the registration location.</p>
 <p>In contrast to an online registration, registering on-site was more direct. When registering in-person, there were staff on-hand that would measure the applicants three measurements of bust, waist, and hips, as well as their height and weight. If those results were acceptable, the applicant would next move on to an interview session. Finally, if they’d managed to pass the interview, they would then be able to participate in the competition. Compared to that, the online registration process was more cumbersome. After filling in their information, the applicant would have to wait for the system to check through their qualifications, and after that, they would then advance to video interviews. Once they’d passed the video interview stage, they would then have to book in a time to visit the registration location to be measured. Only if the results of the measurements and the registration information were approved, could they then participate in the competition.</p>
 <p>The registration location was in a newer part of the city, while Sheng Jiaoyang lived in one of the older areas of the city. Fortunately, there were subway stations near where she had to go. Other than yesterday, when she’d left Central Hospital with Xu Qing, Sheng Jiaoyang had never before taken a bus. Because it was a novelty to her, she’d observed them very carefully. Therefore, even though it was now her first time taking a bus alone, she wasn’t at all confused.</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang first took a bus to the nearest subway station, and then switched to a train to travel the rest of the way to the registration location.</p>
 <p>It was only nine a.m in the morning; however, there were already a lot of people lining up to fill in their information at the registration desk. This might have been because today was the last day to register for the competition.</p>
 <p>All those waiting in line to register were young, beautiful, tall girls; with their hair, makeup, and clothes all carefully selected to show themselves off in the best possible light. Two girls had evidently come together and were now excitedly chatting with thick Northeast accents.</p>
 <p>“Oh my god, I’m so excited! Yang Bao, what do you think; will I pass?” As the queue gradually moved forward, a tall girl with slightly above average looks nervously asked a girl standing next to her.</p>
 <p>“Certainly! Just relax,” The girl called Yang Bao raised her hand and made an encouraging gesture.</p>
 <p>As Sheng Jiaoyang watched the interactions between the two girls, the corners of her mouth slightly curled upwards. She’d also had a best friend; a beautiful girl who would be there to laugh and cry with her. The two of them had done many crazy things together.</p>
 <p>When she thought of how their identities were so different now; like heaven and earth, she somewhat regretted her decision to return to her birth country. If she hadn’t returned home, then maybe at this moment she would still be enjoying her life as the Eldest Miss. She would be able to window-shop with Mei Niu, ogle guys...cough...and even if it meant that she would experience heartbreak, it didn’t matter. She was just unable to understand; why at that time had she insisted on returning home to fight with the stupid people of the Sheng family?</p>
 <p>Oh alright, to be honest, at that time she’d thought that she was unhappy and had wanted to find something that would please her. Then, she’d thought of the Sheng family’s mother and daughter pair who’d viciously ruined her reputation. She knew she was different from the her of the past; she wasn’t the same girl who was unable to stand against her Stepmother’s tricks, leaving her no choice but to go and live abroad with her Grandfather. Therefore, how could she have tolerated letting them live a comfortable life?</p>
 <p>If you’re filled with hatred or resentment; take revenge.</p>
 <p>The beginning of her revenge went pretty smoothly as before she’d even had a chance to do anything, her good Younger Sister’s sweetheart had confessed his love to her. When he’d confessed she was shocked; she hadn’t expected that her prey would unexpectedly take the initiative and send himself straight to her door. At that time, Sheng Shiyun’s embarrassed and pained face had made Sheng Jiaoyang feel rather pleased.</p>
 <p>Sheng Shiyun had probably never thought that Sheng Jiaoyang, who’d been wrongfully discredited and was treated like a vile person by the people who were jealous of her success, would be able to easily steal her sweetheart.</p>
 <p>Of course, Sheng Shiyun would never accept this kind of humiliation. Taking advantage of her birthday, she’d invited her sweetheart to her party and then secretly had photos taken that could make a person easily misunderstand the situation. Next, she’d sent those photos to Sheng Jiaoyang.</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang had just finished taking an exam, and because she had free time and was bored, she’d decided to drive to where this ‘adulterous’ couple was; thinking of exposing Sheng Shiyun’s cheap trick.</p>
 <p>Subsequently…</p>
 <p>She’d then become Xu Jiaojiao.</p>
 <p>Over the years she’d taken excellent care of her body, all so that she could live like a healthy person. Who would've guessed that such a situation would be too stimulating and result in her collapsing? Only a few people had known about her disease. When she’d been born, her Mother had concealed her illness from everyone. No one knew the reason why, but her Mother had even hidden it from her Father.</p>
 <p>After Sheng Jiaoyang’s eighth birthday, her Mother had passed away. Then, only about two or three months later, she’d found out that her Father had been hiding a mistress and her daughter. Once she’d found out, she’d taken to venting her frustrations on the mother and daughter pair. What no one expected though, was that after Sheng Jiaoyang had pushed the mistress, it caused her to have a miscarriage! Apparently, the mistress had been around two months pregnant. After this accident, Sheng Jiaoyang’s Father had brought that mother and daughter pair back with him to live in their home. In less than two years, after numerous incidents had occurred, Sheng Jiaoyang became known as a vicious girl who was scolded by everyone. It was at this time that her maternal Grandfather took her with him to go live abroad.</p>
 <p>As Sheng Jiaoyang grew older, her experiences and knowledge increased to the point that when she’d recalled her youth in her birth country, she’d realised that many suspicious circumstances were surrounding that time in her life. Now that she’d experienced those things she would never again fall for that woman’s traps; where each mistake would lead to another.</p>
 <p>“Do you see the form on the screen? First fill it in, making sure that you fill in the required sections. Now, please hand me your ID card so that I can check it, and after it’s been checked, you can head over to the testing area for the next step,” A hand stretched out from behind the computer, pointing to a desk diagonally across from the registration area.</p>
 <p>Since it was currently her turn, Sheng Jiaoyang returned from her thoughts and took out her ID card. Quickly sweeping her gaze over the details written on it, she handed the card over and then moved the mouse to fill in the form.</p>
 <p>Just after she’d entered her name, the staff member behind the desk called out to her to get her attention, “Ah, that’s wrong. Your name on the ID card is Xu Jiaojiao, yet you wrote Sheng Jiaoyang. Are you not the actual person on this ID card?”</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang momentarily froze, and then, without a change in her expression said, “Oh, I just had my name changed and I’m not used to it yet.” Taking back the ID card, she filled in the section for ID numbers and other personal information before passing the ID card back to the staff member.</p>
 <p>After checking all of the information, the staff member scanned the ID card and attached the copy to her form. Once the ID card was returned, he then stared at the photo on the copy of the ID card and murmured suspiciously, “Is that really her?”</p>
 <p>The corners of Sheng Jiaoyang’s mouth turned down; she really wanted to say that she wasn’t the person in the photo.</p>
