 <p>Hey readers!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wonderful news!<strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">Bone Painting Coroner&nbsp;</span></strong>is back!!! Our EXCEPTIONAL novel lead, <strong>Choufleur</strong>, will be releasing <strong>3 chapters a week, between Friday to Sunday</strong>!! The BPC team has been gradually expanding so that they can post more frequently.

 <p style="margin-left: 20px;"><em>Ji Yunshu was an outstanding anthropologist who was transmigrated into the body of a mistreated young girl. To survive in her new circumstances, she could only rely on her wits and the knowledge she had accumulated in her...</em></p>

<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Another toast was proposed.</p> 
 <p>After the toast, the contestants clamoured for the chance to get closer to the five male idols.</p> 
 <p>Whatever it was, if they were able to become familiar with the male idols, there might be a possibility that they’d be lent a helping hand. If all else fails, the contestants might still be able to enjoy a bit of exposure from the resultant rumours that may arise.</p> 
 <p>The top three winners of the previous national supermodel competition also joined in the race to be in front.</p> 
 <p>Noticing the situation, the production team hurriedly brought forward the dance event and invited the five idols to choose their partners in the form of a lottery.</p> 
 <p>With five extremely popular male idols present, in that instant, it seemed like Zhuo Yiyan didn’t exist at all.</p> 
 <p>Guiliana laughed at him. “Look at you, you seem out of favour now!”</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan just smiled, he didn’t care about Guiliana’s comment. The contestants weren’t anyone dear to him, and it was their freedom to choose who they wanted to go for. He wouldn’t feel left out over something like this.</p> 
 <p>“Hey?” Guiliana cried out in bewilderment. “She’s so unconcerned that she can eat?!”</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan followed Guiliana’s line of sight. <em>That person at the table over there, who’s eating dessert with gusto, isn’t that Xu Jiaojiao?</em></p> 
 <p>This little girl…</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan broke into laughter. Truthfully speaking, he was quite curious about what sort of environment the girl had grown up in, as he didn’t know what kind of circumstances would nurture such a peculiar person. When he was young, he’d had a unique opinion of fashion and beauty. Most importantly, she wasn’t at all behaving like a love-struck fool.</p> 
 <p>If Sheng Jiaoyang knew what Zhuo Yiyan was thinking, she would’ve definitely snorted at him. <em>Nonsense! She would scare even herself if she started fangirling. Eh, it seems like she’d revealed something unnecessary about herself…</em></p> 
 <p>“Which one is Xu Jiaojiao?” Xu Yinuo, the first person to draw a name from the lottery asked after opening the slip of paper and looking at the name written inside.</p> 
 <p>“Wow, Jiaojiao was chosen. Jiaojiao—” Wang Wei cried out in extreme excitement.</p> 
 <p>Only then did the other girls realise that there was one person missing.</p> 
 <p>When they looked around and saw Sheng Jiaoyang standing at the food table struggling to swallow a cookie shoved into her mouth while holding a fork on the fruit plate, they didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.</p> 
 <p><em>This girl was filled with confidence!</em></p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, hurry up and come here; you’re so lucky to be selected by Prince Charming Xu! Soon, you two will need to inaugurate the party with the first dance!”</p> 
 <p>Listening to Wang Wei speaking as if she’d won a prize, Sheng Jiaoyang silently swallowed the rest of the cookie in her mouth.</p> 
 <p><em>Thank you! But, can I refuse?</em></p> 
 <p>Of course, she could only refuse in her heart. She was now only a poor girl who had no power. In other people’s opinion, it was a blessing to have a big star pick you as a partner. If she dared to refuse, then that would mean she was unable to differentiate good from bad.</p> 
 <p>Under everyone’s envious and jealous gazes, Sheng Jiaoyang walked slowly to Xu Yinuo’s side.</p> 
 <p>“Brother Nuo, the two of you can form a father and daughter combination, haha!” Ye Fan teased.</p> 
 <p>Xu Yinuo smiled gently, and said, “Had I married early, my child would be around her age now.”</p> 
 <p>“Alright, it's Qi An’s turn to draw.”</p> 
 <p>“Ahhhhhhh! Idol, you have to pick me!!!” The girls who were unable to hold back anymore began to squeal.</p> 
 <p><em>Why did it seem like they were fighting over who would obtain the emperor’s token?</em> Sheng Jiaoyang pursed her lips.</p> 
 <p>Qi An paused as he went to pick a name, and with a gaze as light as a feather, he glanced in disapproval at Sheng Jiaoyang.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang blinked her eyes innocently. The person who’d accidentally taken the words out of his mouth wasn’t her!</p> 
 <p>“Qi Hua,” Qi An opened the paper and read out a name.</p> 
 <p>“Is it me? Is it really me?” Qi Hua was particularly excited, as she’d finally found an opportunity to stand out.</p> 
 <p>“It seems like I read it wrong,” Qi An said with a deadpan look.</p> 
 <p>In that instant, Qi Hua’s complexion changed greatly. She’d clearly heard Qi An read out her name.</p> 
 <p>“I’m just teasing you.” Qi An’s lips raised in a smile.</p> 
 <p>The contestants were taken aback; their idol seemed to be different from the cold and aloof image that they’d imagined…</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang giggled. Qi An’s personality quite suited her taste.</p> 
 <p>Seeing that Sheng Jiaoyang was laughing, Qi Hua’s complexion darkened.</p> 
 <p><em>What are you laughing at? What’s so funny? Didn’t you get chosen by an old man? What are you so proud of?!</em></p> 
 <p>Qi Hua walked quickly to Qi An’s side. Sniffing the faint scent of perfume emanating from the person beside her, she finally felt content. <em>What’s so good about an old man? She was the lucky one! Qi An had chosen her, and he had the best background amongst all of the idols!</em></p> 
 <p>Following that, Zhou Zhiyu, Jiang Liqing, and Ye Fan each selected a dance partner.</p>
