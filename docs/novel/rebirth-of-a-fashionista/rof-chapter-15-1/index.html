 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang’s current state wasn’t at its best. Her body lacked any experience with exercise, and her muscles were weak. The training plan given out by the Fitness Instructors hadn’t even been one third completed, yet she was already incredibly exhausted. Compared to some of the contestants who you could tell regularly exercised with just one look, she was totally inadequate.</p> 
 <p>However, there was one thing she had that others couldn’t compare with, and that was her youthful body and her ability to recover many times faster than the older contestants. At the moment, she may be so tired that she couldn’t even move a finger, but in just a few minutes, her energy would start to slowly recover until she was once again lively and full of vigor.</p> 
 <p>Sometimes, when she felt that she couldn’t go on anymore, she would recall the condition of her past body.</p> 
 <p>The past her used to think that she would never be able to exercise. Many of her friends who were unaware of her condition had always tried to lure her out to play extreme sports with them. The her at that time had been so tempted, but she could only find clever excuses to reject them. This had resulted in people thinking that she was somewhat of a chicken.</p> 
 <p>Skydiving, gliding, skiing, surfing…Sheng Jiaoyang had wanted to try everything, but she couldn’t! She’d had to be responsible and consider her family and friends.</p> 
 <p>The only thing that she’d ever indulged in was driving, and she’d even ended up failing that.</p> 
 <p>Now that she had a healthy body, it would be a waste if she didn’t train it properly. She still want to try everything that she’d missed with her old body, so how could she give up such a good opportunity to try exercising.</p> 
 <p>With such a thought in her mind, her spirit became extremely excited. The physical fatigue she was feeling wouldn’t stop her from sticking to her beliefs.</p> 
 <p>Sweats soaked her clothes and short-hair. Her appearance would normally be considered embarrassing, but her eyes, which were usually foggy when she wasn’t wearing glasses, were now as bright as stars. In that moment, they were filled with an unwavering determination and a longing for a better future.</p> 
 <p>Without any complaints, she completed the exercises set out by the Fitness Instructors, differentiating her from other the contestants that had been intentionally, and unintentionally, carrying on like pork chops. Her forbearance and persistence, which were unlike those of other girls her age, had caught the attention of the trainers who were struggling to supervise the training of the other contestants.</p> 
 <p>They were training during the day in the gym, and as evening fell, the two teams were taken out by the coaches to jog along the beach. After a day of training, all the contestants were extremely exhausted, and the dinner prepared by the program’s crew wasn’t enough to fill up their stomachs. Once dinner was finished, everyone washed their clothes, then returned to their respective rooms to rest.</p> 
 <p>This intense training continued for a week, and it was so tiring that the people who normally liked to cause trouble didn’t have the energy to plot anything. The atmosphere in villa became harmonious.</p> 
 <p>The greetings of the exhausted girls when they got up every morning went something like this:</p> 
 <p>“Are your legs feeling sore today?”</p> 
 <p>Such hellish training resulted in almost everyone losing weight, and for the few of them who were originally thin, they were now so thin that they appeared anorexic.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was one of those who looked slightly too thin, and the baby fat on her cheeks had disappeared. However, although she looked thinner, her weight hadn’t actually changed. She appeared thinner because her skin was tightening, her waist had narrowed, and her collarbone could vaguely be seen.</p> 
 <p>Of course, these achievements were related to her positive attitude. She complied to every one of the coach’s commands when training, and she was no longer picky about taking supplements. With some of the contestants losing weight daily, she’d managed to avoid losing weight to the point of looking sickly.</p> 
 <p>On the last day, the coaches fairly scored the contestants’ performance and training results, and this score would be included in the final evaluation.</p> 
 <p>In these past few days, everyone had more or less complained that the coaches were too harsh, but when they reached the end of their training, everyone was reluctant to part with them.</p> 
 <p>The night before, the two teams had gathered together to discuss giving a gift to the coaches, but all they’d brought with them were women’s products. They couldn’t go out shopping, and they couldn’t give money either. Ultimately, they unanimously decided to give the coaches a farewell party.</p> 
 <p>The two team Leaders, on behalf of the team members, went to find the program’s crew. They then persuaded the crew to provide the ingredients and kitchen utensils that they needed.</p> 
 <p>As a veteran of the dark underbelly of the food industry, Sheng Jiaoyang consciously stayed away from the kitchen. Unfortunately, nobody was willing to let her slip away, so the important task of organising the beverages fell to her. This was something that had gained her the limelight from the very first day she’d come to the villa.</p> 
 <p>Everyone divided the work equally, and then they spent the afternoon preparing the food. All kinds of dishes, from chinese style to western style, were spread over the long table.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang had prepared a simple and tasty cocktail. When everyone’s wine glasses clinked together, it seemed that the misunderstandings and tension within the group had ended, and the room filled with laughter.</p> 
 <p>However, after the coaches had left, everyone felt depressed. Some of the contestants even cried while holding their wine glass in their hand.</p> 
 <p>“I don’t know what’s waiting for us tomorrow. These past few days, everyone has been training hard, so let's go to bed early today!” Luo Yi said as she stood up.</p> 
 <p>“No, I still want to drink. Xu Jiaojiao, give me another glass!” Qi Hua was the first to disagree. She extended her empty glass to Sheng Jiaoyang and spoke in a commanding tone.</p> 
 <p>“Forget it, Jiaojiao made a lot of cocktails today, and she is also tired,” someone said in Sheng Jiaoyang’s defence.</p> 
 <p>“Yeah, it’s late now anyway. Let’s go to bed early!”</p> 
 <p>Because of their budding friendship with Luo Yi and Pu Mingyu, the other contestants had realised that the matter concerning Sheng Jiaoyang being alone with Zhuo Yiyan was just slander started by Qi Hua. These days, Sheng Jiaoyang’s behaviour hadn’t seemed finicky at all, and coupled with being able to drink a cocktail made by Sheng Jiaoyang, quite a lot of people weren’t against her anymore.</p> 
 <p>Of course, Qi Hua was unaware of this. She only knew that the girls who shared a room with her were now speaking on Xu Jiaojiao’s behalf. She suddenly felt a fierce rage well up within her, and slapping the table as she stood up, she shouted, “Shut up!”</p> 
 <p>“It’s you who should shut up! I hope that tomorrow you won’t claim to have a hangover from drinking my cocktail,” after saying that, Sheng Jiaoyang got up and leisurely headed upstairs.</p> 
 <p>“Xu Jiaojiao, what did you just say?! Stop right there--”</p> 
 <p>Qi Hua’s sharp voice echoed throughout the dining room, but none of the contestants paid her any attention. One by one, they went back to their rooms to wash up, and sleep.</p>
