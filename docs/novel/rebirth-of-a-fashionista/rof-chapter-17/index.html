 <p>“What is Xu Jiaojiao doing?! She knew the answer, yet instead of telling us secretly, she had to go and say it loudly. Doesn’t this means that we just gave Luo Yi’s team a point?” someone complained.</p> 
 <p>Xiao Yang quickly disagreed. “Xu Jiaojiao didn’t deliberately do it.”</p> 
 <p>“Sure, as far as we can see she didn’t deliberately do it, but she still did it. Who doesn’t know that she and Luo Yi are close?” that person continued angrily.</p> 
 <p>Although they’d lowered their voices while speaking, the projection room was large, and they’d all been sitting near each other when answering the questions. It would’ve been easy for the other team to hear their discussions.</p> 
 <p>“What’s the deal? It’s just one question!” Wang Wei pursed her lips.</p> 
 <p>“What’s with the ‘just one question’?! We’re now behind by one point!! Don’t you want to win?”</p> 
 <p>This girl was so fired up that her voice gradually escalated until everyone in the room could hear her.</p> 
 <p>“Please be quiet. Now, I'll start the second video,” Zhuo Yiyan glanced indifferently at the girl who was quarrelling over something so small.</p> 
 <p>Wang Wei was pleased as she glanced at the girl who was left with no choice but to shut up, then turned to Xu Jiaojiao and caught a fleeting smile on the other party’s mouth. She blinked, but by the time she’d opened her eyes it was no more, and she thought she’d just imagined it. If it was herself that everyone had complained about, she wouldn’t be able to smile.</p> 
 <p>Following this, she discovered that the girl beside her, who was a few years younger than her, was really amazing.</p> 
 <p>One question after another, as long as Xu Jiaojiao opened her mouth to answer, her responses would definitely be accurate. It was as if she’d created those questions herself.</p> 
 <p>Every time Xu Jiaojiao answered, her voice wasn’t too loud, yet it wasn’t quiet either. Instead, it was just loud enough for Luo Yi to overhear.</p> 
 <p>One could see that Luo Yi was also quite trusting when it came to Xu Jiaojiao’s answers. After hearing her answer, Luo Yi would immediately change the answer her team had discussed. While Xiao Yang, on the other hand, was the opposite. There were two times where even though she’d heard Xu Jiaojiao’s answer, she had thought her own answer was correct. Now, Luo Yi’s team was ahead by three points.</p> 
 <p>The girl who’d complained about Xu Jiaojiao before was now even more infuriated, but no matter what she said, Xu Jiaojiao would only reply with one sentence.</p> 
 <p>“I’ve already lowered my volume when I speak, but who can blame me for having such a loud voice?”</p> 
 <p>Wang Wei was a little anxious as she watched Luo Yi’s team gaining an advantage, but, when she heard Xu Jiaojiao’s shameless words said with a nonchalant expression, she had the urge to stretch out her claws to ravage that little face.</p> 
 <p>How could a person be so hateful?</p> 
 <p>“Hahaha, Luo Yi, you see that woman? Xu Jiaojiao has angered her almost to the point of insanity,” Pu Mingyu whispered with a laugh as she nudged Luo Yi.</p> 
 <p>“Serves her right!” Luo Yi snorted and smiled.</p> 
 <p>“I think that Jiaojiao is doing it on purpose,” Pu Mingyu said.</p> 
 <p>“Yes.” Luo Yi smiled. “It’s intentional.”</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao’s personality is pretty interesting. They’d said that she was doing it intentionally, so she must now be doing it on purpose to spite them. Xiao Yang and her team members must be regretting it now.”</p> 
 <p>Luo Yi could see that Xiao Yang really did regret it. Xu Jiaojiao acted harmless, but she refused to be wrongfully accused. The more you confronted her, the more you were humiliated and would disregard the consequences.</p> 
 <p>In actual fact, Xiao Yang should’ve known this already. Just take Qi Hua for example. In the beginning, everyone had disliked Xu Jiaojiao, but over this last week, none of the other contestants had seen her create a ruckus. Everyone’s impression of her had greatly improved, and they’d all started feeling like Qi Hua’s personality was the bad one instead. In just one week, the person who was being isolated had reversed.</p> 
 <p>Although, Xiao Yang wasn’t entirely to blame, as who would’ve thought that Xu Jiaojiao would know so much at such a young age. Someone else in her position probably wouldn’t pay too much attention to Xu Jiaojiao either.</p> 
 <p>Thinking this way, Xiao Yang came to a decision, and stretching her body, she kindly said, “Jiaojiao, there’s one final video. If we can get three points from it, we’ll still have a chance to win against Luo Yi’s team. So, if you know the answer, can you only tell us? If our team wins, you’ll also get the reward!”</p> 
 <p>“That’s right, Jiaojiao, whether we can win it depends on you!” Having witnessed everything so far, Wang Wei, who was sitting beside Sheng Jiaoyang, now believed in her knowledge.</p> 
 <p>The other team members looked hopefully at Sheng Jiaoyang, and even the girl who’d previously complained clamped her mouth this time.</p> 
 <p>No one wanted to lose. If they did, what would they be doing participating in this competition?</p>
