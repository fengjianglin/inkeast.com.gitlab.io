 <p>The music started.</p> 
 <p>Xu Yinuo slightly bent towards Sheng Jiaoyang, and like a gentleman, he reached out his hand.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at him and took his hand before following him into the circle.</p> 
 <p>“Do you know how to dance, little girl?” Xi Yinuo asked as he smiled.</p> 
 <p>A corner of Sheng Jiaoyang’s lips twitched. Little girl?</p> 
 <p>“Since you called me little girl, do you want me to call you uncle?” Sheng Jiaoyang tilted her head and replied with a question of her own.</p> 
 <p>Xu Yinuo stared blankly at her for a moment before laughing. Although he was fifty years old, with streaks of grey hair, his laugh still could topple all living beings. When he was younger, he was known as a handsome man who could attract thousands of women. Now, while the years may have eroded his young face, it had also given him a gentle personality.</p> 
 <p>He always laughed, but at that moment, everyone could see that he was truly happy.</p> 
 <p>“Then, I’ll call you Jiaojiao. You don’t mind, right?”</p> 
 <p>“Suit yourself.”</p> 
 <p>Compared to the other partners, this combination with the biggest age gap was indeed very harmonious. Discerning people could see that the couple were comfortable with their conversation. At least, the smile on Xu Yinuo’s face never went missing, and sometimes, he laughed heartily.</p> 
 <p>Qi Hua, who’d spoken for the sixth time and only received a reply such as “hmm” and “oh”, was inwardly irritable and ready to crumble. After dancing, Qi An resumed his cold face and ignored her enthusiastic attempt at conversation.</p> 
 <p>Compared to them, Xu Yinuo and Xu Jiaojiao were like friends despite the difference in age. It could be heard from their occasional conversation that Xu Yinuo was the one who was taking the initiative to talk.</p> 
 <p>Qi Hua almost ground her teeth in frustration.</p> 
 <p>The ‘father and daughter combination’ were completely relaxed as they conversed.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, I presume you’ve never heard my song, right?”</p> 
 <p>“My Mother really likes your song.”</p> 
 <p>“Can you sing my song then?”</p> 
 <p>“I’m tone deaf.” Sheng Jiaoyang laughed before continuing, “But, my Father sang your song, ‘White Haired Promise’ well. He sang that song to chase after my Mother.”</p> 
 <p>“I didn’t expect that one of my songs could contribute to such a good story. It seems like your Mother really likes my song. Next time I have a concert I’ll definitely invite you.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was silent for two seconds before answering, “Good.”</p> 
 <p>Xu Yinuo’s brows rose. He felt that the mood of the girl before his eyes had suddenly dropped, but why?</p> 
 <p>When the song ended, the god-like idols once again drew a dance partner from the rest of the list.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang silently went to the side and looked up at the stars in the sky.</p> 
 <p>Amongst the group of party people, there was a lonely person.</p> 
 <p>“Homesick?” came a voice from behind her.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang recovered her expression, and she turned to see Zhuo Yiyan approaching.</p> 
 <p>“I’m drunk. Can I return to my room and rest first?”</p> 
 <p>“Sure.”</p> 
 <p>Upon receiving a reply, Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t say anything further, and left to return to the villa.</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan looked up at the sky. The night sky was dotted with just a few stars, and it appeared to be very lonely.</p>
