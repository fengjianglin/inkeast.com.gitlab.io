 <p>After the game was over, Zhuo Yiyan led everyone to a bus specially prepared for the show.</p> 
 <p>In the bus, most of the contestants were discussing what the reward would be, while some were those who’d lost the game and were unwilling to admit defeat. There were also a couple of people who had good relationships with each other chatting together. Only a few people were sitting silently.</p> 
 <p>So, the bus was actually quite noisy.</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan didn’t say anything. The contestants had stayed in the villa for the last week, so it was understandable that they’d get excited over a rare chance to go out.</p> 
 <p>“Teacher Zhuo, where are we going?” the girl who was sitting near him asked.</p> 
 <p>“I’ll tell you when we get there,” Zhuo Yiyan answered mysteriously.</p> 
 <p>“Why is it so mysterious? Won’t you give us a hint?”</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan laughed, and said, “It’s to do with the party tonight.”</p> 
 <p>“But, isn’t the party being held in the garden? Where else are we going?”</p> 
 <p>“You’ll naturally know when you get there,” Zhuo Yiyan cryptically responded.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang, sitting in the back, couldn’t help but chuckle.</p> 
 <p>Luo Yi, who occupied the sought after position next to Sheng Jiaoyang, asked, “Jiaojiao, you wouldn’t know where we’re going, would you?”</p> 
 <p>“You can think of it with just your big toe. We must be going to choose an evening dress.”</p> 
 <p>“Arghh, my big toe was shot!” as she said that, Luo Yi was clasping her chest, displaying an expression of being unjustly attacked.</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan raised an eyebrow, and turning his body to look at Sheng Jiaoyang at the back of the bus, teasingly said, “If I wasn’t so sure that we hadn’t told anyone about our itinerary, I would really think that you were one of the staff.”</p> 
 <p>“You mean, Jiaojiao guessed right?” Luo Yi asked, her eyes wide open in shock.</p> 
 <p>“Woah~ Choosing an evening dress? Really?” they all successively exclaimed in surprise.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao really knows how to make an impact, she even gave you all a nice surprise,” Zhuo Yiyan sighed as he forced a smile.</p> 
 <p>“What can I do? I'm a straightforward person, after all,” Sheng Jiaoyang pushed her glasses higher up her nose and said calmly.</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, you’re constantly changing my view of you,” Luo Yi sighed. “From the first day of training, I had the impression that you weren’t an ordinary girl. You look soft and delicate, but you’re the complete opposite. I didn’t see you utter a single complaint during our bitter training days. Moreover, how did you train your brain to be so intelligent? Today’s freaking questions almost drove me crazy, but you easily answered everything.”</p> 
 <p>“Jiaojiao, in school, you were definitely a top student, right?” Pu Mingyu asked as she leaned towards Luo Yi and Sheng Jiaoyang from her seat across the aisle.</p> 
 <p>“Right, I keep forgetting to ask! Jiaojiao, you should still be in high school, right?” Luo Yi asked curiously.</p> 
 <p>“I just graduated,” Sheng Jiaoyang replied.</p> 
 <p>“Oh, so that means you just finished the university entrance examinations. Tell us, which university you are admitted to? We might be future schoolmates!” Luo Yi inquired.</p> 
 <p>“F University.”</p> 
 <p>“As expected of a top student!” Pu Mingyu said in admiration while lamenting her own inadequacies.</p> 
 <p>“What will you choose to major in?” Zhuo Yiyan asked, his interest peaked.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang tilted her head, and uttered two words. “Wanna guess?”</p> 
 <p>Zhuo Yiyan was speechless.</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang was in a good mood, and decided not to keep everyone in suspense. “I’m going to be majoring in English.”</p> 
 <p>“I think your English is very good. From the game before I can see that you’re quite familiar with foreign big-name brands. It seems that you usually spend time understanding other cultures.”</p> 
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang smiled but said nothing. She couldn’t tell Luo Yi that it was only because she’d spent all her time shopping that she’d come to know those big-name brands.</p>
