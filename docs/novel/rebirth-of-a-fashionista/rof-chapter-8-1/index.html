 <p>Without a moment’s hesitation Sheng Jiaoyang had finished her meal, as previously, she’d needed to abstain from consuming certain foods. After eating, she cheerfully left the cafe.</p>
 <p>“I want to recharge my phone credit,” Sheng Jiaoyang said as she once again entered the post office.</p>
 <p>The same clerk who’d previously served Sheng Jiaoyang was behind the counter and vaguely remembered this girl who was being ridiculed by many people behind her back. Immediately, the smile on the clerk’s face disappeared, and she coldly asked, “How much this time?”</p>
 <p>“For now, recharge it with one, no, two…”</p>
 <p>“In the end, how much do you want to recharge it with?” The clerk interrupted impatiently.</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang glanced at the clerk, leisurely opened her bag, and took out a stack of money. Under the clerk’s eyes wide-eyed stare, Sheng Jiaoyang then slowly counted out twenty banknotes before placing them on the counter.</p>
 <p>“Here, two thousand dollars to recharge my phone with!”</p>
 <p>The clerk blinked a few times as she looked at Sheng Jiaoyang in disbelief. Although there were only a few changes, she was still able to confirm that it was indeed the same person who’d recently recharged their phone with only ten dollars. It wasn’t until the two thousand dollars had cleared the counterfeit detector twice that she spoke to Sheng Jiaoyang politely.</p>
 <p>“Ma’am, we’re currently offering a promotion where if you buy two products in the same transaction, we’ll offer you a special discount~” The attitude of the clerk had now gone through an unprecedented 180-degree change.</p>
 <p>“Is there an international call package?”</p>
 <p>“Ah, unfortunately, we don’t currently offer one.”</p>
 <p>“Oh,” Sheng Jiaoyang adjusted her bag on her shoulder and turned away.</p>
 <p>“Ma’am, we also have gifts available!”</p>
 <p>“I don’t need any.”</p>
 <p>Returning to the cheap rental house, Sheng Jiaoyang began to pack up the free stuff that she’d managed to score off her cousin yesterday. Although they were only all small brand name products that she wouldn’t have touched before, they were still better than her original body’s cheaper products. They would suffice until she could earn enough money.</p>
 <p>When Xu Qing came home, Sheng Jiaoyang was searching online for rental information on nearby high-end residential areas.</p>
 <p>“Jiaojiao, have you eaten yet?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah,” Sheng Jiaoyang answered without lifting her head.</p>
 <p>Xu Qing was standing beside Sheng Jiaoyang with a somewhat hesitant look on her face for a while before she finally mumbled, “Jiaojiao, I found a job.”</p>
 <p>“Oh? This is good news!”</p>
 <p>“Unfortunately, I’ve been asked to stay there at night.”</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang felt that it was a bit strange and looked up at Xu Qing. “What kind of job did you get? You have to work overtime?”</p>
 <p>“It’s a housekeeping job.”</p>
 <p>“Housekeeping?” A frown formed on Sheng Jiaoyang’s face. “That’s so exhausting; forget about it.”</p>
 <p>“She said that it wouldn’t be tiring. It’s just taking care of a villa’s hygiene and helping the kitchen Aunt to make meals. It’s not that hard, and it pays five thousand dollars a month,” Xu Qing hurriedly explained.</p>
 <p><em>Five thousand dollars is a lot?</em> Sheng Jiaoyang’s mouth flattened into a straight line. Li Shen, who had used to take care of her daily life had more bonus pay per month than that!</p>
 <p>“Okay, if you think you can do it,” At most, she could always resign in the future.</p>
 <p>“But at night I won’t be able to come back,” Xu Qing said with no little amount of hesitation.</p>
 <p>“That’s okay, it just so happens that I entered a contest anyway. I have to be there all day and can’t come back at night either.”</p>
 <p>“Contest?” Xu Qing was utterly surprised.</p>
 <p>Sheng Jiaoyang didn’t want to say anything more than that and quickly changed the topic, “Where are you working?”</p>
 <p>“On Yun Jin Road, close to College Road and not too far away from the university where you’re admitted,” Talking about this made Xu Qing slightly cheerful as she’d be able to take care of her daughter in the future.</p>
 <p>“Oh,” Sheng Jiaoyang lowered her head and went back to searching for information on renting an apartment.</p>
 <p><em>‘Ding’</em> “Done!” Sheng Jiaoyang said as she clicked on the mouse to confirm the payment, her fingers then quickly tapping across the keyboard to enter the password.</p>
 <p>Xu Qing who was sitting beside her was shocked and hurriedly asked, “What’s done?”</p>
 <p>“I rented us an apartment in College Road. The deposit has already been paid, so now all that we have to do is move in!”</p>
 <p>“What?” Xu Qing was shocked once again. “Where did you get so much money?”</p>
 <p>“From selling my sketches. Alright, don’t ask anymore; my money was fairly earned anyway. When I make more money, later on, you won’t have to go to work and will be able to relax at home.”</p>
 <p>Xu Qing packed up her belongings in a daze. When she was wondering what else they should bring with them, her daughter insisted that they should just abandon those shabby things and only take themselves. But after negotiating for a while, they finally settled on being allowed to bring two sets of clothes each.</p>
 <p>Subconsciously, the backbone of the family had suddenly changed from Xu Qing to Sheng Jiaoyang.</p>
 <p>After leaving the cheap rental house, Sheng Jiaoyang hailed a taxi under Xu Qing’s stunned gaze and arranged for them to be driven to the new apartment.</p>
 <p>When they arrived, the Landlord was already waiting for them in the house.</p>
 <p>Afterwards, Sheng Jiaoyang left her Mother to get settled while she efficiently and decisively sorted any remaining details. She first signed the rental contract, organised the locks to be changed, and then bought all the daily necessities. As well as new bedding, she swapped out all the mattresses for new ones and called for housekeeping to clean up the inside and outside of the house. In just a short time, the apartment was completely re-arranged.</p>
 <p>Xu Qing stayed quiet throughout the whole process, even though she really wanted to help in some way. She thought that personally handling some of the details to save money would’ve been better, but Sheng Jiaoyang disagreed and brought her to stand nearby to help direct everyone with their tasks.</p>
 <p>Her thoughts were: <em>why bother getting tired when you could spend money to solve it instead?</em></p>
 <p>That night, Sheng Jiaoyang, who didn’t have to cram into a small bed was finally able to have a peaceful sleep with sweet dreams. In the dream, she’d just reached a scene where she was about to embrace a handsome man when suddenly, she was awoken by a phone call from the staff of the supermodel contest.</p>
