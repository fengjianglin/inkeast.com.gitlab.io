 <p><span style>Chapter 258: Target? Sir Song Jiaoyue</span></p>
 <p><span style>One could easily tell from Xiaoshi’s expressions that she didn’t have a good impression of this mother and daughter pair, even though she’d been chosen by them to serve their daughter. However, the young maid was just too well-behaved. She didn’t speak more than she was asked to and never once spoke badly about them to Bai Xiangxiu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Rong’er pouted and ultimately chose not to make a sound. Bai Xiangxiu didn’t say much either, and seemed quite calm and composed. N</span><span style>é</span><span style>e Xiao noticed how composed her daughter was. </span><i><span style>As expected, she really has changed after becoming princess consort. She’s become so much more level-headed now. </span></i><span style>“Let’s talk about our future instead. Our two families should get along together well and spend more time together from now onwards. I’ve actually come today to discuss something with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mother, please speak your mind!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As Princess Consort Li and as Prince Rong’s godsister, your social status is no longer what it was in the past. Your sister’s marriage needs to be appropriately arranged as well. Lately, there’s been many families visiting us to ask for her hand. Your father and I have no idea who to pick, so I’ve come to seek your guidance. The eldest sister is like a second mother. Maybe you can help us decide and pick a good family for us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see. Unfortunately mother, I am not familiar with the noble families in the capital. I don’t believe I can give you any useful opinions.” The original Bai Xiangxiu was only a young lady. Even though she chosen to marry Long Heng and become his concubine, the person who made that ultimate decision was actually not her father, but her mother standing in front of her now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that Bai Xiangxiu’s mother wanted her opinion for her younger sister’s marriage might sound good on the surface, but in truth, Bai Xiangxiu was just being used as bait to attract good families for the little sister. However, Bai Xiangxiu didn’t know much about Bai Rong’er. If her personality truly was similar to the previous Bai Xiangxiu, it probably wouldn’t be too much of a good thing for family she was married to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve actually taken fancy to a family which I’m sure you’re very familiar with.” N</span><span style>é</span><span style>e Xiao began to laugh. She was sure that the eldest daughter would help out if it was this family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What family?” </span><i><span style>The plot can’t possibly proceed like one of those novels where the younger sister is asked to marry into the same family as a concubine, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The elder sister would be the princess consort while the younger sister was a concubine. There’s no way Bai Xiangxiu would even bother to entertain such absurd thoughts, even if others managed to conjure up such a thing. Fortunately, this wasn’t what N</span><span style>é</span><span style>e Xiao had in mind. With a wide grin, she continued, “I was thinking about the eldest son of the Song family. Sir Song Jiaoyue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?!” Bai Xiangxiu nearly smashed the cup of tea in her hands as she looked at N</span><span style>é</span><span style>e Xiao with a wide-eyed stare. The social status of their families alone would make them extremely incompatible despite her younger sister’s exquisite looks. The Bai family was just a tiny household with five or six servants, while the Song family was one with a few hundred servants. Song Jiaoyue alone had three servants who served him in the bedchamber. There were numerous maids in the manor, and every single one of them were somewhat educated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Jiaoyue probably wouldn’t even have noticed Bai Xiangxiu, had she not been a transmigrator and had more knowledge than most others during this period. While looks were important, highly successful men normally salivated at women who had both brains and beauty. Bai Xiangxiu could easily tell that Bai Rong’er wasn’t an intelligent lady just from looking at the arrogant way she treated the servants in the Prince Li Manor. It’d be Sir Song Jiaoyue’s loss if he were to marry this girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiangxiu scratched her cheeks reflexively and smiled. “Mother, the difference in social status of our families alone is simply too big. I find it impossible to even mention such a thing to them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Based just on your rel-….Your Highness’ closeness with Sir Song, this should be too big a demand right? Moreover, you are now a princess consort. The difference between our families can’t possibly be that big right?” N</span><span style>é</span><span style>e Xiao smiled. The social status gap between them was genuinely great, but her eldest daughter had a great reputation in the capital! Bai Xiangxiu’s reputation was so good that N</span><span style>é</span><span style>e Xiao and her husband couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride when people talked about her. If it hadn’t been for her good reputation, that old stubborn man at home would never have let them out of the house. Receiving endless waves of people asking for her daughter’s hands probably made N</span><span style>é</span><span style>e Xiao think that she could now aim for the stars. Prestigious families and fourth or fifth rank officials had been asking for Bai Rong’ers’ hands ever since news traveled that Bai Rong’er had rescinded the betrothal. There were quite a few men of the right age with very good looks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, they just paled in comparison to the eldest son-in-law. After much contemplation, they ultimately set their sights on Song Jiaoyue. Bai Rong’er had even seen Song Jiaoyue in private and it’d been but a second before she’d fallen in love him. From then onwards, she’d fixed her mind firmly on marrying this gentleman. N</span><span style>é</span><span style>e Xiao had begun aiming for the sky because of Bai Xiangxiu. Her daughter was a beauty, and the seeds of social climbing had sprouted in her mother’s mind after those of the Prince Li Manor had wanted her daughter. Because of that, N</span><span style>é</span><span style>e Xiao decided to rescind the verbal engagement Bai Xiangxiu had set with another family before sending her daughter intot he manor. And now, reality had proven that N</span><span style>é</span><span style>e Xiao had made the right choice. Bai Xiangxiu was now a princess consort and was living the glory life, but she didn’t even once contact home. </span><i><span style>Such a heartless child.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiangxiu could feel the rage building up inside her chest. Who in the world wouldn’t notice what her mother was trying to imply? Wasn’t her mother trying to say that she had some sort of relationship with Song Jiaoyue? Why would they even of such a thing! Yes, there are a few rumors of their supposed relationship in the capital. It was impossible that they wouldn’t know of these rumors, as some had noticed Song Jiaoyue’s feelings towards Bai Xiangxiu even though they’ve tried their best to hide this fact. However, was Bai Xiangxiu’s mother really the type of woman that really wanted the best for her daughter when she would come to Bai Xiangxiu and try to take advantage of this relationship?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiangxiu’s expressions instantly darkened. She stood up and said, “I’m sorry, your daughter is but a lowly wife who understands her place. I have no influence over His Highness’ friends.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>N</span><span style>é</span><span style>e Xiao immediately realized that she must’ve said the wrong thing when she saw Bai Xiangxiu’s expressions change. “You are no longer the same now that you are a princess consort. You don’t even have to mention anything to the prince and let mother’s mouth do all the work. However, your younger sister has never seen the world as she’d always been kept at home. Why don’t you let her help you out in the manor for a while? It’ll be a good opportunity for her to learn to be a wife.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder sister, It’s been so long since we last met. I’ve missed you a lot.” Bai Rong’er used a tiny handkerchief to wipe around her eyes, though not a single tear was shed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiangxiu disliked this young girl a lot. However, she also knew that she would never hear the end of it from N</span><span style>é</span><span style>e Xiao if she were to decline. “If that’s the case then I shall let her stay for two days. However, our manor is very strict, so if younger sister causes any trouble, I will have no choice but to send her back home if the old madame orders it. Otherwise, my place as the princess consort will soon end up in someone else’s hands.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiangxiu sounded extremely unfriendly, which made N</span><span style>é</span><span style>e Xiao a little exasperated. However, N</span><span style>é</span><span style>e Xiao also knew quarreling with her daughter now would do no good. So, she left Bai Rong’er behind and quickly made her way back home. Surprisingly, Bai Rong’er became much more well-behaved after her mother had gone home. She scanned her elder sister from head to toe and noticed how noble she now looked now. Everything she wore and used were made from the finest material. Even her maids and old servants were wearing better clothes than what commoners wore. Even Xiaoshi, the once miserable looking maid, was becoming prettier by the day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Elder sister, It’s been more than a year since we last met right? I heard you’ve given birth to a very beautiful young boy. Where is he?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s gotten a cold lately, so he’s recuperating in the old madame’s quarters.” Bai Xiangxiu was slouching in her chair while perusing the account books. Bai Rong’er sidled up to her and laughed. “Elder sister, you are now in charge of the entire manor right? Why not let someone else read these books to you?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Books?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The edge of Bai Xiangxiu’s mouth twitched. “How could I possibly have the time to read books? These are the accounts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The manor’s accounts?” Bai Rong’er grabbed one of the many books on the table and exclaimed. “Oh my word! There’s so much money flowing in and out! It would probably take our family at least three to five years to fill up one of these books!”</span></p>
