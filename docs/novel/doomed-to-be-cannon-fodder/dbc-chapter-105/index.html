 <p><span style>Chapter 105: Ghastly Shrieks, Getting Rid of Someone in Secret</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Heng was in no hurry. He leisurely sat to the side and looked at Sun Hong’er coldly. “Sun Hong’er, this prince has hundreds upon thousands of ways to persuade you that living is more unbearable than death. Do you want to try some of them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Highness, this servant really hadn't done anything. Please...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Servants, chop off five of her toes first.” Long Heng didn't waste his breath. He knew very well which part of the body would hurt the most when lacerated. But suddenly, a thought struck him. If he were to punish her while he was in the estate, wouldn’t her constant wailing cause rumors to spread? As the head of the household, nèe Bai would surely catch wind of this, to say nothing of anything else. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She was so extremely timid. Wouldn't the rumors frighten her to death? Thus, when Sun Hong’er began to cry in horror, he immediately said, “Gag her.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>And so, Sun Hong’er’s mouth was stuffed until she couldn't even let out a single sound when five of her toes were chopped off. How could a girl like her withstand this kind of pain? She fell into a dead faint almost immediately. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She still wanted to wail when she awoke later, but how could she have a chance to do so when she was still gagged?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because she was afraid of pain, she’d initially planned on confessing and dying in a straightforward fashion. But she hadn’t expected that they would gag her, leaving her no chance to speak. Moreover, Long Heng intended to make her suffer more as well. So, before she could confess, he made sure to chop off her other five remaining toes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Sun Hong’er was assaulted by extreme agony, as if her liver and gallbladder were torn apart from within. She dropped to her knees with a thud just before they were going to chop off her fingers. Only then did Long Heng finally gesture to have her gag removed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Back in Winter Garden, Bai Xiangxiu had no idea all this was going on. She was still having the time of her life sleeping in bed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When she woke up the next morning, she was immediately notified that one of the small workshops she’d made an agreement with had already shipped their merchandise. The rush job had been completed in record time, and ten or so pieces had been delivered to the estate. She inspected the merchandise personally and paid off the invoice after concluding that the workmanship was up to par. Although they had only sent over ten pieces of clothing, she still distributed them to the servants. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The servants who received the clothing felt that the clothing this year was very warm, and thanked the fourth madame with compliments before they took their leave. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Heng returned after he was finished with the matters at hand. On his way back, he noticed that the servants all had unusually happy expressions on their faces after they’d received their winter clothes. This was a rare sight. </span><i><span style>Isn’t it just some pieces of clothing?</span></i><span style> From his point of view, it didn’t seem like there was any difference between these pieces and the winter clothing of previous years. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He heard the conversation between Ye-</span><i><span style>mama </span></i><span style>and Bai Xiangxiu as soon as he went inside. The more he listened, the more he felt that Bai Xiangxiu was a very cute and kind-hearted person. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Madame Xiu, you must've paid them with your own money this time. Otherwise, there's no way that these cotton pieces could be as warm as this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was just a little bit of money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s just clothing for servants. They’re not worth your money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re people working for the prince's estate. If they are kept warm, they will naturally work harder for the estate. Wouldn't you say so, Ye-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style>?” People in the past really enjoyed calling upon their ranks of seniority. And every time, Bai Xiangxiu was struck speechless for an instant. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiangxiu felt like she was beginning to have more and more qualities of a white lotus flower, kind and beautiful on the outside, but scheming on the inside. However, she really didn't like the hierarchy system where the servants were treated as lesser humans. The key person that everything revolved around was Long Heng. She didn't know what he was currently doing either. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>After getting wind of that incident yesterday, I wonder how he plans to handle it? Has he found the person who was trying to kill me yet?</span></i><span style> Someone walked in from the outside at this moment. To her surprise, it was none other than Prince Li, Long Heng. What had he come here for? This was the servant quarters, right? </span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, everyone stood up. Bai Xiangxiu, sitting on the heated platform, stood up abruptly as well, but by doing so, she towered over everyone, twice as tall as the tallest person in the room. Feeling that this was a little inappropriate, she could only lower her body. However, sitting down wasn’t appropriate either. And so, in a panic, she decided to kneel on the heated platform.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The platform was different from a bed, since it was extremely hard. Therefore, abruptly kneeling like that on the platform was no different from abruptly kneeling on the floor, causing her to grimace in pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ouch…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You… There’s no need for such formalities.” Long Heng extended his hands to nonchalantly support her a little. There were too many people in the room, so it wasn’t too appropriate for him to hold her hand tightly and help her up. However, who would still dare stay in the room when such a situation was developing? They all backed out of the room one by one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you still not getting up?” Only when everyone had left the room did Long Heng come over to help her up. He put her arm around her and pulled her to the edge of the platform. Because of how petite Bai Xiangxiu was, that little impetus pushed her whole person to fall into his embrace. Her person was so soft and her body so very tender. Her fragrance rushed into his nose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Falling into his embrace was like the straw on the camel’s back; it was as though something in his heart suddenly broke. He ferociously lifted her chin, and lowered his head to give her a kiss. The kiss could only be described as tyrannical. It bathed Bai Xiangxiu with all of the force behind his pent up desire, leaving her short of breath in just a few seconds. It was so powerful, she became somewhat delirious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His strong hug and caring gesture tugged at her heartstrings. </span><i><span style>What do I do if my heart stops? My brain has lost the ability to think. What do I do? </span></i><span style>The only movement Bai Xiangxiu could make was to gently kick her legs, because the edge of the platform was making her very uncomfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Long Heng felt that such an action really suited his intentions. He lifted her, carrying her over to the center of the platform and gently lay her down. Then, he bent over and pinned her down.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh my god!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The group of servants who were still lingering outside the quarters were all very surprised by their master’s actions. They didn't expect that their master would actually be this brash. </span><i><span style>At a place like this</span></i><span style>…. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it be that the prince wants to do that to the fourth madame at this time of the day? How impatient is he?!</span></i><span style> Logically speaking, they should've gone inside the quarters to stop them. How could they let such a thing happen in the estate while the sun was still out? However, nobody was bold enough to go inside to stop them. </span></p>
 <p><span style>But while they didn’t dare to, others had to. Someone had come to report the arrival of Minister Lin just as the others were nervously standing around. Since Minister Lin had personally come by to pay a visit, the prince naturally had to greet him personally as well. Without much of a choice, Shu’er faced the room and called out, “Your Highness, Lin Shangshu asks to see you.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Your father-in-law is here. Stop fooling around inside with your concubine. If Minister Lin were to get wind of this, he would surely faint with anger.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Long Heng froze for a second. He could clearly hear what was being said from the outside. But the beauty before his eyes had already captured his heart, even though he had yet to obtain her in her entirety. When he lifted his head to glance at Bai Xiangxiu’s face beneath him, he immediately felt his entire body tighten.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This girl is simply too mesmerizing!</span></i><span style> She was squinting slightly, a slightly intoxicated expression on her face. Her clothes were half undone, the sensuous picture an overwhelmingly seductive and tantalizing scene. He was actually a bit reluctant to let go of her, but his guest was already waiting outside, and it wouldn’t be good to make him wait.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll go meet him for a bit. You will return to Winter Garden to wait for me. Don’t busy yourself with other things." Long Heng reluctantly got to his feet and tidied his clothes. While he was leaving the room, he saw that the girl was still lying on the platform, as though paralyzed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He asked Xiao Shi to go in and tend to her mistress before he left. Then, feeling a little depressed, he hurried off to meet with the insidious Minister Lin, who was rumored to be extremely protective of his children. He was a person who would never investigate the truth no matter what his children had done. He would only blindly cover for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some sort of emergency must have happened, or else Minister Lin would’ve never gotten off his high horse to personally come and call upon him. He had been busy circling around nèe Bai lately, so he hadn’t bothered with the Lin family. He hadn’t expected that trouble would rear its head yet again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After seeing him in person, Long Heng noticed that Minister Lin must have had his own share of troubles lately. Hints of grey streaked his sideburns, and there were signs of dark circles under his eyes as well. He probably hadn’t slept well for the past few nights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Servants, pour some tea.” Long Heng was in an irritated mood since he’d been interrupted in the midst of his... act. He had to set aside his little beauty to come and meet this old man. No one would be in a good mood if they were put in his situation either. </span></p>
