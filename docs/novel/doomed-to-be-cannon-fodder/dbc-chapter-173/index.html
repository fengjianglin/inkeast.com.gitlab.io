 <p>Ye Mama: Despite my best intention, old madame deemed it dangerous for Prince to get *ahem* experienced male servant.</p>
 <p>Long Heng: ...Why?</p>
 <p>Ye Mama: If you see how the courtyards arranged my prince, Old madame make sure the prettiest (Mistress Xiu) is the most corner because you're inexperienced and thus... *ahem* easily corruptible.</p>
 <p>Long Heng:...Does mufei think I am still a child? *No wonder her place is so damn far from mine*</p>
 <p>Ye Mama: But! Desperate situation needs desperate measure so *here* the holy book *Toss Kamasutra to Long Heng*</p>
 <p>Long Heng: *began to read* Hooo... this is enlightening.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile</p>
 <p>Bai Xiangxiu: *shudder*</p>
 <p>Xiao Shi: Mistress, even if Huo'er needs his sunbath I think the weather is too cold to open the window.</p>
 <p>Bai Xiangxiu: I am fine, I just feel like... *A prey who sense a predator eyeing me*</p>
