 <p><span style>Chapter 270: The Disappearing Miracle Doctors</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since when did the doctors from the olden days have such advanced surgical skills? This was definitely unnatural! If Su Yun’s plastic surgeon was brought to the modern times, he would be insanely rich! </span><i><span style>Aren’t his abilities a little too scary? No. Maybe I’m overthinking things. She likely has some sort of supernatural ability or something from her transmigration!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But isn’t that even more illogical? If she did, she would’ve used them already. </span></i><span style>Bai Xiangxiu could feel her brain melting, but she didn’t show a hint of it on her face. She carefully cut out an offshoot of the cactus and put it into another pot. </span><i><span style>Heh. You’re about to bring this biological wiretap back home. Don’t blame me for the consequences.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Where is Prince Li? I haven’t seen him in the manor yet. His Majesty had asked me to apologize for what happened yesterday. I wonder if…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah? Oh, he’s gone out hunting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?” </span><i><span style>Why would he go out hunting after such an enormous occurrence? Does he actually not care about Princess Consort Li?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s not the type person who can stay still. Since His Majesty is wounded too, why don’t you return and keep him some company? His Highness will be grateful for that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s true.” </span><i><span style>Grateful? Him going out hunting so early in the morning and the fact that he didn’t bother entering the palace to convey his gratitude clearly means that Bai Xiangxiu told him everything. But he’s not the type of man to just submit to humiliation. Just what in the world is he planning? Did he even really go out to hunt?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Long Heng had come back while Su Yun’s mind was still filled with doubt, holding a bloody fawn in his hand. &nbsp;Bai Xiangxiu no longer fainted at the sight of blood, but she couldn’t help but furrow her brows when she saw blood drip all over the floor. Noble Consort Su frowned too. </span><i><span style>He really went out hunting? And what are you trying to tell me by showing me this bloody fawn.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Who’s this?” Long Heng looked at Noble Consort Su with a curious look on his face. He might not be familiar with her appearance, but he already knew who she was as he’d already heard people talking about her outside. </span><i><span style>She’s Noble Consort Su? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“This is Noble Consort Su. Your Highness, what are you doing? Take that away!” </span><i><span style>He’s probably trying to frighten the noble consort.</span></i> <i><span style>Unfortunately, she isn’t going to be scared one bit by that. There also seems to be a little bit of suspicion on her face. She’s definitely not an ordinary person.</span></i><span style> Bai Xiangxiu was now a hundred percent sure that this woman was Su Yun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This deer was a vigorous one. Its vital blood is very nourishing. I will have the servants serve one bowl to you later to nourish your body. Noble Consort Su, would you like a bowl as well?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No need. I should leave the both of you to your business. Blood won’t remain fresh for long.” Due to Long Heng’s baleful aura, Su Yan couldn’t help but fear and hate him for disfiguring her. She stood as she made to leave. Bai Xiangxiu handed over the cactus to the palace maid beside her. “This plant is best kept indoors.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know.” It was only when Noble Consort Su finally left with her entourage that Bai Xiangxiu could finally feel at ease. Long Heng definitely hated them. They just needed to force him to make the first move. Since he couldn’t bring his army from Shu County, he’d have to rely on the men currently in the capital to exact his revenge on the emperor. But most of those men had already sworn loyalty to the emperor, so Long Heng’s plans would be exposed immediately. After that, the entire Prince Li Manor would cease to exist, and so would Long Heng and Bai Xiangxiu!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yan was still feeling quite vexed. As a person from modern times, she’d actually suffered a loss at the hands of Bai Xiangxiu, a person from the olden times! That woman was always acting like a white lotus flower, yet she was a deep schemer. Most importantly, she even dared to stab the emperor and cause them to suffer a loss with no way to retaliate! </span><i><span style>She will definitely become the scourge of our existence if she continues to stay by Long Heng’s side.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps it was a conflict of their personalities, Su Yun hated Bai Xiangxiu more than anyone else. However, she’d come to the conclusion that Bai Xiangxiu wasn’t a transmigrator like her, because she couldn’t find any qualities from a modern woman even after a long period of observance. She concluded that because Bai Xiangxiu was smarter than the usual and had a deft touch with plants, it wasn’t impossible for a person from this time to do what she had done.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Su Yun was also speechless when she thought about the emperor. </span><i><span style>It’s only a small injury! And yet that breeding stallion is so out of sorts because he can’t visit his concubines. </span></i><span style>Upon such a thought, she became rather cross and irritable. She would never have wanted to sleep with that public toilet of a man if it weren’t for his power and status. Unfortunately, the opposite was not the case. The only way she could gain power was to stay by his side. If she would be able to bear his child, the entire nation would be hers for the taking!</span></p>
 <p><span style>To Su Yun, the palace was just like her workplace, and the emperor was her boss. A subordinate that didn’t aim to rise in the ranks wasn’t a good subordinate. So, she was always thinking about ways to get promoted. If she wanted to be promoted, then she would have to eliminate everything that blocked her way. She could then obtain a few boy toys when she’d finally risen to the top. Hadn’t Empress Wu Zetian done the same? What fear would she have when she had no desire to leave a legacy for the annals of history?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She returned to the palace to deal with her boss and come up with a plan at the same time. The emperor could not move on his own, so he would need her help to relieve his desires. As a woman from the modern age, she had all sorts of ways to make him feel like he was in heaven without needing him to do anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the Prince Li Manor, Long Heng immediately tossed the fawn away after Su Yun left. He also got the servants to clean up the blood. “Do you feel any discomfort?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not anymore. I’ve already gotten used to the sight of blood on the battlefield.” Bai Xiangxiu frowned as she continued. “Tell me, how do you think Su Yun was able to obtain such a beautiful face? It’s so strange.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How do you know for sure that she’s Su Yun?” Long Heng asked. </span><i><span style>It really is that woman after all. </span></i><span style>He had a hunch, but couldn’t be as sure as Bai Xiangxiu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Her mannerisms and speech convey her contempt for men, which is something very similar to the Su Yun we knew. Also, it’s womanly intuition. Do you believe me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She is Su Yun whether I believe you or not. We must find a way to deal with her, or your troubles will be endless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright. But how are we going to get rid of her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why don’t we start by finding out how she was able to change so much? A woman who wants to be so beautiful would never want others to know about her past. She will surely receive an enormous blow if the truth were to spread.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Women that undergo plastic surgery were mostly like this. Since the couple had free time now, they might as well take advantage of the situation by plucking the feather from a goose whenever it passes by. Long Heng pinched her cheeks. “We’ll do it your way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, their investigation soon turned up something much bigger. It seemed that a short while ago, quite a few miracle doctors had suddenly gone missing. All of them had very different reasons for their disappearance, but the fact was that they had all disappeared. Moreover, those that disappeared all specialized in treating external wounds. Some of them had entered the palace, disappearing after they left the palace. Others didn’t enter the palace, but they were all very famous. It didn’t matter if it was a doctor from the </span><i><span style>jianghu</span></i><span style>, the enemy nation, or just a doctor with no affiliation. A few dozen of them disappeared, all around the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Long Heng came back from making his inquiries, he brought someone back with him. This someone was the long absent Yu Kuang! He’d been missing ever since he’d come back to the capital. He’d been in such a rush that he hadn’t even said goodbye before he’d left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiangxiu didn’t try to be a busybody because she thought it had something to do with the </span><i><span style>jianghu</span></i><span style>. She never imagined that they’d meet again today. Yu Kuang was still looked as saintly as ever and flashed a gentle smile when he saw Bai Xiangxiu. “Long time no see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They greeted each other like very old friends that hadn’t seen each other for a long time. Bai Xiangxiu also smiled and replied, “Mm. It’s been a long time. How have you been?”</span></p>
