 <p><span style>Chapter 234: Entering The Capital In Disguise </span></p>
 <p><span style>The two groups actually began to fight right outside the capital. Song Jiaoyue had no choice but to interfere and break up the fight, revealing his identity in the process. Once they recognized Long Heng’s “wife, the men insisted on escorting Bai Xiangxiu back to the capital. They just wanted to help Long Heng in any way they can. In any case, many hands made for light work. Bai Xiangxiu decided to head back to the capital with the accompaniment of these people.</span><span style>However, they would surely be at the center of attention considering how large their group was. So they decided to disguise themselves as they entered the city. There was one major issue that they’d yet to address, and that was Bai Xiangxiu’s outstanding appearance. Nobody would’ve batted an eye if a common beauty decided to enter the city gates, but Bai Xiangxiu was the city’s top beauty! She would surely be the center of attention if she entered the city looking like this!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll disfigure myself!” Bai Xiangxiu said ruthlessly. However, everyone else quickly vetoed the idea. They were all trying to save her husband. How would they explain to Long Heng why his wife had become ugly after they’d saved him? “I mean I will disfigure myself with makeup.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Judging from the expressions on their faces, they probably thought I was going to cut my face with a knife. </span></i><span style>Bai Xiangxiu would never do that even if her life depended on it. One had to understand that a knife to the face was actually very painful. This suddenly reminded her of Su Yun. She was a woman that was as proud as a peacock. </span><i><span style>I bet she’s incredibly furious at Long Heng for ruining her face!</span></i> <i><span style>With her abilities, there’s no doubt that she will eventually stage a comeback! It’s almost like there’s a tiger in front of Long Heng and a wolf behind.</span></i><i><span style>However, Su Yun probably won’t be able to create too much trouble for now; she still isn’t too familiar with this world. </span></i><span style>Bai Xiangxiu consoled herself mentally while putting on makeup to disfigure herself. Yu Kuang helped her out. As a man from the </span><i><span style>jianghu, </span></i><span style>he knew how to make it look more realistic and believable. It didn’t take long before a very horrifying birthmark was drawn on her outstanding face, but that was not all they did. They also thickened her eyebrows and even made her lips seemed chapped. She genuinely looked like a different person.</span><span style>Bai Xiangxiu was speechless. She was sure that she would frighten a few people with her current appearance. Surprisingly, that didn’t happen. The others were just incredibly astonished by how she’d managed to turn such a beautiful face into something like that. Bai Xiangxiu touched her face and smiled awkwardly. “Do I look very ugly?”</span><span style>“No. You’re very beautiful.” Bai Xiangxiu’s looks didn’t really matter to Song Jiaoyue. To him, her beauty was beyond her outer appearance and came from deep within her.</span><span style>Bai Xiangxiu found her question very silly. “Let us depart. We will enter the capital separately.”</span><span style>She was dressed as an ugly woman as she carried a basket of eggs into the city as though she was about to sell them. However, Song Jiaoyue entered the city on his horse with his head held high. There was no need for him to disguise himself. Some of the others were dressed like farmers, while the rest were dressed as beggars. It wasn’t hard for them to collectively sneak into the capital as they were all very capable.</span><span style>They all went their own way to do some work before they gathered at one of Song Jiaoyue’s houses. Bai Xiangxiu had been busy sending out feelers and realized that nobody in the city knew that Long Heng was already back. He was clearly being arrested in secret. “Where should we begin with our plan to rescue Long Heng?” Bai Xiangxiu asked.</span><span style>“First of all, we need to know why he was summoned back to the capital. Someone could be pulling the strings from behind, but it might be the emperor’s own intentions too,” Song Jiaoyue took the lead in explaining, as he was much more familiar with the inner workings of the court.</span><span style>“I’m afraid that means we have to enter the palace. But how are we supposed to do that? Is there someone you know who’s in the palace right now?” Long Heng’s trusted aide asked. </span><span style>“We do. The old madame is in the palace but we can’t get in touch with her. It’s simply impossible,” Song Jiaoyue replied with his brows furrowed.</span><span style>“I’ve have a plan. Sir Song, I have to return to the Prince Li Manor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What plan?”</span><span style>“It’s a secret,” Bai Xiangxiu winked and returned to the Prince Li Manor under the silent protection of Song Jiaoyue and her ugly appearance. She reluctantly crawled into the manor via the hole that she’d used last time. Song Jiaoyue had gotten used to it by now. There was just so many sides to her, dumbfounding him each time.</span><span style>How many women could have led such an exciting life during the olden days? Back then, women mostly lived deep in the rear courts. Their sole purpose in life was fulfilling the needs of their men while slowly growing old, and eventually dying. But Bai Xiangxiu was different. Despite her weak and feeble outer appearance, she was doing things that only the tough and strong-willed would be able to do.</span><span style>Bai Xiangxiu was being extremely cautious even after she slipped into her own courtyard. The servants were being a little more lackadaisical as none of their masters were at home. It didn’t take her too much effort to arrive at Apricot Garden since everyone only treated her as just another servant when they saw her. She was even carrying something as part of her disguise. She waltzed into her own room and picked up Huo’er. However, Xiaoshi was already standing by the door with a shoe in her hand when Bai Xiangxiu turned around. She immediately shouted, “Someone is stealing a plant…!”</span><span style>Bai Xiangxiu immediately covered her mouth and said, “It’s me! Don’t call for help!”</span><span style>“Madame… Xiu?” </span><i><span style>Why do you look like this now?</span></i><span style>“Yes. I’m here to retrieve Huo’er for something. Don’t raise a commotion over this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But… where are you going? And when will you be back?”</span><span style>“I’ll explain everything to you at a later date. Xiaoshi, be good and stay put in the manor. You don’t have to worry about anything.” </span><i><span style>Xiaohuan was left behind in Shu County as well. Hopefully, she’ll be able to come back when things have settled down and we can go back to our previously peaceful lives.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiaoshi wants to follow you. Xiaoshi will follow you no matter where you’re going!”</span><span style>“Be good. Things will settle down soon, but I can’t take Xiaoshi with me before that happens.” Bai Xiangxiu was worried that even more people would learn of her return, so she quickly warned Xiaoshi. “Don’t mention to anyone that I’m back. Alright?”</span><span style>Xiaoshi could only nod as tears slowly welled up in her eyes. She didn’t know why but she had a feeling that Madame Xiu was about to do something very important. Bai Xiangxiu patted Xiaoshi’s head and crawled out of the manor through the hole, bringing Huo’er with her. Song Jiaoyue was about to collapse. Bai Xiangxiu seemed like she had a plan just now, but all she took from the manor was just this random potted plant.</span><span style>Bai Xiangxiu immediately shut herself into her room when they returned to the house and finally came out after half a day. She took out a fragrance pouch that seemed like it was newly made. “Sir Song, can you make sure this gets to the old madame in the palace?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will find a way, but I’m afraid that I can only do this once. I’m afraid that I can’t help you if you want her to reply,” Song Jiaoyue frowned. Even if the old madame knew something, it would be impossible to get her message out of the palace. </span><span style>“I don’t need a reply. As long as she talks about her findings in a place with nobody around, I can immediately know of it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? You…”</span><span style>“It’s a secret!” </span><span style>Bai Xiangxiu stuck out her tongue in a rather playful manner and refused to tell him anything else. Nobody would believe her anyways.</span></p>
