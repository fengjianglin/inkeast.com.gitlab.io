 <p><span style>Chapter 116: What Happens After Scratching the Female Lead?</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was once again annoyed by the female lead’s holy mother, white lotus flower act. The female lead couldn’t tell right from wrong at all in these matters! Just what did she have stored in that brain of hers?</span><span style>Bai Xiangxiu finally realized only now that her pitiful little bit of white lotus attribute could be sent back for a reroll compared to the female lead. She’s spent so much effort to get to where she was without the two men noticing, and nothing would be gained if her boss sustained injuries because she’d let the female lead stop her from alerting others. </span></p>
 <p><span style>So, she didn’t care that she wasn’t the female lead. She grabbed the female lead’s hand and flung it away. “Take shelter off to the side. If I don’t call for help, the prince will also be in danger.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impossible. He is Prince Li. He can defend himself.”</span><span style>“You’ve gone mad! Prince Li is a human, not a real war god.” Bai Xiangxiu was anxious. Seeing as the female lead still wanted to pounce on her, she simply swatted her hand in the female lead’s general direction. She didn’t do so with the intention of actually hitting the female lead. She only wanted to push her away, but she didn’t think that her movements were slightly quicker than usual under these desperate circumstances. She actually ended up slapping the female lead across the face and her overly long fingernails accidentally left a bloody scratch on the female lead’s face.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Damn it! I’ve really stirred up trouble this time.</span></i><span style> Bai Xiangxiu was sure that the male lead and all the other supporting male characters were going to hunt her down for this. However, Bai Xiangxiu didn’t expect that the female lead would actually grab her hand with her claws while she stood dazed. During that mild struggle, Bai Xiangxiu’s hand was also injured by the female lead’s nails. </span><span style>The two women likely hadn’t expected to injure the other party, and so both were stunned for a moment. However, Bai Xiangxiu’s mind was consumed by thoughts of saving the prince, so she ran away without a thought for her image. She shouted as she ran, “Help!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had held her breath for a long time, so her shout came rushing out with great volume. The guards at that end immediately heard her cry of alarm and bolted towards her. Long Heng had also heard her and subconsciously glanced in her direction. As a result of that, he bore witness to the scene of Lin Qianzi pulling her back while she shouted for help. This was the first time he’d seen Bai Xiangxiu doing something with all her might, so he could be forgiven for losing his focus for a moment. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When he came back to his senses, the other man’s punch was already too close for him to evade. &nbsp;Long Heng quickly used his palm to cushion the punch, but still sustained internal injuries and spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiangxiu’s heart tightened as she saw him fall from the sky with her own eyes. This wasn’t because she liked him! It was because she felt that he’d been protecting her recently and had never harmed her. Even if he wasn’t a friend, he was still more than just a stranger to her. So, she would naturally be a little concerned about him, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, she shook off the female lead and ran towards the prince. The male lead was much more important to her than the female lead.</span><span style>Those guards were also sprinting towards her as Bai Xiangxiu ran. Lin Qianzi called out loudly to Luo Yunzheng, “Go quickly...” A guard had a sword pressed to her throat the second she’d choked out those words. She didn’t dare move any further.</span><span style>The third supporting male lead Luo Yunzheng felt that he had indeed gained a small advantage from the situation. He pivoted and ran off. Bai Xiangxiu, on the other hand, had already run up to Long Heng’s side. When she saw that the corner of his mouth was bleeding, she paled in consternation. She had no idea how she was going to help him up.</span><span style>Unexpectedly, the look in Prince Li’s eyes didn’t change in the slightest. He only said, “I’m fine” and rose to his feet. He wiped off the blood from the corner of his mouth with an outstretched sleeve. “Take her back to where she came from and keep an eye on her. If anyone comes to look for her, kill them. No exceptions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do we need to call a doctor over to take a look at your injuries? It doesn’t look like your injuries are light… Ah…” The prince had grabbed ahold of Bai Xiangxiu’s hand, revealing the bloody scratches.</span><span style>“Was this her doing?”</span><span style>“It was an accident. I actually also scratched Miss Lin as well.” She lowered her head. </span><i><span style>You’re feeling bad for me, aren’t you?</span></i><span style>Prince Li did indeed feel bad for her and said, “Let’s go back into the house.”</span><span style>After the doctor came, he diagnosed some minor internal injuries in Prince Li. Fortunately, the prince only needed to rest a bit to recover. Hearing this, Bai Xiangxiu relaxed and felt that her actions just then really had been a little excessive. She’d even scratched the female lead’s face. Even though the male lead hadn’t blamed her, she felt that the various supporting male characters and whatnot would exact revenge on her sooner or later.</span><span style>This also included the male lead before her eyes, but she only prayed that he would remember that she’d only done so to save him tonight, and so wouldn’t place this matter to heart. Nevertheless, she’d better remind him of this matter. Hence, she waited when Prince Li’s complexion had turned slightly better before suddenly falling to her knees in front of him.</span><span style>“I’m sorry, Your Highness. I scratched Mistress Lin just now because I was anxious that you would be hurt. Please let me know what my punishment should be.”</span><span style>“You… Get up!” Long Heng had no idea what he would do with her. Why was she so timid? Since when was he going to blame her for what’d happened? She made it seem like that woman actually had a place in his heart.</span><span style>Bai Xiangxiu hesitated, but then saw her boss close his eyes and faintly say, “She is just an unrelated person here. Why should you have to torment yourself because of her? You don’t need to be so afraid of her in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What do these words mean?</span></i><span style> Bai Xiangxiu couldn’t seem to put her thoughts in order for a moment. What exactly did he mean by that? Could it be that he was already considering Bai Xiangxiu as his woman? Even so, she couldn’t relax because who knew when the dying embers of love between the male lead and the female lead would one day flare up again?</span><span style>But, it was worth mentioning that she really did like what the male lead had said, so much that she heaved an audible sigh of relief. It seemed like the effort she had put in for such a long time had paid off in the end. She’d finally received her boss’ praise and acknowledgement. In retrospect, this was the kind of mindset that she had when she just started working!</span><span style>However, the male lead was much more handsome than her previous boss. She had actually slightly drifted off into a daze just by looking at his side profile as he meditated. She was completely oblivious to the fact that Xiao Shi had draped an outer garment over her. In the end, she rested her head on her arms and fell asleep on the table as she watched him.</span><span style>The group of servants didn’t dare to disturb their master’s meditation either, so everyone silently gathered to the side. When Long Heng finished circulating his qi throughout his body, he noticed that the small woman who’d just behaved in an extremely impressive manner just now had actually fallen asleep on the table. His heart softened at the sight, and he carefully lifted himself off the bed, scooped her up in his arms, and carried her to the bed. He covered her with the quilt, and then lay down beside her, dismissing those outside with a wave of his hand.</span><span style>However, he didn’t do anything. He only stroked her hair as he thought, </span><i><span style>she’s obviously a timid person, but she did something so brave just now just to help me. It seems that I have a place in her heart. </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Long Heng lightly planted a kiss on her forehead. Even though he was furious that man had come to find him, that matter had already receded to the annals of his mind when he saw her working so hard to protect him. A small burst of happiness actually unfurled in his heart when he lightly kissed her smooth forehead again. His lips couldn’t help but to curl up in a little smile. Even though he didn’t do anything, the warmth in his heart grew even deeper.</span><span style>Bai Xiangxiu didn’t exactly sleep peacefully that night. She was caught in a weird dream, where a huge cat was chasing her, like it really want to lick her. The cat licked her so thoroughly that it didn’t stop even when her entire face was covered in its saliva. The next moment, the dream switched to a monster pressing down on her chest. She felt herself being smothered to the point where she couldn’t catch her breath. </span><span style>When she woke up the next day, she felt more tired than if she’d climbed a mountain for a day. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>Something’s wrong. It really feels like there’s something pressing down on my chest.</span></i><span style> She glanced down to see that there was actually a man’s arm on her. “Ah…”</span><span style>She couldn’t be blamed for overreacting at that moment because she’d been sleeping alone all this time. Anyone wouldn’t be used to having someone suddenly sleep beside them. Moreover, this person was clearly a man. She could clearly see the muscles on his arm through his thin inner garments. </span></p>
