 <p><span style>Chapter 217: Miss Lin’s Husband</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Qianzi shook her head and said frantically, “No, I didn’t! It’s not what it seems!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the men around her only laughed uproariously as they unabashedly leered at her body from tip to sole. Lin Qianzi was so flustered and angry, but she was sure this had something to do with Bai Xiangxiu. </span><i><span style>I won’t let her get away with this!</span></i><span style> Someone finally gave her a shirt to wrap herself up with, but it was only a shirt. No one paid any more attention to her; they even stayed far away from her, as if she was some terrifying beast. When she got back to her room, she gave full vent to her embarrassment and rage, smashing everything she could get her hands on. She was a vaunted noble lady! It was all because of that woman that she was like this now! </span><i><span style>I’m going to kill her, I definitely have to kill her!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiangxiu spent a long time muffling her laughter in her blankets after she received the news. Although her fever had abated, the wounds on her butt still hurt greatly. Long Heng didn’t bring up the matter of her going back to the capital anymore. Although Bai Xiangxiu didn’t leave the city, someone else decided to make a visit. But, when he arrived, everyone in Tranquil City had the most interesting expressions on their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Zhangshu felt that everyone was looking at him weirdly as he wound his way through the city. He’d immediately rushed over when he received news that his wife Lin Qianzi had been rescued after being captured by the enemy. He wanted to bring her back. Although he knew that her child wasn’t his, he still held it in for these sake of a cousin he’d been obsessed with since youth. His entire family had seemed to be against them after the two had gotten married. They hated his Miss Lin and thought of all sorts of ways to torment her. Lin Qianzi, on the other hand, spent her days crying instead and never once showed him a friendly expression. He felt that his patience was just about worn out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the two had gotten married, they had spent very little time together. He wanted to take her back and properly live out their lives this time. He didn’t want her to come in contact with those people anymore. It was all because of those men that she had lost her way and become stranger and stranger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As odd gazes followed him into the military camp, he quickly found Long Heng. How he’d envied the man before because he was her fiancé! But what was with the look in his eyes now? “Thank you very much for rescuing my wife. I’m here to take her away.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, then take her away!” Long Heng waved his hand and had someone bring Lin Qianzi over. Bai Xiangxiu took this opportunity to walk over and speak to Ji Zhangshu, “Sir Ji, there are some things I'd like to speak to you about.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Zhangshu had recognized Bai Xiangxiu immediately. She wasn’t exactly easily forgettable. “What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’d like to speak of Miss Lin’s story before she arrives. You can then decide if you want to take her with you or not.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Zhangshu frowned, having no idea what this woman wanted to say. Long Heng watched off on the side, a hint of a smile playing about his lips. Bai Xiangxiu was the most familiar with Lin Qianzai’s story, so she talked at length about how she’d fallen for Luo Yunzheng after being captured by him, then how she’d fallen in with Duan Yunying and how she’d been used by him. In the end, she hadn’t even known who the father of her child was, and had thrown her child to his death. Of course, Bai Xiangxiu also spoke of how she’d given her body to Chen Tao to try and get revenge for her child.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All those present can stand as witnesses. If you don’t believe them either, Commander Lu would have the same story to tell you.” She didn’t have to go into detail of what had happened to Lin Qianzi in the enemy camp after so many days. “I originally tried to persuade her not to run, but you have indulged her far too much. Why didn’t you marry her if you liked her? Look at all the trouble she’s stirred up. I can tell you now that the emperor will find out of Lin Qianzi’s actions that placed her desire for personal revenge over her nation sooner or later. At that point, your entire family may be implicated in the ensuing strife.” Lin Qianzi’s only way out lay in the Ji family now. Where could she go if Ji Zhangshu didn’t want her? Bai Xiangxiu couldn’t let her stay anymore, she might cause trouble for Long Heng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How… how can this be? How did she turn into this?” Ji Zhangshu looked around at those present. Prince Li, Sir Song of a noble family, and some of Long Heng’s men. He suddenly understood the meaning of the odd gazes. That was pity… and contempt. What man could accept this? </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Qianzi happened to walk in at that precise moment. She felt particularly close to Ji Zhangshu. In her mind, he’d been the one who’d cared about her the most since they both were young. He would understand and take care of her even when her parents wouldn’t. However, he actually subconsciously moved aside when she flung herself at him. He didn’t say anything but, “Get your things and let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He still had to bring her back after all. Minister Lin was waiting for him to return safely with her. Yet Lin Qianzi was in no hurry to pack her things. She slowly walked over to Bai Xiangxiu, but saw Long Heng standing behind her before even speaking. “Bai Xiangxiu, you killed my son. I’ll have my revenge!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You killed your own son; you can’t have forgotten that, can you? I’m sure everyone in the enemy camp will remember even if you’ve forgotten that little tidbit.” Bai Xiangxiu didn’t shrink back at all and stared right at Lin Qianzi with a dismissive smile. </span><i><span style>Is the white lotus female lead about to become the black lotus?</span></i><span style> She was rather curious just how much ability Lin Qianzi would have after this transformation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiangxiu had actually already thought of what the female lead could do. </span><i><span style>Isn’t it just her usual tricks of using the men who are madly in love with you? </span></i><span style>But out of all the men you’ve met, you’ve hurt Luo Yunzheng, Duan Yunying’s dead, and this cousin of yours doesn’t look like he’ll let you off easily when you return. Who are you going to use in the future? Male supporting character the emperor? They hadn’t even met yet!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Qianzi snorted and turned around to pack her things. She was still very happy to be able to return to the capital. Her cousin was waiting for her in the carriage when she was done, but sent a servant to help her into the carriage. </span><i><span style>How odd, why is his attitude so different? He used to take care of me so carefully before. Is it because of the child?</span></i><span style> Ah right, he still wasn’t very understanding of the child, so she had to make a proper explanation. She immediately started her explanation after climbing into the carriage. “Cousin, I’m sorry, I know you loved the child very much so, but Bai Xiangxiu was the one who’d killed him. She threw our child to the ground herself!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that so?” Ji Zhangshu frowned, not knowing if what she said was true or not. “What was the scene then?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then?” Lin Qianzi grew a bit confused. She remembered that she’d grabbed her child, but things had gone a bit hazy after that. “They discovered me and tried with all their might to take my child back. And then…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did they want to take your child?” Ji Zhangshu had heard everything from Bai Xiangxiu, so knew the secret Lin Qianzi had been concealing from him all along, that regarding the origins of her child. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… I don’t know why they wanted my child. I don’t know.” Lin Qianzi didn’t want her cousin to misunderstand anything, because she was already very happy that he’d come to save her.</span></p>
