 <p><span style>Chapter 19: That Appearance is Extremely Seductive</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiangxiu couldn’t care less about what other people thought. She hurriedly dressed up and asked </span><span style>Ye-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style>, “Mama, do you think it would be good if I gave this to the prince personally?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course it would! I’ll tell you what, if the prince doesn’t have any matters to attend to today, he should be in Fragrant Garden!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style> dearly hoped that Madame Xiu could complete the task by herself. At the very least, Madame Xiu’s appearance as she laughed merrily was extremely seductive, to say nothing of anything else. What man could withstand it?! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiangxiu was overjoyed. She couldn’t let this chance go. She had to make the supporting male lead remember her. She clenched her fist inwardly, then went to prepare the gifts she had already put together. She could no longer bother with underhanded secre</span><span style>t dealings. Anyways, the supporting male lead wasn’t so mean as to speak of this matter. The story had already explained his personality in detail, so she wasn’t afraid. As they say, don't bite off more than you can chew, but remember that fortune favors the bold</span><span style>. If she continued like this, she wouldn’t be able to attract a second glance from the supporting male lead, let alone save herself from certain death. She had already prepared this gift for quite some time, but hadn’t gotten the chance to present it. Her gift was also placed in a small cloth bag, but it was quite different from a perfume satchel. When she was ready, she brought Xiao Shi out with her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From Ye-</span><i><span style>mama</span></i><span style>’s point of view, Bai Xiangxiu even looked somewhat heroic as she stepped out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiangxiu had always been a bit passive. A male classmate had chased her for quite a while in her middle school days, but she still hadn’t figured out his motives even when she’d reached senior high. When she finally found out, he had already married and had kids. With her personality, she was only doing such a thing after arriving in the ancient times because of her fear of being beaten to death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scenery in the prince’s complex had become even more beautiful. Although the trees were starting to wither into a golden yellow, one could find a certain beauty to the desolate landscape. But at present, Bai Xiangxiu couldn’t appreciate the scenery. Relying on Xiao Shi for guidance, she made her way to Fragrant Garden, her heart a knot of anxiety.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Prince Li was a general, he was also quite well read, with rather elegant tastes. This Fragrant Garden was situated above a man-made lake with fountains and strangely shaped rock formations. It looked extremely grand, imbued with an ancient and grand sort of beauty. The couplets by the entrance were written with bold calligraphy that soared like dragons and danced like phoenixes, extremely pleasant to the eye. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>She secretly admired the male lead’s vision. He was the male lead after all, other than having a liking for murder, he still had quite a few good points to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pageboy standing outside stopped them, “Madame Xiu, may I ask what business you have here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This concubine has some matters and would like to see the prince. Does he perhaps have some time?” This was the modern way of speaking. She didn’t know how she was supposed to ask to meet a man in ancient times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pageboy was startled. </span><i><span style>This Madame Xiu is quite direct.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He knew that the prince held more interest towards her than the other three mistresses, so he respectfully replied, “Please wait here for a moment, Mistress Xiu. This servant will go and inquire with the prince.” He turned and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Li was currently sipping tea with Song Jiaoyue inside. Without anything better to do, they had started analyzing the current situation within the court, since the both of them were active within that circle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The servant entered and spoke, “Prince, Mistress Xiu requests an audience.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Heng raised an eyebrow, and for reason, felt a stirring of joy within his heart. The mistresses of the Spring, Summer and Autumn Gardens would come looking for him at least once a day, trying to gain his favor by sending over some soup or water. This was the first time the mistress of the Winter Garden had come to find him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he kept a strict face and said, “Don’t you see that this prince has a guest? Let her wait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pageboy froze for a moment, startled. Shouldn’t the prince be saying ‘Let her return? Making her wait… meant that he wanted to have her meet him? It looked like he really did feel differently about Mistress Xiu compared to the others. The servant went back to pass the message without saying anything else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How would Song Jiaoyue not see his friend’s interest? What man didn’t like beauties? However, seeing the way he was acting nonchalant was quite interesting as well. He took a sip of tea before asking, “Why don’t we play a game of Chinese chess?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Yan raised his head to glance at him. His amorous eyes were narrowed slightly, and they looked extremely charming. He was naturally born with a cool, handsome face, but his eyes were extremely mesmerizing. He looked even more beautiful than women.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Jiaoyue liked beautiful things, so he rather admired his friend’s eyes and would even draw them quite frequently into paintings on the faces of beauties. However, he would never dare admit that out loud, otherwise he might get promptly stabbed through with a sword. He would have to be blind not to see the trace of tenderness that flashed across those usually icy cold eyes. Therefore, him asking the other to play chess was simply a way to make things difficult for Long Heng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, upon seeing those eyes turn cold again, ruining the sense of beauty that’d just radiated out of them, Song Jiaoyue stood up and said, “Let’s forget about it. If I hold up your date with the beauty, I’m afraid we won’t be able to continue being friends.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He smiled gently, making Long Heng, whose worries had been exposed, utterly incapable of retorting. Luckily, they understood each other and went through the motions of farewell before sending each other off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiangxiu was waiting anxiously outside. She wanted to go in to see the supporting male lead, but the pageboy was actually making her wait.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as she was getting even more worried, she saw the supporting male lead coming out from afar. Alright, so they’d seen each other, but what could she do with this one glance? No, she couldn’t let him leave just like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that moment of desperation, Bai Xiangxiu’s IQ took a nosedive and she chose to employ a rather unorthodox method. When the servant said, “Mistress Xiu, the prince invites you to enter”, she hurriedly took a few steps forward and accidentally ‘fell down’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wouldn’t be good if the beauty suffered a fall, so Song Jiaoyue naturally reached out to catch her. He felt a pain from his palm, as if something had been placed there. Just as he was thinking it strange, the beauty stood up and glanced at him once with her limpid eyes before walking away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That glance made his heart skip half a beat. Although he had a few women at home, they couldn’t compare to her looks. Mistress Xiu had an outstanding appearance, but more importantly, she had that special aura about her. She seemed delicate, yet she carried some sincere naivete to her which could enchant any man. However, what had she passed to him just now?</span></p>
 <p><span style>After waiting for her to walk away, he surreptitiously peeked at his hand and ended up staring blankly at the item sitting in his palm. Rage rose in his heart. How was this woman suitable to stay by his friend’s side?! He wanted to expose her, but he still hesitated for a moment before he made a move with his hands, speaking in a low tone, “Recklessly causing trouble!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ah?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone looked at him in confusion. They didn’t understand who that sentence was directed towards. He then opened his hand right in front of Bai Xiangxiu, some pieces of cloth and white smoke spilling out of his hands.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This… this must be the legendary inner power!</span></i><span style> The story had described the supporting male lead as an expert as well, but his power couldn’t be compared to the male lead’s. He had actually destroyed her gift for him, and that exclamation was clearly directed at her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiangxiu was speechless. So he didn’t speak of it, but he had destroyed it without looking at it, so it looked like sending gifts wasn’t going to work. Bai Xiangxiu was so afraid that she ran into the Fragrant Garden, her heart beating like a drum. Was it really alright that she had failed to seduce the supporting male lead and even made him hate her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feeling extremely put out in her heart, she walked towards the male lead. The study in this Fragrant Garden was extremely lavish. Although it had been renovated, it was decorated perfectly in the ancient style. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The male lead, Long Heng, sat behind a writing desk, seemingly reading a book with the utmost seriousness. He didn’t even raise his head upon hearing someone enter, simply asking, “What’s the matter?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiangxiu hadn’t actually come looking for him for any particular reason, she was still reeling from the mental blow the supporting male lead had given her. She took out the fragrance bag from her sleeves and placed it on the desk. But this fragrance bag looked a bit unfamiliar to her eyes. Looking at it closely, she saw that it was a little cloth bag she used to wrap bookmarks with.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Heavens!</span></i><span style> She wanted to find a block of tofu and kill herself with it. She had given away the wrong present! </span><i><span style>Someone tell me how I should handle the situation now! I’m waiting online, hurry hurry hurry!</span></i></p>
