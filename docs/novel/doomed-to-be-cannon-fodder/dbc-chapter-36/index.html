 <p><span style>Chapter 36: As Long As You’re Alright</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiangxiu couldn’t be bother with hiding anymore. She suddenly shouted out, “Be careful!”. As a result, Song Jiaoyue really did take more care after hearing the words. He hauled his opponent behind him to block two flying daggers, but another one stabbed into his abdomen, causing him to fall to his knees with a gasp of pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, the other enemy raised a dagger. Bai Xiangxiu ran out without another thought. She had planned to push Song Jiaoyue out of the way after the enemy sent the other dagger flying. But who knew her timing would be so good? That flying dagger seemed to grow eyes and stabbed straight into her shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So painful. </span></i><span style>Bai Xiangxiu faced Song Jiaoyue as she slowly collapsed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He caught her with a face full of shock. Bai Xiangxiu felt that she might die, so it was only right to say some stirring words before her death. After all, she was finally in close proximity to the supporting male lead. But her wound really hurt too much to do anything grandiose. So she lay there in the crook of his arm, and drew in what could be her last breath to whisper, “As long as you’re alright.” She honestly couldn’t say anything more, but she never thought her words would visibly move Song Jiaoyue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Madame Xiu, Madame Xiu, you…” His hands grew inexplicably warm. When he took one out for a look, he found it covered in blood. This was her blood, caused from the dagger she’d taken for him! He abruptly tugged out the dagger stuck in his own body and flung it towards the last </span><i><span style>jianghu </span></i><span style>member. &nbsp;The latter was preparing another strike when Song Jiaoyue’s move abruptly ended his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Jiaoyue was planning to take her and leave, but he only felt more and more muddleheaded. Right at this moment, he saw Bai Xiangxiu struggle with a bottle of medicine despite being in too much pain to speak. When he opened it up, he found that it was Red Pearl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Red Pearl was a medicine that could not only treat injuries, but detoxify myriad poisons. It was especially effective against items that caused confusion. It looked like the prince must have told her about its effects. He hurriedly opened the lid and took a whiff, his mind clearing up immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Madame Xiu, I’ll take you to get treatment right now. Madame Xiu, Madame Xiu…” No matter how he called, that beautiful woman didn’t respond. She’d fainted dead away. No, he couldn’t let anything happen to her. He definitely couldn’t!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Jiaoyue felt his heart trembling at this moment. Holding her carefully in his arms, he returned to the caravan as the fastest speed he could muster. In the distance, he could see Long Heng riding back with people to his aid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as he relaxed, he narrowly avoided fainting away himself. But he couldn’t. If they fainted like this, it might affect her reputation. But she had risked her life to save him, so how could he let her suffer?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Jiaoyue gritted his teeth and had someone bring her back to her carriage. He then took a few steps before falling on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Heng ran over to help him up, his voice anxious. “Where are those people?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All dead. Madame Xiu is injured, save her first.” After gasping out that last matter on his mind, he fell into blissful unconsciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Startled, Long Heng handed Song Jiaoyue over to a subordinate before going over to the carriage for a look. He saw the bloody Bai Xiangxiu lying there unmoving, her face almost white from blood loss, her breath all but gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His heart ached as he rushed to pick her up. If he’d known that this was going to happen, he wouldn’t have left her here. Who cared what other people said as long as she was safe? Ignoring what others thought, finding her a doctor was the most important thing. With everything done and over with, there was no telling whether she’d die just from excessive blood loss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Heng’s speed was very quick. He found a doctor in a nearby town in a flash. There was no time to attend to matters regarding male-female propriety as the doctor examined the wound and shivered, “It’s not life-threatening. The dagger’s already been taken out. She’s just lost too much blood and needs quiet rest. She shouldn’t be easily moved about, either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If there’s no danger, why hasn’t she woken up yet?” Long Heng asked with furrowed brows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because she’s lost too much blood. I believe she’ll wake up in a while.” The doctor explained as he busied himself with a patient that had just arrived. This time it was actually a subordinate bringing in Song Jiaoyue for treatment. There was no helping it. Both of them were severely injured, so they couldn’t wait until they returned to the capital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Jiaoyue was a man to begin with. Add that to his martial arts skills and deliberate defense of his vital areas, he woke up in less than an hour. After bandaging his injuries, he could stand up in the room and walk around. Naturally, he asked after Bai Xiangxiu’s injury first. He was only relieved after hearing that her life wasn’t in danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he released a breath, Long Heng appeared with a cold face. “Just exactly what happened here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vendettas in the </span><i><span style>jianghu </span></i><span style>typically wouldn’t involve kidnapping women and children. Thus, the rest of the Song family were all fine, just rendered unconscious. But why was Bai Xiangxiu the only one who’d ended up with a blade stuck in her back? That had obviously been a concealed weapon, so he didn’t believe things were so simple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inexplicably, Song Jiaoyue felt a twinge of guilt prick at his conscience. He opened and shut his mouth before saying, “It was I who implicated Madame Xiu, because she came to give me Red Pearl.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Red Pearl? That’s right, it can remove the effects of substances that cause confusion. Though, how did she know? I didn’t tell her,” Long Heng wrinkled his brows. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Song Jiaoyue gave a start, but quickly realized how she’d known. She hadn’t been rendered unconscious because there was Red Pearl smeared on her nose. Thus, she’d guessed in that instant that Red Pearl could dispel the effects of the confusion. It was rare to find such an intelligent girl in this world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She deduced it,” Song Jiaoyue smiled wryly before continuing. “When she was chasing me, she was spotted by an expert and was hit as a result. However, because of that I received the Red Pearl and recovered my wits enough to preserve my life.” He was very sincere as he spoke. “This is all thanks to Madame Xiu. But such affairs are really too complex. For the sake of her good name, I can only say to outsiders that she was caught up in the action.” He held back the words that Bai Xiangxiu had spoken before she’d fainted. The words were like a spell, echoing in his ears long after she’d lost consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the same even now, as if time had stopped in that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Heng was calm as he replied, “You did the right thing, though I never expected such minor players from the </span><i><span style>jianghu </span></i><span style>to have the guts to kill the imperial court’s appointed officials.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I sent armed forces to suppress ten branches of his organization, so he came back to kill me. Looks like he really doesn’t want to live a peaceful life.” Song Jiaoyue had received orders from the imperial court to investigate a few fugitives, thus earning the ire of some people in the </span><i><span style>jianghu.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Long Heng glanced at him and said, “I’ll lend some troops to you this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha, with your troops, they’ll definitely be more docile.” His laughter jolted his injury, causing his eyebrows to knit in pain. He thought of the unconscious and wounded Madame Xiu. How much would it hurt for her after she woke?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would a woman be able to bear it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>His brows further wrinkled at the thought, just as a servant girl stuck her head in to speak. “Which one is Sir Long? Your family’s madame is awake, but she keeps saying it hurts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Long Heng was happy to hear she’d awakened, but grew alarmed at the mention of pain. His steps unconsciously quickened as he headed over to her room. Song Jiaoyue was worried as well, but he only followed two steps before stopping. He didn’t have any right to enter her room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It looked like all he could do was wait. Once he calmed down, he recalled the words she’d said to him. He hadn’t paid attention to them back then, nor had he given them any thought when he was anxiously trying to save her life. But now the memory of those words brought him an endless ambiguous warmth. Why would a woman say those things to him in such a dangerous situation? Could it be, she…?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Impossible, impossible.</span></i><span style> She was clearly Long Heng’s concubine, and he was someone who couldn’t even exist in her thoughts.</span></p>
