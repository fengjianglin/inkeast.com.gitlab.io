 <p><span style>Chapter 209: Older Sister! Let’s Sleep Together!</span><span style>Bai Xiangxiu was taken aback when Yu Kuang suddenly barged into her room. He even bounded into bed like an energetic boy, his arms outstretched. </span><i><span style>Is he trying to say that he wants to hug me to sleep?</span></i><i><span style>Hello? Has this guy gone crazy?</span></i><i></i><i><span style>Is he trying to provoke Long Heng to a fight?</span></i><span style> Countless question marks appeared on top of Bai Xiangxiu’s head. She looked rather cute when all a-fluster.</span><span style>“Older sister. Come sleep!”</span><span style>“Are you… Yu Shū?” Bai Xiangxiu opened the window to take a look at the sky. </span><i><span style>Your mother! When did the moon become round?</span></i> <i><span style>Wait, why didn’t he tie himself up as usual? Why did he suddenly barge into my room?</span></i><i><span style>No. He must’ve tried to tie himself up. </span></i><span style>She could see lacerations on his wrist, obviously caused by his attempt to break free from his bindings. His hands were bleeding badly and seemed really gruesome. </span><span style>“You wilful child! Why are you running around when you’re injured?” Bai Xiangxiu crossed the room to grab some medicine for external injuries, and grabbed his hand to apply it. However, Yu Shū decided to use this chance to pull her onto the bed.</span><span style>“Ah…!” Bai Xiangxiu was caught off guard, falling onto the bed. She was instantly swept into a tight hug by Yu Shū.</span><span style>Long Heng witnessed the scene, of course. He’d rushed out from his bath wearing only one thin layer of clothing after hearing the commotion. In a fit of rage, he immediately pulled Bai Xiangxiu away from Yu Kuang and gave him a ferocious punch. Unexpectedly, Yu Kuang didn’t even avoid his attack, taking the full brunt of the punch to the face. </span><i><span style>What’s wrong with him?</span></i><span style> Long Heng found that to be particularly strange. Yu Kuang could’ve avoided that kind of telegraphed punch in his sleep with his martial skills. Even stranger, why didn’t he even have the beginnings of a defensive stance? He had gone flying because of the punch. </span><span style>“Ouch! Why are you hitting people for no reason?!” Yu Shū was very much a child. He didn’t know how to protect himself. “Older sister! Older sister! It hurts! It hurts so much!” Yu Shū leaned on the wall, staggering to his feet in difficulty. There was blood on the corner of his lips and he seemed to be in a lot of pain. There were even tears on his face.</span><span style>“…” Long Heng was speechless. </span><i><span style>Is he really a man? Why is he crying?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiangxiu suddenly walked over to him and caressed his head, consoling him with a gentle voice. “Don’t cry, don’t cry… be a good child. Older sister will help you apply some medicine and will stop that older brother from beating you up. Alright?”</span><span style>“Sure! Older sister treats me the best!”</span><span style>“…” Long Heng was struggling to make sense of the situation in front of him. He couldn’t wrap his head around this situation. His little wife was putting medicine on another man… or a boy, rather, while consoling him and wiping off his tears. It was literally a scene of an adult trying to console a child! Unfortunately, his eyes wasn't seeing the same thing as his mind. He just couldn't come to terms with it!</span><span style>However, there was nothing he could do about it. He put on the rest of his clothes and stared at them with his mouth agape. “What's wrong with him? Is his brain damaged?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn't possibly have given Yu Kuang this much brain damage when he hit the </span><i><span style>wulin</span></i><span style> alliance head... right? However it seemed that the alliance head had already been in that state before Long Heng had even hit him.</span><span style>“Wait just a moment. I'll explain everything when he falls asleep.”</span><span style>“Sleep? Here?”</span><span style>“Where else would he sleep? Shh. Don't be so loud.” Bai Xiangxiu couldn't possibly allow Long Heng to continue misunderstanding the situation. However, she had to settle the first problem in front of her before she could move on to the second one. Yu Shū was simply in too much pain. A grown man like him was now acting like a child, crying and throwing a tantrum. He finally fell asleep while hugging onto Bai Xiangxiu’s arm. He actually wanted to hug her, but that man was staring at him with such a scary expression on his face. He could only take a step back and settle with just holding onto an arm. He continued to whimper in pain until he finally fell asleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Explain,” Long Heng said with extreme impatience.</span><span style>“Haha! Let's talk in the other room.” Bai Xiangxiu dragged Long Heng out of the room and explained everything about Yu Kuang in detail. She didn't tell him about the slightly more intimate moments of course. She did tell him that she believed Yu Kuang retained no memory of when he turned into Yu Shū though.</span><span style>Long Heng found it difficult to remain angry at the </span><i><span style>wulin </span></i><span style>alliance head. After all, it’d be wrong for him to be mad at a child… right? Unfortunately, this child was in an adult’s body! Was it really alright for him to be acting all cute and cuddly? </span><i><span style>Well, it’s true that I owe him for saving Bai Xiangxiu in the first place.</span></i><span style> He decided to endure it for one night and squeeze onto a tiny bed with Bai Xiangxiu.</span><span style>Yu Kuang opened his eyes in a confused state the next day. He couldn’t recollect anything that had happened yesterday. He only felt a stinging pain on his face. His expression quickly darkened when he touched his face. </span><i><span style>My face is clearly swollen! How did I get such a serious injury out of nowhere?</span></i><span style> A burly figure soon appeared in front of him. “Alliance Head Yu, why don’t we go outside to spar a few rounds &nbsp;now that you’ve awoken?”</span><span style>“Prince Li. Why am I here?”</span><span style>“Go outside to train with me and you’ll soon understand.”</span><span style>“Alright,” Yu Kuang didn’t back down either after being challenged. Shu’er, who’d come to wait upon his master, got quite a shock when they walked by. The air was suffused with killing intent. </span><i><span style>What happened? Why is there such a murderous atmosphere so early in the morning?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The groggy Madame Xiu then came out of the room and frowned. “Where have they gone?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“…” Shu’er struggled to make sense of the situation. </span><i><span style>Why did two men and one woman come out from the same room? Why did the prince go out to fight with that weird man? </span></i><span style>It just didn’t make sense to him no matter how he thought about it.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Whap!</span></i><span style> A slap visited his head. “Stop entertaining foolish thoughts! His Highness and I slept together last night in the room.”</span><span style>“What about him?” </span><i><span style>Why was he sleeping in the same room as well?</span></i><span style>“He had something to discuss with His Highness and stayed for the night as it was already late by the time they were done.” </span><i><span style>This is so awkward. Even a pure child like Shu’er is having such thoughts.</span></i><span style>“Oh.” Shu’er remained skeptical. He believed that it was inappropriate to stay for the night even if it was late. And even if that was true, why would they go out to fight so early in the morning?</span><span style>“Ignore those two. Put the wash basin down here.” Men were hot-blooded creatures after all. They’d calm down after a fight. She couldn’t be bothered as it was still early in the morning. Shu’er brought in porridge and picked vegetables for breakfast some moments later. He served three bowls of porridge as there were three people here.</span><span style>They didn’t have much of a choice in food selection. Food was in shortage after all. Simply having breakfast was already quite a luxury. She wasn’t picky at all. Long Heng and Yu Kuang entered the dining area after she’d wolfed down her breakfast. They both had some injuries here and there, but it didn’t seem too serious. “Take a seat and have some breakfast. I’ll go check up on the troops’ training progress.”</span><span style>Long Heng opened his mouth but didn’t say much else. He greatly appreciated that she wasn’t even complaining in times like these. When Long Heng saw how Bai Xiangxiu had left in a hurry, he quickly downed his porridge and left after putting on his armor. </span><span style>Yu Kuang caressed his cheeks. That kid was missing Bai Xiangxiu more and more. He’d been worried that Yu Shū might do something wrong, and now his fears had come true. He’d actually gone to the couple’s room to sleep? No wonder Long Heng was so angry. Fortunately, Long Heng hadn’t really fought him for real because Yu Kuang was here to help. Since Long Heng hadn’t gone all out, there had been no need for him to go all out either.</span><span style>He would go all out when the war with the enemy began!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bai Xiangxiu tugged on Long Heng’s sleeves in excitement when he finally caught up to her. “Success! They’re so impressive!” Long Heng was oddly happy when she praised his subordinates. The edge of his lips lifted up to form a smile.</span></p>
