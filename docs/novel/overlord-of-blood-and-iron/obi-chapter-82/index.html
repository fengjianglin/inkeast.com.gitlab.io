 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>The 200 enemy forces were instantly decimated.</p>
 <p>“A-Amazing…”</p>
 <p>And the reason was simple, while death knights were composed of death energy, Spectre Knights were also composed of holy energy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They were without a match against people their level. Obviously, it would be impossible for normal soldiers to defeat them.</p>
 <p>“Podolski. Go back to our territory, and bring the main army here.”</p>
 <p>“Huh? Then milord, what will…”</p>
 <p>“I will stay here, and wreak havoc in their land. Just think of it as a distraction until the main army arrives.”</p>
 <p>“Maybe around five hours maximum, that will be the maximum time frame we have until the enemy finds out that their scouting squad has been killed. If we invade them and they are prepared, then we will be the ones at the losing end.”</p>
 <p>“B-But to conquer the farmlands…”</p>
 <p>“I just need to distract them until our main army arrives. And then…”</p>
 <p>As if he was embarrassed, Kang Chul-In froze for a second, before speaking again, his face stiff.</p>
 <p>“We will harvest all of their crops, before running away.”</p>
 <p>“W-What a… terribly… dirty and underhanded tactic.”</p>
 <p>‘To think that he would think of such a dirty tactic.’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In truly had to praise Kwak Jung, who had come up with a tactic like this.</p>
 <p>They just needed to distract the forces there before reaping the harvest, and running before the enemy’s main army came to retaliate.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>How frustrating and annoying would that be? &nbsp;</p>
 <p>If an army just popped out of nowhere, before taking all of the crops that they had been harvesting for the entire year?</p>
 <p>“... It seems like Soldier Kwak enjoys dirty tactics.</p>
 <p>“Well, go back immediately so that the army can come here quickly.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, milord.”</p>
 <p>‘3 hours… All I need to do now is to distract them for 3 hours.’</p>
 <p>“White-Lion Knights, hear me. If you see any more scouts or soldiers around here, dispose of them immediately. Oh, and also, get rid of the corpses here.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, milord.”</p>
 <p>And as soon as they got the order, the knights formed groups of 2 or 3, before splitting up into the forest.</p>
 <p>‘Now, it’s just up to me, and the spectre knights. Well, with these things by my side, it wouldn’t be that difficult to distract them for 3 hours.’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In’s current level was 39, while the spectre knights were level 40.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And with Kang Chul-In, who was significantly stronger than people at his level, along with 50 spectre knights, it wouldn’t be a stretch for them to fight the enemy forces and delay them for 3 hours.</p>
 <p>“Where will you go, milord?”</p>
 <p>Said one of the remaining knights.</p>
 <p>“To the enemy’s farmlands.”</p>
 <p>And saying this, Kang Chul-In walked out of the forest, and into the enemy’s lands. He had left the spectre knights in the forest too, so as to not attract too much attention.</p>
 <p>And while Kang Chul-In had gone to the enemy territory, soldiers at the Burrow Lands were in an emergency state.</p>
 <p>“Move it, move it!’</p>
 <p>“Quick, quick!”</p>
 <p>“Go, go now!” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Due to the abrupt order to move out, the soldiers were in a hurry.</p>
 <p>If they came a little bit late, they would definitely risk Kang Chul-In, and the other high ranking officials of Laputa tried their best to go as quickly as possible.</p>
 <p>“C’mon, it’s time for lunch now!”</p>
 <p>Mr. Sullivan, who was the leader of the farmers in the Absilon Territory, came to the farm lands, pulling a wheelbarrow along with a few others.</p>
 <p>“Ow… My back! Come on, everybody, let’s eat!”</p>
 <p>“Lunch!”</p>
 <p>And all of the farmers there came near Mr. Sullivan, to grab their share of food.</p>
 <p>And suddenly, they spotted a man with black hair lying down on a big boulder, looking relaxed.</p>
 <p>This man was wearing black armor, and gave everyone a sense of majesty.</p>
 <p>“Hello, you there?”</p>
 <p>Mr. Sullivan called out to that man with black hair.</p>
 <p>There was no answer. It seemed like that man was asleep.</p>
 <p>“Oh, that young’un?”</p>
 <p>Clark, who was very close to Mr. Sullivan, spoke.</p>
 <p>“It seems like he’s an adventurer? I think he’ll probably rest here for a little bit, before leaving.”</p>
 <p>“Hmm… is that so.”</p>
 <p>And Mr. Sullivan nodded, convinced of what Clark was saying.</p>
 <p>There were many adventurers like this, and was not a rare sight.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>To the Pangaeans, the dimension traveling adventurers were a common sight, and to them, they were like the wind, coming one day, before disappearing the next day.</p>
 <p>And they were mostly pretty likable.</p>
 <p>They took commissions and did missions for the territory and the Lord, sometimes saving the civilians of the territory. And sometimes, they were like storytellers, telling people of fascinating stories that were far away.</p>
 <p>They were not people to be alarmed about.</p>
 <p>Of course… there were some occasional cases where an adventurer would sometimes charm a woman, play with them, and take them away into their world, but looking at this young man’s face, he didn’t seem like the type to do that.</p>
 <p>“Hey~~ young man. Your sleeping, but don’t you think you need to eat too? I’d bet you’re also hungry, considering that you probably go around traveling everywhere.”</p>
 <p>But the adventurer, or Kang Chul-In, didn’t respond.</p>
 <p>‘Sometimes it’s not too good if the people are too nice.’</p>
 <p>‘It’s easy… But…’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In felt a little bit regretful that the people of this territory were living so happily.</p>
 <p>Normally, if people were living happily like this, the happiness was very high, and so was their loyalty to their Lord.</p>
 <p>And if Kang Chul-In attacked territories like this, it would be easy to imagine that they would try their best to resist against him, and due to their loyalty, it would be difficult to convert them into his own civilians.</p>
 <p>But suddenly… an unexpected word came out of one of the farmers.</p>
 <p>“****! God damn that stupid sex maniac!”</p>
 <p>Maybe he had drank too much beer for lunch, but this one man’s face was beet red, and was cursing like a sailor.</p>
 <p>“Hey, be careful!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mr. Sullivan poked the drunken man, and motioned towards him to caution.</p>
 <p>“What if the soldiers hear us! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“This filthy mot***f*****! This ‘Lord’ of ours is doing nothing but taking women and acting like a fiend, how could I remain calm in situations like this?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>And a story that seemed quite interesting piqued Kang Chul-In’s interest.</p>
 <p>“Still, our Lord is using his privileges as a Lord, how can you say that?”</p>
 <p>“Sigh~ You say that because you don’t have a daughter, do you know how painful it is if your daughter is taken away by a sex fiend like him?”</p>
 <p>And due to this one voice, the discussion became heated, with a lot of others attacking and cursing at the Lord.</p>
 <p>And listening to this, Kang Chul-In could realize what was going on.</p>
 <p>‘What a crazy bastard.’</p>
 <p>According to the system, you could have a maximum of 7 women as a Lord. &nbsp;It was like the fact that you could have 3 main wives, and 4 concubines like ancient China.</p>
 <p>BANG!</p>
 <p>It was at that moment.</p>
 <p>A teenager that looked about 18 grabbed his pickaxe, before slamming it on the ground, with a terrifying and bloodcurdling expression.</p>
 <p>“R-Rok…”</p>
 <p>Even the drunken man couldn’t speak in front of this teenager who had a terrifying aura around him.</p>
 <p>‘It seems like his fiance was taken from him.’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In could tell why Rok had such a terrifying expression, and why he had been releasing such a terrible aura.</p>
 <p>Was it not obvious.</p>
 <p>A male and female who loved each other.</p>
 <p>And a greedy, good for nothing Lord who took the woman from him.</p>
 <p>It was such a cliche story.</p>
 <p>…Although for the one that had his woman taken from him, every day was like hell.</p>
 <p>But Kang Chul-In didn’t sympathize with this young teenager called Rok.</p>
 <p>He felt that someone that had been robbed of someone that they loved wasn’t a true ‘man’.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even if he was not a Lord, Kang Chul-In would definitely have just grabbed some weapons, before heading immediately to kill the one that did such a thing to him.</p>
 <p>‘It seems like this isn’t going to be very difficult then.’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In changed his mind.</p>
 <p>It was at that moment.</p>
 <p>As Kang Chul-In was secretly rejoicing, from far away, around 300 soldiers that were on horseback came riding towards them.</p>
 <p>‘It seems that they have finally found out.’</p>
 <p>Looking at the speed of these soldiers, it was quite quick. And as expected of Kang Chul-In’s predictions, they had finally figured it out after around 4-5 hours.</p>
 <p>NEIGH!</p>
 <p>Along with the loud noises of the horse…</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“You there!”</p>
 <p>A man, who seemed to be the captain of the soldiers, pointed at Kang Chul-In, before speaking.</p>
 <p>“You’re going to come with us!”</p>
 <p>He seemed that he was just going to take Kang Chul-In with him, as he wasn’t recognized as one of the people that were part of the territory.</p>
 <p>‘3 hours, huh…’</p>
 <p>And as he was thinking that, Kang Chul-In slowly rose from the boulder he was resting on.</p>
 <p>“Follow obedientl…”</p>
 <p>CHING!</p>
 <p>And as the Soft Sword Kaiforce was taken out of its hilt…</p>
 <p>KACHING! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>He swung the sword like a whip towards the leader of the soldiers.</p>
 <p>“ARGH!”</p>
 <p>And as he was struck, he had fallen off the horse, and screamed in pain. It seemed like he had lost some of his flesh due to the sword.</p>
 <p>“From now on…”</p>
 <p>And after knocking down the leader in the blink of an eye, Kang Chul-In boldly stated.</p>
 <p>“This land is mine.”</p>
 <p>It was showtime.</p>
 <p>And turning on Overdrive, he rushed headfirst into the enemy forces.</p>
 <p>WHOOSH!</p>
 <p>And wind, that was now formed of blood, started forming a tornado around him.</p>
 <p>“AGH!”</p>
 <p>And as one soldier fell…</p>
 <p>“C-Catch that crazy…”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In rode on the horse of the fallen soldier, and started to brutally slaughter the enemy forces.</p>
