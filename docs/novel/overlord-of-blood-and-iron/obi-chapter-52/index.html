 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">All the adventurers that came in from the windows were part of Team Slayers, the group of adventurers that had helped him hunt the Peacock Dragon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“You guys.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The leader of the adventurers, Billy Halford, took out his fearsome mace, “Evening Star”, and spoke.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Our leader says to kill all the ones that didn’t kneel.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">And as soon as he finished speaking…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“ARGH!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“KUAHHH!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You could hear the sounds of screaming dwarves everywhere.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">She’s grown.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In stood in a corner leisurely, watching the adventurers fight. He couldn’t care less about the scene of blood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He had had once killed tens of thousands of people in one day, so he wouldn’t even blink at slaughter of this level.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Mr. Chul-In…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Lee Chae-Rin called Kang Chul-In in a nervous voice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Why. Are you afraid?” he replied in a dry voice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“It’s… terrible. Truly.” She spoke with a trembling voice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It should be.</span></em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In could sympathize with her feelings completely. Why? It was because there was also a time when he was like her. 10 years ago.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But you still have to conquer your fear. If you cannot stand something of this level, you won’t be able to survive here.</span></em><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Maybe if she was a Lord in the main continent, he wouldn’t push her this far, but this was the Pandemonium region. This was the haven of slaughter and death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">There was no way to survive until Ragnarok unless she faced her fears. &nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“It should be painful.” He opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“It should be terrifying, disgusting, and terrible. I know what you feel too.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“But you have to be tough.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“To...ugh?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“The second you show weakness, there will be many who try to strike you. Just like these traitors.” He said and pointed towards the dwarves that were now fighting against his group of adventurers.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“But you have to endure when it’s sad. When it’s painful. When you feel lonely. And even when you’re afraid. If not, then at least try not to show it. Always try to cloak yourself in a veil of bravado.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This was all he could really say from what he had experienced.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“That is a Lord. Pretending to be resourceful even when not, pretending to know even if you don’t. That’s what a Lord is. If you want to become a good Lord, then you will need to learn how to become a good pretender first.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Did you… endure all of it? The fear and the loneliness? Alone? The words that you’re speaking right now… are only those spoken by the truly experienced.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">She really couldn’t see through him. The only thing she knew about Kang Chul-In was that he was the one that radiated overwhelming imposingness as well as a tough strongness.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“One more thing,” he continued.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Although you shouldn’t avoid and hate killing, you should never enjoy it. Although there’s only a minuscule difference, that’s what differentiates a Lord and a murderer. Always remember this. The words of a Lord can influence another’s life and death.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">She could somewhat understand what Kang Chul-In meant.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Endure and be strong.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Although deciding to do so or not is your choice, Lee Chae-Rin,” he thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He had no more advice. He had no more to say and no more he wanted to say either.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It’s time to join in’</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">While she was trying to calm herself down, Kang Chul-In realized that it was finally time for him to join in the fight.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">At this moment, Billy shouted across the hall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Don’t fight them directly! These guys, they have stupidly strong strength!”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It was true.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If an average adult human male struggled with holding up 100kg, an adult male dwarf would be able to hold up over 200kg.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This was the difference in muscle mass and genetics; the dwarves that averaged around only 150cm tall (which is around 4’9) weighed 30 kg more than a healthy, tall human.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Long story short, dwarves were 1.5-2 times stronger than humans.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“What the f*ck?! How come these damned dwarf bastards are so strong?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Billy shouted and aimed for a member of the Iron Hammer group.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">TENG!</span></em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The sound of metal hitting metal rang throughout the whole hall.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Kuk…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Billy, who was over 190cm tall (which is around 6’2), was knocked over. The hand that held the mace had blood splattered everywhere, though by some miracle, he had managed to hold onto it.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Seeing this scene, a few dwarves took this opportunity and ran towards Billy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Oh sh*t.</span></em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;He tried to move his body, but it wouldn’t move. At this rate, there was no doubt that his head would split into two after the impact of the hammer.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Get out.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">At that moment, Kang Chul-In appeared and bodyslammed Billy away and faced the two dwarves running towards them.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Speed, precision over strength.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In’s eyes gleamed like those of a hawk.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Pukk…</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The rapier that Chae-Rin bought for Kang Chul-In showed its power as it precisely drilled into the area where the dwarf’s helmet had a gap.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“KUH!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Blood splattered out from the inside of the helmet.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But even after the dwarf became fatally injured, he tried to move towards Kang Chul-In. As expected of a dwarf, his mentality was something that deserved praise.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But the opponent was too strong.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Then take this.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In, who held the rapier in his right hand, dashed towards that dwarf in a lightning-quick manner and stabbed the dwarf multiple times, quickly ending his life.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In a space of not even a second, 4 unbelievably fast strikes hit the dwarf on his mouth. Instead of just piercing through the mouth, it even went through his tough skull.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Leader…”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Billy, whom Kang Chul-In had saved, looked at him as if he were Billy’s wife.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hmm, this seems usable.</span></em><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In was pretty satisfied with the new rapier, Punto, that he had received.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This item was meant purely for stabbing, and it also had an option to allow his attacking speed to rise by 20%, allowing him to aim for the weak spots of the dwarves easily.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Of course, to use this item to its fullest potential, the user itself had to be skilled in the way of the sword and had to stab absolutely precisely and perfectly, matching the timing as well as the area where he stabbed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Although, this didn’t matter to Kang Chul-In, who was proficient in swordplay.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Billy.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After instantly killing two of the Iron Hammer group, Kang Chul-In spoke.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Yes, leader!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Billy who had fallen down earlier stood back up.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“We need to end this quickly. We don’t have time.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">And he dashed off.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This wasn’t the only problem.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In an hour, he needed to use Lee Chae-Rin’s newly purchased units to purge absolutely all of the traitors and high-ranking members of her territory.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Finish this within 5 minutes.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After deciding on his goal, he used the mana that was stored inside of him to go into the state of Overdrive.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">POW!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In alone wreaked havoc among the dwarves, injuring all the dwarves that seemed to have an advantage against the adventurers.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But there were no instances where he personally finished them off.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He just needed to help his allies to make it an advantageous fight for them.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The reason was because his “Overdrive” effect only lasted for a single minute.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But that in itself was enough to lead his allies to victory.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">By the time the effect was over, the fight that was once even was now heavily in the favor of the adventurers.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“T-that monster…!” Sledge could not believe the situation right now.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Iron Hammer group. The elite force of Dorado began falling one by one. The Sledge that believed in his own military might felt like the sky was falling down on him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But there was no time for regrets.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">...Because that was already the past.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">KUHK!</span></em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After the final member of the Iron Hammer group fell to Billy’s repeated attacks, Sledge felt dread and hopelessness inside of him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“P-please… Spare me!”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Sage Majestic had knelt down and had given up on his dwarf’s pride, wanting to survive.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“UGH...KUHK!”&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Meanwhile, General Smith already lost both of his arms and was throwing up blood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">And the spy, Entwan, was already rolling on the floor, his corpse missing its head.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Over. It was all over.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“It seems like I’ve found someone who is going to be usable in the future,” Kang Chul-In thought of the “Death List” that Lee Chae-Rin had written earlier and marveled.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The “Death List” was just to test her willingness to kill and was nothing but a piece of tissue paper.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But… the list that Lee Chae-Rin wrote perfectly corresponded to the high-ranking members of the Dorado territory.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Surprising.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This was proof that his eye for talent had not faded and that Lee Chae-Rin truly had hope of surviving in the Pandemonium region in the future.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Not bad. She’s someone who could be useful if I ally with her. I’ll make sure to keep tabs on her and check up on her after this.</span></em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;But while he was thinking of this, Sledge started moving.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“You disgusting B*TCH!”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Holding his fearsome hammer, Sledge started running towards Lee Chae-Rin at a fearsome speed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Ms. Chae-Rin! Be careful!”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Although Billy desperately tried to chase Sledge, he was too late. Sledge had almost arrived in front of her.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It was dangerous.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If Lee Chae-Rin’s small head took the brunt of that hammer, there was no doubt at all that she would perish instantly. However…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“How dare you.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Suddenly, Podolski appeared out of nowhere and bound Sledge’s right ankle up with a whip.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“ARGH!”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">‘BANG!’</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As if he had fallen into a hunting trap, Sledge’s body did a 360 turn in the air and fell to the ground.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Is it over?” Kang Chul-In looked around the hall.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">There was no one alive whose name was written down on the list by now. Even the Iron Hammer group that Sledge had put so much faith in was all lying on the floor by now, dead.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The only one who was alive now was Sledge.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Billy.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Yes, leader.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Get rid of the corpses. And don’t let anyone move a muscle or speak from the ones that are alive.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Just leave it to me!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The adventurers all started moving, following his orders.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Traitor.” Kang Chul-In put his rapier on Sledge’s forehead, making a drop of blood fall from his forehead down to his lips.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“And how should I kill you?” Looking at Sledge, Kang Chul-In’s gaze was frostier than a glacier.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">No, it was closer to rage than a cold expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He was a man who never accepted betrayal. Especially if it was against one’s own Lord.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Not only that, but the one who should be taking care of the Lord the best, the Secretary, was the one who led the charge against his Lord. Before he had been reborn, it was not a rare sight to see some Lords married with their secretaries. So seeing this, how could he not be angered?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“You… dirty human!” Sledge looked at Kang Chul-In wrathfully.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“To think that you plotted against me with that stupid b*tch… You will fall into the depths of hell! You will die unknown in a desert. Your parents’ necks will be wrung by the hands of your enemies, and your children will become slaves of your enemies and be humiliated!!!” He had started cursing at Kang Chul-In.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“If you’re going to curse, at least try to make it more detestable.” Kang Chul-In didn’t even snort.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Oi, traitor.” Kang Chul-In gave Sledge a terrifying smile.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“There are over hundreds and thousands of guys like you, who cursed me to death.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Out of the past Lords, if they made a ranking to see who had gotten the most hate, Kang Chul-In would definitely be at the forefront.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Because he was the greatest “villain”. After all, there was a reason that the fact that his name was synonymous with “the strongest” and also “the most evil”.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“But do you know what happened to the ones who did curse me?” Kang Chul-In clenched his two fists.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">And…</span></p>
 <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He started to violently beat up Sledge.&nbsp;</span></p>
