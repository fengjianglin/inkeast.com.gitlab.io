 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

 <p><em>The enemy’s military doesn’t seem like much, but I don’t know why I feel so uneasy.</em></p>
 <p>Timothy was in a dilemma.</p>
 <p>Although he’d sent seven scout hawks over the last two days, Laputa’s military force looked mediocre at best, if not a joke.</p>
 <p>If military power was the only factor, the victory of the Burrows would be a given.</p>
 <p>The basic specs of the Burrows were overwhelmingly better than Laputa’s.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In’s territory, Laputa, was composed primarily by humans, but the Burrow lands comprised of ants, moles, centipedes, mole crickets, and others that lived primarily in the soil. If a war broke out, an overwhelming victory was to be expected.</p>
 <p>But he felt uneasy.</p>
 <p>In Kang Chul-In’s territory, it was hard to find any big threats, but this was commonly called “having a bad feeling”. Timothy did not feel too good about this impulsive and reckless battle.</p>
 <p>“It is difficult. Very difficult.”</p>
 <p>Timothy let out a long sigh.</p>
 <p>It was understandable because Timothy’s specialty was [Administration], and so he was an Secretary best suited for paperwork. Thus, he was not too competent regarding war tactics.</p>
 <p>Even so, he could not leave things to Lord Kimura either.</p>
 <p>Kimura knew nothing.</p>
 <p>He was immersed in role-playing and wanted to be king, labeling himself “Shogun”, “Great Warrior”, and other things Timothy could not understand. He was a typical tyrant, a young tyrant at that.</p>
 <p>“Sigh… my fate!”</p>
 <p>A long sigh came from the old Goblin’s mouth.</p>
 <p>They definitely had the upper hand terms of military force, but he could not shake the uneasiness that overcame him. It was as if he was about to poke a beehive.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>However, there wasn’t any solid excuse for him to convince Kimura to give up on war either. If he had a good enough excuse, it would be worth it to manipulate and convince him. However, their superiority in numbers was so clear that there wasn’t any foundation in telling Kimura to give up on battle.</p>
 <p>It was then.</p>
 <p>A pretty good idea crossed the old Goblin’s mind.</p>
 <p>“That’s it!”</p>
 <p>It was quite a good idea.</p>
 <p><em>This will do! I could make a reasonable argument!</em></p>
 <p>Timothy smiled widely and went to seek his Lord, Kimura.</p>
 <p>“Bastard! How dare you shoot an arrow at me?!”</p>
 <p>Kimura was drinking honey water in the Lord Hall located deep underground and was grinding his teeth thinking about Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>“Shogun!”</p>
 <p>“What, Goblin.”</p>
 <p>“Could you send me as a diplomat?”</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>Kimura tilted his head as if asking him what kind of a dumb question that was.</p>
 <p>“Why would we send something like that? We can just invade!”</p>
 <p>“There are rules in battle as well.”</p>
 <p>“Rules?”</p>
 <p>Kimura squinted and furrowed his brow at Timothy.</p>
 <p>“Although he is the enemy, there are basic rules that one needs to follow.”</p>
 <p>“Stop saying things that are difficult to understand, you stupid Goblin!”</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
 <p>“So, what’s your point?”</p>
 <p>“As the old saying goes, the best victory is won without a fight.”</p>
 <p>“Hmm… yes, that is true.”</p>
 <p>Kimura nodded.</p>
 <p>What Timothy said, anyone heard at least once, and it was a line from “Art of War”. Although the world was different, it seemed that a victory acquired without a fight was valuable in both worlds.</p>
 <p>“If you send me as a diplomat, I will offer the Lord who wronged you the chance to surrender.”</p>
 <p>“Surrender?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, Shogun. If you offer them the chance to surrender and they accept, wouldn’t we be able to win without shedding any blood? It won’t be easy, but since our military strength is much greater, there is a chance.”</p>
 <p>“Hm…”</p>
 <p>Kimura seemed half-convinced, so Timothy took the opportunity to continue.</p>
 <p>“Even if the opponent does not agree to surrender, wouldn’t it be an advantage for me to go as a diplomat anyway?”</p>
 <p>“Advantage? What advantage?”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Lord or not, Timothy was about to scream, “Why do you live with a head if you have no brain!?”</p>
 <p>This was not just an issue of age.</p>
 <p>The human himself was just stupid and did not think much.</p>
 <p>In the Secretary’s position, his patience was tested again and again.</p>
 <p><em>I must endure it. This is my Lord… I must…</em></p>
 <p>Timothy persevered with all that he had and held in his anger. With a gentle and polite tone, he spoke to Kimura.</p>
 <p>“First, sending a diplomat shows that our Burrow lands are civilized and will not just use force. It is a show of sorts.”</p>
 <p>“Is that it?”</p>
 <p>“Of course not, my Lord! A diplomat is a legal spy. While I ask for surrender, I will also gather intel on the enemy. Wouldn’t it be more accurate to see it with my own two eyes instead of using expensive scout hawks?”</p>
 <p>“Hmm… I guess you are right as well.”</p>
 <p>When Kimura seemed to agree, Timothy showed a relieved expression.</p>
 <p>“And also, war is not just invading whenever you want but making a declaration first. It is a savage thing to do to just wage war without any warning. Aren’t you a good and wise leader, Shogun?”</p>
 <p>“Hmm… yes, that is also true.”</p>
 <p>“If you trust and leave it to me, although I cannot guarantee surrender, I will at least bring back good intel.”</p>
 <p>Kimura was manipulated by Timothy’s words and allowed him to leave.</p>
 <p>“Ha. You make sure to tell that Lord. If he does not surrender, he will face hell.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, of course. Hehe~ Then, I will be back, Shogun.”</p>
 <p>Timothy cheered on the inside after finally getting approval.</p>
 <p><em>It is done!</em></p>
 <p>Honestly, Timothy did not want this rash, unprepared war. Therefore, saying that he would offer a chance to surrender was just to convince Kimura.</p>
 <p>Timothy’s intention was as follows.</p>
 <p>He would go but would then come up with an excuse to make Kimura give up on war such as saying that the enemy had a secret army or weapon that they were concealing.</p>
 <p>Timothy knew that war was not child’s play.</p>
 <p>In addition, he wanted to visit Kang Chul-In’s territory and relieve the unknown uneasiness that was consuming him. However, his delight was short-lived.</p>
 <p><em>Sorry, Shogun, but Timothy is prepared to sin if it’s for the safety of the Shogun and the land!</em></p>
 <p>Timothy apologized to his Lord Kimura inwardly.</p>
 <p>Intentions aside, Timothy’s actions were undermining Lord Kimura, so he felt guilty.</p>
 <p>“Sigh… I hope the Shogun would soon become a wise and decisive leader.”</p>
 <p>Timothy mumbled and headed towards Kang Chul-In’s territory.</p>
 <p>That afternoon.</p>
 <p>Timothy went to Laputa as the diplomat for the Burrow lands. He was able to meet the Lord of Laputa, Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>“So, it was just a patrol of the surroundings, and you had no other intentions?”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In, sitting on his throne, showed an interested expression.</p>
 <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
 <p>“Oh ho, that’s funny.”</p>
 <p>“Sir?”</p>
 <p>“I wonder who would use seven of those expensive scout hawks to just patrol. And patrol just my territory… are you overflowing with gold?”</p>
 <p>Timothy was speechless at Kang Chul-In’s sharp response and started to make an excuse.</p>
 <p>“It’s not that! The Lord of the Burrows wants peace! It’s just that our lands are so close together, so we are just preparing for unforeseen events. Yes, it’s just that.”</p>
 <p>“Unforeseen events?”</p>
 <p>“I would be very grateful if you would think of it as a patrol for purely defensive reasons. Shogun Kimura promised that there won’t be any more of these situations in the future. Please, this time…”</p>
 <p>“Stop.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In stopped Timothy mid-sentence.</p>
 <p>“What did you just say? Say it again.”</p>
 <p>“Sir?”</p>
 <p>“Kimura? Shogun?”</p>
 <p>“Ah, yes. The Lord of the Burrows wishes to be called Shogun instead of Lord.”</p>
 <p>“HAHAHAHAHA!!”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In exploded in laughter.</p>
 <p>Timothy did not understand Kang Chul-In’s sudden laughter.</p>
 <p>The Kang Chul-In that he saw was not someone who would laugh in a formal situation like this. Even with just a glance, he could tell that Kang Chul-In was filled with authority and dignity as he just sat on his throne. However, he had laughed. Timothy could not understand why.</p>
 <p>“Lord, may I ask why you are laughing?”</p>
 <p>“I laughed because it was funny. Do I need another reason?”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In answered.</p>
 <p>“Which part is funny?”</p>
 <p>Discomfort filled Timothy’s face. Although Kimura was incompetent and showed signs of being a tyrant, he was Timothy’s Lord. In Timothy’s position as a loyal Secretary, it was right to feel offended. However, Kang Chul-In asked again with a smirk, disregarding Timothy’s feelings.</p>
 <p>“Your Lord asked to be called Shogun?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, Lord. Shogun Kimura.”</p>
 <p>“Ha, he’s a crazy bastard.”</p>
 <p>“Sir?”</p>
 <p>“Your Lord is the craziest of the crazy, a little rascal.”</p>
 <p>Timothy’s face hardened at Kang Chul-In’s words.</p>
 <p>“Lord, your words are an insult to the Lord of the Burrow lands.”</p>
 <p>“I call a crazy bastard crazy. What else am I supposed to call him?”</p>
 <p>“Lord!”</p>
 <p>“Maybe I should call him something different. Idiot? Mentally retarded? They said Pandemonium is filled with crazy retards, and it turns out to be true.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In snorted as if this situation was absurd.</p>
 <p>It was an expected response.</p>
 <p>Maybe if Kang Chul-In was a different race, it would have been different. But as a Korean, he couldn’t help but view the Kimura who called himself Shogun as crazy.</p>
 <p>Shogun.</p>
 <p>It was the most important position of the military government and was held by Japan’s supreme ruler in medieval times. Despite the other being Japanese, Kang Chul-In didn’t imagine that there would be anyone shameless enough to call himself Shogun. However, Timothy, who did not know this, had no choice but to be upset.</p>
 <p>“Lord! Although Shogun Kimura is young, he is the ruler of a territory! If you insult my land’s ruler in a formal setting like this…”</p>
 <p>“What, are you going to go to war or something?”</p>
 <p>“Lord! How can you say such violent things? As I said previously, Kimura Shogun wishes for peace.”</p>
 <p>“Stop.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In stopped Timothy and said in a calm voice with authority.</p>
 <p>“Timothy, you said? Do not insult me with such lies.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Timothy froze due to the stare from the man sitting on the throne.</p>
 <p><em>Huk!</em></p>
 <p>The stare looking down was not that of a criminal. It was like a predator with its prey in front of it.</p>
 <p><em>T-this man is different from the Shogun.</em></p>
 <p>Timothy did not want to admit it, but he needed to accept that the man in front of him had a much larger presence than Kimura.</p>
 <p>The aura itself was different.</p>
 <p>It was as if he was born to be king. The throne suited him. This kind of man spoke with authority, so it was expected that Timothy was suppressed and speechless.</p>
 <p><em>Timothy, remain calm! Wake up! Your Shogun was insulted! If you lower your tail here, it is the same as the Shogun losing!</em></p>
 <p>Timothy tried to be strong. He was trying to be a competent Secretary.</p>
 <p>“Lord, although you are upset, your words are too harsh. I would like you to apologize to Shogun Kimura, my Lord. If you don’t, the Burrow lands will declare war.”</p>
 <p>It was then.</p>
 <p>Before Timothy finished his sentence, Commander James hurried into the Lord Hall and bowed to Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>“My Lord, I need to report immediately.”</p>
 <p>“What is it?”</p>
 <p>“The enemy has moved from the underground and has begun to advance into our territory!”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Timothy felt his world turn upside down and wished to bite his tongue.</p>
 <p><em>He could not wait that much! That wretched…</em></p>
 <p>As Timothy was thinking this, Kang Chul-In smirked and turned towards Timothy.</p>
 <p>“What were you saying? Continue with what you were saying.”</p>
 <p>What was happening? Timothy could not raise his head due to his embarrassment.</p>
 <p>“From this point forward, our Burrow lands are declaring war on you, Lord.”</p>
 <p>Timothy announced war with his head still bowed. It was a play to be written in history where the declaration and release of troops happened simultaneously.</p>
