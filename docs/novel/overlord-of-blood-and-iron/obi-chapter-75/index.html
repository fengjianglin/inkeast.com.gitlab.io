 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

</div>
<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>As the gates opened, the golden glow from inside slowly faded, revealing what was inside.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>‘Akan’s hall?’</p>
 <p>Looking inside, Kang Chul-In recalled the Hall, where the Great Summoning had occurred, and where the future ‘Lord Meetings’ would also occur.</p>
 <p>Yes.</p>
 <p>Looking inside, the interior was almost the same as the hall of Akan, ‘the messenger of god’. It was a structure that used both Gothic and Baroque as influences to build.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Ancient Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Akan’s hall, the current ‘Royal Palace’, and the dungeons that Kang Chul-In had faced previously…</p>
 <p>All of the most important, key ‘things’ were all related to the Ancient Kingdom.</p>
 <p>The true rulers of the continent from 1000 years ago. The remains of the kingdom were just about to test Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>Come.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>A serious, heavy voice could be heard from behind the doors.</p>
 <p>“Come?”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In snorted, and ignored the voice.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“How dare you!.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;pleased.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not even the president of the United States, or China could tell him to do so, he would smack them in the face if they did.</p>
 <p>And telling someone like this to ‘come’?</p>
 <p>To Kang Chul-In, this was blatant mockery. Arrogance was ingrained inside Kang Chul-In, and it was one of the key factors that made up who he was.</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>Arrogant one, you will pay the price with your death.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The heavy voice answered Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>BAM!</p>
 <p>And suddenly, a giant broadsword appeared, and hit the floor of the hall.</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>The Lord of Laputa will be humble, and will always look forward to everything like they are challenging an opponent.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Inside the hall, a knight that had white armor spoke, with the same heavy voice.</p>
 <p>‘An ‘immortal knight’.’</p>
 <p>Looking at it, Kang Chul-In could tell what it was.</p>
 <p>An immortal knight was a high ranked unit, that was at least level 100.</p>
 <p>This immortal knight was at least a few stages higher than a death knight, and if the death knight was a knight made of the darkness attribute from a necromancer, an immortal knight was a knight of the light attribute composed purely of mana, allowing it to keep the appearance of a person before death.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And to the current Kang Chul-In and his fellow ‘explorers’, this was a disaster.</p>
 <p>“I-Is that the final boss?”</p>
 <p>Dorain was startled at the sight of the immortal knight, who stood at 3m.</p>
 <p>“No.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In shook his head.</p>
 <p>Although the immortal knight was truly powerful and could definitely be the boss of a difficult dungeon, this was not it.</p>
 <p>“Look behind.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In pointed further beyond the immortal knight.</p>
 <p>“The altar… the door…”</p>
 <p>James was startled.</p>
 <p>“M-Milord… The knight is not the final boss…”</p>
 <p>Lucia was also surprised.</p>
 <p>“This guy, he’s just a middle boss. The real boss… is behind him.”</p>
 <p>To think that the named immortal knight would just be a checkpoint in a dungeon, it was scary to think what kind of existenceexistance was beyond the door.</p>
 <p>‘But there might be hope’.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Because the immortal knight here was of the light attribute, there was still a faint chance that the children of Laputa might still be alive.</p>
 <p>Why was that? Well, there were very few true ‘psychopaths’ that used the light attribute.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Whoosh! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a bunch of blackish currents started swirling…</p>
 <p>And…</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>Suddenly, over 50 ‘Spectre Knights’; which were higher ranked versions of the death knights appeared.</p>
 <p>“Hu....” Kang Chul-In sighed deeply.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Now, show me what that stupid test of yours is.”</p>
 <p>And he stepped forward.</p>
 <p>“Chul-In!”</p>
 <p>“Milord!”</p>
 <p>“Milord, not by yourself…”</p>
 <p>But while Dorian, Lucia and James were worried about Kang Chul-In....</p>
 <p>“Kuku… how could the ghosts of the kingdom dare to touch his majesty.”</p>
 <p>Nilus was laughing, just looking at this situation from the sidelines.</p>
 <p>‘We cannot win anyway. I have to go fight myself.’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In was aware that if they fought against the immortal knight, and the 50 spectre knights, they would undoubtedly be wiped out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Although the enemies were lowered by 50 levels due to his circumstances, they were undoubtedly powerful.</p>
 <p>50 spectre knights that were level 40, as well as an immortal knight that was level 50. Rather than fighting head-on to their deaths, it would be better to just hear the contents of the ‘test’.</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>The test is…</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The immortal knight opened its mouth.</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>Defeat me, and prove yourself worthy as the true owner of Laputa.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>It was simpler than expected.</p>
 <p>“And my subordinates?”</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>They will be… hostages.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>“Hostages?”</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>I will begin the test.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>… and as the words left his mouth.</p>
 <p>“They’re coming!”</p>
 <p>“I’ll take the front!”</p>
 <p>“I’ll defend the left flank!”</p>
 <p>The spectre knights charges straight towards Kang Chul-In’s friend, and subordinates.</p>
 <p>“You’re going to take my people hostage right in front of me?”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In’s eyes turned blue from rage.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>‘Ahh… milord… always, always trying to carry all of the weight by himself…’</p>
 <p>Looking at Kang Chul-In running towards the immortal knight looked very sad and desolate to Lucia, and she felt her heart ripping. To her, all she wanted to do was help Kang Chul-In with some of his responsibilities, as the secretary.</p>
 <p>“How dare you!”</p>
 <p>And as Lucia shouted…</p>
 <p>[War Machine Mode, R.E.A.D.Y.]</p>
 <p>Turning on the War Machine mode, Lucia started pouring down attacks relentlessly against the Spectre Knights.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In was struggling.</p>
 <p>‘I’m losing in terms of power.’</p>
 <p>Between the 3m tall immortal knight and the 183cm Kang Chul-In, there was obviously a disparity in strength.</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>Is this all you’ve got to show?</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Although the immortal knight had its level lowered by 50, it was able to easily block off Kang Chul-In’s attacks. This was not the problem of the levels of skill levels but the problem of the difference in basic attack and defense. Because…</p>
 <p>KAKANG! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Most of Kang Chul-In’s attacks were accurately ‘hitting’ the immortal knight’s back, legs, as well as the neck.&nbsp;</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>Fake Lord.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The immortal knight spoke insolently.</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>You do not have the qualifications nor the rights to possess the soul core of Laputa. Quickly, give it to me.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Rage seeping into Kang Chul-In; he activated Overdrive as well as Sword Light at the same time. However…</p>
 <p>The strength of the immortal knight suddenly surged, and it swung it’s broadsword that was now full of starlight.</p>
 <p>‘This guy is getting stronger too?’</p>
 <p>It was strange.</p>
 <p>BANG!</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In and the immortal knight’s clashed against each other.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Kuk…”</p>
 <p>And Kang Chul-In was pushed back by 5 meters. He had lost in terms of strength even after using Overdrive.</p>
 <p>“Cough!”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In coughed out blood. The violent and impactful clash between the two swords caused a great shock and strain on his body.</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>Look.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The immortal knight suddenly pointed backwards.</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>Your friends are in danger.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Just like the immortal knight was saying, Dorian, Lucia, Nilus, and James were all pushed to the brink of death.</p>
 <p>If Lucia’s War Machine Mode turned off, they would definitely crumble.</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>Give up. If you give up, you can live.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The immortal knight instead asked him to surrender.</p>
 <p>‘Overdrive, Phase Two.’</p>
 <p>But instead of listening, Kang Chul-In activated the second phase of Overdrive.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>If the first phase Overdrive used mana as a resource to boost one’s capabilities by 40%, then phase two used mana as well as one’s life force to boost one’s capabilities by a whole 60%.</p>
 <p>But due to the fact that one’s life force was required to activate it, someone like Alfred was needed to help and heal from this loss.</p>
 <p>But right now, there wasn’t much choice left.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>To use ‘that ability’ he still required more levels. Right now, the only solution he had to the problem he was facing was to activate phase two Overdrive.</p>
 <p>Swoosh!</p>
 <p>Around Kang Chul-In formed a tornado of mana that could not be compared to the past Overdrives that he had used.</p>
 <p>“Stop with your bull**** and farce.”</p>
 <p>And Kang Chul-In, with his 60% increase in abilities, swung his sword towards the immortal knight once more, with Sword Light also activated.</p>
 <p>And at that moment! &nbsp;</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>You cannot defeat me.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The immortal knight once more started becoming stronger, and showed an enormous pressure. It was clear that he had a slight edge over Kang Chul-In, even in his phase two Overdrive.</p>
 <p>‘This doesn’t make any sense…’</p>
 <p>Becoming stronger as the opponent got stronger? Was there an existence that had an ability like this?</p>
 <p>If this immortal knight truly got stronger as an opponent got stronger, then even the Kang Chul-In of the past would find it difficult to defeat it.</p>
 <p>‘Danger!’</p>
 <p>And as the two swords collided against each other…</p>
 <p>CLANG!</p>
 <p>Ifrita, Kang Chul-In’s sword, was shattered into pieces.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And the immortal knight didn’t give Kang Chul-In time to get back into position.</p>
 <p>‘I won’t be able to avoid the next strike.’</p>
 <p>The immortal knight, who managed to get in front of Kang Chul-In brandished its fist, which was almost as big as a person’s head.</p>
 <p>BANG! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In, who was struck by the punch of the immortal knight, was flung back onto the altar.</p>
 <p>“Kuk…”</p>
 <p>And pointing directly at the Kang Chul-In that was on the floor was a sword that was at least 30cm thick.</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>Fake Lord, you are not capable to be the true ruler of Laputa. Admit that you are an imposter, and beg for your life. If you do so, you and your companions will be spared.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>It was the worst humiliation that Kang Chul-In faced.</p>
 <p>Even in his past life, there was no existence that could overpower him like this. He had not seen or heard of an opponent that would follow their opponents, and become stronger as they did.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Milord!”</p>
 <p>Lucia despaired, while being surrounded simultaneously by 8 spectre knights.</p>
 <p>“Hey, you son of a *****! What the hell do you think you’re doing to my friend?!”</p>
 <p>Dorian was the same.</p>
 <p>“Mi-Milord… I… this servant… could not protect…”</p>
 <p>James cried, already half dead from the wounds that he had received.</p>
 <p>Nilus…</p>
 <p>“Kuku… these things that will kneel in front of his majesty sooner or later are still showing off.”</p>
 <p>…was still unable to face reality even after being beaten up like a rag doll. The belief that he had in Kang Chul-In was so strong that he couldn’t feel any sense of danger.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile Kang Chul-In…</p>
 <p>‘There’s no choice but to use it.’</p>
 <p>Was thinking of the final trump card that he had.</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>Will you still not surrender?</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The monster-like immortal knight that grew stronger with its opponent started walking towards Kang Chul-In again, once again offering him to surrender.</p>
 <p>‘Sword… I don’t have a sword.’</p>
 <p>But Kang Chul-In completely ignored what the immortal knight was saying.</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>If you do not surrender, I will kill your companions. Kneel, and admit that you are just an imposter.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>“I hear all kinds of bull**** while living, huh?”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In spoke with a voice full of murderous intent. And in his eyes there was a dangerousness that could not be seen after he had reincarnated.</p>
 <p>Even though his current state was pitiful… Kang Chul-In didn’t feel any fear.</p>
 <p>“Shut up with your bull****.”</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>…….!</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Kang Chul-In laughed at the immortal knight.</p>
 <p>“Do you really think that your stupid blackmailing would work against me? Kill them if you will.”</p>
 <p>Was there a Lord like that? No.</p>
 <p>If there was a Lord like that, then they would truly be the ones without the qualifications to be a Lord.</p>
 <p>A Lord was an existence that was supposed to be on top of a tower of bones and blood, and was one that was always supposed to be selfish. Kang Chul-In thought that it would be better to die than to beg for his life and say that he was a fake Lord.</p>
 <p>Before reincarnating, Kang Chul-In was someone that was arrogant even moments before Rothschild had chopped his head off. There was no way that threats of this level would work against him.&nbsp;</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>Imposter, at least your attitude…</li>
 </ul>
 <p>And at that moment.</p>
 <p>BANG! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In suddenly stood up, and kicked the midriff section of the immortal knight, pushing it away. He was buying time with a sneak attack.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>‘Sword, I need a sword!’</p>
 <p>He had no intention of fighting barehanded against the immortal knight. He was already pushed against the brink, and he needed a sword to defend himself.</p>
 <p>“Your highness! Your highness’s sword is there!”</p>
 <p>Nilus pointed towards the altar that was ruined from the impact of the collision earlier.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>‘My sword?’</p>
 <p>Although turning away one’s attention during battle was fatal and definitely suicide, Kang Chul-In was lead by a sort of ‘desire’ to turn his head, and unintentionally turned his head.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And there… was a sword that had a peculiar shape that he had never once seen before. It seemed like it was inside the altar, and only revealed itself after the altar was destroyed.</p>
 <p>Dugeun!</p>
 <p>His heart started fluttering.</p>
 <p>Dugeun!</p>
 <p>It was beating intensely.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>‘It’s calling me’.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In instinctively felt that the sword was calling him.</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>Imposter.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The immortal knight spoke again.&nbsp;</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>Do not be greedy. That object is only for the true Lord of Laputa to have. It is not someone like you to…</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Kang Chul-In once again completely ignore what the immortal knight was saying.</p>
 <p>The true Lord of Laputa?</p>
 <p>That was Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>Even though the immortal knight continued to deny the fact that Kang Chul-In was in fact the true owner of Laputa, he was not at all shaken. If he was not the true Lord of Laputa, then who was?</p>
 <p>‘Although this doesn’t make any sense…’</p>
 <p>Walking towards the sword, Kang Chul-In felt that the dungeon and the sword was the thing that led him here. Although he didn’t believe in destiny and fate, and even refused to believe in it, this time around he was thinking that it might be the work of fate.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In got close to the sword.</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>One without the qualifications, if you touch the sword a disaster…</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Although the immortal knight warned him…</p>
 <p>Ignoring the immortal knight, he grabbed the sword with his bloodstained hands. The feeling when he grabbed it was as if he was meeting with an old friend of his.</p>
