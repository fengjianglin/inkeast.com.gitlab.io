 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

 <p>The blast was massive, and a battle ogre, along with two troll shieldsmen fell down, taking the brunt of the impact.</p>
 <p>“Huu…”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In took a deep breath, regaining his composure.</p>
 <p>Although his state was a mess, he wasn’t really injured.</p>
 <p>“Good. Lucia, get ready. We will go again.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In stared at his, showing his faith towards Lucia’s defense.</p>
 <p>‘Milord… milord… He’s relying on me!’</p>
 <p>Lucia was absolutely blissful at this moment, and felt like she would fly away.</p>
 <p>But she didn’t have time to daydream, and she quickly regained her focus.</p>
 <p>“Let’s go.”</p>
 <p>And saying this, Kang Chul-In lept towards another Atlas, Lucia right behind him.</p>
 <p>‘It’s only a low level Atlas.’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In laughed in anger.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>And he had the confidence to laugh. Although the Atlas was a terrifyingly strong Magic Weapon, it also had its weaknesses. Otherwise, it would have been invincible.</p>
 <p>And the reason that he had been able to destroy the Atlas earlier was because he had used the Atlas’s own weakness against it.</p>
 <p>Unlike normal Golems, an Atlas had joints that connected its main body to its’ ‘arms and legs’, in order to let it move more freely. But these joints were also the weaknesses, as they were vulnerable to attacks.</p>
 <p>And knowing this, Kang Chul-In stabbed Kaiforce, which he had transformed into a sharp claw. And then he used Intraburst.</p>
 <p>And if he used mana which would explode to contact a Magic Gem, which was the fuel for the Atlas, what would happen?</p>
 <p>A big explosion like earlier.</p>
 <p>And using this method again, another Atlas was broken, and the impact of the explosion tanked by Lucia’s shield, Aegis.</p>
 <p>‘Hmph… Let’s see how good you feel now, bastard.’ Kang Chul-In thought to himself, quietly smirking.</p>
 <p>----</p>
 <p>And just like Kang Chul-In thought, the owner of the Atlases, Franz, was trembling in rage.</p>
 <p>“M-M-My precious Atlases…”</p>
 <p>Although the price to keep an Atlas running was astronomical, the thing that hurt him the most was the Magic Gem, which was the engine of the Atlas. And he only had two remaining Magic Gems in his territory.</p>
 <p>It was the first practice run too.</p>
 <p>It had only been a week since he had succeeded in designing an Atlas, and this was the practice run in which he would reassure himself and his confidence. But…</p>
 <p>BOOM!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As another Atlas blew up, Franz felt like something also blew up in his mind.</p>
 <p>“Uuuu… Uuu…”</p>
 <p>“Milord… If we go on like this… it’s possible that we may lose all of…”</p>
 <p>“I know!”</p>
 <p>“Please make them retreat. We will not gain any benefits by continuing our attack against them.”</p>
 <p>“Fine. Retreat.”</p>
 <p>And Franz sighed, as he made the correct decision, to retreat using his Soul Core.</p>
 <p>----</p>
 <p>“Chase.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In had no intention of letting the enemy go so easily after what they had done.</p>
 <p>“B-But milord… the Atlases are too quick…”</p>
 <p>“At least we should try, though. Don’t you think?”</p>
 <p>And saying that, Kang Chul-In lifted Lucia in his arms, before chasing the Atlases that were running away.</p>
 <p>And as they were chasing…</p>
 <p>“Milord! Look over there!”</p>
 <p>Lucia pointed to where the Atlases were running towards.</p>
 <p>And standing there was a man riding something that looked like a Motorbike, along with a Marionette. It was the Lord who controlled the Atlases.</p>
 <p>Cr-Crack…</p>
 <p>But suddenly, around 700 meters away from them, the ground started splitting open, before an Igloo-shaped building rose out of the ground.</p>
 <p>“We’ll stop here.”</p>
 <p>It was at that moment.</p>
 <p>“Hey, you stupid bastard! Come a few steps closer, I dare you! We’ll smash you to smithereens with our turrets if you do, though.”</p>
 <p>“T-That… Milord… what shall we do?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Today, we retreat.”</p>
 <p>“But… just retreating here isn’t good enough.”</p>
 <p>“Lucia. Can you lend me your blade for a while?”</p>
 <p>“Of course, but… May I ask why?”</p>
 <p>Lucia asked, as she handed her sword, Zenith to Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>“Sorry. I’ll return this to you in a month.”</p>
 <p>“...Sorry?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Swish! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>And the Sword started flying towards Franz in an absolutely fearsome speed. It was impossible to dodge for Franz, and it headed towards him like a bullet.</p>
 <p>At that moment! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Milord!”</p>
 <p>His secretary, the marionette shouted, and launched her body towards Franz, in an attempt to save him.</p>
 <p>Puk…</p>
 <p>And the sword pierced through her head.</p>
 <p>Bang!</p>
 <p>The marionette didn’t fall.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Instead… She hung across the wall like skewer, due to the fearsome power and speed that it travelled.</p>
 <p>“Marionette!”</p>
 <p>Franz shouted, in shock of the situation.</p>
 <p>‘I… nearly died…’</p>
 <p>Franz realised the severity of the situation, and gulped.</p>
 <p>How painful and depressing would it be to die, hanging on the wall like a skewer?</p>
 <p>“You there!”</p>
 <p>A loud voice interrupted Franz’s thoughts, and he looked at Kang Chul-In, still in a daze.</p>
 <p>“Look carefully.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In said, walking towards a boulder that was nearby.</p>
 <p>“If you get caught…”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In swung his fists, aiming it at the rock.</p>
 <p>BANG! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>And the rock, which was the size of an adult bull, cracked into nothing but dust.</p>
 <p>“Like this...”</p>
 <p>“I will break your skull.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In spoke, and Franz’s mouth opened in shock.&nbsp;</p>
