 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

 <p>Alex, Alex Rothschild. It was the bastard who had pierced Kang Chul-In’s heart and cut off his head.</p>
 <p><em>His face is still sickening, even the second time around.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In reevaluated his enemy’s face the moment he faced him.</p>
 <p>Alex Rothschild.</p>
 <p>His full name was Alexander Mayer von Rothschild.</p>
 <p>He was the descendant of the Rothschild family, well known in the finance world as an absolute colossus. Rothschild himself was in the top 0.01% of society as a Hollywood celebrity and as part of an extremely wealthy family. It was ironic that he fought battles upon battles and was on the brink of death countless times because of Kang Chul-In, a commoner from South Korea.</p>
 <p><em>If it were up to me, I would kill him right here… but Akan will not just watch.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In, with all he had, held in the burning desire to twist Alex Rothschild’s neck on the spot. Akan had disappeared from sight, but Kang Chul-In knew that he would be watching from somewhere. And there were also a lot of eyes on them. He could not murder in front of the 298 people other than himself and Rothschild. Although Kang Chul-In was not one to worry about others’ opinions of him, there was a right time for everything.</p>
 <p><em>Revenge is a dish best served cold.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In remembered the saying regarding revenge and sharpened his heart quietly. It was not wise to act rashly right now. It wasn’t the right time. Revenge worked best when one could plan every detail meticulously and was able to detach all human emotions. It would be more fun to impose the maximum humiliation as well.</p>
 <p>“Excuse me… can you speak English?”</p>
 <p>Rothschild, who was unaware of Kang Chul-In’s thoughts, smiled kindly at him and carefully asked.</p>
 <p><em>I feel like throwing up.</em></p>
 <p>As Kang Chul-In looked at the face of Rothschild that was filled with pretentious sincerity, he felt himself wanting to vomit. Although Rothschild acted like a gentleman that worked for the benefit of the majority, he was ruthless, cruel, and vile. Although it seemed like he was conversing with Kang Chul-In with no motive, he would have previously calculated this very moment. Rothschild, in the mind of Kang Chul-In, was like himself, if not crueler. Kang Chul-In had actually discovered a couple of evil deeds that Rothschild had committed in secret. It was a sort of hatred of one’s kind. Kang Chul-In had thought of Rothschild like himself and knew about his true self— therefore, he despised him. If Rothschild had admitted his wrongdoings, maybe the outcome would have been different, but it was not so, and therefore, Kang Chul-In hated this rich bastard.</p>
 <p>“You can’t speak English? Chinese? Japanese?” Rothschild asked, speaking in a multitude of languages.</p>
 <p>“Korean.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In answered.</p>
 <p>“Ah…!”</p>
 <p>Rothschild exclaimed as if he realized something amazing.</p>
 <p>He was able to understand.</p>
 <p>In Pangaea, language barriers did not exist. In whatever language one spoke, it was understood 100%.</p>
 <p>“I can hear it. Your words and that person’s words over there.”</p>
 <p>Rothschild pointed at the person talking loudly in Arabic. The Arabian was worshipping Allah and was preaching out loud about his religion.</p>
 <p>“This… is amazing! Assuming that it isn’t a dream, of course!”</p>
 <p>Rothschild was amazed.</p>
 <p>“It would be difficult if it was a dream.”</p>
 <p>“Excuse me?”</p>
 <p>“No, nothing.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In changed the subject from the answer that had come out unconsciously.</p>
 <p><em>Yes, if it was a dream, that would be difficult. Yes, it would. I need to kill you.</em></p>
 <p>As Kang Chul-In thought, Rothschild spoke again.</p>
 <p>“If it isn’t too much to ask, can you tell me how you got the information to pop up like that?”</p>
 <p>“It is not hard. Just look at it for 2-3 seconds, and it will open on its own.”</p>
 <p>“Ah, I see!”</p>
 <p>“If you got it, get lost. It makes me nauseous looking at your face.”</p>
 <p>Due to Kang Chul-In’s unexpected violent language, Rothschild’s face hardened, and his eyes seethed with rage. Kang Chul-In did not fail to take note of that brief moment. However, that visage quickly disappeared, and the polite person’s face returned.</p>
 <p>“Don’t you think that is a little bit over the top?”</p>
 <p>Rothschild’s face as he said those words was calm and collected. He was acting like a gentleman and not a rich heir of a powerful family.</p>
 <p>“What is over the top is your social managing. It would be right to frown a little as a human being if someone said something bad to you. Isn’t that so, Alex Rothschild?”</p>
 <p>Rothschild was taken aback hearing his name from an unfamiliar Asian man.</p>
 <p>“Do you know me?”</p>
 <p>“Any civilized person would have seen your face at least once. Entertainment reporters are busy writing about every little thing you do.”</p>
 <p>It was true.</p>
 <p>Alex Rothschild appeared very often on the media outlets for someone with the Rothschild family name. Dating a rich heiress, friend of an actor from a pro-wrestling background, charity benefits raising hundreds of thousands of dollars… The 24-year-old Rothschild was known not only in the U.S but also in the rest of the world.</p>
 <p>“Ah, that might be so. Unintentionally…”</p>
 <p>“What do you mean unintentionally? It’s probably is a foundation for you to get your feet into the movie industry. Aren’t you going to buy out 20th Century Fox?”</p>
 <p>Rothschild was definitely taken aback this time.</p>
 <p>Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, as mentioned by Kang Chul-In, was a major film production company, and the buyout deal was kept strictly confidential from the public or media. And yet, this young Asian man had known.</p>
 <p>“There is no such thing as a perfect secret.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In did not give Rothschild a chance to protest.</p>
 <p>“Whether it is business secrets or personality, I believe that all will be exposed at some point. What do you think?”</p>
 <p>Rothschild still could not come to his senses and kept quiet as if mute.</p>
 <p><em>Who in the world was this man?</em></p>
 <p><em>Knowing me, sure… but how did he know about the buyout deal with 20th Century Fox… that aside, his words bare teeth. As if he knows me well… who is he? Who are you?</em></p>
 <p>Rothschild ransacked his smart brain, the brain smart enough to major in business at Harvard, to find a point of contact with this unfamiliar Asian man.</p>
 <p><em>Where…!</em></p>
 <p>There was no way he could get an answer.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In had come from the past, and naturally, Rothschild could not find a connecting strand between the two of them.</p>
 <p><em>Spinning your brain again.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In, looking at Rothschild, had the devil’s smile on his face.</p>
 <p>“Well then, keep on thinking. I will be choosing my territory like Akan told us to do.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In, grinning widely to mock Rothschild, moved towards the models.</p>
 <p>“Wait! Who are you?!”</p>
 <p>Rothschild called for him, but Kang Chul-In did not even look back.</p>
 <p><em>Your smart little brain, think all you want. You won’t even be able to step on my shadow.</em></p>
 <p>A smile formed on Kang Chul-In’s face as his back faced Rothschild.</p>
 <p>This was enough for today.</p>
 <p>If he were to attack Rothschild who knew nothing, it would bring him no satisfaction. The revenge would not materialize.</p>
 <p><em>Just you wait. I will crush you slowly.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In pledged his revenge.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In left Rothschild behind and went through the trouble of looking at all 900 models carefully. It was a wise and clever choice. The territory that they were to choose in the hall was land that they would spend the rest of their lives on in Pangaea. It was key to be cautious and sure since it could not be changed.</p>
 <p>There were many territories that were potential candidates.</p>
 <p>[Stingray]</p>
 <p>Type: Airborne city</p>
 <p>Tendency: Conquest</p>
 <p>Location: Southeast, Hyperion Province</p>
 <p>Description: Land atop the back of the flying stingray</p>
 <p>Ability: Tactical weapon, Venom Gale</p>
 <p>Price: 8,700 gold</p>
 <p>The Stingray territory was able to release a poison called Venom Gale from its long tail and seemed very powerful. Biochemical attacks, both on Earth and Pangaea, had great destructive power. However, Kang Chul-In did not make the mistake of choosing his territory rashly.</p>
 <p><em>It is tempting… but whether it’s Uranus or Stingray, I can’t.</em></p>
 <p>Whale’s back and Stingray’s back. It got to him that both were lands that were on a living organism. Living atop another living thing was difficult. Even if it was a magical creature, it was still alive. It could get sick or die during battle. Also, he would need to feed it and worry about defecation as well.</p>
 <p>It was a big responsibility and work to raise a cat or a dog, but to raise a giant animal carrying land would require immense food and work. Therefore, he eliminated lands dependent on living organisms from his list. For these reasons, Simurgh, Ziz, and other lands atop animals were dropped from Kang Chul-In’s selection. It was not an easy thing to do to look at 900 territories while weaving through 300 Lords, but Kang Chul-In slowly looked at the lands with patience. Meanwhile, Lords who had already chosen their territories were disappearing one by one. They had purchased their territories and were transported to Pangaea. Alex Rothschild was also nowhere to be seen, and Kang Chul-In guessed that he had chosen his mobile fortress, Cyamodus.</p>
 <p><em>It would be better to be left alone.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In decided to just take his time in purchasing his land. To decrease the chances of unforeseen variables, it was better to not choose other Lords’ lands anyways. The future changed the moment he had made up his mind to choose an Airborne city instead of Valhalla, so for Kang Chul-In, he wanted to decrease the changes as much as possible. In order to manage the variables, he would need to run all over Pangaea. While Kang Chul-In was taking his time, a few familiar faces passed him. From Albrecht Wilhelm, the Overlord who was the leader of the Gulveig Union, to the traitor Aleister (Kang Chul-In had spotted him and slyly pushed him to the ground after he bumped shoulders) to the Overlord Dorian Explorer, who was more focused on exploring ruins and discovering monuments than war—there were many. It was a new experience.</p>
 <p>While he was taking his time looking at the other Lords’ territory selections, most had already been transported to Pangaea. In the great hall, only two remained: himself and a woman with auburn hair.</p>
 <p><em>Hecate.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In recognized the woman right away.</p>
 <p>From Eastern Europe.</p>
 <p>The woman who preferred the nickname Hecate over her given name. She was the Overlord who had not betrayed Kang Chul-In to the end. Hecate was contemplating between her future territory Temeraire and Helios, another territory that was more of a chariot than land, pulled by four Pegasi.</p>
 <p><em>Temeraire is perfect for Hecate.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In smiled, remembering the Hecate who had reigned over Temeraire.</p>
 <p>[Temeraire]</p>
 <p>Type: Airborne City</p>
 <p>Tendency: Conquest</p>
 <p>Location: Western part of Pangaea, Countach province</p>
 <p>Description: Land made in the form of a boat using Magic Spell-tech</p>
 <p>Skill: Tactical weapon, Fire</p>
 <p>Price: 9,500 gold</p>
 <p>Temeraire was expensive, but it was in the form of a ship with 74 cannons, and it had unimaginable firepower.</p>
 <p><em>I need to intervene.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In could not leave his future ally to choose a worthless territory like Helios. If she were to choose Helios, it would come at a great loss for him.</p>
 <p>“A ship seems to suit you.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In said.</p>
 <p>“Right?”</p>
 <p>Hecate was cool and unfazed, and she answered without hesitation even when a stranger talked to her.</p>
 <p>“I like it.”</p>
 <p>Hecate nodded and chose Temeraire without hesitation, disappearing from Kang Chul-In’s sight.</p>
 <p><em>Now, it’s my turn to choose.</em></p>
 <p>It was Kang Chul-In’s turn.</p>
 <p>About 600 territories remained, excluding the 299 lands and Valhalla that he had chosen previously.</p>
 <p><em>Let’s choose slowly.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In looked at the lands slowly. It was repetitive, but Kang Chul-In was not impatient or bothered. It was said that “Perseverance is sour, fruit is sweet.” Who knew? Maybe he would be able to buy a territory that other Lords would cry about if they found out.</p>
