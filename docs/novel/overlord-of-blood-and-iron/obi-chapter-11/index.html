 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

 <p><em>Secretaries seem to vary from territory to territory</em>.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In looked at Lucia and reminisced about his old Secretary, Alfred the vampire butler.</p>
 <p><em>Be careful, milord! Your Alfred is amazed by your strength and prowess! You are getting older, so isn’t it time for you to start looking for a wife? It is this Alfred’s wish to see your children! Please get married before this old vampire dies!</em></p>
 <p>Alfred had a 70-year-old man’s face but was extremely good at his job of assisting Kang Chul-In. He was usually a professional like no other, but he also knew how to scold Kang Chul-In for his rashness or nag at him like a mother-in-law.</p>
 <p><em>Alfred.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In was a little bit saddened over the thought that he wouldn’t be able to meet Alfred again and thought of the last words he had said to him.</p>
 <p>“Do not act rashly and do not tremble in fear. Maintain your dignity. We have not lost yet.”</p>
 <p>“We may lose today, but not next time.”</p>
 <p>It was true.</p>
 <p>Before the end of Valhalla, Kang Chul-In had said those words and calmed down Alfred. That was not a lie. Although Valhalla had disappeared with the times into a history that never happened, Kang Chul-In remembered those times.</p>
 <p><em>Alfred, are you watching? If you can, then wait for it. I will make those cowards pay for messing with Valhalla.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In promised and pledged to Alfred who had remained faithful and loyal to him until the end. This time around, he would definitely crush Rothschild, unify Pangaea, and obtain the glorious title of Emperor amongst the 10 Overlords!</p>
 <p>“Milord! Can you hear me, my Lord?”</p>
 <p>Lucia, not knowing Kang Chul-In’s thoughts, spoke carefully. It was obvious that she was very worried about displeasing him in any way.</p>
 <p>“Ah, are you my new Secretary?”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In finally turned his eyes towards Lucia.</p>
 <p>“Yes, my Lord. My name is Lucia.”</p>
 <p>Lucia bowed towards Kang Chul-In again.</p>
 <p>“Lucia… you don’t seem like a humanoid. Are you a human?”</p>
 <p>In Pangaea, there were other lifeforms that were cousins to humans. Primary examples would be the Elf, Dark Elf, Vampire, Lycanthrope, Dwarf, Orc, Mermaid, Devil, Angel, and a couple more that were fewer in number. Combined, there were about 20 different lifeforms. Those who were secretaries to Lords, as well as NPC units that came along with the territories purchased, were always other lifeforms. However, Lucia did not have any characteristics of a lifeform that Kang Chul-In was aware of.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“No.”</p>
 <p>Lucia answered.</p>
 <p>“Hm… Not human?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, my Lord. My roots are human, but my body was engineered as a mechanical design and is therefore not humanoid or human.”</p>
 <p>“Hmm? I see.”</p>
 <p>It was somewhat complicated, but it seemed that she would be more powerful than a human, so he nodded.</p>
 <p>“Milord.”</p>
 <p>“Speak.”</p>
 <p>“With my limited intelligence, I believe that you are not from Pangaea but from a foreign land, far, far away.”</p>
 <p>“You are right.”</p>
 <p>It was mostly true, so Kang Chul-In nodded.</p>
 <p>“Although you are my most esteemed Lord, I think there are some things you have not been able to completely understand because you are from a different land. Therefore, this Lucia…”</p>
 <p>“No.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In cut Lucia off.</p>
 <p>“I know your role is to help the Lord adjust to the new surroundings, but I do not need it.”</p>
 <p>“But…”</p>
 <p>“You don’t need to worry. First, can you wait while I take care of some things?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, my Lord.”</p>
 <p>Lucia followed Kang Chul-In’s wishes but had a worried expression on her face.</p>
 <p><em>It is my job to help the Lord adjust to life in Pangaea, but he has turned down my help. Maybe… he doesn’t like me.</em></p>
 <p>Lucia was restless, worried that Kang Chul-In had not taken a liking to her.</p>
 <p><em>First, it would be good for me to check my information and the territory’s current status.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In didn’t care about Lucia’s restlessness and moved to the tasks that he had to complete.</p>
 <p>“Open status information.”</p>
 <p>As soon as the order left his lips, an information screen showed his current descriptions.</p>
 <p>[My Status]</p>
 <p>Name: Kang Chul-In /Rank: Lord/ Class: Warrior</p>
 <p>Score: 0 Points/ Complete Ranking: ______</p>
 <p>Level: Level 1 / Specialty: Conquest (B Grade) / Tendency: Conquest Lord</p>
 <p>Race: Human / Skill: Locked (Unlocked when Overlord status is obtained)</p>
 <p>Spouse: (Maximum of 7)</p>
 <p>Charisma: 67 (B+)</p>
 <p>HP: 200/200</p>
 <p>Mana: 100/100</p>
 <p>Physical Attack: 67</p>
 <p>Magic Attack: 10</p>
 <p>Physical Strength: 120 / Intelligence: 141</p>
 <p>Agility: 110/ Spell Management: 20</p>
 <p>Accuracy Rate: B+</p>
 <p>Evasion Rate: B-</p>
 <p>Critical Hit: B-</p>
 <p>Defensive Power: 9%/ Endurance: 3%</p>
 <p>Finance: D- / Internal Affairs: E-</p>
 <p>Resource: B- / Politics: C+</p>
 <p>Diplomacy: C- / Command: A+</p>
 <p>Attack: A+ / Defense: C-</p>
 <p>Military Force: A+ / Charm: A+</p>
 <p>Obtained Points: 0 (+5 per level)</p>
 <p>Remaining Points: 0</p>
 <p><em>Not bad. Actually, much better than when I first started.</em>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The past Kang Chul-In and the current level 1 Kang Chul-In had a big difference in ability. It probably was due to the experiences of the past that had influenced him and allowed him to obtain a good score. Kang Chul-In’s abilities were definitely great. It was probably enough to place him in the top 1% of the 300 Lords…</p>
 <p><em>Okay. My weaker points will be filled naturally as my level rises, so there will be no need to worry greatly.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In smiled, pleased after checking his status menu. Next, it was his turn to check the state of the Sky Fortress, Laputa, which he had high expectations about. As he ordered for the status for Laputa, a brief overview of Laputa appeared.</p>
 <p>[Sky Fortress, Laputa]</p>
 <p>Type: Airborne City</p>
 <p>Tendency: Multipurpose</p>
 <p>Location: Southwest Pangaea, Pandemonium Province</p>
 <p>Description: Ancient Empire Fortress applied with advanced magic</p>
 <p>Skill: Cloaking, Self-Healing System</p>
 <p>Additional Options: Cosmic Force, a multipurpose magic engineering satellite</p>
 <p>Lord: Conquest Lord Kang Chul-In</p>
 <p>Level: Level 1 (Maximum Growth to Level 30)</p>
 <p>Status: Calm</p>
 <p>Maneuver: Landed state (Gold, Mana, Fuel used for Take-Off)</p>
 <p>Lowest speed: 5km/h</p>
 <p>Fastest speed: 100km/h (Fastest speed limit depends on level)</p>
 <p>Basic Expense: 100 Gold/ 30 days (fluctuates depending on territory’s condition)</p>
 <p>Public Order: Very Good/ Economic Affairs: Weak / Food: A small shortage</p>
 <p>Population: 500/500</p>
 <p>Military Force: 100/100</p>
 <p>Facilities: 11 / Durability: 1,000/1,000 / Loyalty: 90/90</p>
 <p><em>Everything seems to be okay other than the economy and food. I need to take care of those as soon as possible.</em></p>
 <p>The economy was weak, and food was in short supply because he had used 9,800 gold out of the 10,000 given to him in the beginning to purchase the territory…</p>
 <p><em>I will need to fix these one by one. Next, Cosmic Force.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In briefly checked the status of the territory and then ordered the information on the additional option of Cosmic Force.</p>
 <p>[Cosmic Force]</p>
 <p>Type: Magic Engineered Artificial Satellite</p>
 <p>Tendency: Multipurpose</p>
 <p>Description: An artificial satellite with advanced magical engineering</p>
 <p>Level: Level 1 (Maximum growth Level 5)</p>
 <p>Level 1: Exploration (Able to be Used) Level 2: Location System (Unable to be used) Level 3: Pulse Wave (Unable to be used) Level 4: (Unable to be used, Unlocked when Level 4 Obtained) Level 5: (Unable to be used, Unlocked when Level 5 Obtained)</p>
 <p><em>This is crazy!</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In was startled once again after seeing the brief information on Cosmic Force.</p>
 <p><em>Exploration is scouting, and the location system is GPS. Pulse wave is for confusing the enemy’s communication lines!</em></p>
 <p>These first three skills were enough to toy with the other Lords, but he could not even begin to imagine what the 4th and 5th levels would unlock. He thought that maybe even Orbital Bombardment might be possible.</p>
 <p><em>Kang Chul-In! Remain calm!</em></p>
 <p>He worked hard to calm his heart that was pounding with excitement.</p>
 <p><em>You must be cautious. Don’t waver and find ways that you can use what you have to the fullest. Even with a treasure in your hands, it is useless if you cannot use it in the right place at the right time. What comes first is to regain your power. You cannot lose again this time.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In steadied himself, thinking about his failed past due to his arrogance and rashness. One failure was acceptable, but if he failed on his second try, then he truly would have no face left in the afterlife.</p>
 <p>“Sigh…”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In exhaled loudly and, after organizing his thoughts, decided to focus on slowly growing.</p>
 <p><em>First, let’s complete the tutorial.</em></p>
 <p>When one was first given one’s territories, there were various quests to level up in the starting stages.</p>
 <p>“Lucia.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In called Lucia.</p>
 <p>“Yes, milord.”</p>
 <p>Lucia answered.</p>
 <p>“I am going to inspect my troops after looking over the territory. Prepare accordingly.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In’s eyes twinkled as he gave his order.</p>
