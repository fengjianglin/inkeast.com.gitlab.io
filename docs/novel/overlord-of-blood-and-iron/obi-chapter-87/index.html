 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

 <p>“Huk...Huk…”</p>
 <p>Gonzales kept running.</p>
 <p>‘Let’s return to Earth immediately.’</p>
 <p>The only thing that Gonzales thought of was the Magic Circle in the Lord’s hall of his territory that could lead him back to Earth.</p>
 <p>It was called ‘dining and dashing’.</p>
 <p>This was a common occurrence in the land of Pangaea, where death and slaughter were very common things.</p>
 <p>There were a lot of adventurers in Pangaea that enjoyed a one night stand with a Pangaean Woman, before either running away from their responsibilities into another region of Pangaea, or back into Earth.</p>
 <p>And for the case of Lords, if their territory was in danger after losing a war or about to be destroyed, a lot of them just ran off into Earth, to avoid being slaughtered. Gonzales was like this right now.</p>
 <p>‘To the Lord’s hall! I’ll make it out alive as long as I get to the Magic Circle!’</p>
 <p>Although Gonzales felt that it was a shame that he couldn’t stay here and play around as a king, it was better than dying.</p>
 <p>He could live in Earth, playing around for the rest of his days.</p>
 <p>He had already taken out money from Pangaea and bought a luxurious villa, and a lot of Supercars in the U.S. Although he wouldn’t be a Lord anymore, he could still spend the rest of his days in peace, and playing around with his money.</p>
 <p>And as Gonzales got out of the battlefield, he started cursing at Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>“Huk...Huk… In this stupid continent… I hope you… AGH!” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gonzales, who was cursing at Kang Chul-In suddenly screamed in agony, before collapsing on the floor with pain.</p>
 <p>“AGH!! My legs! My legs!”</p>
 <p>Stuck in Gonzales’s thighs was a long spear. Someone had thrown the spear at his thighs, piercing it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You bastard!”</p>
 <p>And Rok ran towards Gonzales like a crazy bloodhound.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Y-You…”</p>
 <p>POW!</p>
 <p>Gonzales was smacked in the face by Rok’s fists.</p>
 <p>Not only was his lips bleeding, even his Nasal Bone was broken, and his eyes were also swollen up like crazy.</p>
 <p>“Kuk… stop… please....”</p>
 <p>“Huhu…”</p>
 <p>But the only response was Rok’s maniacal laughter.</p>
 <p>“Do you know how long I’ve been waiting for this day?”</p>
 <p>Rok, who was full of anger and hatred, started laughing again.</p>
 <p>“The day that you dirtied Lowena, this is the only thing I’ve been waiting for.”</p>
 <p>Saying this, Rok held up a huge stone nearby.</p>
 <p>“Now d… Kuk…”</p>
 <p>Rok, who was holding the stone grabbed his chest in pain, and fell to the ground, groaning.</p>
 <p>Although Gonzales couldn’t react due to the state of extreme fear he was in, he was still a Lord, and a Lord could beat up an Orc barehanded.</p>
 <p>“You arrogant prick. You try to kill me for laying a hand on that b****? Die… Ugh…”</p>
 <p>“There you were.”</p>
 <p>Gonzales wobbled, before falling to the ground. It was due to a stone that hit his head.</p>
 <p>“Where are you going to go now? Are you that naive to think that we’d let you go so easily?”</p>
 <p>“Oi, Rok. Stand up. Otherwise, how are you going to beat this guy up?”</p>
 <p>And Rok stood up from the ground, grinning.</p>
 <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
 <p>Meanwhile, the battle between Kang Chul-In and Drakan was at a climax.</p>
 <p>After all, the Absilon army was absolutely decimated by the Laputan forces.</p>
 <p>And due to this, the battle between Laputa’s ‘absolute’, and the ‘strongest demi-human’ was able to garner so much attention.</p>
 <p>Two swords collided in the air.</p>
 <p>Strength against strength!</p>
 <p>But…</p>
 <p>Drakan realized that this fight wasn’t exactly about how strong Kang Chul-In was.</p>
 <p>‘Such technique… such precise control… there was a man as powerful as this?’</p>
 <p>While Kang Chul-In looked as if he was recklessly swinging his sword all the time to tire down Drakan, that wasn’t true. He knew when to approach, and when to retreat during the fight, and this frustrated Drakan.</p>
 <p>“Not bad.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In stepped backwards, and nodded towards Drakan.</p>
 <p>“Kuu…”</p>
 <p>And from Drakan started roaring, like a dragon normally would.</p>
 <p>And looking at him, Kang Chul-In stared expectantly as to what would come next.</p>
 <p>Kuuuooooo!!</p>
 <p>And as Drakan roared…</p>
 <p>Hwaruruk! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Crimson red flames began to approach Kang Chul-In. It was the minor version of ‘Dragon breath’, a dragon’s greatest weapon.</p>
 <p>‘Gotta be careful here.’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In knew that if he was hit directly from those flames, he wouldn’t be able to escape the fate of becoming a barbecued human.</p>
 <p>Tat! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In launched off the ground, and the flames hit the ground, where Kang Chul-In was standing a second ago.</p>
 <p>And after that, a ferocious battle took place.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In, who was armored with his ferocious and unstoppable battle techniques and skill, fighting against Drakan, who had awakened his strength as a member of the drake-man race.</p>
 <p>By using his superior strength as a half-dragon, and using 120% of his skill, Drakan finally seemed to grab the upper hand…&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Until of course, the air around Kang Chul-In started rippling with an invisible aura.</p>
 <p>“Pretty good. Now, it’s my turn.”</p>
 <p>And saying this, Kaiforce started glowing.</p>
 <p>This was Overdrive phase 1, combined with ‘Sword Light’.</p>
 <p>Pang! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>And Kang Chul-In suddenly appeared before Drakan, as if he had teleported.</p>
 <p>Kang!</p>
 <p>Although Drakan raised his sword as fast as he could, it wasn’t enough.</p>
 <p>Crack!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>With one strike, Kang Chul-In had completely shattered the sword of Drakan, and injured him severely.</p>
 <p>“Huu… I have no regrets after fighting such a good battle. Now, finish it.”</p>
 <p>Drakan spoke, as if he wanted Kang Chul-In to chop off his head.</p>
 <p>“Finished?”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In snorted.</p>
 <p>“Then, are you going to spare me?”</p>
 <p>“No, but it won’t be an easy death.”</p>
 <p>“D-Don’t tell me…”</p>
 <p>Saying this, Drakan reminisced of what had happened to his subordinates, the bulldog general Demian, and Amaru.</p>
 <p>It seemed like Kang Chul-In would beat him to death.</p>
 <p>---------------------------------------------</p>
 <p>The next time Drakan woke up was a few days later.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Kuk… Am I not dead yet?”</p>
 <p>“Count, have you woken?”</p>
 <p>Looking at the Drakan that had woken up, a maidservant spoke to him, and addressed him as ‘Count’.</p>
 <p>“Where am I?”</p>
 <p>“We are in the Absilon territory, of the Laputa kingdom, sire.”</p>
 <p>“Laputa Kingdom? Absilon… territory?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, count.”</p>
 <p>“Count? I am not a Count, just a mere soldier.”</p>
 <p>“No, sire. A few days ago, our majesty Kang Chul-In has addressed you as a count of the Laputa territory.”</p>
 <p>“W-What? Well, tell me! Where is your Lord, Kang Chul-In?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Calm down, sire. Our Lord has left just a few hours ago to conquer another territory with his army.”</p>
 <p>“Left? He has left?”</p>
 <p>Although Drakan was wounded, he stood up easily, and got ready to leave immediately.</p>
 <p>“Tell me, what direction did he go in! I must see him at once!”</p>
 <p>And he followed the way that Kang Chul-In had left, all the way from the Absilon Territory.</p>
