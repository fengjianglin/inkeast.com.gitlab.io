 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“You’re Overlord, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Said the man that looked like a beggar.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Nice to meet you. You, your skills aren’t too bad?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Then, he proceeded to approach Kang Chul-In to shake hands.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I’m known as ‘Lumpen’ in the World Community, Dorian. Dorian Explorer.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In did not grab Dorian’s hand. He was very dirty, and there was no way for Kang Chul-In to harbor goodwill towards him since he was late.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I’m Kang Chul-In. But, why were you late?” he asked instead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Th-that is…..”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Dorian began to give poor excuses.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I, I was too excited…….As soon as I received your message, I asked an adventurer to borrow his gate and immediately came here……But….it somehow ended up….No, now that I think about it, I don’t even have any food……Or a bag….Then, I noticed a weird-looking animal, so I followed it around and eventually, the day was over. I was hungry…..and as I was looking for food to eat……”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It basically meant that he had come to this world with just his body and ended up running around in the forest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This crazy bastard.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Listening to Dorian’s excuses, a vein popped up on Kang Chul-In’s forehead.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">For a guy who said that he was from the special forces, how is he able to get lost?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Starting from the year 2021, the 25-year-old Dorian was part of the famous SAS (Special Air Service) in the British Armed Forces and was a true monster with plenty of experience on the battlefield from Afghanistan, Somalia, etc.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Although it was weird that such a person could get lost, the real Dorian often got lost.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“So, I rushed to the meeting spot as quickly as I could, but it seemed like everyone had left already. The only thing I could do was to follow the traces and ended up here. Either way, I’m sorry I’m late.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Dorian apologized.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“But the handshake? I told you I’m sorry……You’re making me feel embarrassed…….”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“If you’re going to stick your hand out, wash yourself first,” Kang Chul-In retorted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Forget the handshake. Even a hobo would cry after looking at your appearance.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“It, it’s that bad?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“No, dirtier.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Aren’t you a Lord as well? Wouldn’t it have been better if you had brought a subordinate or two with you?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Ah, they all seemed to be sleeping…..I felt bad waking them up, so I came by myself.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In understood.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It was obvious that this guy had run out in the middle of the night while his confidantes and leaders were asleep. Dorian was a tiresome and irresponsible lord in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Well, it’s nothing new I guess. Since back then, you’ve always been like that.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It wasn’t something that had only occurred once or twice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I don’t understand how this guy got through military life.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">There was something that Kang Chul-In did not know.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Navy Seals, Delta Force, famous special forces like the SAS, had a very different image from what regular civilians knew. Most of the people in these forces were filled with people who were worse than thugs.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Of course, once training started, their personalities would make a full 180-degree change, but it was undeniable that their military discipline was poor.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It was the same with Dorian. Normally, he seemed to be out of it, but once he was put into battle or was killing monsters, he would change into a completely different person.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Murder? If it was necessary, Dorian would be able to heartlessly kill a person, just like Kang Chul-In.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Ah, by the way……”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Dorian spoke as if he had something to say.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“That thing just now.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“That thing just now?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“When you killed off the Crocuta.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Did you hold the sword backwards to put more force into it? And did you turn your body to the right so you could dodge the Crocuta’s counter? It just seemed like a movement that was preparing you for the possibility of being bitten since you would have to get close to the body with the sword pierced into it. You aimed to attack to deal the most damage while also dodging the counter. Wasn’t it a movement of the perfect balance between attack and defense? Well, at least that’s what it looked like to me, but it’s alright if it’s not.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He had a discerning eye that completely saw through Kang Chul-In’s intentions. He was indeed the Dungeon Attacking Strategist (at least in the past) with those sharp insights.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Ah, is that so?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Was that what it was?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“It kind of makes sense after it was explained like that…..”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Is that why the General moved to the right when he cut the Crocuta’s body?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The adventurers that had listened to Dorian’s explanation began to understand Kang Chul-In’s demonstration.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“What do you think about my words?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“It’s accurate.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As I thought, he has a lot of uses. He would be perfect as a teaching assistant.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In felt very happy and believed that it was God’s grace for him to be able to catch Dorian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Dorian’s questions had the same effect as being able to explain the confusing parts to the adventurers. Kang Chul-In believed that if he used Dorian right, he would be able to create great synergy in teaching the adventurers.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I will use you to the fullest.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Although he was late, since Dorian had joined the group, Kang Chul-In vowed that he would use him to the fullest rather than destroying him. Although, that was his true purpose from the beginning.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">With the addition of Dorian, the attack unit “Slayers’ gained momentum.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It was the same as giving lectures.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If Kang Chul-In fought against a monster 1-on-1 to demonstrate, Dorian would ask questions he was curious about and share his opinions. If Kang Chul-In was the teacher, then Dorian was the assistant or honor student.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thanks to the discussions between the two, the adventurers could find solutions for the parts they were doubtful of and were slowly able to build up their knowledge.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thanks to that, their learning efficiency had increased greatly, and in proportion to that, their levels grew quickly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Although the adventurers were unaware of it themselves, they were currently getting private lessons from the rare cheat character know as Kang Chul-In and the genius know as Dorian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">[You have raised your level! Attained level 15!] [You have raised your level! Attained level 16!] [You have raised your level! Attained level 17!] [You have raised your level! Attained level 18!] [You have raised your level! Attained level 19!]</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After a week on the hunt, Kang Chul-In had attained level 19. Excluding eating and sleeping, all his time was put into monster hunting.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However, Kang Chul-In was unsatisfied.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He had a high threshold that he wanted to hit, and it was a far road to hitting at least level 100. Also, he knew that he would be unable to go against the Peacock Dragon with a mere level of 19.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Still too far. I won’t be able to deal with that thing unless I hit at least level 25……..</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Late at night, Kang Chul-In was lost in thought while everyone else was asleep.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Listening to the reports from Podolski, who was going back and forth between the territory and base camp, the Peacock Dragon was still looking for food around the territory even though it had been concealed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It would be best to hit level 30…..But, it’ll be too late by then.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Even now, gold was quickly being used.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">With the territory being concealed, Kang Chul-In would suffer a greater loss the more time was spent.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Hey, what are you thinking about so hard?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">With a swish, Dorian got closer and asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Aye! So hard, so hard! I don’t think It’s ever been this tough even during my military days. It’s not easy hunting monsters.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It was obvious that Dorian was exhausted.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Because Kang Chul-In was staring at Dorian as if he was going to eat him, the adventurers that were watching from the side felt pity for Dorian because of how severely he was being exploited. If it were anyone else, there was a high chance that they would have run away by now.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“It seems like you’re having a tough time?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Would it be considered normal if this wasn’t tough? It’s so easy with such half-assed demonstrations, huh? You should try it yourself, or what do you want me to do? Sigh! It’s not like I’m some kind of genius!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Dorian grumbled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You are a genius. A very clumsy and weird genius.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In laughed to himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“If it’s that hard, why don’t you go back? I won’t stop you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Words that Kang Chul-In truly didn’t believe in.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“What are you talking about?! I’m not going back until I fight that Peacock Dragon! Of course, although it’s tough…… I’m learning a lot from you, and I feel that it was a good idea to have come here.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Dorian truly seemed to be enjoying himself right now.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">They’re all things I learned from you.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In more ways than one, Kang Chul-In was also enjoying himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The owner was like the customer, and the customer was like the owner. It was a situation where their roles had completely changed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If Kang Chul-In was the one learning in the past, it was different this time. Dorian was learning from him now. He was learning his own tips and attack strategies from Kang Chul-In.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">For such an irony to occur.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It was something that could not have occurred if Soul Back-up didn’t exist. It was a situation that Dorian would never have dreamed of.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Hey, buddy,” Dorian said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Can I ask you something?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“If it’s something that I can answer.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Why are you not telling the adventurers the final goal? Although the others aren’t saying anything, because they’re unsure, their goal isn’t to simply level up, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“It’s a problem of confidence.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Confidence?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Although the Peacock Dragon is the weakest of the dragon species, it is a level 40 monster in name. If I were to tell them that we were going to fight against an uncouth monster like that, do you think they would follow me?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Mm?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Dorian showed a stupid expression.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“They would have run away or would have said that they would not do it.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Ey, what do you mean run away? I’m sure they would have definitely agreed since we’ll be fighting against a dragon-type.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“You idiot.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“You think everyone is like you? The adventurers’ goals are money and items, not dying in a fight against a high-level monster.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I-is that so?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Dorian could understand Kang Chul-In’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">No matter what it was, there was a big difference between having confidence and not.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“By tomorrow, you and I should be level 20, while the adventurers will be level 15.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In was planning on fighting the Peacock Dragon once he hit level 25 and the adventurers hit level 20.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I think we can slowly enter into special training.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Special training? What special training? Did you by chance think up a strategy specifically to fight against the Peacock Dragon?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“How admirable. To think that you would be able to think that far.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“…..Hey, I’m not stupid.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Of course you are.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">….as Kang Chul-In responded like so, he thought to himself.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you’re not stupid, then who is?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It was quite pleasant to be able to mess around with Dorian.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">At that moment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Dorian spoke as if he was doubtful of something.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Wait, something’s weird.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“What’s weird?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“You….what’s your purpose?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Something’s weird. How do you know how to fight every monster that we come across? How do you know the existence of the Peacock Dragon and how to fight against it? Are the items that you distributed also part of the strategy to specifically fight against the Peacock Dragon?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">For a moment, Kang Chul-In was very surprised by Dorian. He did not know how sharp Dorian was because he had only seen him as an easy fish, someone who could easily be played around with.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“It really is suspicious. It’s only been a month since the Grand Summoning, yet you know too much. Are you by chance……..?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">With eyes full of suspicion, Dorian stared at Kang Chul-In.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When did this bastard get this smart? He usually would skip through it as if it were nothing.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As Kang Chul-In was at a loss, Dorian took the initiative.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Did you practice earlier? You wanted to get stronger quicker and wanted to fight against high-leveled monsters?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In was super nervous, but as expected, Dorian guessed wrong.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“You asked your confidantes, and if there was something they didn’t know, you researched the information on World. What do you say, am I right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In thought “You stupid idiot, that’s why you always get played with in the palm of my hands” as he agreed enthusiastically.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“…..I’ve been caught.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“As I thought.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Dorian was elated as he perked his shoulders up. Idiots were idiots and were happy because of it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Well, either way, we just need to gain the skills needed to fight against the Peacock Dragon. Or, fight against monsters that have similar characteristics to the Peacock Dragon.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Dorian used his innate monster hunting skills to grasp Kang Chul-In’s intentions.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“That’s what I’m planning.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In had already planned a curriculum of monsters that he wanted to kill. Slowly, there was a list of monsters in Kang Chul-In’s head that he wanted to hunt within the next week.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">From this point on, we need to fight against big monsters.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In order to fight against the Peacock Dragon, the 40+ adventurers needed a big monster that could take on everyone’s attacks at once. A big monster that was at least around level 30.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What Kang Chul-In didn’t know was that this opportunity would come a lot faster than he thought.</span></p>
