 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p><em>Fine. Since it has already become like this, maybe it is a good thing.</em></p>
 <p>But why though?</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In smiled faintly.</p>
 <p><em>I focused too heavily on military power. My neglect of economic strength was a critical mistake. And also my neglect of paperwork… I am an Overlord. I did not have time to focus on foreign and diplomatic policies, or on military tactics and strategies. With the slow progress of the war, I neglected to collect intelligence and diplomacy. If I had maintained good relations with others, I would have at least had good, solid information and intelligence. Then, I would not have been caught off-guard like this.</em></p>
 <p>In the face of destruction, the Kang Chul-In’s mind was ruthlessly calm and quiet.</p>
 <p>If his enemies had known of his current state, they would have thought that he had given up or that he had nothing left but regret. That was how calm he was.</p>
 <p>“Master! We need your orders in order to fight the enemies!” Alfred pleaded with Kang Chul-In as if worried by his current state.</p>
 <p>It was understandable, considering the threat bearing down on them.</p>
 <p>“Alfred.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, Master.”</p>
 <p>“Do not be afraid. Maintain your dignity. We have not lost yet.”</p>
 <p>“Excuse me…?”</p>
 <p>The vampire butler Alfred was taken aback by Kang Chul-In’s calm composure but worked to calm his nerves and regain composure soon after. As an NPC unit, Alfred could not know the internal workings of Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>“Call the five Great Generals in right away and send all troops out of Valhalla to meet the enemy as soon as they come.”</p>
 <p>“Master! That, that cannot happen! Do you not think encouraging a siege would be better? A frontal collision would put Valhalla at a great disadvantage!”</p>
 <p>It was true.</p>
 <p>They were numerically inferior. Even for a 1% chance of getting out of this situation, it would be better to defend against a siege.</p>
 <p>“No. It would only drag on the battle longer without changing the outcome. We will square off with our enemies instead of cowardly withholding from battle.”</p>
 <p>“Master!”</p>
 <p>“Do not worry. We might have lost today, but not next time.”</p>
 <p>It really did not make any sense.</p>
 <p>It was obvious that today’s defeat would lead to death and destruction, but Kang Chul-In remained calm and composed.</p>
 <p>“Lucy, Bella!”</p>
 <p>When Kang Chul-In called their names, the two Dark Elf Guards Lucy and Bellatrix, who had been hiding in the darkness behind the throne, showed themselves.</p>
 <p>“Yes, Master.”</p>
 <p>“Did you call us?”</p>
 <p>Lucy and Bella, who, like Alfred, were NPC Units. They were both guards who specialized in magic and martial arts. They were stronger than most mid-level Lords.</p>
 <p>“My sword and armor.”</p>
 <p>As soon as his words fell, Lucy and Bella brought forth the epic items, the sword Fragarch and “Vali’s Burning Vengeance Armor Set”, and set them before him. These items were what allowed him to become the unstoppable Overlord he was now, otherwise known as the Lord Hunter.</p>
 <p><em>Alex Rothschild, and Lee Gong-Myung.</em></p>
 <p>He focused his thoughts by thinking of his enemies while he dressed for war with the help of Bella and Lucy.</p>
 <p>He shuddered in anger as he thought of the two who had brought upon his destruction.</p>
 <p>He had been the most viable candidate for the unification of Pangaea. And they took that from him.</p>
 <p>He had stepped on them countless of times, and they had returned alive like cockroaches, repeatedly.</p>
 <p>It would have been more accurate to describe them as zombies rather than Overlords. He regretted having left them alone instead of killing them or subjugating them, but since things had come to this point, he would let them feel the full wrath of Overlord Kang Chul-In and Valhalla in this war.</p>
 <p>* * *</p>
 <p><em>Boom! Boom!</em></p>
 <p>Cyamodus, the giant tortoise, breathed fire and lava while moving towards Kang Chul-In’s headquarters.</p>
 <p>There were almost 15,000 troops total when one combined the allied troops of Baldur and Gulveig, as well as two thousand troops tailing the headquarters.</p>
 <p>“Master.”</p>
 <p>Lee Gong-Myung, the mastermind behind all of this, turned towards his leader, Alex Rothschild.</p>
 <p>“Are you really going to fight head-to-head with Kang Chul-In?”</p>
 <p>Alex Rothschild had already put on a full set of plate armor, scattered with white and gold. As expected of an Overlord, all his items were also Epic Items.</p>
 <p>“He will not just stand and watch, that’s for sure.”</p>
 <p>“But my Lord, Kang Chul-In is very strong. One-on-one, no, even with many, you know it is difficult to win against him. Kang Chul-In is Pangaea’s strongest warrior. If you fight him, your life may even be in danger.”</p>
 <p>“That’s why I am going against him with others. With a combined attack with other Overlords, there is a good chance for victory. We also have overwhelming numbers of troops.”</p>
 <p>“But…”</p>
 <p>“Payback.”</p>
 <p>Lee Gong-Myung spoke no further as soon as Alex Rothschild uttered that word.</p>
 <p>It was understandable.</p>
 <p>Since the start of Ragnarok seven years ago, Alex Rothschild had always been entrapped by Kang Chul-In’s attacks and had struggled to survive.</p>
 <p>He lost two subordinates he had treasured as if they were his brothers, and his headquarters, Cyamodus, was stomped to nothing, not once but four times.</p>
 <p>If Cyamodus had not been a mobile fortress, Alex Rothschild would have been crushed at the hands of Kang Chul-In long ago.</p>
 <p>“I need to avenge their deaths, and I need to repay him for the humiliation that he gave me in the past. If not today, I will never be able to pay off this debt. Maybe if it was another day, I would have avoided this, but not today.”</p>
 <p>He stated this so firmly that it was obvious that his mind was made up.</p>
 <p>No matter what Lee Gong-Myung said, he would not be able to convince him otherwise. Therefore, Lee Gong-Myung did not question his lord further.</p>
 <p>“It would have been nice if we could break him with Cyamodus alone. It’s too bad that it had to be this way.” Alex Rothschild stated regretfully.</p>
 <p>“It’s an overused phrase, but ‘the last one standing is the victor’. Kang Chul-In is too strong. He will not bend against the wind, even if it means his death. His fatal flaw is that he is not flexible enough.”</p>
 <p>“True, if he had been more cautious, this day would not have come.”</p>
 <p>“Yes. And that is one of the reasons why I chose you, milord, and not Kang Chul-In.”</p>
 <p>As the two conversed, Valhalla’s troops slowly showed itself from afar.</p>
 <p>“It cannot be!”</p>
 <p>Lee Gong-Myung exclaimed, seeing what lay ahead of him.</p>
 <p>“My liege! Look over there! It is a giant army! He has given up siege warfare and has chosen a face-to-face confrontation!”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In’s choice was a stupid one, but it did succeed in causing surprise.</p>
 <p>“It cannot be!”</p>
 <p>Alex Rothschild also could not hide his surprise.</p>
 <p>“Gong-Myung, is this maybe a trap? Even if Kang Chul-In is reckless, to think he would engage us in a confrontation!”</p>
 <p>He had suffered immensely due to Kang Chul-In until now.</p>
 <p>It was natural for him to be taken aback by Kang Chul-In’s choice of confrontation in the face of complete obliteration.</p>
 <p>“No, it is not.”</p>
 <p>Lee Gong-Myung had different ideas.</p>
 <p>“It is his pride.”</p>
 <p>“Pride?”</p>
 <p>“I am sure of it.”</p>
 <p>Lee Gong-Myung was sure.</p>
 <p>“According to the intel that just arrived, Hecate’s headquarters has already been destroyed by the Gulveig Union. Aleister, who is part of the Ishtar Army, is over there.”</p>
 <p>Lee Gong-Myung’s finger pointed at the Overlord Aleister, who was sitting atop the giant undead monster, Bone Dragon.</p>
 <p>“He has already judged that there is no hope and will go out with a bang. It is not Kang Chul-In’s style to drag on a fight that will lead to nothing.”</p>
 <p>“Oh!”</p>
 <p>“To go out with a bang instead of holding out. Isn’t that just the embodiment of Kang Chul-In’s personality? It means that he will not plead for his life, nor would he seek to save himself. This is who he is.”</p>
 <p>It was as expected of the genius tactician, Lee Gong-Myung.</p>
 <p>He had seen through Kang Chul-In’s intentions and assured his Overlord while sitting. It was obvious as to why Kang Chul-In had regretted not having Lee Gong-Myung for himself.</p>
 <p>“My liege, order an attack in full force. As long as Kang Chul-In has chosen a frontal collision, it is impossible to absorb Valhalla’s military force. There is no other way than to completely destroy it.”</p>
 <p>“Is that right?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, milord.”</p>
 <p>“I will do so.”</p>
 <p>Alex Rothschild nodded at Lee Gong-Myung’s counsel.</p>
 <p>* * *</p>
 <p>The great collision that was thought to end easily lasted for three long days and nights.</p>
 <p>Valhalla had that great of a military power, and Kang Chul-In also displayed great skill in withstanding the combined efforts of the Overlords.</p>
 <p>But his limit was three days.</p>
 <p>He was outnumbered. In the face of overwhelming numbers, there was no victory.</p>
 <p>Ultimately, the five proud Grand Generals of Valhalla fell one by one, and Kang Chul-In was pushed all the way to his throne inside Valhalla headquarters. As predicted by both sides, Kang Chul-In had lost.</p>
 <p>“Hey, you came?”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In, who sat alone on his throne, greeted the Overlords on the allied side.</p>
 <p>Taken aback, the allied Overlords were at a loss for words.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the roles had reversed, and it looked as if the defeated Kang Chul-In was the victor, and the victorious Overlords had lost.</p>
 <p>Like this, Kang Chul-In remained proud and held his head high.</p>
 <p>The face of Kang Chul-In, sitting on his throne alone, was not that of a loser. Rather, the wry smirk spread across his face looked as if he was looking down at the allied Overlords.</p>
 <p>“You cannot believe your defeat?”</p>
 <p>Alex Rothschild, the rival of Kang Chul-In, finally spoke.</p>
 <p>“Because I stepped on you after being stepped on countless times?”</p>
 <p>It seemed as if Alex Rothchild was overcome with resentment.</p>
 <p>Indeed, who knew he would deliver his enemy Kang Chul-In to the clutches of death? It was a new feeling.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In sneered.</p>
 <p>“Why, were you disappointed by my reaction? I guess you would have been satisfied if I had cried and cowered like yourselves, you losers.”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Alex Rothschild almost lunged at Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>How could he taunt him like this?</p>
 <p>His cheeky mocking of the victors was enough to drive anyone crazy.</p>
 <p>“You have really lost your mind.”</p>
 <p>The Overlord necromancer Aleister, who had remained quiet, spoke. He raised the visor of his skull armor, exposing his crude, vulgar face.</p>
 <p>“You would have never guessed, huh? But what can you do? You lost. That is what you get for being a cocky and arrogant fool.”</p>
 <p>Aleister smirked at Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>And in response…</p>
 <p>“Shut your mouth.”</p>
 <p>It was a menacing statement, enough to send chills down the spine of even the icy Overlord Aleister.</p>
 <p>“Shut up before I break that skull of yours. I do not wish to speak to a traitor like you.”</p>
 <p>Disgusted, Kang Chul-In turned his head away from the necromancer Overlord towards Alex Rothschild.</p>
 <p>“Hey, Rothschild.” He pointed at Alex Rothschild with the end of his chin.</p>
 <p>“You work hard to act like you work for a just and great cause, to act nice and good.”</p>
 <p>“What are you saying?”</p>
 <p>Alex Rothschild answered.</p>
 <p>“What am I saying? Well, if you are going to play dumb, I’ll kindly tell you. You want Pangaea all for yourself, but to pretend you don’t, doesn’t that just keep you up at night?”</p>
 <p>“No way. I am different from you.”</p>
 <p>“Ha. Different. I can recognize my own kind. You are the same as me. Except you pretend to be on the side of the angels instead of being honest like me. You took everything you could and benefited all you could, and now you are pretending you did not?”</p>
 <p>“Evil only recognizes evil. Kang Chul-In, you… are just that.”</p>
 <p>“Is that so? It seems like you are going to kill that traitor first as soon as I’m gone.”</p>
 <p>After that statement, the traitor Aleister shivered.</p>
 <p>“Coward.” Kang Chul-In sneered at Aleister and continued.</p>
 <p>“Well, whatever happens, that will be after I die anyway, so it is business among yourselves. Now, end it.”</p>
 <p>And Kang Chul-In put down his Fragarach and opened his arms wide.</p>
 <p>“What are you scheming, Kang Chul-In?”</p>
 <p>Rothschild asked, his guard up.</p>
 <p>“What scheme, you idiot? End it. You don’t understand?”</p>
 <p>“Are you just going to die?”</p>
 <p>“Well then? I don’t want to cry and run away like someone after a little attack on their headquarters, nor do I want to come back to life like a cockroach. Neither is my style.”</p>
 <p>It was a direct insult at Rothschild, and the veins in his temples bulged.</p>
 <p>The angry Rothschild’s sword gave off a glint as it penetrated Kang Chul-In’s heart in an instant.</p>
 <p>“It is my victory! Kang Chul-In!”</p>
 <p>“Yes, enjoy it. Enjoy it all you want.” Kang Chul-In laughed.</p>
 <p>“Today will be the first and last day that you will be victorious against me.”</p>
 <p>“Shut up!”</p>
 <p>Rothschild’s sword gave off another glimmer.</p>
 <p>And Kang Chul-In’s head fell and rolled on the ground.</p>
 <p>Dead.</p>
 <p>The great Kang Chul-In had died.</p>
 <p>“It is my victory! My victory, Kang Chul-In!”</p>
 <p>Alex Rothschild announced his victory with red, bloodshot eyes.</p>
 <p>And that face… was to be feared.</p>
 <p>The face of the man who had defeated the enemy he had despised and feared was like the devil’s. However, the menacing face of the man soon disappeared and was replaced with joy and accomplishment.</p>
 <p>“You all worked hard.”</p>
 <p>Rothschild spoke, looking around at the faces of the Overlords as well as Aleister.</p>
 <p>“And now, this head will be…”</p>
 <p>As Rothschild was about to suggest hanging the head for all to see and celebrate their victory, he suddenly stopped.</p>
 <p><em>Crack!</em></p>
 <p>The ground began to shake.</p>
 <p>It did not seem like a good thing.</p>
 <p>The vibrations that they felt beneath their feet grew stronger and felt ominous and strange. It was as if a big explosion was going to occur.</p>
 <p>“No way!”</p>
 <p>Rothschild yelled.</p>
 <p>“Self-destruction?!”</p>
 <p>“We need to get out of here right now!”</p>
 <p>“Kang Chul-In, you despicable bastard!”</p>
 <p>And just when everyone had processed the situation, a fiery storm came over them with a loud bang.</p>
 <p>It truly was a despicable tactic.</p>
 <p>“Stupid, foolish, idiots.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In smirked and mumbled.</p>
