 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

 <p>“W-What?”</p>
 <p>Staring at ‘its’ front legs, one of the people in the sidelines mumbled in a dazed manner.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>‘Front legs from the egg?’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In himself was also very startled.</p>
 <p>Since the egg was very large, Kang Chul-In thought that a dragon or a bird would come out, but that was not the case.</p>
 <p>Instead, what came out was the large legs of a mammal. And it also had the claws attached that could easily rip through even steel.</p>
 <p>“Y-Your majesty… that… that is…”</p>
 <p>Nilus seemed like he knew what was inside the egg.</p>
 <p>“That?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Nilus seemed like he couldn’t breathe, due to his astonishment.</p>
 <p>And suddenly, the powerful legs of the beast managed to finally crack the egg, and made a huge visual impact to the people watching.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“T-This… can I truly keep something like this?”</p>
 <p>Looking at the scene, Dorian regretted him asking for the egg. It seemed like he was unable to control something like the beast.</p>
 <p>BAM! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>The beast inside the egg finally broke its shell apart, and stood on the ground with its four feet.</p>
 <p>The beast was incredible, and majestic. Even Kang Chul-In who was watching fromat the sides nodded his head, and had an appearance that anyone could admire.</p>
 <p>“I-I found it, so… can I keep it?”</p>
 <p>The beast was so majestic that even a pushover like Dorian wanted to keep it.</p>
 <p>“If you want it, you can keep it.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In nodded his head.</p>
 <p>But it was not purely of kind intentions, but Kang Chul-In was ready to use Dorian in the future as he pleased.</p>
 <p>“Kuu… as expected of my friend.”</p>
 <p>Dorian’s lips parted in happiness, and appreciation.</p>
 <p>“Hey there, buddy.”</p>
 <p>And as Kang Chul-In accepted, Dorian treated the beast as if treating a puppy.</p>
 <p>“I’m your new owner… OW!”</p>
 <p>And started bleeding.</p>
 <p>ROAR!!</p>
 <p>The beast bared its fangs at Dorian, completely ignoring what he had to say.</p>
 <p>“W-What the hell?”</p>
 <p>And Dorian seemed like he was about to cry, After all, his hands were almost bitten off by an animal.</p>
 <p>“Kuku… as expected.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Nilus laughed it off.</p>
 <p>“Uhh… why are you doing that to me? I’m telling you, I’m your new owner!”</p>
 <p>Although Dorian tried to calm it down…</p>
 <p>ROAR! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>There was an indifferent response to him.</p>
 <p>Yes.</p>
 <p>Dorian had failed to make the beast recognize him as histhe owner of it. His ‘imprinting’ had failed.</p>
 <p>But it made sense for him to fail.</p>
 <p>Imprinting only worked against weaker species like birds, not fierce beasts like the one in front of him.</p>
 <p>HMPH! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>After snorting at Dorian one last time, the beast turned its head away from him, walking slowly towards where Kang Chul-In and Arshelly were, on the white horse.</p>
 <p>‘Oh?’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In’s eyes gleamed.</p>
 <p>“Kuku, as expected of an Altaica! It truly is an intelligent one, recognizing his majesty in just a glance.”</p>
 <p>Like Nilus had said, the Altaica was a symbol, as well as a godbeast that originated from the Ancient Kingdom. Even though it was just born, it had the size of a fully grown hound.</p>
 <p>Meow~~!</p>
 <p>But in front of Kang Chul-In, it made noises like a cat, trying to appeal to him.</p>
 <p>‘Look at this thing.’</p>
 <p>And Kang Chul-In was speechless at the Altaica’s behavior.</p>
 <p>Golden eyes that shone brighter than those of a dragon, fur that was closer to pure silver than white, intimidating black stripes on its back, sharp, glistening teeth and claws, as well as a third eye on its forehead.</p>
 <p>A beast like this that had a visual appearance that could scare away most monsters was trying to appeal itself to Kang Chul-In, even turning over and showing its belly to him, made him speechless.</p>
 <p>And it was turning its body in a cute (?) manner, looking at Kang Chul-In with its eyes. It was a clear sign of it obeying him.</p>
 <p>“Father.”</p>
 <p>Arshelly spoke.</p>
 <p>“It seems like the baby Altaica wants to serve you as its owner.”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, seems like there’s no other choice.” Said Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>Although he was planning on giving it up for Dorian, there was nothing he could do but accept it since the Altaica was like this.</p>
 <p>“Dorian.” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In spoke.</p>
 <p>“It seems like I have no choice.” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>And Dorian spoke back, depressed.</p>
 <p>“... Your right… It seems like me and it are not destined to be together.”</p>
 <p>Dorian sounded depressed, and it made sense. For Dorian, who was in love with the animals in Pangaea to almost lose his hand and be humiliated by a newborn baby was very depressing to him.</p>
 <p>“Can you ride a horse?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In spoke to Arshelly.</p>
 <p>“Yes, father.” She answered.</p>
 <p>“Then hold the reins.” He spoke, before getting off the horse, and walking towards the Altaica.</p>
 <p>MEOW!!</p>
 <p>As he got closer, it started to appeal itself even more to Kang Chul-In. It had a completely different attitude to when it was facing Dorian earlier.</p>
 <p>MEOW!! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>And when Kang Chul-In stroked its fur, the Altaica moved, as if it was satisfied. It seemed like nothing more than a cat in front of Kang Chul-In, and was astonishing from an onlookers perspective.</p>
 <p>And this was how Kang Chul-In became the owner of the godbeast Altaica.</p>
 <p>And when Kang Chul-In got back to the territory, he was met with the best reception as well as treatment he could.</p>
 <p>It was due to the fact that he had saved the children, and came back with all of them alive.</p>
 <p>Of course, it was a misunderstanding, but if he revealed what had actually happened, it might affect how people viewed Arshelly, so he didn’t do that.</p>
 <p>“Timothy.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, milord.”</p>
 <p>The goblin Timothy was instead named as Secretary while Lucia was injured, and helped Kang Chul-In with his duties.</p>
 <p>“Tell the civilians that Arshelly is the princess now, and that they will continue working to gather the Talking Tree sap. They need to gather up for the two days that they have missed. And… Michael.” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yes, milord.”</p>
 <p>“Take this.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In handed his bracelet, the epic item, Owner of the Ghosts to Michael.</p>
 <p>“T-This is…?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It is an item that allows one to control 50 spectre knights. I will lend it to you for a while, so use it to guard the perimeter while the work is going on.”</p>
 <p>“Spectre Knight!!”</p>
 <p>Michael was frightened and startled, almost falling down due to his astonishment.</p>
 <p>And it was understandable, as Spectre Knights were more powerful than even Death Knights.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was very surprising to Michael that he was able to control 50 spectre knights.</p>
 <p>“But if you fail, then you will be severely punished this time around. Understood?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yes, milord.” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Good. Dismissed.”</p>
 <p>After Michael left and all of Kang Chul-In’s ‘work’ was done, he could have a rest.</p>
 <p>‘It was a blessing in disguise.’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In thought asthought, as he looked through a list of what he had gained during this expedition.</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>3 Levels up, 1 Ticket of Territory Enrichment</li>
  <li>Epic Item, Kaiforce</li>
  <li>Epic Item, Owner of the Ghosts</li>
  <li>Epic Item, Needle of the Empress</li>
  <li>Godbeast Altaica</li>
  <li>+60 Lord points due to the civilians worship</li>
 </ul>
 <p>And finally…</p>
 <p>“Father!”</p>
 <p>He had also gotten a daughter, Arshelly.</p>
 <p>“What is it?”</p>
 <p>At the unexpected words, Kang Chul-In’s face stiffened.</p>
 <p>“I thought you would be tired, so I made you so honeywater!”</p>
 <p>His pretty daughter smiled dazzlingly towards Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>‘The descriptionIt had said it was impossible to dislike her in her description.’</p>
 <p>As expected, Arshelly, with one of her occupations being a ‘kind daughter’, she had brought Kang Chul-In hand-made honeywater, even being a princess.</p>
 <p>“Thank you… but I dislike sweet things.”</p>
 <p>But Kang Chul-In absolutely loathed eating sweet things.</p>
 <p>“Daughter also knows your taste preferences, and instead used Maltbee honey in this honeywater, and it is not sweet at all.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Arshelly’s eyes started sparkling, as if she was waiting for Kang Chul-In to compliment her.</p>
 <p>‘As expected of a kind daughter, should I say?’</p>
 <p>Thinking like this, Kang Chul-In drank the honeywater that Arshelly had made in one go. He felt it going down his throat cleanly, and was quite satisfied with its bitter taste.</p>
 <p>And staring at him was Arshelly, her gaze full of love.</p>
 <p>The next day.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In went to the small (?) poultry farm placed behind where the Lord lived.</p>
 <p>“Ohh, my Lord.” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was Adrian, the father of Lana Lovely. Maybe it was due to the stress of his daughter being lost, but Adrian had lost a great deal of hair since the last time they had met.</p>
 <p>“Get one of them.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Huh?”</p>
 <p>“Take the smallest, and skinniest one there.” Kang Chul-In pointed at the massive cage.</p>
 <p>And inside were 7 child Peacock Dragons.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Since the last time when they had succeeded in killing the Peacock Dragon, Kang Chul-In was able to take out the eggs out of the female’s belly, and were now growing them as livestock.</p>
 <p>The reason… they were planning on growing them like chicken, and using them for meat. Although it was doubtful if they could earn the Dragon Heart, with these Peacock Dragons being domesticated (?).</p>
 <p>“Already? After all, these things are still children and need at least 20 years to mature fully...”</p>
 <p>“I need meat.”</p>
 <p>It was due to Old man Kwon’s request.</p>
 <p>Old man Kwon continued to believe in Kang Chul-In. And for someone like him, taking out one of the seven childrenchild Peacock Dragons was not a big deal.</p>
 <p>“Oh, if you’re looking for meat, there’s still some leftover at the storage room.”</p>
 <p>“There’s some left?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, there was still quite some left after we had handed it around the city, so we made some of it into sausages and have some meat left too.”</p>
 <p>It was good news.</p>
 <p>“That’s good then. Tell Secretary Timothy and hand me over 10kg of the meat there.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, milord.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In smiled satisfiedly, as he didn’t need to unnecessarily kill the Peacock Dragons, which were very rare.</p>
 <p>“Are you raising them well?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Well, they’re not very obedient. And not only that, they’re already growing so big that I think we need to expand the cages. And since they are subspecies of dragons, we need at least 5 men in order to stop them if they’re on a rampage.”</p>
 <p>It seemed like they were hard to control, as prideful beasts.</p>
 <p>“Well, if you think they’re too disobedient, just go and beat them up.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In ordered.</p>
 <p>“Of course, not so bad for them to die.”</p>
 <p>‘Well, the processing of the sap is being continued, and Old man Kwon’s request is also completed. It’s time to head back to earth and finish of the business.”</p>
 <p>After this was over the Galaxy Corporation would definitely prosper even more, and after this, Kang Chul-In was ready to take over all of what was on the Eastern side of Pangaea. It was time to show his true power as the ‘Conquest Lord’.</p>
 <p>“Well, good luck.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Thank you, sire!”</p>
 <p>And saying that, Kang Chul-In was going to head back. Before he heard Adrian’s mumbling, that was.</p>
 <p>“Hmm… c’mon, hair, grow…. Grow…”</p>
 <p>Listening to this peculiar ‘chant’, Kang Chul-In turned his head around.</p>
 <p>‘Wait a minute…’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In’s face stiffened, looking at Adrian’s weird behavior.</p>
 <p>And this weird behavior of Adrian… was something that would make Kang Chul-In into the richest man in the world in the future.</p>
