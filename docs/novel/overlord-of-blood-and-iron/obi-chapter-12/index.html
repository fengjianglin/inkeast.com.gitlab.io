 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

 <p>Kang Chul-In ordered Lucia, but she did not move as if she had a malfunction. Something was bothering her.</p>
 <p><em>Uh… how does he know all the commands?</em></p>
 <p>Lucia did not show it on the outside, but on the inside, she was very taken aback. The Kang Chul-In who had given orders to see [My Status] and [Territory Status] without any help from her was a shocking sight.</p>
 <p><em>Will he not need me, by any chance?</em></p>
 <p>Lucia stiffened.</p>
 <p>It was understandable.</p>
 <p>The reason for her existence was for her to advise her Lord and grow Laputa, but if Kang Chul-In considered her useless, her existence would also be useless. For Lucia, it was understandable for her to be worried and upset.</p>
 <p>“Excuse me, milord.”</p>
 <p>Lucia mustered up the courage to ask Kang Chul-In because her very own existence was threatened.</p>
 <p>“May I ask you something?”</p>
 <p>Lucia, who had a cold and stern feel about her that contrasted with her full body, asked Kang Chul-In timidly. Kang Chul-In wondered why she was acting strange but nodded, allowing her to speak further.</p>
 <p>“Of course.”</p>
 <p>“You, milord, were able to use commands without my help. You were also not surprised or taken aback. Despite your greatness, you are too calm and composed in a strange, new place.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In did not agree or disagree with Lucia’s words and silently listened.</p>
 <p>“So that’s why I am asking you. Are you by any chance the ‘All-Knowing’?”</p>
 <p>It was a far-off guess.</p>
 <p><em>What the heck?</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In was taken aback by Lucia’s guess.</p>
 <p><em>All-Knowing?</em></p>
 <p><em>What was he, a God?</em></p>
 <p>It was an absurd statement.</p>
 <p>“No, I am not the All-Knowing.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In shook his head.</p>
 <p><em>I acted too deftly. It makes sense that she is puzzled.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In realized why Lucia had thought that and was briefly stumped on what to do next but decided to give an evasive answer.</p>
 <p>“This place is a foreign place to me, but also not so foreign.”</p>
 <p>Lucia tilted her head at the confusing statement.</p>
 <p>“What do you mean, sire?”</p>
 <p>Lucia spoke first before Kang Chul-In could explain further.</p>
 <p>“Is the place in which you were born similar to here?”</p>
 <p>The corners of Kang Chul-In’s lips twitched upwards. It was annoying to try to explain, but since she misunderstood first, it made it easier for him to make up something.</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In answered quickly.</p>
 <p>“So, in your hometown, did you reign over a territory as a Lord?”</p>
 <p>“You are right.”</p>
 <p>It was a lie, but in some sense, it was also true. It was a fact that he did reign over a territory and rose to the position of Overlord.</p>
 <p>“Oh, I understand now, my Lord.”</p>
 <p>Lucia nodded like she understood.</p>
 <p>“May I know what kind of Lord you were, my Lord?”</p>
 <p>For this question, Kang Chul-In could give an answer too, so he revealed his previous status as an Overlord.</p>
 <p>“I was an Overlord. And I was one of the strongest, if not the strongest Overlords amongst all Overlords.”</p>
 <p>“Overlord!”</p>
 <p>Lucia shivered. It was as if she felt a shudder in Kang Chul-In’s words.</p>
 <p>“Here, here in Pangaea, there is also a status of Overlord! They reign over large lands and command entire regions! My God! I am truly honored to serve you, milord!”</p>
 <p>Lucia’s response was dramatic to the point where it left Kang Chul-In surprised. However, it was not surprising. Like the Lords, secretaries also had their own worlds. They were more revered and respected the more powerful the Lords they served were.</p>
 <p>“Then, did you also have a Secretary?”</p>
 <p>Lucia asked.</p>
 <p>“I had a vampire butler named Alfred.”</p>
 <p>“How was the Secretary called Alfred? Was he competent? Were you satisfied with him?”</p>
 <p>Lucia questioned Kang Chul-In while all worked up, and her eyes burned with jealousy.</p>
 <p><em>Competition.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In saw right through Lucia’s emotional state.</p>
 <p>“Hmm.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In looked at Lucia who wanted, like a puppy, to hear that Alfred was an incompetent Secretary and started to speak.</p>
 <p>“Alfred was…”</p>
 <p>Lucia’s eyes glimmered as she concentrated on Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>“Incredibly competent.”</p>
 <p>It seemed that Lucia was shocked at his answer, but Kang Chul-In could not speak badly about Alfred, who was faithful to him until the end.</p>
 <p>“He was that good?”</p>
 <p>“I was able to rise to the position of Overlord because of him.”</p>
 <p>“Really?”</p>
 <p>Lucia’s face darkened.</p>
 <p><em>He was an Overlord in his hometown and had a good Secretary. What if, by chance, he casts me out? Will I be thrown away?</em></p>
 <p>Lucia, whose existence was threatened and was overcome with jealousy, was about to burst into tears at any moment.</p>
 <p><em>Is she afraid that she will be cast out? I will need to reassure her a little.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In, who could see right through Lucia, smiled widely and decided to prescribe a fitting medication. Even with his horrible personality, Kang Chul-In used to hold the position of Overlord. He knew how to handle his subordinates.</p>
 <p>“Lucia.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In called Lucia in a gentle voice.</p>
 <p>“Yes, milord.”</p>
 <p>Lucia’s voice was depressed.</p>
 <p>“You do not need to worry. I will not abandon you.”</p>
 <p>Lucia was surprised. It was understandable, seeing how Kang Chul-In had seen right through her.</p>
 <p>“From where I am from, the relationship between Overlord and Secretary is to the point where you can share your deepest and most private thoughts, things that you could not even tell your family.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, yes! It is the same here as well!”</p>
 <p>“Then you will understand quickly. Listen. You are my Secretary, and you are family with whom I would spend eternity. Why would I abandon you?”</p>
 <p>“Is that true?”</p>
 <p>“Yes. Although I might know a lot more than others, there will be much that I do not yet know. Also, instead of being jealous of Alfred, you just need to be better than him. Do not look so down and let’s work together to grow this territory.”</p>
 <p>“Ah!”</p>
 <p>Lucia exclaimed.</p>
 <p><em>Yes, what the Lord says is right! I will prove that I am more capable than Alfred!</em></p>
 <p>Lucia, who had been encouraged by Kang Chul-In, clenched her fists and vowed that she would prove to be more useful than Alfred.</p>
 <p><em>Simpleton.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In looked at Lucia and smirked but did not get caught. A Lord should not look easygoing, and he needed to maintain his dignity.</p>
 <p>“My Lord.”</p>
 <p>Lucia spoke with a determined face.</p>
 <p>“Speak.”</p>
 <p>“I, Lucia, will serve you with all my soul and heart and will prove my competence to you!”</p>
 <p>“Good.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In looked pleased.</p>
 <p>“First, I will complete the tutorial quest. Get my troops ready for inspection like I had ordered.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, my Lord!”</p>
 <p>Lucia answered in a lively manner.</p>
 <p>“I will order the troops to muster!”</p>
 <p>After Lucia left to prepare for inspection, Kang Chul-In took the time to look at the Tutorial Quest description.</p>
 <p>[Tutorial 1] Level 10 Obtained</p>
 <p>Description: Reach Level 10</p>
 <p>Reward: Experience +500/ 20 gold/ Use of Warp Gate (Unlimited)</p>
 <p>Reference: Unable to return to Earth without completing Quest</p>
 <p>Reference: Conquer other Lords. +5 Levels</p>
 <p>Reference: Related to Tutorial 2 Quest</p>
 <p>The warp gate was the passage that connected Earth and Pangaea and was a must-have for dimension travelers. Therefore, in order to return to earth, the Tutorial 1 Quest needed to be cleared.</p>
 <p>[Tutorial 2] Monster Subjugation</p>
 <p>Description: Defeat the monsters living in the territory.</p>
 <p>Reward: Experience +250 / 20 Gold</p>
 <p>Current Status: 0/500</p>
 <p><em>It’s the same as the past.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In checked that the quests were the same as the ones he experienced before. He then decided that he would clear the tutorial quests as soon as possible. It would be difficult because he was low-level. However, if he put all his energy into it, 3 or 4 days would be enough. As he was thinking, Lucia appeared and notified him that the inspection preparations were complete.</p>
 <p>“Let us go quickly, my Lord. The troops are longing to meet you.”</p>
 <p>“Really?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, my Lord.”</p>
 <p>“I will go right away.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In headed out.</p>
