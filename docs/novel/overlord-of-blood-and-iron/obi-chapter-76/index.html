 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Nothing happened. Even to the point where the serious immortal knight felt embarrassed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“A disaster, huh…”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In snorted at what the immortal knight had said before. They were words that had flipped him over.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Fake Lord?”</p>
 <p>“Look carefully with your two eyes and see who the true Lord of Laputa is!”</p>
 <p>The sword that was only meant for the true Lord of Laputa was being firmly grasped between Kang Chul-In’s hands.&nbsp;</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>I-I cannot accept this.&nbsp;</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The immortal knight stammered, denying reality.</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>O-Only his majesty is the true Lord of Laputa.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>“Both you, as well as Nilus. Only knowing to speak of the stupid past.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In also dissed Nilus unintentionally(?).</p>
 <p>“That stupid emperor that you guys are talking about probably died a horrible death over a thousand years ago, how amazing is he for you guys to still be rambling on about him?”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In found it difficult to accept this, and found it stupid.</p>
 <p>“If you really want to see ‘his majesty’, why don’t you go around the continent digging for some bones. Maybe you’ll be able to see him then.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In spoke insolently, not caring at all about that stupid ‘his majesty’.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>How amazing was he, and how similar was the emperor to him that Nilus and the immortal knight were still talking about him after so long.</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>H-How dare you speak like that to the emperor!</li>
 </ul>
 <p>“What stupid emperor. If you wanna see him that badly... “</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In spoke.</p>
 <p>“Go to hell.”</p>
 <p>And saying that, Kang Chul-In poured mana into his blade, causing something astonishing to happen.</p>
 <p>The sword’s shape was peculiar, with the blade being about 90cm long, and the handle adding an extra 40cm there, with the shape being similar to Earth’s two-handed sword ‘Zweihander’, and seemed to weigh at least 20kg.</p>
 <p>And not only that, there was gold in some parts of the sword, for some reason. And the moment he poured mana into this peculiar shaped sword, Kang Chul-In was faced with a voice from a world that was made of nothing.</p>
 <p>- You, do, not, have, the qualifications, to possess me, yet.</p>
 <p>And this voice once again spoke, startling Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>- If you want to be accepted by me, become stronger.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In could tell where this voice was originating from. It was the sword, the sword was talking to him.</p>
 <p>An 'Ego Sword', a sword that has its own mind!</p>
 <p>It looked unique from the beginning, and it seemed like the sword was actually one that even surpassed the epic rank.</p>
 <p>-Although you are laughing, I will lend you my power this once.</p>
 <p>The Ego Sword spoke.</p>
 <p>"Hmph, know your place. Don't speak of lending your power to others when you're just a scrap of metal."</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In's will and the Ego Sword fought against each other mentally.</p>
 <p>- A puny, human, dares, to challenge, me?</p>
 <p>"Kneel, you piece of scrap metal."</p>
 <p>The two mental energies had a silent clash against each other.</p>
 <p>- Do, you, not surrender?</p>
 <p>The Ego Sword started to fight with a greater power than before. Although this was enough energy to completely destroy the mind of an ordinary person, Kang Chul-In fought resiliently.</p>
 <p>'If I do not endure here, I will be devoured.'</p>
 <p>Objects with its own mind were in fact evil tools that could devour one's soul. At that point it was not the person swinging the sword, but the sword controlling the human-being instead. The one in control would change.</p>
 <p>- Surrender, and I, will give, you strength.</p>
 <p>The Ego Sword continued to pressure Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>But Kang Chul-In was not an ordinary person.</p>
 <p>'Stupid piece of metal.'</p>
 <p>As rage started seeping out of Kang Chul-In, his will also got stronger. The anger was able to intensify Kang Chul-In's mental power.</p>
 <p>"Know your place."</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In easily pushed away and overpowered the mental strength of the Ego Sword.</p>
 <p>-How, can, a human, have, this, strength...!</p>
 <p>The Ego Sword was very surprised.</p>
 <p>"I will erase your existence."</p>
 <p>- ......!</p>
 <p>"Get lost, you piece of scrap metal."</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In prepared himself one last time, and started to push even harder against the Ego Sword.</p>
 <p>- Your, mental, strength, is powerful.</p>
 <p>The Ego Sword was impressed.</p>
 <p>- But, now, is, not the time, to fight.</p>
 <p>And saying that, the Ego Sword stopped pressuring Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>- We, should stop, today.</p>
 <p>It was the Ego Sword that tried to run away from the confrontation.</p>
 <p>"You cannot run without my permission, scrap metal."</p>
 <p>But Kang Chul-In continued to pressure the Ego Sword with his mental power.</p>
 <p>- I, am not, a piece, of, scrap metal. I, am, the only, sword, of, the, mighty, Emperor, of, Blood, and Iron. I, am, the, Soft Sword (literal translation is snake sword, but I thought soft sword would be better), Kaiforce.</p>
 <p>TZZT!</p>
 <p>And at that moment, the world that the two of them were having their silent confrontation in started to split and crack.</p>
 <p>-Today, I will, go back. Later, I, will, test, you, again.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In couldn't stop Kaiforce from running away. It seemed as if the world was made purely of Kaiforce's will. It was not his territory.</p>
 <p>"Stupid scrap metal, come again any time you want."</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In instead insulted Kaiforce for running away.</p>
 <p>And he opened his eyes.</p>
 <p>"Huu..."</p>
 <p>Maybe it was because he had spent a ridiculous amount of mental energy, but Kang Chul-In felt exhausted, but his body felt surging with strength.</p>
 <p>".....!"</p>
 <p>Something was off.</p>
 <p>His body, that was full of wounds was completely healed now. Even his depleted mana was completely full again, and his body was once again functioning perfectly.</p>
 <p>"M-Milord!"</p>
 <p>And looking at Kang Chul-In, Lucia was deeply moved.</p>
 <p>"Kang Chul-In... how?"</p>
 <p>Dorian was surprised.</p>
 <p>"Mi-Milord... how... can... you have... such strength?"</p>
 <p>And James was also startled.</p>
 <p>"Kuku... as expected of his majesty."</p>
 <p>And Nilus, as usual was laughing uproariously as if he had expected that this would happen.</p>
 <p>'Is it due to this thing?'</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In stared at Kaiforce, that was within his hands.</p>
 <p>[Epic] Soft Sword Kaiforce</p>
 <p>The famous sword of the Emperor of Blood and Iron of the Ancient Kingdom.</p>
 <p>Attack Power: 500 (Before Awakening)</p>
 <p>Durability: Infinite</p>
 <p>Option 1: All stats + 15% (Before Awakening)</p>

 <p>Penalty Option 4: Every hour, lose mental strength</p>
 <p>Hidden: (Unavailable, Unlocked after level 90)</p>
 <p>HIdden: (Unavailable, Unlocked after level 120)</p>
 <p>'This is ridiculous'.</p>
 <p>As expected, the sword was ridiculously powerful.</p>
 <p>Although Kang Chul-In was at a low level and could not show the true force of the weapon, there was no epic item that could have the same stats and impact as Kaiforce at this level.</p>
 <p>The only downside to this sword was the fact that this sword would try to devour his soul.</p>
 <p>When he was off guard, and his mental barrier was down, Kaiforce would undoubtedly try to strike against him. He definitely needed to be careful. Kaiforce was truly what you would call a two-sided blade.</p>
 <p>'Well, we'll see whether you, or I win'.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In swore in his heart.</p>
 <p>He could tell that the sword was not truly under his control.</p>
 <p>- You... have... gotten the approval of Kaiforce...</p>
 <p>The immortal knight's voice was quivering.</p>
 <p>- The Soul Core of Laputa... Kaiforce... Maybe you are the true...</p>
 <p>Although the immortal knight was looking at him confusedly, Kang Chul-In wasn't one to care.</p>
 <p>"Test?"</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In had no intention of finishing the ongoing fight.</p>
 <p>And even before the immortal knight kneeled...</p>
 <p>"I do not need your approval."</p>
 <p>Holding Kaiforce, Kang Chul-In dashed towards the immortal knight.</p>
 <p>KAKANG!</p>
 <p>And he swung his sword at the immortal knight's blade.</p>
 <p>TZZT!</p>
 <p>And unexpectedly, a crack appeared within the immortal knight's sword.</p>
 <p>'I will destroy it.'</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In was one to never forgive ones that had driven him to the brink.</p>
 <p>And not only this, the immortal knight had mocked and insulted Kang Chul-In, humiliating him as well as saying that he wasn't the true Lord of Laputa. To Kang Chul-In, the only option left was death.</p>
 <p>CHULKUK!</p>
 <p>And bending to Kang Chul-In's will, Kaiforce suddenly changed shape, and changed into a saw.</p>
 <p>TZZT!</p>
 <p>And with sword light activated on the saw that was Kaiforce, it ripped apart the midriff of the immortal knight, as if the knight's armor was made of tofu.</p>
 <p>CRASH!</p>
 <p>And the immortal knight, that was already half destroyed, knelt down on the spot.</p>
 <p>"Kang Chul-In... that monster..."</p>
 <p>Dorian mumbled.</p>
 <p>- The owner of Kaiforce... The true Lord of Laputa...</p>
 <p>And the fallen immortal knight looked so weak and frail.</p>
 <p>-I... I see your majesty...</p>
 <p>The immortal knight strained to look at Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>-It... It is an honor to see you again...</p>
 <p>But staring at the immortal knight, Kang Chul-In's gaze was piercingly cold.</p>
 <p>"Just like a broken clock..."</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In rated the immortal knight like this.</p>
 <p>"Why don't you just remain in the past forever."</p>
 <p>And he swung Kaifroce.</p>
 <p>CHOP!</p>
 <p>And decapitated the immortal knight.</p>
 <p>KWANG!</p>
 <p>And with a loud noise, the head made of metal rolled on the floor.</p>
 <p>"What your majesty."</p>
 <p>'As for the rest...'</p>
 <p>There were still enemies that he had to destroy and kill. The spectre knights were still remaining.</p>
 <p>"...Where are they?"</p>
 <p>But the spectre knights were gone.</p>
 <p>"Milord...!"</p>
 <p>Lucia, who was in an absolutely pitiful state wobbled towards Kang Chul-In, and handed him a blackish bracelet.</p>
 <p>"The spectre knights... were all absorbed into this bracelet."</p>
 <p>It was also an epic item.</p>
 <p>[Epic] Owner of the Ghosts</p>
 <p>A bracelet that has the ghosts that were part of the Ancient Kingdom's Knights.</p>
 <p>Option 1: Summons 50 Spectre Knights that are 70% of the owner's level (at least level 40) (Cooldown: 24 hours)</p>
 <p>An item that had the option to summon forces that were equivalent to a knight force and grew along with the user? An item like this was absolutely amazing to the current Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>"Lucia."</p>
 <p>Putting the bracelet onto his hand, Kang Chul-In spoke to Lucia.</p>
 <p>"Yes, milord."</p>
 <p>"Just endure for a little bit more. Only the final boss is left."</p>
 <p>"Milord... you will challenge it right away..?"</p>
 <p>"James isn't in a good condition right now."</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In pointed at the unconscious James.</p>
 <p>"We need to hurry up, and get back quickly.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In walked towards the altar in big strides.</p>
 <p>"Just hide your bodies for a while. I will fight the boss alone."</p>
 <p>Not to mention the fact that he was at a perfect condition, he had even earnt Kaiforce, and could also summon the Spectre Knights. He was planning on destroying the final boss right now.</p>
 <p>It was easy to open the door.</p>
 <p>As he walked towards the door Kaiforce started emitting light, and all Kang Chul-In had to do was insert Kaiforce into the door like a key. It seemed like Kaiforce was required to go to the next stage.</p>
 <p>CREAKKK!</p>
 <p>And the door slowly opened.</p>
 <p>'A marionetteer that has incredible psychokinesis.'</p>
 <p>Thinking of the boss beyond the door, Kang Chul-In prepared himself. Although this would definitely be a tough fight, he didn't feel any sort of life threatening danger.</p>
 <p>But... as the door opened, Kang Chul-In almost dropped Kaiforce.</p>
 <p>Maybe the age of an elementary school student?</p>
 <p>A girl with black hair holding a teddy bear within her small arms stared at Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>And she spoke.</p>
 <p>"Royal Father?"</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In's face stiffened.</p>
