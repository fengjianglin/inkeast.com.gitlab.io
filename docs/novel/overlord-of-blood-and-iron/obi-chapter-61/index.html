 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

 <p>Kang Chul-in in the battlefield was like a fish in the water, and was like a lion in a pack of gazelles.</p>
 <p>Overdrive?</p>
 <p>There was no need to use such a high level technique to fight against these normal soldiers.</p>
 <p>Whenever he swung his swords, the soldiers fell.</p>
 <p>“D-Don’t come!”</p>
 <p>One of the Crete soldiers started instinctively backing off when he met Kang Chul-in.</p>
 <p>“Go away…”</p>
 <p>But he died mid sentence, Kang Chul-in’s sword impaled in his body.</p>
 <p>‘Further.’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in went deeper into the enemy lines, slashing and killing all of the enemies that he saw.</p>
 <p>And before him was a red line of blood. Wherever he went, blood flowed.</p>
 <p>Even after killing tens of soldiers in just a moment, Kang Chul-in wasn’t satisfied, going even further in the battlefield.</p>
 <p>“What the fu** is this?”</p>
 <p>The Lord of the Tempaman territory, Reginald was absolutely pissed.</p>
 <p>But he had a right to be.</p>
 <p>He used his secret card, the twin-head ogre, but as soon as the enemy Lord, Elizabeth headed into battle, the battle became even again.</p>
 <p>And not only that.</p>
 <p>The twin-head ogre was slain by some sort of energy blast, and his secretary also disappeared without a trace after getting shot at.</p>
 <p>He had lost both his most important soldier, and his most important accountant.</p>
 <p>And Reginald didn’t see an extra army coming in either.</p>
 <p>“I thought we had crushed them already…”</p>
 <p>It was the Dorado territory’s army.</p>
 <p>‘How?’</p>
 <p>He kept on thinking about it, but couldn’t come up with an explanation.</p>
 <p>“Milord! Our formation is crumbling!”</p>
 <p>Listening to the general on his side, Reginald’s face stiffened even more, but he couldn’t just let out his anger.</p>
 <p>Because the fight was so bad, they needed to retreat.</p>
 <p>“Retreat!”</p>
 <p>Reginald shouted.</p>
 <p>“Get out of there!”</p>
 <p>But the army was in total chaos, and no-one knew what to do.</p>
 <p>The order to retreat definitely wouldn’t work in this situation.</p>
 <p>“Hah….”</p>
 <p>And finally, Reginald let out a sigh of despair.</p>
 <p>The chaotic army, the death of the twin-head ogre, and a seriously fearsome new army. These things drove Reginald to the brink of despair.</p>
 <p>And while the Tempaman’s Lord was despairing, the Lord of Crete, Elizabeth, was still fighting bravely.</p>
 <p>“I’M GOING TO KILL EVERYONE!”</p>
 <p>Elizabeth’s confidence was at the peak.</p>
 <p>“Milord!”</p>
 <p>Eva didn’t care about her death, and ran towards her.</p>
 <p>Although the Tempaman soldiers stabbed their weapons towards her, Eva, despite her weak battle prowess, dodged through them brilliantly.</p>
 <p>“Milord, milord!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Eva called Elizabeth, who was in the middle of slaughtering her enemies.</p>
 <p>“Milord, we need to get out! The Dorado territory…”</p>
 <p>“I know.”</p>
 <p>“Who doesn’t know that?”</p>
 <p>Eva was surprised. Elizabeth’s face was contorted, like a devil.</p>
 <p>“But let them come. Dorado’s army? As if that stupid b*tch Lee Chae-rin could do anything.”</p>
 <p>“But your majesty…”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“SHUT UP!”</p>
 <p>Although Elizabeth was reckless, her battle prowess was truly superb. Similar to Kang Chul-in, everywhere she went, blood flowed.</p>
 <p>“I… I control the battlefield.”</p>
 <p>Elizabeth was drunk in her own fighting ability, as she killed.</p>
 <p>But she wasn’t the only Lord roaming the battlefield.</p>
 <p>“D-Demon…”</p>
 <p>The Tempaman soldiers looked around at the dead bodies, and said.</p>
 <p>“Get out.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in pushed the soldier out the way.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;He was a conqueror, not a serial killer.</p>
 <p>He wouldn’t kill those who had put down their weapons and were trembling in fear.</p>
 <p>And then, Elizabeth came into Kang Chul-in’s vision.</p>
 <p>‘Reckless.’</p>
 <p>Was what he thought at first.</p>
 <p>‘No, brilliant.’</p>
 <p>Looking at her fighting ability, Kang Chul-in was captivated.</p>
 <p>She really was brilliant.</p>
 <p>She had powerful strength, speed and precision. She really wasn’t the ordinary fighter.</p>
 <p>If not for the Dorado territory, she alone would have changed the outcome of the war against the Tempaman.</p>
 <p>‘She needs to be stopped.’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in thought, and immediately rushed towards her location.</p>
 <p>“Nilus.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in called the magicians.</p>
 <p>“Yes! Your highness!”</p>
 <p>“I will go away for now, so cause some chaos on the battlefield!”</p>
 <p>“Yes, your highness!”</p>
 <p>Nilus soon after chanted the spell of ‘Reverse Gravity field’, and limited the movement of the enemies.</p>
 <p>As expected of a future Ark Mage, Nilus’s magical prowess was truly astonishing.</p>
 <p>And meanwhile, no-one could stop Kang Chul-in’s path.</p>
 <p>Everyone that tried to stop him was slain.</p>
 <p>The controller of the battlefield had to be free, when roaming it.</p>
 <p>“There.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in said.</p>
 <p>“Move out, I will fight.”</p>
 <p>He made the exhausted Dorado soldiers get out of the way, and allowed him to fight instead of them.</p>
 <p>And the two superbly powerful Lords faced each other.</p>
 <p>“Who the hell are you?”</p>
 <p>Elizabeth saw Kang Chul-in, and made an interested expression. Her eyes, which were red with madness, seemed to drip blood.</p>
 <p>‘A berserker. One that’s drunk in the blood spilled in war.’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in immediately knew what state Elizabeth was in.</p>
 <p>There were some cases like this.</p>
 <p>Blood, there were some cases where people would lose their mind because of it. It was like the most extreme case of PTSD.</p>
 <p>“Impressive.”</p>
 <p>“What is.”</p>
 <p>Elizabeth said to Kang Chul-in, in a taunting voice, realizing that Kang Chul-in himself was very powerful too.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in didn’t answer.</p>
 <p>“To think that there was a Lord like you…”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in could tell that her special ability had something to do with swordsmanship.</p>
 <p>“Tell me, what is impressive?”</p>
 <p>Elizabeth said.</p>
 <p>“My skill?” And showed her confidence.</p>
 <p>“Skill?”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in smirked at her.</p>
 <p>Elizabeth’s skills were admittedly impressive. After all, she forced Kang Chul-in to come back and help his soldiers.</p>
 <p>But it wasn’t surprising.</p>
 <p>She was just a Lord who relied heavily on her ability, which wasn’t truly impressive. He only said that he was surprised because it had been a long time since he had met someone so crazy.</p>
 <p>“As if. With that tiny bit of skill?”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in didn’t care about her at all.</p>
 <p>“HOW DARE YOU IGNORE ME!”</p>
 <p>Elizabeth’s eyes turned cold, and stared at Kang Chul-in.</p>
 <p>“Just you?”</p>
 <p>‘Pfttt.’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in smirked again.</p>
 <p>“Come.”</p>
 <p>And he stared at Elizabeth, and opened his mouth.</p>
 <p>This was the beginning of the fight of the two Lords.</p>
