 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

 <p>Kang Chul-In, Manager Park, along with an extra two gangsters faced off on the windy rooftop.</p>
 <p><em>Hmm… I still have a little headache. I should rest for a couple days.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In was busy thinking of other things, even in front of three well-built gangsters.</p>
 <p>It was understandable.</p>
 <p>A lion would not be afraid or restless because of some flies on him, just bothered, and like so, Kang Chul-In didn’t have any interest.</p>
 <p><em>First, I’ll rest for a couple days. Then, what should I do first? I should first work out again… Oh! Kwak Jung! Kwak Jung first!</em></p>
 <p>And right then, he decided that he would need to find a strategist who would match up to Lee Gong-Myung. From all of Kang Chul-In’s tasks, finding Kwak Jung was top priority. It seemed logical because around this time, Lee Gong-Myung would have been attending Harvard University in the United States with Alex Rothschild, building their friendship, making it difficult for him to approach anyway. In contrast, Kwak Jung might be easy to find. According to the word on the street, Kwak Jung was from Seoul, and although it was not solid information, it was enough to go on.</p>
 <p><em>I must find him.</em></p>
 <p>It is not too hard to find someone in South Korea. If you have a name, one could search for them on Facebook or Twitter, and if not those two, then Google. If these ways didn’t work, one could hire a detective.</p>
 <p>Although it would cost some money, but to locate someone in a short amount of time, this would be the best way.</p>
 <p><em>I’ll make some inquiries.</em></p>
 <p>It would be better to spend some money than to be stuck in a room with a computer, searching for Kwak-Jung’s whereabouts.</p>
 <p>After all, he did have a reputation to maintain as an Overlord.</p>
 <p><em>Hmm… if it is a private detective office or inquiry office, it’s usually run by gangsters and thugs.</em></p>
 <p>The thought flashed through his mind, and that thought brought Kang Chul-In’s eyes to the gangsters standing in front of him.</p>
 <p>“Here are just the perfect ones at the perfect time.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In’s mouth flashed a large smile.</p>
 <p>“What is this dog?”</p>
 <p>Manager Park met the eyes of Kang Chul-In and shivered as chills spread all over his body. He felt uneasy as if he had become prey, which also hurt his ego. And the premonition that he would be the one injured popped into his brain, like a disease.</p>
 <p>“Hey, gangster boss.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In called Manager Park.</p>
 <p>“Gang Boss?”</p>
 <p>“Well, of course you are a gang boss. What else would you be, a civilian boss?”</p>
 <p>“You little!”</p>
 <p>“I’m not scared of you, so cut the bluffing. I want to make an offer.”</p>
 <p>The three gangsters, including Manager Park were speechless for a moment, and Kang Chul-In continued.</p>
 <p>“You.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In poked Manager Park’s chest.</p>
 <p>“Work for me.”</p>
 <p>Manager Park was speechless and stared at Kang Chul-In, baffled at this unimaginable situation. He could think nothing else than to beat some sense into this rude little bastard. The problem was that the one who said this meant every word.</p>
 <p>“You crazy bastard!”</p>
 <p>Manager Park’s subordinate could not hold his anger any longer, roared, and took a swing at Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>“What is this?”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In easily dodged the swing and threw a knee kick. With a large ripping noise, the Manager’s subordinate fell to the floor like a rag doll.</p>
 <p>The gangster clutched his stomach, groaning.</p>
 <p>He got knee-kicked as a counter after he stupidly used his fists, and the damage was not something that could be overcome that easily.</p>
 <p>“B-boss!”</p>
 <p>The youngest of the three gangsters called Manager Park. Then, he lunged at Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>“Hey, you bastard!”</p>
 <p>The gangster tried to pin down Kang Chul-In by using his body weight, which seemed to easily weigh more than 100kg. However, Kang Chul-In had once been the strongest man on Pangaea. Even without his skills, his power would be unmatched by a common human.</p>
 <p><em>Bam, bam!</em></p>
 <p>A One-Two punch landed on his face.</p>
 <p><em>Crack!</em></p>
 <p>And another hook landed on the gangster’s chin.</p>
 <p><em>Thud!</em></p>
 <p>The large gangster fell on the ground, making a sound so loud that it seemed as if a stone had split in half. And he was silent. He had been knocked out.</p>
 <p>“This bastard… is he a professional fighter?”</p>
 <p>Manager Park who had seen his two subordinates fall in a flash then realized that he had messed with the wrong man.</p>
 <p>“What fighter,” Kang Chul-In answered, smirking.</p>
 <p>“Anyways, why don’t you give me an answer to my appealing offer? Work under me?”</p>
 <p>“YOU BASTARD!”</p>
 <p>“Hm, you will anyways!”</p>
 <p>“Shut your mouth!”</p>
 <p>And with that, Manager Park lunged at Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In noticed that Manager Park was using a ground-fighting technique as he lurched at him like a bear. It seemed like he did have an athletic background.</p>
 <p>“You have met your match today, you bastard!”</p>
 <p>Manager Park roared.</p>
 <p>You could feel the determination in his voice to pin Kang Chul-In to the ground.</p>
 <p>But.</p>
 <p>Unfortunately, Manager Park’s determination was nothing but a delusion.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In had been gifted in his strength and leadership at birth, but he was also an extremely hard-working man.</p>
 <p>In his past life, he had mastered and studied almost all contemporary martial arts on his own.</p>
 <p>And Manager Park, who was an amateur at best, was no match.</p>
 <p><em>Whish whish!</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In turned his body and bore into the Manager’s sides.</p>
 <p>“Huk!”</p>
 <p>And the surprised shout was brief as Kang Chul-In grabbed Manager Kang’s waist and lifted him backwards, flipping him on his back. It was a modified Suplex.</p>
 <p><em>Thud!</em></p>
 <p>Manager Park landed on his back on the roof.</p>
 <p>“O-Ouch!”</p>
 <p>Manager Park gripped his back and moaned.</p>
 <p>“Stand up. It doesn’t even hurt that bad.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In said heartlessly.</p>
 <p>To be honest, a suplex is not a skill that inflicts too much damage, but that is in the case when the skill is performed on top of a mat. If it is performed on bare ground, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the damage could be fatal.</p>
 <p>“Y-you bastard! I’ll kill you!”</p>
 <p>Thus, Manager Park’s initial thoughts to just scold Kang Chul-In lightly and let it go disappeared.</p>
 <p>“YOU’RE DEAD!”</p>
 <p>Manager Park stood up and lunged at Kang Chul-In again. It seemed like he had quite a bit of pain tolerance and endurance, being a gang boss and all.</p>
 <p><em>Not bad, but he needs to know his place.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In recognized Manager Park’s endurance but decided that he will teach him a lesson. If you wanted to have someone work under you, you would need control.</p>
 <p><em>Thwack!</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In spun a low-kick, hitting Manager Park’s calf.</p>
 <p>“ARGH!”</p>
 <p>Manager Park screamed.</p>
 <p>However, he wasn’t fazed, and Manager Park came at Kang Chul-In again, closing the distance between them. It was Manager Park’s pride that would not allow him to lose.</p>
 <p><em>Oh? How long are you going to hold out?</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul thought as he hit the Manager’s left calf again with a low kick. He hit the same spot!</p>
 <p><em>Thwack!</em></p>
 <p>A tenacious, clear sound filled the rooftop.</p>
 <p>“Urgh…”</p>
 <p>It would not have been a surprise if Manager Park had broken his shin.</p>
 <p><em>Plop.</em></p>
 <p>Manager Park fell to his knees. His legs had gone limp.</p>
 <p>“Hmm… it probably didn’t break?”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In looked at Manager Park as if he was a piece of art that he had painted and mumbled to himself. For Manager Park, who heard everything, Kang Chul-In was adding fuel to fire.</p>
 <p>“You evil bastard!”</p>
 <p>Manager Park exclaimed as if he was complaining of an unfair situation.</p>
 <p>“Just beat me up! You hit the same place over and over again, you dirty mongrel!”</p>
 <p>As he was screaming, tears were streaming down his face, and snot was running from his nose. On the rooftop of a building in Seochodong, a grown adult whose job was a gang boss was crying with snot running down his face.</p>
 <p>“Hmm… he still hasn’t learned.”</p>
 <p>And looking at this, Kang Chul-In’s face seemed unsatisfied.</p>
 <p>“Haven’t learned yet?”</p>
 <p>Manager Park flinched. Was this not over yet?</p>
 <p>“I’ll massage you for a little while longer.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In flashed an evil smile and stepped towards Manager Park.</p>
 <p>“M-MOM!”</p>
 <p>Manager Park recognized that his endurance and pride as a gangster was breaking down as he called for his mother, who he had left behind in his hometown.</p>
 <p>And soon after, the sound of pig slaughter and blows landing filled the rooftop and rose to the sky.</p>
