 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>A month and a half had passed by, and Kang Chul-In had succeeded in conquering two territories, and was looking to head back.</p>
 <p>Out of the two territories, the Lord of the ‘Linguini’ territory had run away back to Earth the second that he had heard of his army’s defeat, and the Lord of the ‘Schiaparelli’ territory had offered a one on one fight, where Kang Chul-In easily defeated him.</p>
 <p>And now that Kang Chul-In had conquered these two territories, his overall territory had expanded, and he now controlled over 60% of the eastern plains in Pangaea.</p>
 <p>And as he was looking to get back to the Laputa territory, a letter came from his&nbsp;</p>
 <p>‘adopted daughter’, Arshelly.</p>
 <p>----</p>
 <p>Dear beloved father,</p>
 <p>How are you doing, father?&nbsp;</p>
 <p>I have heard the news that you have been winning consecutive battles, and that you have succeeded in conquering other territories!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>I have heard that you are returning soon, and cannot wait for your arrival, I wish to see you soon, father. I am well, and I hope you are too.</p>
 <p>I miss you, father.</p>
 <p>I love you.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yours sincerely, your daughter, Arshelly.</p>
 <p>P.S: The Altaica has grown to the point where it is now larger than a fully grown tiger.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>P.S: I have learnt the ways of making honeyed water or wine from another, other girl called Lana Lovely. I wish to let you try some when you get back.</p>
 <p>-----</p>
 <p>And looking at this letter, Kang Chul-In smiled unconsciously.</p>
 <p>Although Kang Chul-In was someone who hated whiny kids, Arshelly was so sensible that it was hard to see her as a 9 year old child.</p>
 <p>At that moment.</p>
 <p>“Milord, we are ready to march back to our territory.”</p>
 <p>Lucia reported.</p>
 <p>“Good, it’s about time to head back.”</p>
 <p>And night fell.</p>
 <p>‘There are still 6 months before the first Lord meetings, and 3 months will be hard for war, since it’s winter. Now… what to do with those 3 months?’</p>
 <p>There were a lot of options that he had open to him.</p>
 <p>He could start leveling up like crazy with his fellow explorer Dorian, he could start doing special exercises and training for his army, or do some self-training too. Winter was a good season to develop his forces, as it was hard for a war to break out.</p>
 <p>‘No. But first, I’m going to take a look at Valhalla.’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In decided on a long journey.</p>
 <p>“No-one has taken control over it, right?”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In whispered to himself, as he thought of his old Secretary, Alfred, as well as his generals: the dark elf Bellatrix, and the elf Lucy.</p>
 <p>But at that moment, his thoughts were interrupted by a sudden shake in the ground.</p>
 <p>“Emergency! Emergency!”</p>
 <p>“Enemies!”</p>
 <p>“Get ready to fight!” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Lucia ran into Kang Chul-In’s tent, and spoke to him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Milord! There are five approaching Atlases approaching us at high speeds!”</p>
 <p>‘Atlases? No way!’</p>
 <p>Even Kang Chul-In, who remained calm at almost all times was startled this time. It was because of how strong Atlases were.</p>
 <p>“We will stop 3 of them here, and let our main army defend against 2 of the Atlases.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In stared at the Atlases that were still approaching them, now barely a kilometer away from them.</p>
 <p>Suuu….!</p>
 <p>Starlight shone on Kaiforce, which had turned into a broadsword.</p>
 <p>And as Kang Chul-In fought one on one against one of the Atlases, Lucia led herself, along with a group of Battle Ogres, and Troll Shieldmen to defend against two of them. And a ferocious battle took place afterward.</p>
 <p>-----</p>
 <p>“Oh? Look at them!”</p>
 <p>The Lord of the Mechan Dome, Franz Waldstein spoke to himself, looking at Kang Chul-In and Lucia’s battle prowess.</p>
 <p>“Maybe I should have sent all of them instead…”</p>
 <p>“Milord…”</p>
 <p>His secretary, a steel marionette spoke.</p>
 <p>“I don’t think there is a reason to do that. Isn’t it just a practice run anyway? Take a look over there.”</p>
 <p>And the marionette pointed at where two Atlases were wreaking absolute havok in the Laputa force’s main army.</p>
 <p>“Run!”</p>
 <p>“Hmm.. I guess you’re right.”</p>
 <p>Franz said, satisfied with himself.</p>
 <p>“Well, how many Atlases can we further make?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Franz asked his secretary.</p>
 <p>“I think… the maximum should be 12 for now.”</p>
 <p>“Only that much? Ah… If I had just 100 of those things, I would be able to easily conquer this continent. Anyway… I’m satisfied with their performance right now.”</p>
 <p>Franz nodded.</p>
 <p>“Milord, since we’ve started our attack, why not just decimate their entire army?”</p>
 <p>“That seems like a plan to me. Hmm… the booster button… where is it…”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;But it was at that moment, when Franz was looking to boost the potential of the Atlases, a massive explosion shocked him.</p>
 <p>“W-What? How even…”</p>
 <p>The Atlas… the expensive magic weapon that he had designed with his ability… was lying on the floor, now a huge hunk of scrap metal.&nbsp;</p>
