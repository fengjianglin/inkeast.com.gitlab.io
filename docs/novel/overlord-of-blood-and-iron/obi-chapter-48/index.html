 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Then let him in please, Secretary Sledge.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Chae-Rin had been waiting for Kang Chul-In the whole time and wanted to meet him badly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“So you’ve come.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">For her, who was being attacked by an alliance of two other Lords, she was delighted to see that Kang Chul-In had come.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However… there was someone who made the happiness go away…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Milord, why are you letting an unidentified person come into our territory?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It was Secretary Sledge.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I’ll meet him first and decide whether he is fit to see you or not. So please wait here.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Even though he was Chae-Rin’s Secretary, he had no respect for her.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The reason was complicated.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">First of all, the dwarves were sexist and believed that males were greater and more important than females. They had strong and prideful personalities and would never allow a female ruler to order them around.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">So the fact that Chae-Rin had chosen this territory was a disaster.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Second, Lee Chae-Rin had almost no charisma at all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Third, to the dwarves, Nidavellir was a sacred place, and even though their Lord opposed trying to take it back, they didn’t listen to her.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">All the dwarves thought about was taking it back.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In conclusion, all of these factors lead to the dwarves ridiculing and mistreating their own Lord, which had caused a disaster.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“H-how dare you….” thought Chae-Rin as she felt rage boiling inside her.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">From the beginning of the great summoning, she was confused, and now, all of her pent-up feelings felt like they were going to erupt and explode like a volcano.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Not only that, after hearing from Kang Chul-In the life and ways of a Lord, she felt humiliated and disgusted by the actions that her own Secretary, Sledge, was taking.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Calm down, me,” thought Chae-Rin as she fought the urge to punch her Secretary in the face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right now, Secretary Sledge was on the verge of rebelling against her for the territory of Dorado. If she raged right now and managed to irk him, no one could tell whether he would truly fight back against her.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Secretary Sledge.” Closing her eyes, Chae-Rin spoke.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Please speak,” Sledge retorted in a disrespectful manner.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“The one that’s here right now is someone I know from my hometown. He’s not someone to be suspicious of, so you can let him in.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Are you sure about that?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“And how can I trust what milord is saying?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“……!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">At that moment, Lee Chae-Rin felt that all the blood in her body was rushing backwards and felt that her head was about to explode from anger.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Chae-Rin was originally a nice, kind individual, and if she was this mad at Sledge, you could tell that his attitude towards her was absolutely terrible.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Huuu…,” she exhaled loudly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Secretary.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Yes?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Do I not have the right to even meet my friends?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Of course not. But because milord is uncooperative in taking back Nidavellir, who knows whether you’ll bring in an outside force to fight and kill us?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It was as if he thought of her as not their Lord but an enemy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Do you know how to count to 1 but not to 2?” (It’s a Korean idiom to express idiocy) She tried to be as patient as possible and not pull out a knife and just stab him in the head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Sigh… Are you trying to educate me or something?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I’m not trying to educate you or anything. Excuse me, Secretary, without me, you can’t use or access the shop for the Lords. Will you be able to take back Nidavellir then?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“……..!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“If you don’t let him in, I won’t supply us with soldiers anymore.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This was the final, trump card that Lee Chae-Rin could play.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Although they were disrespectful to her, she was still a Lord and owned the rights to the territory with her Soul Core.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The golden necklace she was wearing right now was the Soul Core for the territory. Even the Secretary couldn’t take it away from her.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Hahaha, using underhanded methods now, are we?” Sledge laughed as if she was saying something ridiculous.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Milord, if you do that, I have another method.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Well, if you aren’t going to use that method right now, let the man in. Before I take the Soul Core and head back home.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Hur hur…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">She was able to win in this discussion. But… Sledge’s final words before departing made her heart clench.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Yes, yes. I will listen to our ‘great’ leader’s orders. After all, what can you even do with one person? Haha, we’ll let him in any time of the day.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“……..!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Just one person. This phrase made her heart clench. When he said that he had no thoughts of bringing reinforcements, he had truly come alone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Mr. Chul-In, what are you thinking?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After making the deal with her, she truly had no idea what he would do by himself. She just wanted to meet him as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Then… someone stepped into the hall.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I missed you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">There was a man with chains on his belt standing there, smiling at her. It wasn’t Kang Chul-In.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“……….!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As the man saw her eyes widening, he hurriedly sent her some inconspicuous signals. It was then that Chae-Rin realized that this was man, Podolski, was someone that Kang Chul-In had sent.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Ah, Chae-Rin, to think that we would meet somewhere that isn’t our hometown. How lovely. Since we didn’t meet in a long time, will you allow me a kiss?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“A kiss?!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Haha, I see you’re still embarrassed and shy as ever.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Podolski gave her a happy smile and walked towards her in long strides. Then… he kissed her on both of her cheeks.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This was the “Social Kiss”, one that many did in western countries on Earth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&lt;From Lord Kang Chul-In.&gt;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Podolski told Lee Chae-Rin without moving his lips, a truly hard skill to master.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&lt;He’s already inside your territory.&gt;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">She was very surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&lt;Don’t make it obvious. He sent me here in order to keep you safe.&gt;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After telling her Kang Chul-In’s words rapidly, he put both his arms on her shoulders and spoke while laughing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Hahaha. As always, you smell very nice. I can’t stop myself from wanting to kiss you. What should I do?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">And as he said that, he leaned in again to kiss her cheeks and spoke.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&lt;Tonight, he will come and meet you personally.&gt;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">With that, Lee Chae-Rin finally felt relief.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">———————————————————————————————————————</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">About 8 hours ago.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Hmm… Adventurers?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Near the Dorado territory were 30 adventurers doing a sort of customs check.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The man who spoke was 190cm tall and had a huge beard with a bald head. He looked imposingly at the surveyors with his massive, muscular body. This was none other than Billy, who had joined in the hunt for the Peacock Dragon as a member of “Team Slayers”.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“How did you get here?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The dwarven surveyor looked at them with an uncomfortable expression.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I saw the recruitment poster. It seems like the Lord here wants to recruit adventurers to fight for her in the battle?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Oh, so you’re mercenaries then?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I guess.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Then it’s two gold per day, and you’ll have to stay in an area that’s marked for you guys. Is that clear?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Why just that place? I also want to take a look at the Lord who hired us.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“That’s not going to work,” shouted the dwarf.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Our Lord has no plans on meeting with you guys. If you want to work here, then follow the rules. If not, then GET OUT!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After receiving the slightly harsh treatment from him, the adventurers felt a bit uncomfortable but didn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“There’s no reason to be so mad over that,” said Billy to the adventurer, scratching his bald head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Well, I guess not. The only thing that really matters to us is the money. Fine, we’ll stay in that area then.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Good.” That dwarf surveyor nodded, and after warning them a few more times, he let them in.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Oi, you guys. Come over here.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A dwarf warrior beckoned them over and led them to an isolated area. It was a very small place with limited space.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Leader.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The one sitting next to Billy whispered to Kang Chul-In.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“This is really weird. This is completely different from your area, leader. Those dwarven bastards are so unfriendly, and the way they look at us makes me uncomfortable. Doesn’t this mean that Miss Chae-Rin’s authority over here is very poor?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Billy’s insight was spot-on.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“You’re right.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“This won’t be easy then.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Then we’ll make it work.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Of course, what can’t we do with leader here?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The way that Billy looked at Kang Chul-In was full of trust and admiration. After the hunt for the Peacock Dragon last time, Billy had truly been entranced by how strong Kang Chul-In was.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Okay, you guys be quiet for now. Let me think.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Yes, sir.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Billy signaled the others to be quiet, and everyone fell silent.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Dorado itself was brilliant. But the situation couldn’t be worse. The tension in the air could be felt.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">And even though they were mercenaries, the way they were treated was almost unacceptable.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Although they took money for it, the role of a mercenary was to fight against the enemy. But the fact that the dwarves made sure that they couldn’t meet with the person that had hired them was ridiculous.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">They’re afraid that she would regain authority by allying with the adventurers against them. How utterly ridiculous.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In now felt that all this wasn’t really Chae-Rin’s fault but everyone’s collective responsibility.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">From the beginning, it was unlucky that there was a female ruler of the dwarves. And for a naive, nice person like Chae-Rin, it was obvious that she wouldn’t have fought back and intimidated the dwarves.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Of course, if it were him, he would have long since beaten up these disrespectful dwarves and shown them their place. But for someone like Chae-Rin, this was obviously impossible. He could now see why she asked for his help.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“If I had come here with the army of my territory, they would have disrespected her even more. Wow, it really was a good idea bringing this group of adventurers here instead,” he thought.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A leader that tried to bring in an outside force or power normally didn’t last very long. Their endings were very tragic.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Even just for her image, they needed to dodge the nuance of bringing another army here. The fact that he wanted to preserve the army of Laputa and her situation fell in line perfectly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Not only that, but the deal with her also stated that he was to help her get out of this situation and not create a leadership ruled by an outside force.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right now, the purging of the local forces is more important. We need authority.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As expected of an experienced veteran, Kang Chul-In could see what he needed to do first.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He needed to calm the unrest in their forces before they could even think about fighting other forces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">There was no way that the war would go well if there was an internal dispute.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In slowly waited for the night to come when he could finally converse with Chae-Rin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He could almost smell the stench of blood on the two short swords on his belt.</span></p>
