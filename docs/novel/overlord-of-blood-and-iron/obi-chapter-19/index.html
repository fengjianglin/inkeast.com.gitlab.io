 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

 <p>“Milord!”</p>
 <p>As Timothy was at a loss for words, Lucia, who had been quiet until then, stepped forward and called Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>“That Goblin, as the Secretary for the enemy Lord, has volunteered himself as a diplomat and visited this territory but, in actuality, has tried to undermine and fool you. I believe that he needs to receive adequate punishment for this.”</p>
 <p>Lucia’s opinion was fair.</p>
 <p>Timothy up until a couple of seconds ago was a diplomat, but now was currently a key player in the enemy’s movements. It would not have been excessive to behead him this instant.</p>
 <p>However, Kang Chul-In’s opinion was different.</p>
 <p>“There is reason to what you are saying.”</p>
 <p>“Then the guillotine…”</p>
 <p>Lucia spoke cruelly. She did not intend to forgive those who had been disrespectful to Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>“Not yet.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In shook his head.</p>
 <p>“Lucia, your opinion is right and proper, but there is no significance to killing the Goblin right now. It would not be too late to do it after the battle has ended.”</p>
 <p>“I, sir, do not understand what you are saying.”</p>
 <p>“Look at the Goblin.”</p>
 <p>At Lucia’s question, Kang Chul-In pointed with his chin towards Timothy, who had frozen on the spot. Timothy was unaware of the conversation happening between Kang Chul-In and Lucia and was just at a loss.</p>
 <p>“That Secretary was abandoned by his Lord.”</p>
 <p>Lucia’s eyes opened wide as she understood Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p><em>It’s true!</em></p>
 <p>Lucia’s mind formed a picture of Timothy’s situation.</p>
 <p><em>That Secretary did not know his Lord was invading our territory! If he knew, he would not have that kind of response! Ah… the Lord does not miss out on the details as always!</em></p>
 <p>What crazy bastard would wage war not even a full day after sending a diplomat with not even a declaration? Violent and uncivilized diplomacy aside, it was a cruel and heartless decision made without even the smallest consideration for the diplomat sent.</p>
 <p>“Yes, milord. The enemy Lord does not care whether his Secretary dies or not. He was abandoned.”</p>
 <p>As Lucia looked at Timothy, her eyes filled with sympathy.</p>
 <p>She, too, was an Secretary.</p>
 <p>She knew better than anyone what being abandoned by a Lord meant. Lucia had also been uncertain and afraid that she was of no use to Kang Chul-In and would be abandoned. Although she couldn’t know for sure, she felt that Timothy’s heart would be burned to nothing right now.</p>
 <p>“Yes. What is the use of taking the life of someone who has already lost it all?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, my Lord.”</p>
 <p>“But, he still must pay for undermining me.”</p>
 <p>“Huh? My Lord, what do you mean…?”</p>
 <p>“I will give him a pain worse than death.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In had a profound smile.</p>
 <p>“Timothy, you said?”</p>
 <p>“Yes… Lord…”</p>
 <p>Timothy’s voice had no strength as he answered. His ears were sagging as well, and he could not get any more pitiful.</p>
 <p>“Follow me.”</p>
 <p>“Won’t you need to see how the one who abandoned you gets ruined?”</p>
 <p>At that moment, Timothy saw in the face of this man called Kang Chul-In the image of the greatest evil and the image of a benevolent leader overlap.</p>
 <p>In Kang Chul-In’s previous statement, there were two meanings.</p>
 <p>“James.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In called his Commander James, not caring about Timothy’s thoughts.</p>
 <p>“Yes, my Lord.”</p>
 <p>“Go and show that arrogant ‘Jap’ his place.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, Lord!”</p>
 <p>James answered loudly and saluted Kang Chul-In. Then… he carefully asked a question as if he was bothered by something.</p>
 <p>“But… Lord.”</p>
 <p>“What does Jap mean…?”</p>
 <p>“…There is something like that where I’m from.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, sire!”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In did not answer. He was too lazy to give an explanation.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In took Lucia and Timothy to the watchtower.</p>
 <p>In Laputa, there was a 40km-high watchtower called the “Watcher’s Tower” that made it possible to look over the territory and the surrounding area from one vantage point.</p>
 <p>The reason for climbing the tower was simple.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In was not going to participate in this battle.</p>
 <p>It was not an urgent situation, nor was it a war big enough for him to go out into battle himself.</p>
 <p>All he had done was order a few things previously, and those orders would be the keys to determining the tide of battle. Kimura and Timothy had no idea, but Kang Chul-In had used two scout hawks of his own as well as additional scouts to gain intel on the Burrows’ current status.</p>
 <p>Therefore, Laputa’s soldiers had already completed all preparations for war before Timothy arrived and were just waiting for the soldiers of the Burrow lands to invade.</p>
 <p>It was like a spider waiting for its prey after spinning its web.</p>
 <p>“Timothy.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In looked at the soldiers of the Burrow lands that were approaching from afar and called to Timothy.</p>
 <p>“Yes… Lord…”</p>
 <p>Timothy was still sullen. The thought of being abandoned was too much for the old goblin.</p>
 <p>“What do you expect the outcome would be?”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In asked.</p>
 <p>“…if you compare just the armies, it is expected that the Burrow lands will achieve a grand victory.”</p>
 <p>“Really?”</p>
 <p>“The military power of the Burrows is strong. There are 300 ants, 4 Giant Centipedes, and the Shogun has a Flame Toad as well.”</p>
 <p>“Those are some powerful troops.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In nodded.</p>
 <p>It was the truth.</p>
 <p>Military power meant economic power.</p>
 <p>Because Laputa was so expensive, Kang Chul-In did not have extra money to spend in the store. It was a bit embarrassing, but the current financial status of Laputa was destitute and sparse. Kimura’s military was clearly better.</p>
 <p>However, Kang Chul-In did not bat an eye after hearing Timothy. He smiled a leisurely smile.</p>
 <p>“So, you think your Lord can conquer this territory?”</p>
 <p>“That…”</p>
 <p>Timothy could not give an answer quickly.</p>
 <p>‘We definitely have a better military. We have the upper hand… but why do I feel so uneasy?”</p>
 <p>The incompetence of the Lord Kimura was a factor, but Kang Chul-In’s confident demeanor got to him. How could he be so relaxed when he was extremely disadvantaged? Timothy could not guess the outcome of this battle.</p>
 <p>“I’ll give you the answer.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In spoke.</p>
 <p>“We will win.”</p>
 <p>It was a straightforward, confident statement without an ounce of doubt.</p>
 <p>“Today, your land will fall.”</p>
 <p>“No!”</p>
 <p>Before anyone could blink, Timothy shouted and disagreed.</p>
 <p><em>So, he is still an Secretary, I see.</em></p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In looked at Timothy and was a bit in awe of the old Goblin’s loyalty.</p>
 <p>Timothy, as seen through Kang Chul-In’s eyes, looked as if he hadn’t lost his loyalty towards his Lord even though he’d been abandoned.</p>
 <p>“Alth-although the Shogun is inexperienced, he will not lose!”</p>
 <p>“Hm… really?”</p>
 <p>“Of course! Although your Grace seems extraordinary, you will not be able to easily overcome the difference in the milit…”</p>
 <p>“Well, if you wait, you’ll see.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In cut Timothy off and spoke to Lucia.</p>
 <p>“The megaphone.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, milord.”</p>
 <p>Lucia politely handed Kang Chul-In a megaphone ensorcelled with a sound amplifier.</p>
 <p>“Requesting surrender is the virtue of the strong.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In looked below and spoke. There Kimura and the soldiers of the Burrows were, having almost reached Laputa.</p>
 <p><em>Beep–!!</em></p>
 <p>-Hello, hello, Can you hear me?</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In did a mic test of sorts.</p>
 <p>“Are you the Lord of this territory?”</p>
 <p>Kimura yelled to answer Kang Chul-In. Kimura, who hadn’t brought a megaphone, had no choice but to yell as loudly as he could.</p>
 <p>“Surrende…”</p>
 <p>-Surrender, Jap.</p>
 <p>-Then I will spare you your life.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In beat him to the punch.</p>
 <p>“J…Jap?”</p>
 <p>Kimura’s eyes burned up with rage.</p>
 <p>“Y-you… Joseon<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title>[1]</a> bug!”</p>
 <p>As Koreans knew of the insult “Jap”, the Japanese also knew their insults.</p>
 <p>“How dare you call me Ja…?”</p>
 <p>-I call a Jap a Jap. What else would I call you? Stop talking nonsense and surrender.</p>
 <p>“Y-you…!”</p>
 <p>Kimura shook with rage.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In’s voice was so detestable that it felt as if his rage would bubble and fill his bone marrow.</p>
 <p>-If you don’t surrender nicely…</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In, with a smirking voice, sent Kimura the final punch.</p>
 <p>-I will let you feel what it feels like to be hit with an atomic bomb. Wait, that is your Japs’ specialty. You are the only people in the world who got hit with one. Two at that… you people can really take it though. Bunch of undying cockroaches.”</p>
 <p>Kimura could not muster a comeback.</p>
 <p>Although Kang Chul-In was pushing on all his buttons and enraging him, it was a fact that no one could deny.</p>
 <p>Japan was the first to ever be hit with an atomic bomb in the world, and it was also the last to be hit with an atomic bomb.</p>
 <p>“Little Boy”, the atomic bomb made from uranium and “Fat Man”, the bomb made from plutonium, were one of the biggest humiliations for the Japanese people.</p>
 <p>“I will… kill you!”</p>
 <p>Kimura, who was angered to the point of bursting, roared.</p>
 <p>-Well, try it then.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In sneered.</p>
 <p>-Don’t know if you are capable of doing so, though.</p>
 <p>At that moment, Kimura felt something snap in his head. He had snapped.</p>
 <p>“Attack!”</p>
 <p>Kimura roared the command.</p>
 <p>“Now! Go bring him to me! Attack, I said!”</p>
 <p>And that was the start.</p>
 <p>The soldiers of the Burrows, under the leadership of Kimura, all began to charge towards Laputa’s castle walls. The siege had started.</p>
 <p>“Ah, Shogun!”</p>
 <p>Timothy shut his eyes tightly at the dismal situation.</p>
 <p>Even if he had lost in the verbal battle, the Lord had fallen easily for Kang Chul-In’s taunts. For Timothy, who was in the middle of enemy territory, he was so embarrassed that he wanted to hide in a hole.</p>
 <p>“Are you still loyal to a stupid idiot like him?”</p>
 <p>Seeing this, Kang Chul-In threw Timothy a question.</p>
 <p>“Lord, please be watchful of your language. This Timothy, although he has been abandoned by the Shogun, still has his loyalty.”</p>
 <p>“Really?”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In asked as if he was intrigued.</p>
 <p>“Then…”</p>
 <p>He smiled. It was the devil’s smile.</p>
 <p>“Enjoy watching.”</p>
 <p>It was then that the soldiers of the Burrows began to climb the castle walls.</p>
