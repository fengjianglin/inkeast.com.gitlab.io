 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>
 <p><strong><u>CHINESE NOVELS (NEWLY RELEASED)</u></strong></p>

 <p> <a href="/announcement/six-new-novels-review-system-activated">Read More...</a> </p>

<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p>There was once a male celebrity, that grew to extreme fame in the late 2000s, and later plummeted in terms of support and fame.</p>
 <p>… This was because it was later revealed that he was actually bald.</p>
 <p>A smile that could melt any woman’s heart, snow white teeth, as well as high, angular cheekbones. Not even the face that seemed as if crafted by the gods could stop his fall.</p>
 <p>Although it could be different with another actor, actor Kim Deuk-Chul was the most popular male actor in the 20s, and this lead to a huge backfiring in his image, due to him ‘betraying’ all of his female fans when they found out he wore a wig.</p>
 <p>“Hello, everyone. How have you been?”</p>
 <p>Kim Deuk-Chul, who had taken off his wig, didn’t look amazing. It was even more so due to the fact that he hadn’t even completely shaved his hair, due to the fact that he felt that all of his ‘remaining’ hair was a waste.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“The reason I… am here is… well, it is to apologize for everyone that had fallen for my stupid trick back when I was an actor, and was to embarassed to embrace the fact that I was, and am, bald. Also, I would first like to thank the Galaxy Corporation for giving such an opportunity, and would like to thank everyone related to this product. And I also thank everyone who is watching this right now.”</p>
 <p>And Kim Deuk-Chul bowed his head to the camera, bowing down 90 degrees.</p>
 <p>“Well, first…”</p>
 <p>An MC, that was very famous around Korea spoke to Kim Deuk-Chul.</p>
 <p>“How have you been? It’s been almost 10 years since you’ve last shown yourself in front of a camera.”</p>
 <p>A lot of discussion passed.</p>
 <p>As expected of an experienced MC, he and Kim Deuk-Chul kept the viewers watching by the actor speaking about what he had been doing, and all of the worries that he had.</p>
 <p>“Well, hasn’t humanity been plagued by the disease called hair loss from ancient times? Mr. Deuk-Chul, I think you shouldn’t be so embarrassed about it.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, that’s right. Since ancient times, humanity has been plagued by hair loss, and even now, where modern medicine is extremely, extremely highly developed, there is still no complete way of conquering hair loss. However!”</p>
 <p>Saying ‘however!’, the MC made all of the viewers focus.</p>
 <p>“As the Galaxy Corporation has stated, what if. What if there truly was a way to conquer hair loss?’</p>
 <p>The camera suddenly rotated, focusing on Kim Deuk-Chul’s scalp. This live broadcast was in HD, allowing the viewers to see clearly what was going on.</p>
 <p>“Right now, the Galaxy Corporation would like to ask you. What would YOU do if over 5cm of hair grows over the next 30 minutes?”</p>
 <p>And as the MC spoke until there, all of the famous portals and search engines in Korea had the Galaxy Corporation in 1st place for the ‘Hot Searches’ list, followed by ‘Hair Loss Medicine’, ‘Hair Loss’, ‘Kim Deuk-Chul’ etc.</p>
 <p>“Everybody.”</p>
 <p>“Right now, we will use the Galaxy Corporation’s newest product, the Hair Brother, otherwise known as the ‘Hair Bro’, and test it on Mr. Deuk-Chul over here. I am also very curious to see what will happen.”</p>
 <p>And as the MC said that, the full HD cameras got closer to Kim Deuk-Chul’s head, and a staff of the Galaxy Corporation sent here started rubbing ‘black cream’ on the top of Kim Deuk-Chul’s head.</p>
 <p>Gulp!</p>
 <p>The sound of the people on site swallowing anxiously was heard, and was sent on the live broadcast.</p>
 <p>“According to the Galaxy Corporation, the time it takes for new hair to grow after putting on the ‘Hair Bro’ is about…”</p>
 <p>At that moment.</p>
 <p>“E-Everyone!”</p>
 <p>On Kim Deuk-Chul’s head, new, black hair started growing.</p>
 <p>“Viewers, everyone, do you see this? New hair is growing on Mr. Deuk-Chul’s head!”</p>
 <p>Allowing with the enthusiastic and passionate MC…</p>
 <p>“Sob...sob…”</p>
 <p>Kim Deuk-Chul sobbed, and cried to his heart’s content. The stress that he had gotten from the fact that he was bald was recalled by him, causing his emotions to stir up.</p>
 <p>“Thank you… Thank you so much, Galaxy Corporation…”</p>
 <p>And as Kim Deuk-Chul said that, new captions on the bottom of the Live Broadcast could be seen.</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>We are looking for investors that are interested in investing in our new product, the ‘Hair Bro’!</li>
 </ul>
 <p>The Galaxy Corporation presents the new method for conquering hair loss, the ‘Hair Bro’!</p>
 <p>Hair Transplant Surgery can go away! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Hair Loss Inhibitors worry can also go away! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>No more methods that do not completely cure hair loss, just use one bottle of Hair Bros, and you’re set!</p>
 <p>We take care of your appearance! &lt;Hair Bros.&gt;</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>We are currently working on mass producing this product. We would like to look for investors.</li>
  <li>Selling in small amounts currently! (100 bottles per month)</li>
  <li>You can see the exact effects of the product on our homepage.</li>
  <li>Produced by: The Galaxy Corporation.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Along with Kwak-jung, who had successfully hyped up the production of the two products of the ‘brother’ series, Kang Chul-In returned to the Laputa territory.</p>
 <p>He could not wait to start conquering anymore. He had to unify the eastern plains as soon as the harvest was finished.</p>
 <p>“Mr. Chul-In!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Surprisingly, the person who greeted Kang Chul-In first in his territory was Lee Chae-Rin. It seemed that she had brought the gold, as well as the Recall stones with her.</p>
 <p>“What about your territory?”</p>
 <p>“Well, after my secretary died, I got a new one, namely being the secretary of that crazy woman before (the berserker). Her name is Eva.”</p>
 <p>“Well, how is your mother?”</p>
 <p>“She moved to Seocho.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, does she still own a fruit store there?”</p>
 <p>“A small cafe. And I also set up a flower shop next to it there as well.”</p>
 <p>“You’re such a good son, Mr. Chul-In.”</p>
 <p>“You could do the same, can’t you?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t have any parents.” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“....?” &nbsp;“They both died, back when I was in my third year of University.”</p>
 <p>“Well, it’s okay. If I’m feeling lonely I can come to visit your territory like this, and also meet your mother!”</p>
 <p>And as Kang Chul-In was about to open his mouth because the subject was becoming dangerous…</p>
 <p>“Father~”</p>
 <p>Arshelly, who was walking with the godbeast Altaica by her side, came and hugged Kang Chul-In cutely.</p>
 <p>‘Oh dear.’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In was startled, as he was suddenly hugged by Arshelly.</p>
 <p>“F-Father?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Due to Arshelly’s sudden appearance, Lee Chae-rin’s face turned pale.</p>
 <p>‘No way… is Mr. Chul-In actually married?’</p>
 <p>Lee Chae-Rin continued to stare at Arshelly.</p>
 <p>She hoped that she wasn’t actually his daughter, and that she had mistaken him for somebody else.</p>
 <p>But…</p>
 <p>‘They look… similar.’</p>
 <p>The problem was that no matter how you looked at it, Kang Chul-In and Arshelly looked similar.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“I… I’ll go check on something else!”</p>
 <p>Saying this, Lee Chae-Rin, who looked shocked, scurried away.</p>
 <p>‘She seems to think that I’m married.’</p>
 <p>‘Mr. Chul-In…’</p>
 <p>As if she was running away, Lee Chae-Rin hurried away from the Lord’s hall. She needed some private space to sort out her thoughts.</p>
 <p>“To think that you even had a daughter… Ack!”</p>
 <p>Suddenly screaming, Lee Chae-Rin fell to the floor on her butt.</p>
 <p>“Oww… What did I even bump into…”</p>
 <p>“Sorry, are you okay?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>And someone held their hand out to the fallen Lee Chae-Rin.</p>
 <p>“I-I’m okay…”</p>
 <p>“No, no. You nearly got injured because of me. But… I haven’t seen you around here before?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Oh… yes, I’m actually the Lord of the Dorado Territory.”</p>
 <p>“...What?”</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the woman, Lucia’s voice turned frosty.</p>
 <p>“Oh, so you’re that woman with a lot of money?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Do you know me?”</p>
 <p>“Of course, who wouldn’t? Anyway, I’m Lucia, the secretary of the territory.”</p>
 <p>And in the air was an invisible pressure, formed by the two women staring each other down.</p>
 <p>Economic Power Vs Military Power.</p>
 <p>This was the first meeting of the two women that would have the greatest rivalry throughout the whole of Pangaea.</p>
 <p>As Kang Chul-In had enough economic power and stability, he decided to increase the population.</p>
 <ul type="disc">
  <li>Sky Fortress Laputa</li>
  <li>Lord: Kang Chul-In</li>
  <li>Level: 9 (Can grow until level 30)</li>
  <li>State: Idle</li>
  <li>Price: Costs for 1712 gold per every 30 days (changes depend of State)</li>
  <li>Security: Very good / Finances: Average: / Food: Severely lacking (Before harvest)</li>
  <li>Loyalty: 99/100</li>
  <li>Happiness: 80/80</li>
  <li>Durability: 1000/1000</li>
  <li>Military: 300/300&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Facilities: 27 (not including bedding)</li>
  <li>Population: 1286 humans / 47 Dwarves / 93 Ants</li>
  <li>Population Limit (human): 1500 (varies with level of the territory and Lord)</li>
  <li>Population outside the city: 15 (adventurers)</li>
 </ul>
 <p>‘1500, huh…’</p>
 <p>Although it was easy to increase the populace, Kang Chul-In didn’t do so immediately.</p>
 <p>It only costs about 5 gold to summon a person. And even to summon the max limit of people, it would only cost 7500 gold.</p>
 <p>But the difficulty lies in the fact that you had to pay them constantly, every month. Bedding, food, salary, etc. It was difficult to handle if the increase in population backfired against them. It would cause their economy, which had just turned for the better to struggle again.</p>
 <p>“I will just discuss with Timothy.”</p>
 <p>And while Kang Chul-In was looking for Timothy, Kwak-Jung appeared.</p>
 <p>“Milord.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, you’ve come?”</p>
 <p>“I have something to speak to you about.” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What is it?”</p>
 <p>“I have something to speak to you about…”</p>
 <p>“Well, go on then.” &nbsp;“Hmm… I’ve been thinking for the past few days, and…”</p>
 <p>“As a result?”</p>
 <p>“I-I believe that…”</p>
 <p>“Do not hesitate, and speak. I will make the final decision after listening to your decision. I will not ignore or shame you even if I disagree with you.”</p>
 <p>“W-Well…”</p>
 <p>And after hesitating for a little bit, Kwak Jung’s eyes gleamed.</p>
 <p>“Milord.”</p>
 <p>“We need to start war right now.”</p>
 <p>And it was faster than even Kang Chul-In was anticipating.</p>
