 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

</div>
<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Everyone had at least one memory that they didn’t want to recall.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Even the mighty Overlord of Blood and Iron, Kang Chul-In, was the same.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If he thought of it, Kang Chul-In’s one was when his head was chopped off by his eternal rival, the damned Rothschild, but it wasn’t something that he couldn’t tell anyone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He would maybe tell Lucia or maybe his future wife.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But the bad memories he had about this “Random Unit” was one that he truly didn’t want to tell anyone. That was the first as well as the last time that he had gotten teased by someone.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This event occurred 7 years before he had gone back in time, 3 months before Ragnarok had started. This was when he and Dorian had gone into a dungeon as a duo.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Look at ‘im, him.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Dorian pointed at a dog that was inside the dungeon. This was a dog that Dorian had brought with him this time, saying that he was the “ace” of this dungeon exploration.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“What do you plan on doing with that small, puny dog?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In didn’t like small dogs like poodles, Yorkshire terriers, and Shih Tzus. It was because he didn’t like the fact that they kept on barking as if they were ignorant of how big and scary the world was compared to them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Hmph, you would be surprised if you knew the true value and abilities of this guy.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Dorian who had always been on the receiving end of the teasing said proudly. His expression almost bordered on being annoying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“No matter how he looks, he is still an S rank unit after all.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Do you really expect me to trust you on that?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Sigh~ to think that even the great ‘Lord hunter’ Kang Chul-In can’t see the true worth of our Lucky. Hey! Lucky!” Dorian called his dog.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Ruff, Ruff!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The dog named Lucky came towards Dorian and greeted him with bright and cheerful barks.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Lucky then performed a flip and then suddenly dashed towards a deep part of the Dungeon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Do you call a well-trained dog an S rank unit now, Dorian?” Kang Chul-In laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“What are you going to do with that dog that doesn’t radiate the slightest bit of mana?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“As expected of a battle maniac. Not all units are used for fighting, you know? Think about utility! The utility!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“If that dog has good utility, then are you telling all the units famous for their utility to kill themselves out of shame?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Hmph. Seems like you don’t believe me. Then look for yourself. You will see how amazing our Lucky is soon.” Dorian was confident in Lucky, and Lucky truly did not let him down.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“What the…?” Kang Chul-In was very surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“You see, our Lucky is amazing!” Dorian happily chimed in.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“How does this… make sense?” Kang Chul-In was truly startled right now.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After all, the results that Lucky brought were truly amazing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Lucky found a secret pathway inside the obscure dungeon ruins and single-handedly found and activated a hidden lever that led to a chamber.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">And inside was…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A huge amount of gold and other jewels as well as a terrifying amount of unique-rank items.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Hahaha, now do you see how amazing our Lucky truly is? He’s a seeker.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Seeker?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Treasure seeker, hunting for treasures. He reacts and senses items or gold that is at least of the unique rank. With this guy, I wouldn’t be lying if I said I would be able to take the items of all the dungeons and ruins in the Pangaea continent.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“... That’s why it’s an S rank unit?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Of course! It’s kind of like the victory of utility?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“But where the hell did you find a dog like this?” Kang Chul-In was very curious to see where the dog was from. He had no idea where Dorian found something like this.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Oh, that. I’ll tell you. It’s not something that amazing anyway.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“You’ll tell me?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Of course! I picked Lucky by purchasing a ‘Random Unit’. I used around 1500 gold to kill time on that.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“...I didn’t know that good units could even come out in that.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Well, that depends on the individual’s luck. I’m ‘Lucky’, a lucky guy after all. Haha.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“That sounds like a lie to me.” Kang Chul-In didn’t believe Dorian’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He too had spent 2000 gold on random units, but the result was him obtaining the lowest-rank units like Goblins, Gnolls, and Skeletons.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Of course, it was not just him. Other Lords had also talked trash about buying this option as they had only lost money.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In fact, there were some Lords who tried to spend all their money buying this and went broke.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To think that there was actually possible to get an S rank unit like Lucky from the Random Unit purchase, who would believe it?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Hahaha. For someone as kind and nice as me, there is luck. Of course, that’s different from a villain like you, Kang Chul-In.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This taunt led to the start of the nightmarish memory.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“You’re saying that I’m not lucky because I’m a villain?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Because it was so ridiculous that Dorian had gotten Lucky, Kang Chul-In fell for Dorian’s taunt.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Like they say, Santa Claus doesn’t give presents to the naughty. Unless you’re a kind person like me, there’s no way to obtain an S rank unit!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Sigh, I think you’re ridiculous to spend money on that sort of gambling. Why don’t you just go and gamble in Las Vegas instead?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Oh, that place. I got on the blacklist of the casinos there because my luck was too good. I can’t enter.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Do you really expect me to believe that?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“What, have you been lied to all your life? The next time I go to Earth, I’ll prove it to you!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After arguing and bickering for a long time, they decided to have a bet to see who would get the better unit using the ‘Random Unit’ option.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The two of them went back to their territories and connected to each other using the “Node Network”, a network that allowed the two of them to communicate, and started a video call. Then, they began to buy Random Units. The result… Kang Chul-In was absolutely destroyed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“HAHAHA! Even though you show off all the time, you have absolutely terrible luck.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Although Dorian had spent 2500 gold, he obtained an A rank unit called the “Illusionist”...</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“It seems like a goblin field over there, eh?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Even after Kang Chul-In spent 8500 gold (he later had to watch the scene of Albert bleeding blood and tears from his eyes), he got Goblin Scout, Goblin Assassin, Goblin Archer… It was as if he were collecting the “Goblin Series”.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It almost seemed like Dorian was right when he said that villains couldn’t pick good things from the random unit selection, and the kind ones had good luck with it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“See, good units come out too! Oh, since I won this bet, the next time we party, you’re going to have to pay for it, okay? Well, see ya then. Have fun with those goblins you earned, you unlucky bastard. HAHAHA!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">That stupid bet ended up with Kang Chul-In’s loss. Although he didn’t want to admit it, he had truly lost.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">That was the only battle in which Dorian had beaten Kang Chul-In, and it was still a sore spot for Kang Chul-In. Not only that, but it was also the day that Dorian had teased Kang Chul-In to no end.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Dorian, you motherf*cker.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In thought of Dorian, who would be receiving verbal abuse from his Secretary soon for not coming back for so long. Thinking of that, he involuntarily smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Mr. Chul-In?” Lee Chae-Rin called him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“What is it? Were you thinking of some bad memories?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;“No, it’s nothing.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Although he tried to deny it, it was the truth when she said that he remembered some bad memories.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Anyway, just leave that button alone. There are some Lords I know who went bankrupt after using that button too much. Just think of it like a menu or option that doesn’t exist.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What he said was true. The only one he knew that had truly benefited from using that option was Dorian.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He didn’t realize this until later, but Dorian’s luck was ridiculously good.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After asking and researching for a bit, he found out that out of the 200 Lords, there was no one who had benefited from using that menu.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Don’t try to lean on your luck. There’s no kind of system or gamble that’s as rigged as that stupid thing. Doing it once costs 500 gold, equivalent to 2 hundred million KRW (which is around $200,000). Of course, it’s your choice if you want to hire a goblin that’s worth 2 hundred million KRW.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In thought that the stupidest thing he had done between his present and past lives was gambling like that. Everyone had a secret that they wanted to hide, and for Kang Chul-In, it was this.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Whatever, I’ll just do it for fun then.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Surprisingly, Kang Chul-In heard Lee Chae-Rin’s nonchalant voice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Is one time okay?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Is this stress?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He thought that it might be from watching the bloody scenes of dwarves dying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Well, I guess once is okay.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In didn’t stop Lee Chae-Rin from doing so as he wanted her to experience first-hand why you shouldn’t do it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If things went overboard, he would stop her. Yes, once would be okay, right?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Pzzt, Pzzt!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After Lee Chae-Rin clicked the button that shouldn’t be pressed, a magic circle descended. And inside was…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Kik?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">…The most primitive type of wild goblin. It was the worst unit of all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“It’s a goblin?” Lee Chae-Rin laughed as if she didn’t care. It definitely was stress, laughing after losing that much money.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Hmm… should I try some more? Maybe a unit worthy of being my new Secretary might come out.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Lee Chae-Rin, full of her false fantasies, tried 3 more times to pick a random unit.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But the result was as Kang Chul-In expected. The sight of a Goblin Assassin, Orc, and a Goblin Laborer greeted Lee Chae-Rin.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“This… I shouldn’t do this again. What a waste. Why did they even make this? Thinking about it, I don’t even know why I decided to do it. Even when Mr. Chul-In warned me.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Lee Chae-Rin’s face looked pained now. It seemed like her stress had been relieved.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“That was fast. Maybe it’s because her special ability is related to money.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If it was another Lord, it was highly probable that they would have spent at least 5000 gold before stopping.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Yep… I’m definitely not doing this again.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“As long as you understand.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“But that’s me… Mr. Chul-In, want to give it a go?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Now is not the time to be gambling like this,” Kang Chul-In’s cold voice replied.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Yes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Since they had already gotten their hands on an elite force, they should be getting ready for executing Sledge, not relaxing like this.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">At this moment, the adventurers and Urad were also working.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“But it doesn’t even take that long.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I have no plan to use my precious resources and money in that sort of rigged gambling.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Well then, I’ll just pick it for you then. I want to test it out.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Test what?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Mr. Chul-In’s luck.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">And before he could even reply to her, she gifted him a “random unit”.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Pzzt, Pzzt!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Another magic circle descended, and you could see that inside it was a small silhouette, though it disappeared soon after.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Another goblin, I don’t even want to look at it.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Looking at the small silhouette, Kang Chul-In obviously thought it was another goblin and looked away, his interest dimmed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Since he knew that it was a type of goblin, he didn’t have any hope or curiosity towards it. To him, the “random unit” menu was a sort of sore spot that he would never be able to forget. At least… until today.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“M-m-mr. Chul-In?” Lee Chae-Rin called Kang Chul-In with a trembling voice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“What, is it a goblin sorcerer?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In asked with a calm voice. Goblin sorcerers were the most expensive and usable out of the goblins. Although, it was worth 3 gold compared to the 500 spent.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“N-no… It’s not a goblin....”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Then, is it a gnoll?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“No! It’s a boy. A boy came out!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“......?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thinking that something was odd, Kang Chul-In finally turned his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left">&nbsp;</p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">[Congratulations! You have successfully obtained the SS Rank named unit, Ark Mage Nilus!]</span></p>
