 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In silently swung the metal bat.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He did not swing it with everything he had. If he did, Kimura’s hipbones would break after two or three hits, and he would die after ten blows. He controlled his strength as well as he could and hit as much as Kimura would be able to endure. However, even that was too much for Kimura.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Ugh, Mmmm!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Every time the metal club swung, Kimura screamed, but the gag in his mouth muffled the sound.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Crack, crack!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In hit like a machine. He looked so emotionless that, for those who were watching, the hairs on their backs rose.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">And this lasted for about 30 minutes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When Kimura had received about 50 blows, Kang Chul-In spoke.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Untie him.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Yes, Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">One of the soldiers quickly did as he ordered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Please spare, spare me!!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kimura, who had been untied from Podolski’s rope-tie and gag, begged and pleaded until his hands became his feet. He was crying and making a big commotion. Kimura looked like a young boy who just had gotten in serious trouble with his father.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I-I will never do that again!! Please, please spare me my life! Don’t kill me!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kimura, who was begging on his knees, had lost any last sense of dignity he had as a Lord. He was so servile and desolate that even those looking clicked their tongues.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“What have you done wrong?” Kang Chul-In asked.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I am sorry for causing the war. I am sorry. I’m sorry for cursing.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Wrong.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Put the gag back on him.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The gag went back on Kimura’s mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Mmmm…Mmmm!!!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The metal club swung again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Speak. What did you do wrong?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In, who had delivered the second blow, asked Kimura again.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I-I’m sorry… I was in the wrong.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“So, what did you do wrong?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I don’t know, but I’m sorry for everything! Please just spare my life…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Put it back on.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In seemed dissatisfied, as if the answer was again not what he was looking for.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Crack!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After the blows landed again for the third time and Kimura was almost unconscious, the iron club finally stopped.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Urgh.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Do you still not know what you did wrong?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Please, if you could tell… if you tell me.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kimura seemed like he did not even have the strength to beg anymore. Indeed, although Kang Chul-In controlled his strength, he had been hit almost a hundred times.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Lord, why don’t you just take his head instead?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">James came forward, unable to watch further. Kimura was in so much pain that James asked for a clean death.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“No, I am not going to kill him.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Feed him the potion.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When the order was given, Kang Chul-In’s subordinates shook in terror. It sounded like he was going to heal Kimura, then hit him some more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“The person who you should be begging is not me but over there.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In went against everyone’s predictions and put down his iron club.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Since you ask to be taught, I will teach you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In’s finger pointed outside.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“The one you should apologize to is not me but your soldiers. Those who died for nothing because of the orders you gave with your incompetence.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“You have the authority to give orders, no matter how incompetent of a Lord you are, but have you ever thought of the weight of those orders? Have you ever thought of the things that were going to happen because of your orders?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">At Kang Chul-In’s criticism, Kimura could not say anything. It was even more so because they were all true.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Of course, you are extremely young and probably were not able to completely figure out the Grand Summoning that suddenly happened. This situation may have felt like it was a dream or a game. It’s not that I cannot understand. But.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kimura flinched at his loud voice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“No matter how ignorant and incompetent you were, what you did is not easily forgivable. Giant centipedes, sure, but ants are a kind that has emotion and intelligence. And over two hundred of those ants are dead. Because of your orders.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Lord’s Hall fell silent at Kang Chul-In’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“If you are in a high position, you need to be able to carry responsibility. How could you not, for the lives of your soldiers depend on your decisions?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It was not for Kang Chul-In to say since he was the prime example of a conquest Lord, but it was also something that only Kang Chul-In could say. How many had their lives or deaths depend on his orders? Kang Chul-In was once a man who controlled thousands of lives. There were probably few who knew better than himself, knew the weight of a Lord and the weight of war.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“If even one of my soldiers died, I would have killed you without hesitation. But I guess you are quite lucky, seeing that not one of my soldiers died in this battle. But even if I forgive you, who will listen to the cries of your soldiers who died today? How about the emotional state of your loyal Timothy who you abandoned?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Ah, ah!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It seemed like Kimura finally understood Kang Chul-In.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Beg for forgiveness, to those who died because of your foolishness.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I am sorry! I’m so sorry!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kimura kneeled towards the front and bowed his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I am sorry… I’m so sorry…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The apology lasted for a long while.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I changed a lot too.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In silently looked at Kimura and realized that he too, had changed. If it was him before, he would have cut the throats of every man and woman among the enemy Lord’s populace. Although it was not often, there were a couple of times when he had.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However, after his return, he himself could feel that he was different from before. Maybe it was because of that day’s defeat that he had changed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Well, let’s just call it circumstance.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Underage, foolishness, lack of realization that it is reality, etc. It was okay to show mercy once considering it was shortly after the Grand Summoning.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Of course, as previously mentioned, it was also because there were no casualties on his side. As time passed and Kimura apologized again and again to the point where he almost lost consciousness, Kang Chul-In spoke.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“That is enough apologizing in front of me. I don’t know if the apology that you showed right now is sincere or a sly trick to save yourself from this situation. I don’t have a way of knowing nor do I care. But if you truly feel sorry, then you must never forget what you did today. That is dependent on your humanistic qualities, and I will not intervene.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In paused briefly and then continued.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“My lecturing stops here. Like I said, I will spare you, so return home as soon as your throat gets better. Ah, before that, we must finish what we were doing. Lucia!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Lucia had come into the Lord Hall earlier and was watching the event unfold. She answered when she heard her name called.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Yes, Lord. What do you need?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Bring the Soul Core.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Yes, my Lord!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Lucia disappeared somewhere and then reappeared with a fancy sword that she held with two hands.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The “Soul Core”.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It was a sword that had no use as an actual weapon and was purely for ceremonial purposes, but it was a key item that symbolized the Lord and controlled the territory. Therefore, the Soul Core was something that only the Lord and his Secretary could touch. Kang Chul-In was able to control Laputa’s facilities and the magic engineered satellite in space only with the Soul Core. The Soul Core for a Lord was like a royal decree: a God-Given gift.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“You do not have the right to be a Lord. Also, the responsibility of defeat falls solely on the Lord. Therefore, I will take away your position here as Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“How…?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kimura answered with a quivering voice.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“The thing you are wearing on your waist… That is the Soul Core. You need to make a vow to me holding it.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kimura took out the Burrows’ Soul Core at Kang Chul-In’s orders.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Get on your knees and touch your sword to mine. Repeat after me. I…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Pledge my troops and my territory-“</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Pledge my troops and my territory-“</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“To the one who was victorious over me,”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“To the one who was victorious over me,”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Laputa’s Lord, Kang Chul-In.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Laputa’s Lord, Kang Chul-In.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Leaving nothing,”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Leaving nothing,”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As the vow continued, the Soul Cores of Laputa and the Burrows began to radiate energy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“And give up my status as Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“And give up my status as Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As soon as Kimura finished reciting the vow, the Burrow land’s Soul Core burned bright red and…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Crack!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Broke into a million pieces.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the remains of the broken Soul Core of the Burrow lands, magic energy flowed into Kang Chul-In’s Soul Core.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Messages then popped up in front of Kang Chul-In.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">[You have gained control of the Burrows territory.] [You have gained 5 levels with the conquest of an enemy Lord.] [You have gained 50 Lord Points with the conquest of an enemy Lord.] [Level 14 Reached!] [Tutorial 1 Quest Complete!] [Reward in Quest Completion: Experience +500/ 20 Gold/ Warp Gate unlocked (unlimited)]</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Because it was summary information, it wasn’t too detailed. However, it was definite that the ownership of the Burrows fell to Kang Chul-In. The ants that survived, as well as the gold that Kimura had, had also transferred to Kang Chul-In. Aside from the Secretary Timothy, of course.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Also, because he cleared the Tutorial 1 Quest, the reward that followed was also given. Even if it was a boring win, the reward was clear.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Is, is it over now?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kimura spoke weakly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Yes, it is over.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I-I am sorry… I am sorry to everyone. I apologize…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kimura fainted, falling to the ground. He could not finish.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Take him and tend to him.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As soon as Kang Chul-In ordered, two soldiers took Kimura and took him away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">‘Now, will I have some time to return to Earth?’</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Compared to the three or four days he had predicted in the beginning, he had instead spent two weeks in Pangaea, an extremely long postponement.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However, he could not go right away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He needed to take care of the ants that survived, the fire toad that he took from Kimura, rewards for his troops, as well as deciding what to do with the Burrow lands. In order for him to return to Earth, he needed at least two or three more days.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Also, is it time for me to pay the interest?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In remembered the borrowed money and showed a bitter smile. He probably had to tell Lucia to draw from the privy purse. However, there probably would be quite a bit of gold won from Kimura, so there would be plenty left after the debt was paid. If there was any left, he might be able to give his mother some funds and find her a good apartment to rent.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It was true.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Lord Kang Chul-In could also not escape worrying about debt and apartment rent. Of course, if more time passed, he could claw in heaps of money ranging in the millions instead of the thousands, but that would take at least a year.</span></p>
