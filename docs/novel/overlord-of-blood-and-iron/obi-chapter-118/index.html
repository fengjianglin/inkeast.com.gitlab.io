 <p>As Kang Chul-In arrived at the central plaza, he could see a lot of people crowded there.</p>
 <p>Why are they all here at this time of day?</p>
 <p>He didn’t understand.</p>
 <p>It was 8 p.m at night, and since it was winter, it was pitch black outside.</p>
 <p>Unlike Earth, since the Pangaeans lacked technology, they usually all went home by the time the sun fell. It was extremely strange that everyone was outside like this.</p>
 <p>Bambababam babam Bababam!</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In could hear music that sounded somewhat familiar to him.</p>
 <p>Babam!</p>
 <p>-You suck!</p>
 <p>Babam!</p>
 <p>-You suck!</p>
 <p>It was music from the TV program that the civilians were watching, WWL (World Wrestling League). With the music, a pro wrestler, Scott Angle, showed up.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Booooo!”</p>
 <p>“Get lost! Stupid baldie!”</p>
 <p>“Get out of there!”</p>
 <p>“Let’s go! John Michaels! Beat him up!”</p>
 <p>The majority of the male citizens started cheering.</p>
 <p>Don’t tell me…</p>
 <p>To confirm his thoughts, Kang Chul-In made his way through the crowd to see what the citizens were looking at.</p>
 <p>“Ah, milord!”</p>
 <p>“Is that milord?!”</p>
 <p>Realizing that Kang Chul-In was there, the citizens split apart to give room for Kang Chul-In. It was as if Moses was splitting the red sea again.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What the…”</p>
 <p>Confirming his thoughts, Kang Chul-In muttered in astonishment.</p>
 <p>There, he could see a huge screen that projected and broadcast wrestling matches from Earth.</p>
 <p>Or to be exact it wasn’t a screen, nor was it being broadcast.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>What Kang Chul-In had thought was a screen was actually marble that was so clean that it seemed like a screen, and a simple looking machine from far away was shooting a beam at the marble, acting as a projector.</p>
 <p>“Father~”</p>
 <p>Spotting Kang Chul-In, Arshelly ran towards him, and hugged him.</p>
 <p>“You’re busy nowadays, right father?”</p>
 <p>“I’m alright. But what is all this?”</p>
 <p>“Oh…”</p>
 <p>Arshelly looked at Kang Chul-In, trying to guess what his thoughts on this were.</p>
 <p>“Uhh… I wanted to give a source of recreation for the citizens… and this was one of the options that I thought of…”</p>
 <p>“Haha…”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In opened his mouth in astonishment at Arshelly’s words.</p>
 <p>“Father… I’m sorry if you’re angry…”</p>
 <p>“No, daughter.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In shook his head.</p>
 <p>“You’ve done a very good job.”</p>
 <p>“R-Really?”</p>
 <p>“As expected of my daughter.”</p>
 <p>“.....!”</p>
 <p>“I’m proud of you.”</p>
 <p>As Kang Chul-In complimented her while stroking her hair, Arshelly couldn’t help but smile happily.</p>
 <p>The sight was so lovely, that Kang Chul-In wondered if this was why others raised their daughters.</p>
 <p>“But… how is this even possible? I thought that nothing from Earth could be brought to Pangaea except pure gold?”</p>
 <p>“They’re from my memories, father.”</p>
 <p>“Your memories?”</p>
 <p>“This is done by using memories in which I watched TV, and putting it inside this magic gem. With the help of the Magic Engineers, I was able to make it in such a big scale.”</p>
 <p>Though it was a great idea, it was also a very difficult one to actually carry out. If not for Arshelly’s god-gifted magical abilities, one wouldn’t be able to even dream of things like this.</p>
 <p>She’s my daughter, but… she’s brilliant.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In looked at Arshelly as if he was looking at a precious doll.</p>
 <p>A kind daughter.</p>
 <p>A kind granddaughter.</p>
 <p>Smart, kind princess of the Laputa territory.</p>
 <p>There wasn’t a single thing about Arshelly that wasn’t perfect.</p>
 <p>“Kuu… Milord, you do have a fine daughter. I’m jealous! If I marry in the future, I hope that I’ll be able to get a daughter such as Arshelly too…”</p>
 <p>Kwak-Jung said from aside, truly envious of Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>“Stop saying ridiculous things.”</p>
 <p>“Sorry?”</p>
 <p>“How can there be another girl like Arshelly?”</p>
 <p>“...Ok.”</p>
 <p>At Kang Chul-In’s pride in his daughter, Kwak-Jung pouted.</p>
 <p>“Then when the princess gets married later…”</p>
 <p>“There’s no way of that happening.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In stopped Kwak-Jung mid-sentence.</p>
 <p>“What kind of man would be able take Arshelly?”</p>
 <p>“......”</p>
 <p>“Go to my office and put your hands up as punishment.”</p>
 <p>“... Sorry?”</p>
 <p>“If not, mental tr…”</p>
 <p>“I’m going.”</p>
 <p>As soon as Kwak-Jung realized Kang Chul-In was going to say the words ‘mental training’, he immediately ran away.</p>
 <p>“Father!”</p>
 <p>Arshelly said.</p>
 <p>“Arshelly is thinking of asking the Magic Engineers to help make more of these screens across the territory. What are your thoughts on this?”</p>
 <p>“Is it possible?”</p>
 <p>“This is in it’s testing stages, so there are a lot of things that we can fix. But if we have father’s support…”</p>
 <p>“Alright.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In nodded his head. There was no way that Kang Chul-In could listen to his lovely daughter’s plea and just ignore it.</p>
 <p>And not only that, the effects were obvious.</p>
 <p>“I’ll tell Timothy to start planning the funds for this project.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you, father.”</p>
 <p>Arshelly hugged Kang Chul-In. It was truly a heartwarming scene.</p>
 <p>------</p>
 <p>Since he was out here anyway, Kang Chul-In decided to spend some time watching the TV with Arshelly.</p>
 <p>On the screen was an intense fight between the Scott Angle who was famed for playing dirty, and the HBM (The Heart Break Man) John Michaels.</p>
 <p>“Come on, John! You got this!”</p>
 <p>“That dirty… how dare he kick John’s balls!”</p>
 <p>“C’mon, John!”</p>
 <p>“Woohoo! Let’s go John!”</p>
 <p>The people near Kang Chul-In were busy looking at the match, and cheering for John Michaels.</p>
 <p>To think that I would be watching Pro Wrestling in Pangaea… As expected, you really can’t take over Pangaea with just brute force and strength.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In once again reconfirmed that in Pangaea, military strength wasn’t everything.</p>
 <p>If I’m able to bring more of Earth’s culture to Pangaea…</p>
 <p>At the moment Kang Chul-In was thinking of that…</p>
 <p>“Woah!!!”</p>
 <p>“Kya~”</p>
 <p>“W-Who exactly are those women?”</p>
 <p>The male citizens of the territory looked at the screen, and roared enthusiastically. The reason…&nbsp;</p>
 <p>-I’ll slowly walk to you~ Cutting my flower~</p>
 <p>Was because a Korean girl group, a K-pop group came out on-screen. It was because after the fight between Scott Angle and John Michaels finished, it changed over to a K-pop program.</p>
 <p>“Woahhh~!”</p>
 <p>“A-Am I going crazy?”</p>
 <p>“T-T-They’re so pretty!”</p>
 <p>At this point, Kang Chul-In started to head back into his office. He didn’t want to be absorbed by all the K-pop hype even in Pangaea.</p>
 <p>A lot of things had changed.</p>
 <p>Learning a lot from the happiness system, Kang Chul-In listened to Arshelly and Kwak-Jung to create a happier Laputa.</p>
 <p>And by providing a lot of money to the research and engineering groups, he made sure that they didn’t go broke.</p>
 <p>As for the projectors, they weren’t able to mass-produce it (the magic gems were too expensive), but they were still able to make 4 of these massive screens, spread across the territory, with 1 in the East, 1 in the South, 1 in the West, and 1 in the North.</p>
 <p>Arshelly played a crucial role in this, since she was a literal walking video folder. This was because they had to use her memories in order to play these things on the screens.</p>
 <p>By going from Earth to Pangaea over and over, Arshelly was able to put the videos from her memories on&nbsp;these devices.</p>
 <p>And thanks to this, the citizens were able to watch many famous films such as ‘Lord of the Necklace’, or ‘Henry Potter’, as well as watch many K-dramas.</p>
 <p>-Happiness: 78 (content)</p>
 <p>-The citizens are happy with their current lives!</p>
 <p>-Though there are some complaints from the female citizens of the territory, they are overcoming this with the power of drama!</p>
 <p>In the document-stuffed office of Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>“Huu…”</p>
 <p>We’re still not even close to done.</p>
 <p>Though the territory had a lot of positive changes during the past few days, they weren’t even close to finishing. If Kang Chul-In of the past was a Conquest Lord who only cared about his military power, the current Kang Chul-In was one who became smart and intelligent enough to look after his citizens too. He had improved as a Lord.</p>
 <p>It was at that moment.</p>
 <p>[You have gained 100 Lord Points!]</p>
 <p>[The stat: ‘Internal Affairs’ has risen from E- to B-.]</p>
 <p>His Lord Points experienced a sharp rise, and so did his stat ‘Internal Affairs’. He had gone from being a complete beginner in terms of this, to at least being somewhat experienced.</p>
 <p>[You will gain a reward for overcoming an incredibly weak stat!]</p>
 <p>As a message that Kang Chul-In had never seen before popped out, he narrowed his eyes.</p>
 <p>Overcoming a weak stat… apparently a bonus was given for this.</p>
 <p>[You have received the item: ‘master of signing’!]&nbsp;</p>
 <p>An incredibly peculiar item was given to him.</p>
 <p>[Unique]: Master of Signing</p>
 <p>One who sits upon the throne, withstand the pressure of documents!</p>
 <p>-Item from the Ancient Kingdom</p>
 <p>-Requirements: Lord</p>
 <p>-Type: Pen</p>
 <p>-Option 1: Documents Scanning speed +30%</p>
 <p>-Option 2: Signing Speed +80%</p>
 <p>-Option 3: Infinite Ink (ink is not required for this pen)</p>
 <p>“... Do these people really want me to die while looking through these documents or something?”</p>
 <p>Angered, Kang Chul-In almost broke the item he had been given, but stopped.</p>
 <p>3 months later.</p>
 <p>Inside a particular forest in the Southern Ishtar region, Dorian was wandering through a fog-filled area.</p>
 <p>During this time, Jackpot (Dorian’s pet) started to whine.</p>
 <p>“Jack?”</p>
 <p>Whine~</p>
 <p>“This guy… what’s wrong with you all of a sudden?”</p>
 <p>It was strange.</p>
 <p>Though Jackpot was a dog pet who lacked even a&nbsp;bit&nbsp;of fighting strength, he was still one to have a lot of courage and stamina to go through dungeons. It was very rare and strange to see him scared like this.</p>
 <p>And his specialty, path-finding, was also not of use in this fog-filled area.</p>
 <p>Thanks to this, Dorian was stuck in here for over 2 weeks. With his slowly dropping supplies, Dorian was starting to grow tired.</p>
 <p>“Come on, Jack.”</p>
 <p>Whine~</p>
 <p>Though Dorian tried to cheer Jack up, Jackpot seemed to be very scared, whining again.</p>
 <p>Why is he… I mean, the fog here is a little too thick. Night and day, we can’t even see past 5 meters.</p>
 <p>Even Dorian was getting impatient.</p>
 <p>As a member of the famed British Special Forces, he had gone through all sorts of situations. But everything that he had learned thus far didn’t seem to work in this forest. Not only was he unable to see which direction the sun rose from, he was unable to find North, West, South, and East. It was as if he was back in the Bermuda Triangle.</p>
 <p>“Sigh… it seems like it will truly be annoying to get out of here.”</p>
 <p>Dorian muttered.</p>
 <p>At that moment!</p>
 <p>Dding!</p>
 <p>A message popped up in front of him.</p>
 <p>[Alarm] Message for the coming Lord Meetings! (D-50)</p>
 <p>It was about the coming Lord Meetings.</p>
 <p>“Hmm? Well, I’m not interested in those… Agh!”</p>
 <p>Dorian screamed.</p>
 <p>-------</p>
 <p>At the same time.</p>
 <p>“Finally…”</p>
 <p>Within the Laputa territory, Kang Chul-In also received an alarm about the coming Lord Meetings.</p>
 <p>“Not bad.”</p>
 <p>Standing on the highest part of Laputa, Kang Chul-In took a look at the improvements that they had made over the last 10 months, and smiled.</p>
 <p>The winter had gone, and spring had come.</p>
 <p>The clean facilities, the energetic citizens, and the constant flow of adventurers. The state of the territory was great.</p>
 <p>Not only that. Though the construction of the new city began in the middle of the harsh winter, the basic structure was already done. Though it was still far from being complete, it was enough for Kang Chul-In to decide to move the Laputa territory to the Ishtar region.</p>
 <p>“I’ll see you again, Rothschild.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In’s eyes shone.</p>
 <p>The Lord Meetings.</p>
 <p>This was an event that all Lords were forced to take part in, no matter what.</p>
 <p>Unless one died, or lost their place as a Lord, or ran away to Earth, they would be forced to&nbsp;take part. That meant that Alex Rothschild, who&nbsp;had run&nbsp;away with his tail between his legs would also be there.</p>
 <p>“I’ve prepared a present for you, Rothschild.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In smirked.</p>
 <p>It made him joyous<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; float: none; display: inline !important">&nbsp;just&nbsp;</span>imagining what would happen with his ‘gift’.</p>
 <p>Through this particular gift, Kang Chul-In&nbsp;was prepared to give Alex Rothschild an absolute hell of a time there, destroying his ‘kind’ image.</p>
 <p>… All that was left was to publicly humiliate him.</p>
