 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In, the meeting with Lee Chae-Lin behind him, drove his Mustang towards the marketplace near Gyeonggido, Buchun. His mother had run a fruit shop in the marketplace for 20 years.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Yes.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If Alex Rothschild was the typical privileged born-to-wealth scenario, Kang Chul-In was a commoner who was raised by a single mother after losing his father at a young age.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Are you there?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">His mother Park Sun-Ja, whom he noticed from far away, was staying warm in front of an antique heater, fighting the cold winter wind.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It was late.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">All the other stores had closed their shutters one-by-one, and the grandmas who were selling different things on the ground were packing up, but Park Sun-Ja was not moving with her eyes locked on the TV.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I need to work hard and earn money if I want to give you a nice home when you get married.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In remembered what Park Sun-Ja always said to him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A nice home.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Park Sun-Ja, who could not give him an apartment worth $400-500 but still said she wanted to get him at least a nice home for rent, opened her store the earliest and closed the latest compared to anyone else. It was her determination to not send her son off with empty hands.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Son?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Park Sun-Ja noticed her son Kang Chul-In right away and smiled widely.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“What are you doing here? It is the weekday… you haven’t contacted me in a while!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I’m back, mother.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In smiled and, unlike his usual self, responded back to Park Sun-Ja. It’s been 7 years.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In helped Park Sun-Ja close the store and went home for a late dinner.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In spoke, with the fruit in front of him after the meal.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I changed my job.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In made up something.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Changed your job? Why? You were doing well.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">With the surprising news, mother Park Sun-Ja seemed surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It was expected.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">South Korea in the 2020s was filled with young people like Kang Chul-In fighting for jobs amidst an environment of westernization and unemployment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Employment Front, Unlimited Competition!” was a slogan and saying that was spreading amongst the young. In this sort of era, Kang Chul-In had left his job, so it was understandable that Lee Sun-Ja was worried.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Intern again? Then, it would be better if you worked at the store with me…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“No.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I got to know the president of a trading company and decided to move to that job. The company isn’t too large, but it is going to be listed soon, and there is a big possibility that it will become medium-sized. Also… I am an official employee.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Employee?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Yes. There are a lot of business trips, but the pay is good, and there are good benefits, so it is much better than the company I was at before.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">At that moment, Park Sun-Ja’s eyes opened wide.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Is… is that true?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Oh… who is that president? Taking my Chul-In in…. he will be blessed, he will!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“President Kwon Hyung Woo… he is known in the trade business. He is almost eighty, but he is well enough to still work in the field.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In sold out Old Man Kwon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He felt a little guilty lying to his mother, but the world still thought of Pangaea as a dangerous, foreign planet. What sort of parent would be glad if her son was going back and forth to such a place? It would be better to tell a little white lie right now, even if he was to tell her in the future.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Also, for he who would be gone often to Pangaea, a trading company job would be a good excuse to avoid Park Sun-Ja’s worries and doubts.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Oh, I see! Oh… seems like your father is looking out for you in heaven!”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Park Sun-Ja mentioned Kang Chul-In’s late father and teared up.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I will be good to you.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In watched Park Sun-Ja and pledged that he would be a different son from before, different from the stoic, detached son in the past.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“No, this won’t do.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Park Sun-Ja thought of something and made a serious face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Son, go to an academy starting tomorrow. I will give you money.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In’s face stiffened at the words.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It was as if he were hit on the back of the head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“You said there are a lot of foreign business trips. Aren’t you not good with foreign languages?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Park Sun-Ja was right.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Kang Chul-In who Park Sun-Ja knew was not someone who had the ability to go on a business trip. It was also true that he did not have the background or the specs either.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">She is smart in these ways.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In was taken aback for the moment, but it was just that – a moment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">お母さん</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">,</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">俺外</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">国</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">語上手ですよ</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">(Mother, I am good at foreign languages)</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Park Sun-Ja looked confused as he spoke Japanese unexpectedly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Meanwhile, I have learned conversation in whatever I can (in English).”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In had begun to speak foreign languages.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">所以</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">别</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">担心</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.” (So, don’t worry.)</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">That was not all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">For a while after, Kang Chul-In showcased his skill in more foreign languages, and Park Sun-Ja, who did not know any other languages, was close to fainting by this display.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Although I am not fluent in Japanese, English, and Chinese, it is enough for me to work. It may be awkward, but I can slowly learn while I work. There isn’t time for me to go to an academy because I am working as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Did you study separately until now?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What studying?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He had drunk a potion from a special tree in Pangaea and had mastered the languages on a whim and had never studied formally.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What time did he have amidst all the battles and attacking dungeons to study?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Aigoo… my son, I’m so proud of you. The academies cost so much, so I could not pay for a good education… but… I’m so proud…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Mother Park Sun-Ja’s eyes turned red and finally shed tears.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Crap.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In did not expect his mother to cry and was put in an awkward position. He had conned his mother, but she was crying.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Son… I’m sorry… I should have supported your education more… my son is this smart…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In was going to say something, but he was a stoic and emotionless man by nature, so he answered by solemnly holding his crying mother.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After Park Sun-Ja cried up a storm, Kang Chul-In took out a thick envelope from his inside pocket.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“What is this, son?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“The president must have taken a liking to me, and he gave me a bit of a bonus. It is for you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“No, you need to use that when you get married. I don’t need anything like that. Speaking of which…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I want grandkids. A granddaughter might be better. I have a son, but I have never had a daughter. Now, my son is an official employee, so you need to get married soon. Right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As the feared marriage talk came up, fear appeared for the first time on Kang Chul-In’s face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Crap!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">For the last 10 years, he was too busy fighting battle after battle and had no time to date, much less get married.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He had spent brief fiery moments with charming women, but those were only single nights. For Kang Chul-In to hear his mother talk about grandchildren, it was quite burdensome.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“It is before I have settled down… it is not too late to talk about that after I have settled in more.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I know that. But… you can bring a nice lady within the year, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I’m going to say it again, but I want a granddaughter.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Park Sun-Ja emphasized “granddaughter”, and Kang Chul-In broke out in cold sweat every time she mentioned it. Even the great Kang Chul-In was just a powerless son in the face of this fearsome weapon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But, he did not know then.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Neither Kang Chul-In nor his mother Park Sun-Ja would know what would happen in just a couple of months.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The next day.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After he had breakfast with his mother, he got on his Mustang and headed towards Seoul.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He first paid off the loans owed to the bank and others that he borrowed from and chose to purchase the Mustang. It did not seem like he would be able to buy a good car anytime soon because the economy of the territory was still unstable.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">That night.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In headed to the 63 building in order to return to Pangaea.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A couple of soldiers and a couple of researchers from the government were around the building, but no one stopped him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Although the 63 Building acted like a sort of dimension door, it was limited to the outside of the building. The inside was still used by people. Also, one did not have to go inside the building to go to Pangaea anyways. You could go to Pangaea from anywhere within 2km of the building.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Pzzt!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In opened the dimension door, not caring if anyone saw or not.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Return.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When he said the command, the golden light that came from the 63 Building fell on Kang Chul-In, and he returned to Pangaea, disappearing without a trace.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Lord, welcome back.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The one that greeted Kang Chul-In the moment he was back was Lucia.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Lucia did not look happy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Lucia, who had the aura of a headstrong, passionate professional, had a rather cold and picky look to her, but she was always smiled widely towards Kang Chul-In.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But how was Lucia’s face now?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Serious and even more serious.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">No, actually, her face was stiffened beyond seriousness.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Something is up.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In saw Lucia’s face and realized something bothersome had happened.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Is there something wrong?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“It’s…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Speak.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Yes, Lord. Please do not be surprised.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Lucia seemed to think for a brief moment and spoke.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Four workers and five Ants died.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In’s face hardened.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“The cause of death… no, who did it? Is it a Lord?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If it was a simple accident at the building site or a fall, then there was no way Lucia would have this sort of response. This meant that it was another Lord or….</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Or is it a monster?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">There was rage on Kang Chul-In’s face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He had returned to Earth, made deals, searched for Kwak Jung, and had even gone to see his mother. He had come back with a light heart, but his precious people had died.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">For the extremely possessive Kang Chul-In who valued “his things”, his anger was understandable.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“It is a monster.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Lucia answered.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“What kind?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“A Peacock Dragon.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In’s eyes glistened sharply upon hearing the attack was perpetrated by a Peacock Dragon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Peacock Dragon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It was a monster that was a dragon but also not.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In Pangaea, dragons existed, but usually, they were red, gold, blue, or the like and were purebloods. But, there were so few in existence and were so rare that it was difficult to even see one in one’s lifetime. Kang Chul-In also, during his 10 years at Pangaea, only saw one blue dragon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But, a subspecies like a Peacock Dragon was not too difficult to find. Roughly about ten different species… but it did have dragon blood and was not a monster to take lightly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In in his prime called the dragon subspecies “fake dragons” and poked fun, but for the current Kang Chul-In, Peacock Dragons represented a definite threat.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Peacock Dragons… from the Drogonia mountains?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Drogonia mountains were the mountains located on the Eastern side of Laputa. Like the name, it was well-known for being a long-time home to dragons and their subspecies.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“It seems so.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Hah…a Peacock Dragon invasion at this time… I’m mad.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This was a time to focus on internal affairs and build the governing system of the territory. For the Peacock Dragon to invade at such a time, Kang Chul-In felt like his ankles had been grabbed from behind as he was trying to move forward.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Lucia.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Yes, Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“From this moment on, announce to the entire territory that we are at war and for everyone to stay inside their homes.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I will fulfill the order, my Lord.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Also, I will use the territory’s hiding function to prepare for future attacks.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Based on the diet of the Peacock Dragons that liked human meat, a second attack was inevitable if the first had already come. If he were to avoid additional casualties, it would be a wise decision to hide the territory, even if it would cost him gold.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Instruct Administrator Timothy is to take care of the compensations for the families of the deceased. Ah, also…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When Kang Chul-In tapered off as if he was thinking about something, Lucia spoke quickly.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“The Royal Guard is already waiting for orders and are fully armed. If you give an order…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“No, not that.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In shook his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“If you say no…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Peacock Dragons are strong monsters. With our military strength right now, we will suffer immense casualties. It is time for us to grow our territory, not shed blood.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“But sire, if you just leave the Peacock Dragon like this, there will be continuous casualties.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I did not say that I will leave the Peacock Dragon be. I will take care of it as quickly as possible.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“But how… Lord, a battle cannot be won without bloodshed.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I know. But in this battle, our blood will not be shed.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Then…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Adventurers.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I will use them to hunt it.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In’s eyes glistened.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Adventurers.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In was going to get in touch with the dimension travelers from Earth to hunt the Peacock Dragon.</span></p>
