 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

 <p>‘Starting a war right now...’</p>
 <p>“Why do you think that?”</p>
 <p>“We won’t make it pass the winter’</p>
 <p>“Milord, the scale of our farmland is small. Even if we do harvest by this winter it would be very bad for us. Sir Timothy and I &nbsp;have concluded that more than 1,200 people will live up to late winter, and when winter comes, the other 300 will die from hunger. ”</p>
 <p>This was something that Kang Chul-in had already known.</p>
 <p>At present the Laputa territory had received 756 people(256 men/500 women) from the Tempaman Territory, and the population increased by more than half. This was why it was impossible to go through winter with their crop yields. So Kang Chul-in wasn’t trying to raise an army right after harvest.</p>
 <p>“Must it be right now?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, it is best to do it today”</p>
 <p>“The reason is?”</p>
 <p>"The problem of food shortages is the same now and after harvest. So why not plunder the farmland of the enemy early and procure the scarce food quickly?”</p>
 <p>What Kwak-jung was suggesting was an extreme way.</p>
 <p>Invading the enemy-&gt; plundering food -&gt; feeding the army with the plundered food -&gt; moving the remaining food to the territory. This was an easy concept.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;...but it was easier said than done.</p>
 <p>This strategy was simple, but also very difficult to pull off.</p>
 <p>"So, do you have any plans?"</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In did not ignore Kwak-jung’s opinion. He knew that there was a reason for Kwak-Jung to suggest this sort of method.</p>
 <p>“Of course, milord.” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kwak-Jung smiled coldly.</p>
 <p>“And what is it?”</p>
 <p>“The Laputa territory will use you, milord, to win in this war.”</p>
 <p>Although some Lords might feel uncomfortable if their subordinate said that they would use them to win, Kang Chul-In instead had a satisfied smile on his face.</p>
 <p>‘It seems like he has worked out how Pangaea works.’</p>
 <p>“Use me?”</p>
 <p>“Yes.”</p>
 <p>“Explain?”</p>
 <p>“Huh?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I want to know why you decided to use your brain, and decided that I was the best way to win the war.”</p>
 <p>“W-Well…”</p>
 <p>Kwak Jung seemed to be ashamed of himself, and tried to avoid explaining it to Kang Chul-In himself.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;"Well, speak. Or do you want to get some mental edu…”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in tried to refer to "mental education".</p>
 <p>"Oh no, milord!"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;Kwak-jung was surprised.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Hmm, okay ... I'll tell you."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kwak Jung's face was red.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"This is neither the middle, nor the modern ages of Earth. Here, you will only lose blood if you try using the tactics normally used back there.”</p>
 <p>"And the reason for that is?"</p>
 <p>"Because of people like you, milord.”</p>
 <p>Kwak Jung pinpointed the point.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"A strong monarch, a strong adventurer, is like a strategic weapon. What can a flock of poor lambs do if you unleash a lion upon them?"</p>
 <p>Indeed, Kang Chul-in was right. Kwak-Jung had understood how Pangaea worked within a few days.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"You are right."</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In nodded his head.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"So, how do you plan to use me?"</p>
 <p>"Foremost is Lucia, Lieutenant James, Captain Michael, Chief Sorcerer Nilus. These 4 will be the ones that go up and beat them up...not. I mean----”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"General."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;"... Yes, four generals take charge."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kwak-Jung blushed, due to the fact that he had subconsciously reverted back to his ‘old way’ of speaking.</p>
 <p>"Anyway, this is the battle for the forefront of the battle, and --- you can take charge of the supply forces."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kwak Jung said that the Kang Chul-In should direct the supply forces, which would be the major targets of the enemy. I told them to hang their guns.</p>
 <p>"Do you want to be the target of the enemy?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kang jung-smiled and said.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yes."</p>
 <p>Kwak Jung-il replied coldly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Ho ... to take over the command of the supply troops most enemies to the monarch alone. I'm going to die."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in said playfully.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Oh, no!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kwak Jung hit his hands in amazement.</p>
 <p>"... We need a supply unit that won't fall... Solid enough to handle a long supply line. Isn’t your majesty the strongest man in the whole of the territory? Well, it isn’t an overstatement to say that the whole plan is dependant on you, milord."</p>
 <p>“Are you sure? "&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yes, your majesty. For your enemy, majesty is the most delicious rice cake and also the best trap. Your majesty will crush every single enemy, no matter how many enemies come..."</p>
 <p>Basically, Kang Chul-In would support and defend the supply unit, and attract the enemy forces.</p>
 <p>It was a bait.</p>
 <p>Since he was the strongest member of the army, Kang Chul-In would be the one that would take the brunt of the enemy forces.</p>
 <p>"It doesn’t really matter whether we win or lose the war, as long as we manage to take some food from them."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Is it profitable to just plunder food?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"The purpose of this war is food procurement. Even if we don't occupy the plains, if we have food for the winter, wouldn't it be difficult for the winter of the enemy? And wouldn't we have a favorable war against the hungry enemies in the winter when spring comes? "</p>
 <p>Kwak-Jung's words were correct.</p>
 <p>It was a bit of a mess, but it was also the most efficient way.</p>
 <p>All except for one fatal flaw.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"What if I fall?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kang jung-il thought of that question.</p>
 <p>"Then… we’re screwed!" Kwak Jung replied.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"You still have to do it, you have to do it."</p>
 <p>And he cheered Kang Chul-In up.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Our estate is poorer than other estates. We really do need the food to get back into business, and start pulling ahead of the other territories. Although we do have the rich Dorado territory as our allies, they just restarted their territory, and still need time to stabilize themselves. If we ask from them, I’m afraid that it would be too much of a burden.” Kwak-Jung said.</p>
 <p>And although the word poor made Kang Chul-In’s veins throb, it was also true.</p>
 <p>“And not only that, milord also has the epic item in order to summon 50 spectre knights.”</p>
 <p>“If it is milord with 50 spectre knights, I’m sure that no squad in Pangaea would be able to stand up against it right now.”</p>
 <p>“Fine.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In nodded his head.</p>
 <p>“Although I would say it is only a 40 point answer, it’s okay.”</p>
 <p>He only gave it the measly 40 points because the strategy was heavily reliant on him.</p>
 <p>It was a good strategy for someone that had been a gangster just a couple of days ago. And not only this, Kang Chul-In, as a Lord who liked to go into the battlefield himself, was willing to take the risk.</p>
 <p>‘Not bad, considering it is his first time’. Was Kang Chul-In’s conclusion with the strategy.</p>
 <p>“Well, we’ll go like this. We will increase the population size, and the ones that join us will stay at…”</p>
 <p>“The burrow lands are currently empty, milord.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, right. We can use that guy’s land.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In nodded his head, as if he understood.</p>
 <p>“Oh by the way, where is that guy? I heard from Podolski that he ran away, before being caught again and being thrown inside the prison.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, you haven’t heard? Kimura is currently helping the Ants in the construction.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, is that so? Well, I’ll have to see his face sometime soon.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In added 1500 people to his populace, along with 3 magic cannons, as well as 6 musketeers to help in shooting them.</p>
 <p>And he also added 4 Battle Ogres, and 8 Troll Shieldmen.</p>
 <p>And after increasing the size of his population, he created an army.</p>
 <p>1000 humans, 4 Battle Ogres, 8 Troll Shieldmen, 3 Magic Cannons, and 6 musketeers. Along with… Billy Halford, and the 30 other adventurers.</p>
 <p>Although it wasn’t a truly big army, this was still the full size of it, due to the fact that they had basically took all the fit men in Laputa.</p>
 <p>‘If we win in this war, we’ll have some breathing room, and we’ll also have some time to create and build an even greater army.’</p>
 <p>Just like Kwak-Jung had said, Kang Chul-In was aware of the fact that the fate of the Laputa territory, as well as his future was dependant on the upcoming war.</p>
 <p>Although he could buy people, items, and weapons with gold, he couldn’t buy food with gold.</p>
 <p>And thanks to this, taking other people’s territories was something that was absolutely important and vital to all the fights in Pangaea.</p>
 <p>Three days later.</p>
 <p>While putting his army on hold and using cosmic force, he scouted the nearby area. As a result, he could see that there was another territory around 50km eastward of Laputa, with a farm there. It was decided. This would be the first target.</p>
 <p>“Podolski, are you proficient with a bow?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Along with the White Lion Knights, he would bring Podolski with him, to go scout their enemy territory.</p>
 <p>“Well, although I’m no Hou Yi (godly archer in chinese mythology), I have to say I am pretty decent in using one.”</p>
 <p>It seemed that Podolski was capable with all types of weapons, being the ‘perfect’ human that he was.</p>
 <p>“Well, follow me.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, milord. But... a bow? Are we going to go hunting?”</p>
 <p>“I’m planning to shoot some Scouting Hawks down if I see them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Oh…”</p>
 <p>Scouting Hawks were quite annoying, due to the fact that they could not be touched by any close combat style weapons. That was why despite the fact that Kang Chul-In himself also knew how to use a bow, he had brought someone else that could also use mana with the bow efficiently.</p>
 <p>“Yes sir. I will follow you.” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Sometimes, there were battles that started coincidentally, and without any plan.</p>
 <p>That was the same with Kang Chul-In’s battle right now.</p>
 <p>While going scouting in enemy territory along with his White Lion Knights, Kang Chul-In met the opposing territory’s scouts due to pure coincidence, the reason being that the time that they had gone to scout overlapped.</p>
 <p>“Who is it! State who you are immediately!”</p>
 <p>The enemy’s captain shouted boldly, along with his 200 or so soldiers standing next to them.</p>
 <p>“I am the Lord of the Laputa territory, Kang Chul-In.”</p>
 <p>“The Laputa Territory? Laputa… isn’t that the territory located within the westernmost area of this region? What is someone near the western borders doing here in OUR territory?”</p>
 <p>“Scouting.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In answered boldly.</p>
 <p>“Scouting?”</p>
 <p>The captain snorted as if his reply was ridiculous.</p>
 <p>“So a Lord has just brought a measly knight squadron along with him to come ‘scout’? Deep into our territory nonetheless?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What, am I not allowed to?”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In retorted.</p>
 <p>“How dare you!!”</p>
 <p>The enemy captain tried to snarl at them, but…</p>
 <p>THWAK! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Blood splattered everywhere.</p>
 <p>“C-C-Captain?!” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“CAPTAIN!!!”</p>
 <p>Looking at their Captain’s head that was separated from his body, the enemy forces were all petrified from fear.</p>
 <p>Thump.</p>
 <p>Roll….</p>
 <p>And their captain’s head just rolled on the floor, lifelessly.</p>
 <p>‘Sigh, what bad luck.’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In’s expression, who had just killed the enemy’s captain wasn’t great. He was planning on launching a sneak attack on the enemy after scouting the enemy territory, but since he had met the enemy on the way there, there was no way past this.</p>
 <p>‘Well, I guess we’ll just have to…”</p>
 <p>“KILL THEM ALL!” Kang Chul-In said, steeling his heart.</p>
 <p>“How dare you do that to our Captain!”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In stared at the enemy soldiers who were rushing in without consequence for their lives, enraged by the death of their Captain.</p>
 <p>A battle of 32 against 200.</p>
 <p>In terms of numbers, the enemy forces were far more superior.</p>
 <p>“Kill them all.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In once again ordered the White Lion Knights, as well as Podolski. And…</p>
 <p>“Go.” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>He used the Epic Item: Owner of the Ghosts.</p>
 <p>SWISH!! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Along with some black, ominous looking wind currents appearing out of nowhere…</p>
 <p>50 Spectre Knights that were of Level 40 showed themselves.</p>
