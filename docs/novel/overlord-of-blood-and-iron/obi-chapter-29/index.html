 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What to do…?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In, even on Earth, as he got in his Mustang and headed towards his home, was preoccupied with trying to come up with a solution to that problem.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Nothing is impossible. There must be a way…</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If it doesn’t work, make it work, even by force, under any circumstances. It was like Kang Chul-In’s motto.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If it doesn’t work, I need to make it work… I must… make it work… wait!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">At that moment, Kang Chul-In opened his eyes wide at the sudden thought that crossed his head.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Low level?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Then, he could grow the adventurers’ levels enough to hunt the Peacock Dragon. Different from the humans in Pangaea, the dimension travelers’ growth is incomparably fast!</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I found a way.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Why did Kang Chul-In decide to use the help of the adventurers?</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In order to solve this mystery, it was necessary to think of the relationship between a Lord and the adventurer.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">There were 300,000 dimension travelers that responded to the Great Summoning,</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Among them were 300 Lords.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The 299,700 remaining were called adventurers.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The relationship between the Lords and adventurers were much like symbiosis. One needed the other to survive. It could be called a ruler and subject relationship and sometimes, a client/customer relationship as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However, the dimension travelers were special (enough to be summoned from Earth) and therefore had faster rates of growth, which made it possible to expect tremendous growth.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Lords often joined hands with adventurers to target dungeons or ruins as well as to participate in monster subjugations. Sometimes, they invited adventurers they connected well with to come settle their territories as subjects.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">There were even Lords with exceptional business mindsets that created businesses such as motels, restaurants, and even prostitution bars and opened them up to adventurers, gaining immense profit.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">For various reasons, Lords associated with adventurers from Earth and exchanged for items they needed. The relationships with the adventurers were crucial for one’s growth into a strong Lord.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Therefore, even the Kang Chul-In who was extremely independent aimed to establish a strong relationship with the adventurers in this lifetime and recruit some useful individuals.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It’s not a bad plan. If I were to train them quickly, we could take on the Peacock Dragon.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It would obviously be a struggle, but the result would not be horrible.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">At the very least, Kang Chul-In himself was confident that he would survive, so there were no big problems.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Gather the adventurers and teach them in a short, fast-paced course…. If I were to set the time to about 2 weeks… the remaining week I can use to hunt the Peacock Dragon.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When he came up with a plan, the rest followed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">With a plan, it was obvious that he would put it to action right away, so Kang Chul-In went home right away, turned on his Macbook, and turned on “World”, the world’s biggest online community.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">World was a website that a young businessman from America created. Much like Facebook, Twitter, and Google, it had various functions and accessibility that allowed it to grow almost immediately into the world’s largest community.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In’s idea was to use World’s community to gather the adventurers that usually worked in the Pandemonium area.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It was because World was a site where English-speaking dimension travelers all around the world used to exchange information.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hm… what ID…?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He thought for a brief moment, remembered his ID, and pressed the login button.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">- ID: Overlord</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">- Password: **********</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As soon as the page appeared, he opened a category.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As soon as he clicked the large category named “Great Summoning”, he clicked on the subcategory called “Location” and then “Pandemonium”.</span></p>

 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Among the various types of posts, he could not find any similar posts. It probably was because it was regarding Pandemonium, which was far off from Pangaea’s mainland and therefore did not have many adventurers in the first place.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Okay.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In liked that there were few posts.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If it were the mainland category, it would be blowing up. Almost all of the 300,000 dimension travelers would be in the mainland category.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Should I create some interest?</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In order to gather the adventurers, he needed to write a post and generate interest.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In knew better than anyone how to grab the attention of the adventurers.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">First, Kang Chul-In took off the set of green bracelets that were on his wrists, took a picture of them with his iPhone, uploaded them to the network, and wrote the post.</span></p>

 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If this were all the responses that he was getting, it would be almost impossible to gather the adventurers. He needed a sort of trick. Kang Chul-In copied the link to the post and pasted it into a messaging app, sent it to Park Du-Sik, and called him.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">[Yes, big boss! Why are you calling me after two days?]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“You don’t need to know why, but I sent you a link, so have your boys comment and click share.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">[Ah! When will you send it, boss?]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I sent it already.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">[I will check right away… uh… um… big boss?]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Park Du-Sik’s voice was weird.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In was sure that Park Du-Sik was sweating on the other side of the phone. It was obvious that Park Du-Sik was in a difficult position.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">[I’m sorry… but… our boys… it’s that… our boys… their backpack straps are a little short…]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He got it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">World was an English-based community with its headquarters in America. Even if translations were available, one would need to be able to communicate a bit in English to use it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Although even gangsters now needed to go to college to survive, most were still only high-school graduates.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">And… someone who was a gangster was very unlikely to have studied hard in school anyway.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“…you uneducated idiots.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In said over the phone, and Park Du-Sik could not utter a word. His face would be red from embarrassment by now.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“You should be ashamed.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">[…yes… Big boss.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Well, it is my fault for expecting so much from a bunch of idiots.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I will hang up before your idiocy transfers to me. Then, at least click share.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">[Yes…]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In hung up quickly and called Old Man Kwon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Old man, I have a favor.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Luckily, things worked out well with Old Man Kwon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">[Ah, really? Alright. I will get my Hong Kong boys on it. They speak some English. Would about 100 comments be enough?]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“That’s enough.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Old Man Kwon was eager to help after hearing that Kang Chul-In revealed a new item — perhaps he smelled money. A person first needed to be smart.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">[You are trying to get adventurers together. Is it a foundation beneficial for our partnership as well?]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“This and that. We will talk details later. Now is not the time.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">[Hm… I guess I will find out bit by bit. I will take care of what you asked within the hour, so do not worry.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“I got it, old man.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After the conversation with Old Man Kwon, Kang Chul-In casually waited for the post to go viral.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After an hour or so… Kang Chul-In’s post became ranked as one of the top posts and grabbed the attention of the World users.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Nice!</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The response was explosive.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The post that was already attention-worthy, combined with a bit of manipulation, caused the views to skyrocket.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Before the post was 2 hours old, there were over a thousand comments.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">And that was not all.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Personal messages flowed into his mailbox.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">One… two… suddenly 50… and when three hours had passed, around 500 messages were in his mailbox.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This is still not enough.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In did not stop there.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">[Notice] I will reveal new items every hour.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I will go on a subjugation soon.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Adventurers who wish to join my team send me a message with your profile information, and I will respond after review.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After that, Kang Chul-In revealed one item per hour for three hours.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The World community exploded.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In’s post ranked 1,2,3, and 4 in the entire “World Best Post”, creating a frenzy, and this news spread to Korea, creating noise on Korea’s internet as well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Easy.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In, who had created a viral post in a simple way, sipped his coffee leisurely and smiled. Honestly, the items that Kang Chul-In had posted were not that great, nor were they attention-worthy. The reasons were as follows.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">First, the items that were introduced on World were low-level items that would be used in the early stages of the Grand Summoning.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Second, any Lord with enough wealth in their territories could introduce even better items than Kang Chul-In.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But the reason Kang Chul-In’s posts had gone viral was that he acted quickly before anyone could think or have a chance to.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">There is a saying that “life is timing”. Whatever it was, the one who did it first would have the most gain. And through this, Kang Chul-In gained something else other than just gathering adventurers.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Because all of his posts were 1st to 4th place in the best post category in World, it was not an overstatement to say that there were almost no users in World who did not know his username, “Overlord”.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He had become famous after just a few posts.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">From now on, Kang Chul-In’s posts would automatically become one of the most viewed posts, and he had gained the trust of the World users to a certain extent. It was something that he did not expect from the start.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Nice, now I will offer some incentives.</span></em></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The next step was easy.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He would offer gold and items as bait to recruit competent adventurers, meet at Pandemonium, and create a team.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Although, he did have his work cut out for him as he had to look through all the thousands of messages in his inbox.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">He tackled the messages right away.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">There were all sorts of messages, from those questioning where the items came from to those wishing to buy the items to messages cursing him to much more. However… of the bunch… there was one that stood out to him and grabbed his attention.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">“Aha….”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kang Chul-In’s eyes sparkled after checking the sender of the message.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The account’s name was “Lumpen”.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It was a message from someone who had received the title of Overlord in the past and had been a worthy opponent for Kang Chul-In himself, Dorian Explorer!</span></p>
