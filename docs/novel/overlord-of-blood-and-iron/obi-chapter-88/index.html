 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

 <p>“Milord.”</p>
 <p>Kwak-Jung, who was by Kang Chul-In’s side called him.</p>
 <p>“Well, this time around we have captured 10 cat demi-human, right?”</p>
 <p>“Yes. What about it?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Umm… Are you going to use all of them as assassins?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“For now, that is the plan.” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Ehem…” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Kwak-Jung coughed, and his face reddened.</p>
 <p>“Milord… the thing is…” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Due to Kwak-Jung’s embarrassed expression and quietly spoken words, Kang Chul-In started to get annoyed.</p>
 <p>“Say what you want quickly. I do not have much time to waste.”</p>
 <p>“Oh… yes… The thing is… Is it possible… to put one of the cat-women as… my Secretary? Ehem… I am the Tactician of Laputa, afterall… One secretary should…” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hehe… I think a secretary would definitely allow me to work better, and focus more on my tasks.”</p>
 <p>“No.”</p>
 <p>“Is it not possible…?”</p>
 <p>Kwak-Jung’s expression showed dissappointment.</p>
 <p>“I know for a fact that if I let one of them be your secretary, you definitely wouldn’t work faster, or focus on your task. It’s obvious that you would spend your day trying to flirt with that ‘Secretary’ of yours.”</p>
 <p>“N-No! That’s not true…”</p>
 <p>“I think it would be better entrusting a cat with a fish.” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“...Then why not entrust a cat to Kwak-Jung?”</p>
 <p>POW! &nbsp;</p>
 <p>As he said that, Kwak-Jung’s face fell to the ground from shock. Kang Chul-In had flicked him on the forehead.</p>
 <p>“Ow….” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Kwak-Jung.</p>
 <p>“Yes, milord…” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“They’re not objects.” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“....”</p>
 <p>“If you really want a secretary like that, then go ask them yourself. If they agree, then I’ll allow you to keep one as your Secretary.” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“R-Really?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You know that I do not go against my words.”</p>
 <p>“T-Thank you, milord!”</p>
 <p>And as soon as Kang Chul-In gave permission, Kwak-Jung scurried off, looking happier than ever.</p>
 <p>“Hmph… What terrible personality he has.”</p>
 <p>Lucia stared at Kwak-Jung’s back distastefully, as he scurried off quickly.</p>
 <p>“Ehem… I can’t say that I do not sympathize with Soldier Kwak, though.”</p>
 <p>Billy Halford spoke, embarrassed.</p>
 <p>“Cat-women are probably every man’s dre… Cough. Never mind.” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Milord… As expected.” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Huh?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I’m just saying it’s like milord to not be enchanted by the looks of those foolish cat people. Hoho.”</p>
 <p>Lucia seemed satisfied that Kang Chul-In, unlike the other men, was not that excited about capturing the Cat-women.</p>
 <p>It was at that moment.</p>
 <p>Along with a pained scream, the sound of a loud cat came from elsewhere.</p>
 <p>“Uuu… Why can’t they just say no if they don’t want to…”</p>
 <p>And Kwak-Jung appeared, his face looking crest-fallen.</p>
 <p>“Hohoho! It seems like Soldier Kwak has learnt a lesson from those foolish cats? Those cats have a feisty personality, and they do not appreciate people that are weaker than them… Like you.”</p>
 <p>Lucia laughed, as if she felt that it was pleasurable looking at Kwak-Jung’s pain.</p>
 <p>“What, are all demi-humans like that?”</p>
 <p>Kwak-Jung asked, full of bitterness.</p>
 <p>“No, but those cats are just a special case. Those Cat-women… you can just think of them as angry, female cats. Umm… I think maybe the Ho-people (Fox-humans) would be a good fit for you.” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“W-What? You want me to go with people that have tiger heads on them?” (Ho translates to either&nbsp;狐=fox, or&nbsp;虎=tiger in&nbsp;한자&nbsp;or Han Zi, the traditional korean letters based on chinese)</p>
 <p>“Those are the other Ho-people (Humanoid Tigers), and I was talking about the Fox-humans.” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Fox Humans? Do they have tails too?”</p>
 <p>“Tails, ears. They have both of them.”</p>
 <p>“No way…”</p>
 <p>“If they cat-women have a girl-like charm that exudes cuteness, then the fox-women have a sort of mature-woman like charm.”</p>
 <p>“I-Isn’t that a legendary Kumiho that comes out in mythology?”</p>
 <p>“And what’s that…”</p>
 <p>“Y-You don’t know? Y-You know, the 1000 year old fox demons. The ones with the Nine tails!”</p>
 <p>“That’s a Ninetails.”</p>
 <p>“Ninetails?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yes. They also come out in the mythology of Pangaea, but they are closer to Gods and legends. But no-one is sure. Whether they truly exist or not. After all, Ninetails existing are just legends.”</p>
 <p>“They exist.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In suddenly spoke.</p>
 <p>“Really?”</p>
 <p>“Are you sure, milord?”</p>
 <p>Kwak-Jung and Lucia both asked in surprise.</p>
 <p>“Ninetails… are real.”</p>
 <p>It was at that moment.</p>
 <p>“Milord!!!!”</p>
 <p>From far away, Drakan could be seen riding a horse, and galloping towards Kang Chul-In at full speeds.</p>
 <p>“Milord~~!! Wait!!! Just a moment!!!”</p>
 <p>“What is it.”</p>
 <p>But Kang Chul-In didn’t seem surprised, and spoke calmly.</p>
 <p>“Milord… how could you just leave me after all you’ve done for me? At least let me serve you!”</p>
 <p>“Hmph. You didn’t listen when I asked you nicely. Do I really have to give you a beating to let me listen?”</p>
 <p>“T-The thing is…”</p>
 <p>“Milord… Sorry. I beg you to forgive me, for my insolence. Please. Let this useless one serve you from now on!” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Stand.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In spoke.</p>
 <p>“Stand, and go back to the Absilon territory.”</p>
 <p>“B-But…”</p>
 <p>“Do I have to give you another beating to make you listen?” &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You will rest today, and come back when you get better. I don’t want the loyalty of someone that is injured.”</p>
 <p>“B-But…”</p>
 <p>“Do not worry. I am going to use Absilon as a temporary base of war, and use it as a tactical fortress, going back and forth. It won’t be long. You better be healed by then.”</p>
 <p>“Kuk… Yes, thank you, milord!”</p>
 <p>“Oh. And. Don’t ride horses from now on.”</p>
 <p>“...Huh?”</p>
 <p>“Look at it. It’s dead.”</p>
 <p>And Kang Chul-In pointed at the poor horse that Drakan had ridden on the way here. The horse… was dead, it’s tongue sticking outwards from exhaustion.</p>
 <p>-----</p>
 <p>‘Ninetails, huh…’</p>
 <p>After the conversation with Drakan, Kang Chul-In’s mind drifted to the queen of the foxes, the Ninetails.</p>
 <p>Was it because of how beautiful it was?</p>
 <p>Of course not. Although Kang Chul-In had heard rumors of it before, he hadn’t actually met one before. He just remembered the war between the Ninetails and Aleister, the traitor that had betrayed him before.</p>
 <p>‘You. I will beat you up first, Aleister.’</p>
 <p>‘3 months after the first Lord meetings. Lord Aleister begins the war with the Ninetails.’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In recalled the past. It was the war between the Fox-humans and the undead, later titled the Graveyard War.</p>
 <p>‘The Graveyard War was the starting point of you becoming an Overlord. But… this time, you won’t succeed, you dirty traitor.’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In ground his teeth, and spoke.</p>
