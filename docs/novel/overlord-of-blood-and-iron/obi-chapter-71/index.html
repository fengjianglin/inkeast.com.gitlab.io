 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

 <p>Kang Chul-in was truly angry.</p>
 <p>They definitely needed the 500L of the talking tree sap by today. If not, they wouldn’t be able to get 1500L, which made the 6000 bottles of Lang Bros.</p>
 <p>In order to deliver their products in time, they needed to make sure that nothing went wrong.</p>
 <p>But… only 60% of their expected amount had come.</p>
 <p>“Huuu…”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in inhaled deeply, trying his best not to explode in rage.</p>
 <p>There must be a reason for this. Otherwise, there would be no shortage in supply. He knew that it wasn’t the civilians being lazy, there must be a cause. Whether it was enemy raid, a monster appearing, or something else.</p>
 <p>But even though he knew this, it didn’t change the fact that he was angry.</p>
 <p>This was a problem of trust.</p>
 <p>Old man Kwon had completely put his trust in Kang Chul-in, and marketed a huge product, using his personal money and constructing the Galaxy Corporation.</p>
 <p>He had taken care of Kwak-jung for him, given him a mansion in Seocho, as well as gotten him several cars.</p>
 <p>If he was unable to meet his end of the bargain, that would make him nothing else but a liar.</p>
 <p>Their harmonious relationship might break off, and it would also be embarrassing to face Old man Kwon like this.</p>
 <p>For someone like Kang Chul-in, who never went back on his promises, this was very rage-inducing.</p>
 <p>“Director, don’t you think we’re missing just a bit of product?”</p>
 <p>The one in charge of shipping the products said.</p>
 <p>“Yes, we are missing some.”</p>
 <p>“There must be a problem in Pangaea. I will tell the higher-ups about the problems, so you should just get to putting it in the storage area.”</p>
 <p>The ‘higher-ups’ he said was referring to Old man Kwon.</p>
 <p>“Yes, director.”</p>
 <p>And as soon as he ordered them, he rode on his Sesto Elemento, and headed towards Yeouido.</p>
 <p>Because this dimensional door was not for humans, he had to go to the 63 building and move back towards Laputa.</p>
 <p>“Old man.” Kang Chul-in decided to call Old man Kwon on the way.</p>
 <p>“Kuku, what is it? Oh, is today when the products come in?”</p>
 <p>“Old man, there’s a problem.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in decided to tell him the truth, and apologize. It wasn’t like Kang Chul-in to avoid these kind of things.</p>
 <p>“Huh? What do you mean problem?”</p>
 <p>“Only 300L of the products have come in. It looks like there’s a problem in our territory.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, and here I was, thinking it was something big.”</p>
 <p>Old man Kwon was surprisingly calm, and didn’t seem to care much.</p>
 <p>“Kuku, these things happen when you do business.”</p>
 <p>“You shouldn’t be feeling to well though?”</p>
 <p>“Well, I trust you, so what is there to be upset about? Aren’t you going to solve the problem soon enough anyway?”</p>
 <p>Old man Kwon really didn’t seem to mind.</p>
 <p>“Oh, let me ask you one thing.”</p>
 <p>“What is it?”</p>
 <p>“Remember… the peacock dragon meat? Hmm… hmm… yes, that thing… was very good.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in suddenly felt that the talk was going to get annoying.</p>
 <p>“The, you know, right?” &nbsp;“What?”</p>
 <p>“The celebrity Lee Eun-mi! Ms. Lee Eun-mi.”</p>
 <p>“Who is…”</p>
 <p>“Huhu, do you not even watch TV shows or Drama? Tzzt tzzt, to think that you don’t even know the famous ‘Korean aunt.”</p>
 <p>Hearing the phrase ‘Korean aunt’, Kang Chul-in thought of a middle-aged woman that was elegant.</p>
 <p>“… Old man, are you doing romance?”</p>
 <p>“Hmm… it just worked out this way…”</p>
 <p>“You guys might have a large difference in age though…”</p>
 <p>“IT’S ONLY 15 YEARS! SHE IS QUITE OLD TOO!”</p>
 <p>It seemed like Old man Kwon was having the quite ‘greyish romance.’</p>
 <p>“Anyway… can I ask you for some more of that Peacock Dragon meat?”</p>
 <p>“Please.”</p>
 <p>“… Fine.”</p>
 <p>“HAHA! I knew you were a reliable man. Well, how long would this take?”</p>
 <p>“One week.”</p>
 <p>“Well then, I’ll leave this to you. I have an appointment with Ms. Lee Eun-mi tomorrow, so…”</p>
 <p>And at that moment…</p>
 <p>“Mr. Hyung-woo, who are you calling?”</p>
 <p>A voice that Kang Chul-in was familiar with spoke. It was a voice that he heard on TV.</p>
 <p>Tuk!</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in hung up the call, and threw his phone to the seat next to him. Old man Kwon… this man truly had no scruples.</p>
 <p>“Milord.”</p>
 <p>When Kang Chul-in stepped out of the magic circle, Lucia came forth, and kneeled.</p>
 <p>And of course, the same came for a lot of others. Nilus, Timothy, James, as well as the newly accepted Michael. All of the high-ranked members of Laputa came forth and bowed to him.</p>
 <p>‘It seems that there truly is a problem.’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in didn’t rage at them.</p>
 <p>“Milord…”</p>
 <p>Michael came forward, and once again kneeled before Kang Chul-in.</p>
 <p>“Please kill me.”</p>
 <p>And he handed his blade to Kang Chul-in.</p>
 <p>‘What’s with this guy?’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in was startled at Michael’s ominous behavior.</p>
 <p>“Milord… this incapable knight… has failed milord’s orders in guarding the perimeter around the Talking-trees. According to the military law, please kill…”</p>
 <p>“Michael.” Kang Chul-in interrupted him.</p>
 <p>“I will decide what to do.”</p>
 <p>“Lucia.”</p>
 <p>“What is it?”</p>
 <p>“Well, the thing is… Lana Lovely has gone missing.”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Lana Lovely?”</p>
 <p>“It’s that girl that milord had saved when you first came to Laputa from the orcs. She was also the one that you accepted the flowers from when you came back after slaying the Peacock Dragon.”</p>
 <p>And listening to the explanation, Kang Chul-in nodded his head.</p>
 <p>“But is the disappearance of one girl that important?”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in spoke coldly.</p>
 <p>Yes.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in wasn’t some sort of weak Lord who would go searching for just one missing civilian. What kind of Lord would do that? Only a weakling would.</p>
 <p>“No, I’d bet that this isn’t everything.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in felt that there was another reason, that wasn’t this.</p>
 <p>“Yes, milord.”</p>
 <p>Lucia spoke.</p>
 <p>“The disappearance of Lana is just one of many.”</p>
 <p>“One of many?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, 37 teenagers under the age of 16 have gone missing. All vanished. Without a single trace.”</p>
 <p>And listening to this, Kang Chul-in understood.</p>
 <p>“Podolski.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in called Podolski.</p>
 <p>“Have you investigated?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, milord. After the disappearance, I’ve called in adventurers to go scout for information.”</p>
 <p>“And the result?”</p>
 <p>“Everyone went missing.”</p>
 <p>The more they spoke, the worse it got.</p>
 <p>To think that his precious ‘Team Slayers’ went missing?</p>
 <p>“Is there a chance that it is an attack of another Lord or a group of monsters?”</p>
 <p>“No, sir.”</p>
 <p>“None at all?”</p>
 <p>“There is none at all. There are no footsteps, blood, or any trace that they have invaded the territory. This Podolski, I can bet my life on this.”</p>
 <p>It was a mystery.</p>
 <p>There were no traces of enemies, but only missing teenagers and adventurers?</p>
 <p>…What kind of situation is this?</p>
 <p>‘It’s not like it is Pied Piper of Hamelin or something.’</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in sighed, thinking of the german folk-tale about the Pied Piper of Hamelin.</p>
 <p>“Ugh, I nearly died.”</p>
 <p>It was that moment.</p>
 <p>“I found it, I found it!”</p>
 <p>A man walked into the hall, with a proud expression.</p>
 <p>Ruff Ruff!</p>
 <p>And a Welsh Corgi followed behind that man.</p>
 <p>‘God dammit.’</p>
 <p>Looking at the man with the dog, Kang Chul-in’s facial expression got even worse.</p>
 <p>“Yo, Chul-in!”</p>
 <p>The man, Dorian Explorer waved his hand at Kang Chul-in, smiling.</p>
 <p>And the one following him was the S rank unit, a seeker.</p>
 <p>Dorian had picked an S rank unit in the past, but to think that he would do so again. It was true that a man that succeeds one could do so again.</p>
 <p>“Why are you in my territory?”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in spoke, even more annoyed now.</p>
 <p>“Cuz’ I’m bored? There’s nothing much to do around my territory, so I decided to go adventuring. And when I came near this area, I thought of you, and came here!”</p>
 <p>“… But your secretary will start nagging you again?”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-in remembered Dorian’s secretary, a small fairy like tinkerbell, that nagged all day.</p>
 <p>“… Please don’t talk about Pixie.”</p>
 <p>Dorian spoke in a tired expression. It seemed like he too was fed up.</p>
 <p>“Oh, right!”</p>
 <p>Dorian slapped his forehead, and spoke.</p>
 <p>“I found it!”</p>
 <p>“Found what?”</p>
 <p>“Where the missing ones are!”</p>
 <p>Surprisingly, it seemed like Dorian was here in order to help him with this situation.</p>
 <p>“Dungeon, it’s a dungeon.”</p>
 <p>“A dungeon?”</p>
 <p>“Kang Chul-in, there’s a dungeon right under your territory.”</p>
