 <p>Hey guys! &nbsp;It's been a bit longer than we had anticipated, but we're really trying to roll things in together instead of overloading you guys with too many announcements, so we wanted to get it all together at once. &nbsp;We continue our revamp with a new Steam-inspired review system (mouse-over covers to see current ratings), have launched two new novels the past week, and will be launching the remaining four Korean novels at the rate of one each day, starting tomorrow. &nbsp;Read on!</p>

 <p>Kang Chul-In got the hundred thousand dollars by using all means. Aside from the 20,000$ he had borrowed from the bank, the interest for all the rest was 34.9% annually (or even more), but Kang Chul-In was not afraid of the interest. It was a recklessness stemming from confidence.</p>
 <p>“Here is the upfront payment of 20,000. I put in 5,000 more so that you can eat a meal with your subordinates.”</p>
 <p>As promised, Kang Chul-In, who had come to Park Doo-Sik’s office, placed 20,000 in cash on top of a desk and signed the contract.</p>
 <p>“You didn’t have to do this much, haha!”</p>
 <p>Park Doo-Sik, who was on the fence about trusting Kang Chul-In for the last three days, rubbed his hands together, smiling when he saw Kang Chul-In and his spendthrift attitude.</p>
 <p>“Report to me if you have anything.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, boss.”</p>
 <p>“Oh, and…”</p>
 <p>“Yes?”</p>
 <p>“Can you get me a car?”</p>
 <p>“A car, sir?”</p>
 <p>“From what I know, you guys do some used car dealings as well?”</p>
 <p>“Ah, that. I don’t exactly have enough reputation to deal used cars because as you know, we are small, but I can ask around for you.”</p>
 <p>After hearing what Park Doo-Sik had to say, Kang Chul-In thought for a while and spoke.</p>
 <p>“Can you find a car that I can have starting tonight? Rent, lease, used, it doesn’t matter. I’ll need it for 3 months at most anyways.”</p>
 <p>He did need a car.</p>
 <p>He was an Overlord, after all, and it was unfitting of someone of his status to ride something “lowly” like a bus or a train.</p>
 <p>“What kind of car?”</p>
 <p>“A coupe.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In answered.</p>
 <p>“I would like a Chevrolet Corvette or Ford Mustang. The gas price doesn’t matter either. Again, I won’t be using it for long.”</p>
 <p>Because his budget was limited right now, he had to make do with cars like Corvettes and Mustangs.</p>
 <p>“I will look for one right away.”</p>
 <p>Park Du-Sik took his smartphone out right away and spoke on the phone for about 10 minutes.</p>
 <p>“They will bring a Mustang right away. It is a rental, but they need a down payment of about 10% because it is a foreign car.”</p>
 <p>“Hey, you.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In called Oh Gwang-Pil upon hearing about the down payment.</p>
 <p>“Yes, yes?”</p>
 <p>Oh Gwang-Pil, who almost had his chin broken by Kang Chul-In, hesitated and headed towards him with a slightly frightened expression.</p>
 <p>“Don’t be scared. I don’t bite.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, yes. Thank you!”</p>
 <p>“Go get my money. The password is 4581.”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In handed Oh Gwang-Pil his card.</p>
 <p>“H-how much do I withdraw?”</p>
 <p>Oh Gwang-Pil asked, relieved that Kang Chul-In would not hit him.</p>
 <p>“Two.”</p>
 <p>“Two dollars?”</p>
 <p>Oh Kwang-Pil made a stupid expression.</p>
 <p>“Doo-Sik, right?”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In looked to Park Doo-Sik.</p>
 <p>“Are all your guys like this?”</p>
 <p>“I-I’m sorry.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Park Doo-Sik’s face was red as he bowed his head in embarrassment.</p>
 <p>“Hey, you stupid idiot!”</p>
 <p>Park Du-Sik roared as he kicked Oh Gwang-Pil’s large bottom.</p>
 <p>“Urgh!”</p>
 <p>“Why are you still here! Go bring the money!”</p>
 <p>“I-it’s the amount…”</p>
 <p>“You think the big boss would ask you to withdraw 2 dollars? Huh? You stupid idiot!”</p>
 <p>Park Doo-Sik had begun to call Kang Chul-In big boss.</p>
 <p>“I-I will go right away!”</p>
 <p>Oh Gwang-Pil left the office like a boar that had been burnt after being slapped multiple times. In a social setting as well as in a gang, it was tiring to deal with those who don’t have any sense.</p>
 <p>“10%. If it is a Mustang, the down payment would probably be about 8-9000, and the monthly rate would be right under 1000?”</p>
 <p>“Yes, boss. It probably will be around that much.”</p>
 <p>“You take care of the insurance and stuff as well, and then with the rest, split it in half with the one bringing the car and yourself.”</p>
 <p>“R-really?”</p>
 <p>Park Doo-Sik’s eyes widened. Who would have thought that Kang Chul-In would be this generous?</p>
 <p>“Don’t make me say it twice.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, boss!”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In ended his deal with Park Doo-Sik with that.</p>
 <p><em>Kwak Jung…this is the end, I will have to find you. If we have fate together, I guess we’ll meet.</em></p>
 <p>Of course, even if it wasn’t meant to be, he did not have any intentions of giving up on Kwak Jung either.</p>
 <p>If it wasn’t meant to be?</p>
 <p>You can make it meant to be.</p>
 <p>He was going to use any means necessary to have Kwak Jung work under him. That was the style and way of the Overlord Kang Chul-In.</p>
 <p>“Then, report to me once every two weeks. I will see you after three months.”</p>
 <p>“Yes, boss. Drive carefully!”</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In left Park Doo-Sik’s office in his Mustang.</p>
 <p>The Mustang, a symbol of the American muscle car with a V8 engine, seemed to flaunt its power as the engine revved.</p>
 <p><em>Not bad.</em></p>
 <p>Although it could not give him the satisfaction of the Bugatti Veyron that he rode in his past life, the American muscle car had its charms.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In, who had inquired about the whereabouts of Kwak Jung to Park Doo-Sik and his gang, focused only on exercise and working out as he waited for the Great Summoning.</p>
 <p>Pangaea was a land where dangerous monsters roamed all around, and to survive in such a place, it was necessary to build his body.</p>
 <p>And like that, two months passed, and it was December 24th, 2020, one day before the Great Summoning. Kang Chul-In went to bed that night calm and composed. “Calling”, the dream that will lead everyone to Pangaea, would come to him when he fell asleep.</p>
 <p><em>Father…</em></p>
 <p>Just before he fell asleep, Kang Chul-In thought of his father who had passed away.</p>
 <p>Usually, the person that he trusted most would appear in the “calling”, whether it was a god or human. In Kang Chul-In’s case, his late father had appeared and led him to the landmark. Perhaps, his late father would appear in his dream again after he fell asleep. As he was thinking so, his eyes slowly closed.</p>
 <p><em>I don’t have to say anything, right?</em></p>
 <p>Surprisingly, it was not his father who had appeared in the “calling”.</p>
 <p><em>I’ll just be tired if I say it. Do it well.</em></p>
 <p>It was himself, the Overlord Kang Chul-In, fully equipped with the epic items “Vali’s Burning Vengeance Armor Set” and the sword Fragarach.</p>
 <p>“I really do all sorts of things.”</p>
 <p>The present Kang Chul-In snorted.</p>
 <p>The one he trusted and believed in the most was himself. It was funny.</p>
 <p>“You will not fail this time?”</p>
 <p>The past Kang Chul-In asked.</p>
 <p>“Of course not.”</p>
 <p>The present Kang Chul-In answered with a faint smile.</p>
 <p>There is no such thing as two failures.</p>
 <p>If he fails again after returning, he would be nothing more but the most useless Lord throughout history.</p>
 <p>The next morning.</p>
 <p>30 thousand people from around the world and future travelers to a different dimension began to search for their landmarks.</p>
 <p>This would be a silent change.</p>
 <p>The superpower nations that surveilled the entire world through satellites, as well as the Echelon Network (A surveillance system that wiretaps the entire world under the control of England and the United States), would also not recognize the signs of the impending Great Summoning.</p>
 <p>Only Kang Chul-In could see what was to come.</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In, after waking up, got in his Mustang and headed towards the 63 building, one of Seoul’s landmarks. He could have looked for other landmarks, but he went to the 63 building in case of any random variables. Like the butterfly effect, a small insignificant thing could twist the determined future. Thus, he did not want the misfortune of not getting his Lord class because he had gone to a different landmark than in his previous life.</p>
 <p>(The 63 building is called as such because it has 63 floors)</p>
 <p>Kang Chul-In paced around in front of the 63 Building solemnly and waited for the Great Summoning.</p>
 <p>5 minutes… 4 minutes…1 minute.</p>
 <p>As it grew closer to 10 in the morning, the clear skies began to fill with storm clouds.</p>
 <p><em>Flash!</em></p>
 <p>There was a flash of light as lightning fell from the sky.</p>
 <p><em>BANG!</em></p>
 <p>And there followed the thunder that seemed to rip one’s ears and shook the earth.</p>
 <p>And then….</p>
 <p>From the sky, a golden beam of light fell and shone on Kang Chul-In and a few others.</p>
 <p><em>It’s coming!</em></p>
 <p>Compared to the others who were screaming or falling to the ground, Kang Chul-In received the light calmly.</p>
 <p>There was no reason to be surprised.</p>
 <p>He had already experienced the Great Summoning before and had already risen to the status of Overlord once, so it didn’t make sense for him to crumble without dignity.</p>
 <p><em>Swish!!</em></p>
 <p>Those who were hit by the golden light disintegrated into particles and disappeared like smoke. Kang Chul-In was no exception. He also disintegrated into particles and disappeared. It was the entrance to Pangaea, the Great Summoning.</p>
 <p>Shortly after, in Kang Chul-In’s line of vision, a message popped up.</p>
 <p>[Welcome to Pangaea]</p>
 <p>And the next message…</p>
 <p>[Congratulations! You have been appointed as the class: Lord]</p>
 <p>It was as expected.</p>
