 <p><span style>Chapter 239</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘An A-grade quest was surprisingly tough.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s power was unique: ever since he had obtained it, he had almost easily solved all A-grade quests.&nbsp;</span><span style>But this time was different. He lost more than one-sixth of his stamina and health at the cost of hunting 25 enemies. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was an unexpected melee.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anybody who heard that statement would cry out, as there was no such thing. It was more accurate to say that it was a slaughter of 25 people without a conscience.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid thought differently. This was shocking for him, the one who had overwhelmed the top rankers in the National Competition!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The average level of the enemy was only around 200. Yet I couldn’t succeed in an instant...’&nbsp;</span><span style>This was because Veradin was a necromancer.&nbsp;</span><span style>'That bastard was too strong.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A necromancer was a nuisance as an opponent. They didn’t distinguish between friend or foe, as corpses were unconditionally revived and used as soldiers. It was a class that consumed the enemy’s resources (health, mana, stamina etc.) because it was so easy to make.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the case of Veradin, his level was high and knew how to fight. The undead soldiers were skilled in offense and defense, so they harassed him. Veradin’s combat ability was no less than that of the Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It would be nice to create an item that could easily kill the undead.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, experience was very important.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid gained insight from his new combat experience. He was able to make more advanced plans by adding items to fight the undead in the future. Grid was quickly evolving in real time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He touched the Guardian’s Bracelet with a gentle expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'The more I use this, the more I like it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, Grid’s indomitable stat was 900. Now, however, it was over 1,000 after wearing the Guardian accessories set. As a result, the effect of the indomitable stat was often triggered.&nbsp;</span><span style>He completely resisted the attacks of lower-levelled enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the result of his abnormally high defense and indomitable stat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Randy was more than I expected.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had no doubts about Randy’s fighting skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>Randy copied 30% Grid’s stats and items, so he was around a level 180 swordsman.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the legendary-rated Pagma’s Swordsmanship gave Randy wings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Randy copied Pinnacle and Link, as well as the highly usable Revolve.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was able to beat quite a few level 200 users, and was a really good colleague.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid praised him as Randy returned to the shape of a little girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You fought well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Randy’s buggy eyes shone like stars.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Praise! Happy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a lovely smiling face with a flush.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Sehee was once cute like this.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid patted her head and said,</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I also want to fight with Master! Nyang! Why don’t you let me fight? Nyang! Why is the best demonic beast being treated like this? Kyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe had been hunting alone around Reidan and was now level 143.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He was hoping to grow with his master while traveling together this time, but Master was too busy with the doppelganger and not looking at Noe. He didn’t like it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid soothed the jealous Noe,&nbsp;</span><span style>"You are my precious secret weapon. I don’t need to borrow the strength of my great secret weapon for something minor like this."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh...! Ohhhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The words ‘secret weapon’, ‘precious’ and ‘great’ were attached to him, so Noe really liked it. He danced with his short limbs. It was cute and ridiculous since Noe’s chubby body was shaking.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid observed Noe’s appearance. The horns that rose from the forehead were slightly bigger and the fangs were sharper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He is becoming increasingly like a demonic beast.’&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s demonic power rose by one every time he PKed.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘Surely I won’t become a demon if my demonic power stat increases?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The higher the demonic power, the more likely he was to go to hell. However, at present, there was no way of going in and out of hell so he couldn’t help imagining bad things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the Ul Clan survivors came running.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hero!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The village mayor, Buda greeted him on behalf of everyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you didn’t help us, our people would’ve been lost in the backdrops of history! I don’t know how to express our gratitude!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The quest ‘Ul Clan’s Rescue’ has been complete.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Affinity with the Ul Clan has risen to the maximum. The Ul Clan will jump over a cliff for you.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ul Clan bowed to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid took out the Great Lord's Sword and looked at their abilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Their intelligence stat is very high?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>General NPCs had an intelligence around 100. But the average of the Ul Clan was 300. In particular, a girl called Hwarin stood out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Hwarin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Age: 11 &nbsp;Gender: Female</span></p>
 <p><span style>Occupation: Refugee</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: Last of the Ul Clan’s Royal Family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level: 7</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strength: 3/70 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 12/249</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agility: 14/398 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligence: 120/1,890</span></p>
 <p><span style>Charm: 155/1,503 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dignity: 30/550</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skills: Haven’t learnt any yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A survivor of the Ul Kingdom that the Saharan Empire destroyed. Her identity might be hidden but she actually has the noble lineage of the Ul Clan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ul Clan was an excellent race. They would be useful in many ways. Among them, it was possible to train some as magicians.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid asked them,&nbsp;</span><span style>“The empire isn’t a place where you can live. Would you consider moving to the Eternal Kingdom?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The Eternal Kingdom...?”&nbsp;</span><span style>The Eternal Kingdom was one of the great powers among the 17 nations of the continent. But these kingdoms weren’t in the same position as the empire.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Will the Eternal Kingdom accept us, who are hunted by the empire? It might provide grounds for the empire to...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you move in secret then the empire won’t notice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But the royal family won’t be happy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, go to Reidan. Even the royal family can’t intervene in the administration of a duchy."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am the master of Reidan. I promise the people there will treat you without discrimination.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok...! That means you are a duke!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ul Clan were perplexed. Why was the duke of another kingdom in the empire? They couldn’t understand it with their common sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid whispered to Lauel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I need someone who can lead 930 people from Earl Zebra’s territory in the empire to Reidan.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-Yes?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid explained the situation to the confused Lauel. The joyful Lauel then recommended Faker.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid responded with surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Faker?</span></i> <i><span style>Is it okay?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Faker always moved in the darkness. He didn’t show himself in public, and wasn’t a suitable figure to lead people.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Lauel gave a different opinion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Faker’s trap installation ability and situational judgment abilities are unique.</span></i> <i><span style>If there are pursuers, he can install traps as quickly as possible as well as secretly lead the Ul Clan.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I know his abilities but...</span></i> <i><span style>Isn’t there someone better than Faker?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>There is a lot of work piled up in Reidan.</span></i> <i><span style>It is impossible to send more than two people, so please trust Faker.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was decided.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then &nbsp;Grid used a skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Summon Knight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Summon a knight. Currently you have Huroi, Lauel, Jude, Jishuka, Euphemina, Faker, Pon and Regas. Which knight would you like to summon?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Faker.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The target has accepted the summons.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sururuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A man wrapped in a black cloak rose from Grid’s shadow.&nbsp;</span><span style>He spoke to Grid with a nonchalant expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You worked hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Faker observed the Ul Clan with emotional eyes. The Ul Clan felt like crying as they saw him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Those eyes feel like they are penetrating me to the bone.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I-I’m scared.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ul Clan felt fear. They were affected by Faker’s killing intent stat.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s why Faker normally acted in secret. He had to consume his mental power to hide this killing intent. For an assassin, the killing intent stat was like a type of penalty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faker didn’t delay. He instructed the frightened Ul Clan to grab their luggage and immediately left the village.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a few days with Faker, the Ul Clan felt like they were sitting on a thorny cushion. Faker didn’t say a single word, but they became increasingly frightened of him. They felt like they would die if they touched him, and couldn’t even breathe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Grid changed his schedule and was busy hunting. It was an inevitable choice because his infamy went up due to PKing. It was impossible to enter a village or city if his infamy figure was high. It might be okay to move freely in the Eternal Kingdom, regardless of his infamy figure, but this was the empire. It was necessary to lower his infamy by hunting monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the monsters in Zebra were only level 180~220. They gave less experience and it wasn’t easy to decrease his infamy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was nervous because he was delaying more than he wanted, but he still remained calm.&nbsp;</span><span style>He bought time by practicing dual swordsmanship and raising the experience of Randy and Noe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then a homing pigeon arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the letter from Irene that regularly arrived once a week. Normally the letters expressed a desire to see him, but today’s one was special.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This letter?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene was always stating that she wanted to get pregnant, but he didn’t think it was really capable to get pregnant from a relationship between a user and NPC.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Around a month ago, my stomach has started hurting.</span></i> <i><span style>I didn’t think much of it, but then I started experiencing pregnancy symptoms.</span></i> <i><span style>Somehow, I feel like my belly has...</span></i> <i><span style>Happy tears are flowing.</span></i> <i><span style>I would like to have a son that resembles Dear Husband.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A child?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was more baffled than glad. It was confusing because it was a totally unexpected an unfamiliar experience.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then a notification window popped up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Do you want to honor the news of your wife’s pregnancy?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The birth of a new life should be congratulated, but those with no sense of responsibility should keep in mind that they don’t deserve to be a parent. Think carefully.]</span></p>
