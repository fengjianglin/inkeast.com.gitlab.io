 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>A rare item didn’t seem that great, but I just nodded because I didn’t want to nitpick.&nbsp;</span><span style>Steng laughed, put his sword away, and sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hah~ when will us users be able to submit our own items to the lady’s auction?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I felt it from the beginning, but there was something strange about the conversation.&nbsp;</span><span style>I had to ask Steng in order to correct the misguided conversation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"So...the reason you’re here right now isn’t to put an item you created up for auction? You’re doing a quest to place your master’s item up for auction?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Steng smiled and replied.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Of course. Even the number one blacksmith, Panmir, can’t create items that can be shown at auction, so how could I?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Can you share the quest information?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? Why?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, I just wanted to check.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure. It isn’t a secret, so I’ll show you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The player ‘Steng’ wants to share the quest information. Would you like to accept?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>I accepted and the quest information appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Teacher’s Errand]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Difficulty: C.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This is the first auction that will be held after the appointment of the new lady of Winston.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blacksmith Razvan will use this auction as an opportunity to show his skills to the lady of Winston and to get a foothold in Winston.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So he gave you, his disciple, an errand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Conditions: Submit Razvan’s work to the lady of Winston’s auction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Reward: 20 gold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* If Razvan’s work is successfully bid on at the auction, he will give you a new production method...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>I forgot, but general blacksmith users often had NPC blacksmiths as a teacher.&nbsp;</span><span style>By steadily carrying out the quests given to them by their teacher, they could raise the level of their blacksmith skills and gain new production methods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was fortunate that Khan gave me production methods without any conditions.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I’m certain of it after seeing this quest information.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The users didn’t come here to submit their works to the auction. They were running errands for their teachers, just like Steng.&nbsp;</span><span style>As Steng said, it was impossible for the present production class users to produce outstanding items that would satisfy the lady and knights of Winston.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I could see it clearly. The difference between me and a general user was huge.&nbsp;</span><span style>I didn’t feel much inspiration when I made an epic rated item, but ordinary users were just happy at making rare grade items.&nbsp;</span><span style>I was desperately happy as I realized the greatness of a legendary profession.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you don’t mind, can I look at your teacher’s item?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Steng asked me with a passionate gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I refused him. It felt like something troublesome would happen.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I don’t want to do that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Steng felt regret.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I see. Then it can’t be helped. By the way, it’s amazing. Your teacher didn’t set a bid price...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. Do you happen to know the average price for armor and gauntlets with a level limit of 120?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Even if the items are the same level, the options are different. Well, normal armor is 300 gold and gauntlets are 100 gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Epic rating?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow! Did you master make epic items? Making epic items is really uncommon!”&nbsp;</span><span style>Steng admired it before kindly giving me an answer.&nbsp;</span><span style>"The price of epic items vary depending on the options, but shouldn’t the armor be a minimum of 1,800 gold and the gauntlets 600 gold?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>100 gold was 120,000 won.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, if the Very Delicate Plate Armor and Seemingly Plain Gauntlets were sold at 1,800 gold and 600 gold respectively, I would earn 2.88 million won.&nbsp;</span><span style>Only seven days after starting work in the capsule room, a huge amount of money was entering my hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No, no. If I deduct the materials cost and capsule room fee, the net profit is around 2 million won.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyway, I was satisfied.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yes, let’s not cling to unique or legendary items.&nbsp;</span><span style>If I make two epic items a week, I could earn 8 million won in a month!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can pay off the debt soon!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I had a total debt of 10 million won.&nbsp;</span><span style>After obtaining a legendary class in Satisfy, it seemed like this debt of 10 million won wasn’t very big, but it was a huge burden to me a few months ago.&nbsp;</span><span style>I also had to pay the interest on the loan, so I hadn’t made a dent in repaying it.&nbsp;</span><span style>I was able to somehow manage with the labor jobs, but now...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Anyway!&nbsp;</span><span style>I would finally be able to live a debt-free life.&nbsp;</span><span style>My fear towards the employees from Mother's Heart is Happy would disappear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kukukuku...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A debt-free life!&nbsp;</span><span style>I imagined a dignified life and couldn’t suppress the laughter.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then I suddenly met Steng’s eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Steng’s complexion turned blue after he witnessed me laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>...I had felt it in the past, but my smile was really the worst.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Children cried when I smiled. People started swearing instantly when I smiled. People took money out of my pocket when I smiled. People bought me cigarettes when I smiled. Women were unhappy when I smiled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘After I pay off my debt, I should get plastic surgery...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was seriously distressed about this as I set the minimum bid based on the price Steng told me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have set the minimum bid price for the Very Delicate Plate Armor at 1,800 gold. Is this correct?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have set a minimum bid price for the Seemingly Plain Gauntlets at 600 gold. Is this correct?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The items have successfully been registered at the auction.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone finished registering their items.&nbsp;</span><span style>The auctioneer confirmed it and showed us to the waiting room.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a large tiger leather rug on the floor and ornaments made of gold and silver on the shelves. The chandelier sparkled.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an incredibly luxurious place for common people like me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'How extravagant would the lady’s room be?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As I was stunned by the wealth that nobility possessed, Steng came up to me and spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You can’t pick up the ornaments over there. I’ve been involved in a lot of auctions while running errands for my teacher, and there are always people who try to steal things from the castle. They were discovered and punished... Grid should be careful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, I understand...I won’t. Hey, wait! Do you think I am a thief? Anyone would feel bad when hearing it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“S-Sorry.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Steng quickly apologized and stepped away from me. However, he continued glancing at me.&nbsp;</span><span style>He seemed to suspect that I would steal something. I showed him a laugh and was branded as a criminal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Sigh, that bastard. He has a discerning eye.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I had to give up on stealing. I only wanted to take one candlestick, but it couldn’t be helped while he was watching.&nbsp;</span><span style>I sat on the couch in anticipation of the results that would appear in three hours and decided to take a nap.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Irene was Winston’s new lady and the only daughter of Earl Steim. She currently only had the title of an Earl, but she would become an Earl later on.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, she was the next successor to Earl Steim and the one who would be a peak figure in the north.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, her knights had a sense of burden and responsibility that other people couldn’t imagine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'We have to be the best knights for Lady Irene.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene’s knights didn’t neglect training their minds and bodies. But there was a limit to the body and talents. Therefore, they coveted powerful equipment that would make up for any lacking parts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The auction held today in Winston was very disappointing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is nothing good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Winston had become a big city due to breakthroughs in the north. However, it was still lacking compared to Frontier.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the same for the abilities of the technicians.&nbsp;</span><span style>The accessories, clothes and armor shown at the auction were all inferior.&nbsp;</span><span style>Some technicians submitted good items, but it wasn’t enough for the knights. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Two hours had passed since the auction started, but there hadn’t been a single bidder on any of the items so far.&nbsp;</span><span style>In this disappointed atmosphere, the auctioneer smiled widely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You should pay attention to these items.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the armor and gauntlets were revealed, the sleepy-looking knights burst out with excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How great!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is difficult to find such armor in Frontier.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The knights examined the armor and gauntlets closely before asking the auctioneer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who was the blacksmith that made this? Is it the rumoured Khan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan was a blacksmith who was somewhat renowned in Frontier. The knights guessed that Khan was the one who made the armor and gauntlets.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the auctioneer gave an interesting answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not exactly. They were made by Khan’s successor. He is revered by the residents of Winston and is one of the three heroes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoh... The rumoured righteous blacksmith?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The knights smiled warmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is such a great person here in Winston. A person with an exemplary personality and excellent skills... He will be one of the talented people working for Irene one day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Its value is much higher. I will bid 2,000 gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You are only giving 2,000 gold? Your eyes are terrible! I will bid 2,500 gold!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“2,800!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why are you trying to take something that I saw first? I will bid 3,000 gold, so everyone give up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Steim was considered one of the wealthiest nobles in the Eternal Kingdom. Therefore, the knights of the family were paid a huge salary.&nbsp;</span><span style>The knights were overflowing with money, so the bid prices of the armor and gauntlets made by Grid skyrocketed.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Mister Grid. Mister Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Uhh... what? Was it time to go to the labor office?&nbsp;</span><span style>I slept without knowing anything about the world and woke up due to someone shaking me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mister Grid, the auction has ended.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right. This place wasn’t my house.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is... It has already been a week since I quit the labor jobs, but I’m still worried about needing to go...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I wanted to quickly escape from the trauma of the labor jobs, so I quickly left the waiting room with Steng. Then I headed to the lobby where the auctioneer was waiting.&nbsp;</span><span style>The auction manager confirmed the number of people and said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There was a total of six items auctioned off at this auction.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd was shaken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Only six? I put up seven items alone...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Weren’t there over 100 entries? Yet only six succeeded?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was ominous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What if my items weren’t won? Did I set the minimum bid too high? If I knew this, I would’ve set it at a cheaper price.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As I was feeling troubled, the auctioneer called out the list of items that had been sold.</span></p>
