 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwuong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dust rose as Grid crashed into the ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was relatively fine. No, his health wasn’t very good, but he was relatively rosy. The wounds on his body were fairly recovered.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was thanks to recovering 13,000 health after wearing Doran’s Ring as well as utilizing the option effect of the Holy Light Armor the moment he got kicked at close range.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Grid wasn’t satisfied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It would’ve been better if I took advantage of it when it was a sword attack, not a kick.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His health would’ve been three times higher than it was now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t that right? Yakult.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[...]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iyarugt was silent despite being called Yakult.&nbsp;</span><span style>He felt bad that he couldn’t read Kraugel’s sword orbit and caused Grid to fall into an awful position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was the same when I fought Piaro and Chucksley. You seem to have no use.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[That...! It’s because most of my original abilities are sealed! If I could really demonstrate my abilities, these guys would be nothing!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Well, let’s say that is true.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, Iyarugt’s rating was unique. It would be more help once the rating was increased to legendary.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The center of the depressed ground.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid, who was deeply embedded in it, slowly raised his body.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t meant to be, but this break away from the battle was very important.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s head calmed and prevailed over his frustration. He suppressed his extreme idea of relying on his immortality.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid would use this incident to further strengthen himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Did I use Blackening too soon?'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blackening consumed 50% of his maximum health to increase his damage, magic power and agility by 20%.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a double edged sword because he could suffer catastrophic damage if hit by the enemy. Just like before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I used it when things were more conclusive... No, it’s better to use it than to save it. I wouldn’t be able to threaten him if I didn’t use Blackening.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The difference in skills was too great.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel could avoid most non-targeted skill and find the perfect opportunity to counterattack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Based on his attack speed and attack power, there surprisingly isn’t much difference between our stats.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the part he was most curious about.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had went through the minus levels, received all types of titles, and steadily raised his stats through making items.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was right that he would have more stats than anyone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Kraugel’s stats were also unbelievable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Isn’t it natural?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 1st ranked Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was ahead of everyone else, and gained a lot of advantages from this.&nbsp;</span><span style>He gobbled up the useful quests and titles, so his stats were likely to have significant growth. He probably also did separate training.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘When I was level 80...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, it was before he became Pagma's Descendant.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘At that time, Kraugel had already crossed level 240.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was correct that there was a gap between both of them that couldn’t be narrowed yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘At least, I think he’s ahead of me in combat related skills.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel was equipped with the appropriate items.&nbsp;</span><span style>His defense wasn’t great, but his weapon was enormous. It was comparable to the legendary weapons produced by Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...In many ways, I still have a long way to go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was he going to lose?&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment that thought ran through his head.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaduduk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s face distorted in a frightening manner.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past, he had lived as a loser due to his lacking talent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Let’s stop losing now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Didn’t he overcome a lacking talent with effort?&nbsp;</span><span style>Some people might think it was ridiculous, but Grid was most aware of it.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was able to become Pagma’s Descendant due to his own efforts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I want to win.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was praised as the sky above the sky, and an object of envy for rankers.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid wanted to wash away the stigma of the past and start a new stage by winning against him. He wanted to be recognized as a true talent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to do that, he needed to put in more effort.&nbsp;</span><span style>As much as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is the second round.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Grid’s Boots have been removed. Movement speed and evasion rate have been restored to normal.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was his first mistake.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s Boots were designed to boost the power of a greatsword, but it was poison when used with the one-handed Iyarugt. The slowness and lowered evasion rate weren’t taken into consideration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Braham’s Boots have been equipped. Movement speed has increased by 10%. Skill cooldown time will be reduced by 20%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham’s Boots were limited in defense, but they had excellent options.&nbsp;</span><span style>Indeed, it was an item from a legendary great magician.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t sell them and used them steadily for a reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The spell ‘Fly’ has been used.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid flew up.&nbsp;</span><span style>The lightness wasn’t comparable to before.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Pant... Pant... What?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the top of the pit in the training ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel was gasping for breath when his eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because he saw through the smoke, Grid flying up while looking fine.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is he a human?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had to question it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Sword Saint Candidate Stage 5,’ ‘Virtuous Man of the West Continent,’ ‘Pandea’s Hero,’ ‘Person who Creates Miracles,’ ‘First…,’ ‘First…,’ ‘First…,’ ‘First...’ </span></p>
 <p><span style>The value of all the titles that Kraugel obtained couldn’t be converted into money.&nbsp;</span><span style>His attack power was unmatched and users couldn’t endure it.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid endured it again and again.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now his health had recovered like a lie, and his momentum had risen even more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In Kraugel’s eyes, Grid was like a boss monster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He was once a subject of ridicule, but he’s truly a legend.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel also had eyes and ears.&nbsp;</span><span style>The owner of a legendary class with poor control skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>A coward who overcame his shortcomings with items and his class.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now he was an overgeared person with some ability.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel was knowledgeable about Grid. In fact, he watched the video of the pope candidate speeches.&nbsp;</span><span style>But now he realized.&nbsp;</span><span style>Everyone was always growing, and Grid was the same.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had grown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The proof was that he was one of the few players who managed to hurt Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You aren’t slow-witted.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid put in more effort than other people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'In the first place, he wouldn’t have become a legend if he didn’t work hard.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel admitted it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was a great person. He shouldn’t be taunted by anyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will sincerely pay my respects to my opponent. Meteor Sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel used the skill that had been cancelled because of Blood Cry.&nbsp;</span><span style>Qi energy filled the atmosphere like meteors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel rose steadily while Grid started his sword dance.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was as Kraugel expected.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was a character with legendary items and skills, so he would be more confident in them than in anything else. It was obvious that he would confront Meteor Sword head on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘That’s your mistake.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meteor Sword was a multi-stage skill. It cut several times in a short period and every time it hit, the damage increased. This could cause terrible damage when facing it head on.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel was confident, but Grid made a choice that was contrary to Kraugel’s prediction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Transcend.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The flow of air caused by Kraugel’s qi changed. Grid absorbed the transcendent energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The second mistake.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was trying to face someone with better control skills than him head on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Entering the transcendent mode.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your attack power is doubled and your default attacks will turn into ranged attacks. This effect will last for 30 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Utilizing the advantage of Fly, Grid floated in the air and opened up a distance from Kraugel. At the same time, the energy blades shot forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 10,700 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meteor Sword’s course was simple. This was the limit of a targeted skill, which resulted in a restriction of Kraugel’s control skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel was hit by a black energy blade and blood poured from his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Change the route...!’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel fell to the ground and got straight up.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were three energy blades already heading towards him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel rolled on the ground and used a skill.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A white cloud spread from White Fang and covered the area.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a trick to hide Kraugel’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it was useless.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had a combination of high insight and the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t detect Kraugel’s sword, but he wasn’t completely helpless.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid ‘quickly’ grasped Kraugel’s location within the clouds. It was proof of how high Grid’s present concentrating was.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Sharp energy blades flooded towards Kraugel every time Grid swung his sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel, who was hoping to avoid the incessant energy blades, allowed another attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Kuk... Is this different from the skill called Transcended Link?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t use Transcend in the two broadcasts Kraugel had watched. The only ranged attack he used was Transcended Link.&nbsp;</span><span style>The difference between the one-time Transcended Link and the persistent Transcend made Kraugel feel baffled.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A heavy rain of energy blades poured down from the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel used his power to avoid it and eventually regained his composure. He was truly a genius who adapted to the speed and trajectory of the energy blades.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shortly afterwards, the heavy rain of energy blades stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The duration of the skill is over.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel determined and jump up towards Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>A wicked smile appeared on Grid’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fake.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The duration of Transcend was 30 seconds. There was still five seconds remaining.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid once again fired energy blades at Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unlike the ground, there was a limit to moving in the air, so Grid believed that Kraugel wouldn’t be able to avoid the attack.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Kraugel changed the trajectory of his body using the back of White Fang. It wasn’t like Grid’s flying magic, but he seemed like he was flying through the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Dodge it!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid felt shocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haaap!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel moved through the air and reached Grid, swinging White Fang.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s chest was badly cut.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel heard Grid speak the moment he was able to link the next attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The third mistake...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>God Hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He reproduced his hands, but so far he only used it for Magic Missile or wielding weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style>Indeed, it was the worst mistake.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Deopsseok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel got goosebumps.&nbsp;</span><span style>The swordsmanship was pathetic, but the four golden hands had far superior movement speed.&nbsp;</span><span style>They flew over and held onto his wrists and ankles.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was easily caught by the hands.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel tried to quickly remove them, but a gap was shown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t miss that gap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Linked Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Super Sensitivity!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The cooldown time of Super Sensitivity still isn’t over.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the excellent use of skills was recognized as part of one’s abilities, making use of good items was also a part of their abilities.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid climbed the cliff persistently, despite being frustrated by his poor talent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He defeated the ‘sky above the sky’ that even famous rankers couldn’t reach.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members, who belatedly arrived, witnessed the scene and couldn’t close their mouths.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Lord’s eyes were shining like jewels as he was held in Ruby’s arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Steim.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the moment when the perception that ‘Father is the best’ was stamped on the future absolute power.&nbsp;</span></p>
