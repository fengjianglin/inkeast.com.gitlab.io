 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Yubadakan was one of the most developed cities in the Harken Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to the enormous capital and the ability of competent politicians, the population exceeded 70,000.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were many hunting grounds, so there was a high floating population. The city markets were always crowded. Thanks to that, the economic growth was constant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The owner of this rich city who would gather more than 1.5 million gold each month?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a user, not an NPC.&nbsp;</span><span style>The user was Zibal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kukukul! You looked down on Grid, so aren’t you funny now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yubadakan Castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asuka, the 12th executive of the Snake Guild, sneered.&nbsp;</span><span style>"You laughed when Black Teddy and I were defeated by him, but what about you? It was very fun watching your drake be beaten by a cat! Kukuku!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately after the Pope Drevigo raid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asuka was a member of the Tzedakah Guild at the time and fought Grid with Black Teddy, Box and Toban, and was badly defeated.&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to that incident, Zibal kept making fun of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But what now?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid wasn’t an existence that could be ignored. Zibal was also hurt by him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asuka felt good.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was like 10 years was taken off of her.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asuka couldn’t stop laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How do you feel being beaten by someone you ignored? Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Asuka, act more moderately...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment that Box tried to restrain Asuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Zibal respectfully apologized to Asuka.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I underestimated Grid. I’m really sorry for making fun of you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asuka wasn’t a narrow-minded person.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was satisfied with Zibal acknowledging his error and bowing to her in front of the 13 executives.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Well, okay. I will be generous and understand your ignorance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, the atmosphere calmed down.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the expressions of the executives still wasn’t good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master. Public opinion about you has been the worst since the National Competition.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You are the face of the Snake Guild. Your reputation falling means that the reputation of the guild falls. For the moment, you should focus on recovering your image.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I would rather you get your third advancement class. It’s imperative that you narrow the gap with Kraugel and Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Did I hear that you failed to invite Hurent and Lauel? It’s a top priority to replace them with other talented people.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Contact Katz. He changed after being defeated by Bondre a few months ago, so wouldn’t he have definitely grown?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We need to boost the morale of the guild after they saw the strength of the Tzedakah Guild... The guild members depend not on us executives, but the guild master.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The executives discussed Zibal’s future route.&nbsp;</span><span style>They came up with ideas about what the guild master needed to do for the guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Zibal wasn’t able to concentrate on the meeting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The First National Competition ended yesterday.&nbsp;</span><span style>Zibal was going to perform brilliantly while millions of people were watching.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he had succeeded, the reputation of the Snake Guild would naturally increase and their forces would expand rapidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But that plan was in vain due to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The most brilliant performer in the National Competition was Grid, not Zibal.&nbsp;</span><span style>People’s attention were focused on the Tzedakah Guild, not the Snake Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Tzedakah Guild was now going to grow at a tremendous pace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The number of users migrating to Bairan is skyrocketing...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some of them were the talents that he wanted.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yes, like Lauel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This can’t continue.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>First of all, he needed to swallow the power of the Harken Kingdom, making it the base of his ambition to conquer the entire continent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Money, talent and military power.&nbsp;</span><span style>At first, he planned to collect the talents using money and that would pave the way for his military power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he realized something in the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>It took more than money to collect people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘...Items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s black greatsword and blue greatsword that cut down the best rankers like cream cheese.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris was defeated by Regas’ knuckles.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pon’s red spear that pushed Regas to the point of death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The enormous power of these four items couldn’t leave Zibal’s mind.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was full of a desire to have them. It was a desire that all users felt, not just him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Indeed, didn’t Lauel go to Grid after seeing his items?&nbsp;</span><span style>He wondered if all the talents would be taken away by Grid at this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the executives mentioned an interesting story to Zibal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Should we contact Panmir?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 1st ranked blacksmith, Panmir.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was originally a person that guilds actually sought after, but he was overshadowed by the emergence of Pagma’s Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve found Panmir’s location. He is staying in the city of dwarves.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dwarves...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dwarves were innate blacksmiths. They produced countless blacksmiths with outstanding talent.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were so arrogant that they ignored human blacksmiths.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Then how could Panmir stay in the city of dwarves?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The executives speculated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Panmir might be recognized by the dwarves and performing a hidden class change quest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoh...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A small number of dwarves were able to give life to items. And the species itself was capable of dealing well with gunpowder.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pagma might be the overall better blacksmith, but they surpassed Pagma in certain areas.&nbsp;</span><span style>What if Panmir inherited the talent of the dwarves?</span></p>
 <p><span style>'The only rival of Grid will be born.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had to invite him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Zibal decided and immediately got up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will go and see Panmir.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that.&nbsp;</span><span style>Zibal succeeded in inviting Panmir, and the Snake Guild grew rapidly with his help.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The Yatan Church’s Third Temple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Yatan servants gathered at the temple in the destroyed Bonkost Principality.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura was also there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Finally, the successor of Priest Malacus has been decided.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the Tzedakah Guild and Grid killed Malacus...&nbsp;</span><span style>The Yatan Church had gradually weakened because they couldn’t proceed with their religious rituals. Now a new priest was selected.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Level 420...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura was astonished as she confirmed the newly elected priest.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because the level of the new priest was 100 higher than Malacus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'A fourth advancement NPC...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the same as the Second Servant and the Third Servant.&nbsp;</span><span style>Neberius’s successor in the future was expected to be in the same class.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura was curious about the identity of the First Servant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How strong is the existence who reigns above all of them?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had never met the First Servant.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid said that he needed to receive God Yatan’s blessing for his quest, but she hadn’t been able to figure out how to help.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Second Servant, Likaos, ordered her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eighth Servant. You are still too weak to show the grandeur of God Yatan. Embark on the Path of Penance and grow.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The quest ‘Path of Penance ’ has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Path of Penance]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Difficulty Level: SS</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meet the First Servant unharmed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Conditions: ??</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Failure: ??</span></p>
 <p><span style>The description was too poor for a quest of the highest difficulty. She already had a headache.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This will be a tough quest.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But she finally met the minimum qualifications to meet the First Servant.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura was filled with tension and anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For the sake of God Yatan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Based on Satisfy’s worldview, she was an obviously evil person.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Thanks for the hard work."</span></p>
 <p><span style>S Broadcasting Station located in Ilsan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo quickly got up as soon as he finished his talk show.&nbsp;</span><span style>The main host, PDs and other staff members approached and greeted him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You did a really good job.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The broadcast turned out well thanks to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Youngwoo-ssi, I’ll see you next time. I want to treat you to a meal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Will you connect to Satisfy as soon as you go home? Please reveal your level!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy revolutionized global innovation as the first virtual reality game that surpassed existing technology. It secured over two billion users and deeply penetrated into the world economy. It had an overwhelming influence in all areas.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Korean people were extremely proud that this great work was made in South Korea.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But there was one problem.&nbsp;</span><span style>South Korea reigned as a powerhouse in games decades ago, but it was now weak.&nbsp;</span><span style>Satisfy was definitely a Korean game, but most Koreans didn’t play it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Most of the content in Satisfy was dominated by users from the US, France, Canada and China. South Korea had Yura and Peak Sword, but that wasn’t enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Korean people felt a severe thirst. Why were the Koreans showing weakness in a proud domestic game enjoyed by the world? It was painful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But not anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One month ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shin Youngwoo participated in the National Competition as a representative of South Korea, and won three gold medals with overwhelming ability. This resolved the thirst of the Korean people all at once.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo became the hero of South Korea.&nbsp;</span><span style>Any Korean person would love Youngwoo. His popularity transcended Park Jisung and Kim Yuna in the past. It was close to Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo’s appearances on TV always had unconditionally high ratings, and his CF’s caused sale volumes to rise. Therefore, Youngwoo emerged as the blue chip in broadcasting and advertising.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many broadcasters and advertisers tried to get him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Youngwoo was a very busy person.&nbsp;</span><span style>He tried to play Satisfy at least 14 hours a day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Broadcasts are hard.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order for Youngwoo to earn a large profit in Satisfy, he needed to make a level 200 item with at least a unique rating. However, he couldn’t make unique rated items whenever he wanted. Sometimes he would invest a whole week into making items and only got one epic rated item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, he could earn tens of millions of won from one broadcast and hundreds of millions of won from one CF.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Youngwoo didn’t like broadcasts and advertising.&nbsp;</span><span style>At first, he was excited about being on TV, but not anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was difficult for him to be on broadcasts because he was plain and lacked improvisation skills, while CFs required shooting the same scene many times, showing his lack of acting skills and concentration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to that, he started getting hair loss.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo would much rather play Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'It’s like living on pine needles.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the first place, it was much more profitable to invest time in Satisfy than to invest time in broadcasting.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was still profitable, even if he produced rare and epic items.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The experience of my production skills goes up.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The higher the level of the production skill, the better the items produced.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo planned to stop broadcasting and focus on Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura’s advice also played a big role in him making this decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Minimize my image consumption.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She said that his influence would decrease because he was too frequently exposed to the public.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo agreed.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the future, broadcasts and CFs would only be filmed when necessary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I hope we will shoot together next time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If I have time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo gave a vague answer to the eager PD and left the studio at a busy pace.&nbsp;</span><span style>As soon as he reached the parking lot, he got into 23 and looked in the mirror.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Phew, isn’t it better now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Youngwoo had almost no sleep and worked for the past month in order to cope with the tax bomb thrown at him.&nbsp;</span><span style>He played Satisfy 14 hours a day to make items, then he spent 6 hours doing broadcasts or advertisements. He only slept four hours a day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The stress caused by fatigue made his hair loss progress quickly, so Youngwoo was worried that he would end up like a bald Japanese youkai.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, he steadily took medicines and found a good tax accountant thanks to Yura, so he was gradually overcoming his hair loss. Hair started to appear again on the empty parts of his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Okay, sooner or later, I will be fine.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Buaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Did it notice Master’s delight. 23’s engine sounded livelier than usual.&nbsp;</span><span style>The destination was naturally his home.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three months remained until the completion of his building, so Youngwoo’s family continued staying in their original house until then.</span></p>
