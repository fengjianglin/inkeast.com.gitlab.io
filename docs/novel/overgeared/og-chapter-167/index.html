 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Exactly 24 seconds ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Damn.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid stiffened as he saw Hell Gao create dozens of black spheres in an instant.&nbsp;</span><span style>Could he withstand the huge bombardment of spheres that did 3,700~4,200 damage each?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘29, 30... Surely he doesn’t intend to throw them all at once?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The flames shot by Hell Gao were fast and explosive. If 30 spheres were fired at once, it was almost impossible for Grid to completely defend or avoid them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In the worst case, I might need to rely on my invincible passive.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought realistically and changed his mind about concentrating on defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I heard that a crisis is an opportunity.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid concentrated on the 30 fireballs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He saw a face that was a mixture between a monster and a male human face.&nbsp;</span><span style>A thick smile could be seen on Hell Gao’s bizarre face beyond the flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘That monster, he will be off guard because he’s certain that he won.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had been through countless battles and was aware of the moment of greatest weakness.&nbsp;</span><span style>He decided to boldly confront Hell Gao rather than react timidly to the current crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I assume that I can’t rely on the invincible passive, it’s wiser to fight back rather than defend.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a chance to overcome the crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his low level days, he had face the knight Leo of Winston. During his middle level period, it was Malacus and the Guardian of the Labyrinth. After that, it was Shay’s party, the pope, the Awakened Guardian of the Forest, and Neberius.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had faced all types of enemies, so his eyes sharpened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I have to take some damage.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was good if simple fog or poison fog was generated, not so good if it was an explosion. Hell Gao’s vision needed to be blocked.&nbsp;</span><span style>Therefore, he prayed while throwing Kenen’s darts and fog appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is good.’&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid smiled with satisfaction and commanded the pavranium.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘Protect me as much as possible.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The seven golden blades moved at his command. They defended as the 30 black fireballs penetrated the fog.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The golden blades showed superior mobility, but it was impossible to defend against all 30 fireballs.&nbsp;</span><span style>Some fireballs broke through the barrier of blades and hit Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 3,870 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 3,920 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have been hit by a lethal blow!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 8,100 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He used the Divine Shield to minimize damage, but the areas that could be shielded were limited and his health fell sharply.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gulp gulp.</span></i><span style> Grid hastily drank a potion and wore the Hooded Zip Up.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suuuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Hooded Zip Up perfectly reproduced the unique function of the invisibility cloaks made by the legendary tailor Kruger.&nbsp;</span><span style>As explosions occurred in rapid succession, Grid’s body became completely invisible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuahahaha! That cockroach like man has finally been turned into ashes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid equipped the Ideal Dagger and used Quick Movements to run towards Hell Gao at a fast pace.&nbsp;</span><span style>The weakened Hell Gao’s detection ability was very different from when he first appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have been detected by Hell Gao, the master of hellfire.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Stealth has been turned off.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...What!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao detected Grid once the distance was narrowed to 3m, and the stealth was released.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had already summoned the red lightning bolt to surround Failure, used Blacksmith’s Rage and hit Hell Gao’s heart with his strongest skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puoook!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 538,000 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The red lightning, Blacksmith’s Rage and the +9 Failure showed overwhelmingly dominant damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hell Gao’s health gauge, which had lost three-tenths of its health, now fell to half.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid was disappointed.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was disappointed because neither the ‘5 Joint Attacks’ skill attached to the Holy Light Gloves or Failure was activated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If both had been activated and there were 10 strikes, I could’ve killed him...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a pity, but it had already passed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was successful in approaching Hell Gao, so he shrugged his disappointment off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough! You bastard...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao suffered damage that couldn’t be overlooked anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style>His face stiffened as he sensed the danger.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chwaack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid twisted Failure that was in Hell Gao’s chest and declared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now it is your turn.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the battle continued, the cooldown time of all his skills except for Transcended Link had ended. He just used Kill, but he still had Link left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Link!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pipit!</span></i> <i><span style>Pipipipipit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid skillfully used Pagma’s Swordsmanship, and dozens of energy blades appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The level of Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Link has increased.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your damage will increase. The number of times a target is hit will increase by 5 times.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Link Lv. 3]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dazzling sword dance that is like the wings of a butterfly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deals 1,100% of your attack power to a single target.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Usage Conditions: Have a sword type weapon equipped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Mana Cost: 500</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: 100 seconds</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been five months since he killed the pope.&nbsp;</span><span style>After that, he used Link hundreds of times, and the level finally rose.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid smiled joyfully and Hell Gao’s face distorted horribly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaack!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 154,600 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao had been weakened two times, but 150,000 damage wasn’t enough to kill him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hell Gao recovered his poise and fired flames all over the place at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Where are you aiming?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid got as close to Hell Gao as possible. H</span><span style>e used Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Wave to cancel out the flames.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he subsequently used Restraint and made Hell Gao unable to do anything for three seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Looking back, the fusion of Transcended Link was only possible after Link reached level 2.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s brain rapidly spun at this moment.&nbsp;</span><span style>He stepped towards Hell Gao who was shrinking back from Restraint, and triggered two skills in succession.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Now that Link is level 3, is it possible to combine it with other techniques?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would give it a try.&nbsp;</span><span style>First, it was an attempt at fusion with the most anticipated Kill. If that didn’t work, he would try it with Wave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid started to dance and killing intent once again gathered at the end of the greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Meanwhile, Hell Gao escaped from the influence of Restraint and summoned a flame in his left hand and hot wind in his right hand, then he combined the two forces together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is a technique that I can’t stand again.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao fired the attack in a straight line.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The ground burned and the whirlwind of flames hit Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Grid’s dance finished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kill, Link.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If these skills failed to combine, Grid’s current health would fall and his invincible passive would activate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Please...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was less than a second.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid hoped that the fusion of Kill and Link would be successful, and Hell Gao hoped that Grid would die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s Failure collided with the whirlwind of flames.&nbsp;</span><span style>The flames were swallowed up by Failure, while the light around the greatsword became more intense than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I did it!'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was delighted.&nbsp;</span><span style>It succeeded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The new skill fusion has succeeded.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Fusion skill ‘Linked Kill’ has been created.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your intelligence has increased by 10 due to the successful fusion of a new skill.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Linked Kill]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is a sword dance that combines hatred with the dazzling flapping of wings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to the weight of Kill, the dazzling style is reduced, but the strength of Kill is overpowering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A minimum of three to seven blows will be randomly generated that will deal 1500% damage per hit (the current damage of Kill -300%).</span></p>
 <p><span style>* This skill doesn’t share a cooldown with Kill and Link.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Please note that your stamina will be depleted if there are seven strikes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Mana consumption: 90% of the maximum mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: 1 hour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a skill where the power of Kill was weakened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It might not have compared to when 5 Joint Attacks was triggered with Kill, but the big advantage was that three strikes were always guaranteed, while it wasn’t certain that 5 Joint Attacks would be triggered.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Duguen!</span></i> <i><span style>Duguen!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s heart beat wildly from joy. The first Linked Kill crushed the power of the fire whirlwind.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘He still has that much power left?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The current Grid was clearly injured. Nevertheless, he unfolded powerful attacks in succession, so Hell Gao was forced to feel confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is he human?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A tenacious vitality. Indeed, he was similar to Muller.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hell Gao was forced to acknowledge Grid as the blue greatsword penetrated through the remnants of the flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 215,000 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 219,800 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The third blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 214,600 damage.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fourth blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 220,100 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fifth blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 218,700 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sixth blow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have suffered 219,200 damage.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The end?&nbsp;</span><span style>No.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was it like a Chinese restaurant offering good service when it was just opened? Even if he ordered one bowl of jajangmyeon, they would give a second bowl for free as a service.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid received a lot of service for his success in a new skill fusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Failure’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘5 Joint Attacks’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A notification window constantly popped up as Grid’s attack hit Hell Gao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 1,057,300 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Failure’s option effect is activated, causing the skill ‘5 Joint Attacks’ to be generated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Critical!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have dealt 2,230,900 damage to the target.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao couldn’t even scream.&nbsp;</span><span style>The black flames around him turned to jade and were then extinguished.&nbsp;</span><span style>The strongest skill was used and the option of the strongest item was activated, meaning Grid drove Hell Gao to death in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He once again told the kneeling Hell Gao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am in the same class as Muller.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pisik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao nodded for the first time,&nbsp;</span><span style>“I admit it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He saw and felt this human called Grid grow in battle.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would eventually follow Muller’s course.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I lost. I will put off my purpose of ingesting the souls of humans to increase my strength for the moment.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao admitted his defeat. The body of the demonkin was destroyed and turned to fog.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time,</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Pepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The two fire stones that hadn’t been mined yet exploded at Hell Gao’s disappearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T-The fire stones?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword panicked because he had been so busy watching the battle that he forgot about mining.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was looking at the notification windows and didn’t see him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have defeated Hell Gao, the master of hellfire, who seizes human souls.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Memphis’ Egg has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[118,411,132 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your level has risen.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your level has...]</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gained 11 levels at once.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Grid was level 253. It was a level comparable to the top 300 rankers, but it was still the lowest among the Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>Furthermore, the reward was a strange item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In the end, only two fire stones were mined... It’s big damage."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao was the most powerful boss he had ever met.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t receive enough rewards for the effort he put in, and he flopped to the ground in disappointment.&nbsp;</span><span style>His stamina was depleted and it was difficult to even lift one finger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword ran up to him.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Are you okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Am I okay?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid frowned and glared at Peak Sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>"What will you do if I’m not okay? Will you give me the fire stone you mined?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Of course.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword confidently replied and pulled out the fire stone he obtained.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I will give this to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The value of the fire stones were so high that it was difficult to price them.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Peak Sword’s life and ranking were saved by Grid, so this was his way of showing gratitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I need one more...”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid grumbled as he grabbed the fire stone.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Sigh... I tied Hell Gao up for 10 minutes, so how did you only obtain one fire stone in that time? Perhaps your level isn’t good enough... It is pretty pathetic.”</span></p>
