 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>For the administrator’s quest, he created two Divine Shields.&nbsp;</span><span style>While the legendary shield was stolen from right in front of him, Grid still had the rare shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Divine Shield]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Rare</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 360/360 &nbsp;Defense: 189 &nbsp;Magic Resistance: 150</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a rare chance of completely resisting dark spells.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>An item made by a craftsman with great skills and potential, but his experience and reputation is somewhat lacking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to the power of Cassus, a priest of the Rebecca Church, it shines with the divine power of the goddess of light. Due to its strength against dark magic, all followers of demons and the Yatan Church will suffer when facing this shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>User Restriction: Level 190 or higher. More than 500 strength. More than 1,000 divine power. A member of the Rebecca Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 800&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What, that shield?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as Grid pulled out the golden shield, the wildly rampaging dogs stepped back at once.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then they started whining like puppies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Tzedakah Guild were filled with admiration. In particular, Jishuka was extremely shaken.&nbsp;</span><span style>She couldn’t let go of her hope and asked Grid,&nbsp;</span><span style>“That shield... Did you make it? Just like the Special Jaffa Arrow?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The creator of the Special Jaffa Arrow was Grid?&nbsp;</span><span style>The Tzedakah Guild members doubted their ears. Grid was only focused on saving his life, so he nodded without thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I made it. But this...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaduduk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid suddenly gritted his teeth before raising his eyes and roaring,&nbsp;</span><span style>“This is a failure! Shit! The real finished product was stolen from me by some jerk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was one of the most outstanding shields the Tzedakah Guild had seen.&nbsp;</span><span style>They admired the Divine Shield, so they were shocked to hear it being called a ‘failure.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T-That great shield is a failure? When it’s one of the top three shields I’ve seen so far?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The guild members were perturbed. Pon went to Jishuka’s side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid’s dagger and armor are unusual. It is clear that both of them have an outstanding performance. That dagger seems to require high agility and that heavy armor is only worn by knights. Above all, Grid revealed a strong sword technique earlier. However, he is a blacksmith? The one who produced the Special Jaffa Arrow... Is he the unknown craftsman we are looking for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What type of blacksmith could be armed with a dagger and heavy armor? Didn’t he also do a sword dance that was typical for a blade dancer?&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka didn’t have an answer for the suspicious Pon, but she didn’t agree either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid recognized the Special Jaffa Arrow with one glance and said it was made by him. There is no reason for him to lie. So, let’s assume he is the unknown craftsman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hrmm...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon had been with Jishuka since L.T.S. and trusted her judgment. She was an open and credible person, thus she became the guild master.&nbsp;</span><span style>But this was an exception.&nbsp;</span><span style>No matter how he looked, it was impossible that Grid was a blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Pon was unable to get rid of his suspicions, Malacus cried out.&nbsp;</span><span style>“That is the Divine Shield...! Are you the rumored blacksmith who has business deals with Winston’s lady?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Malacus was particularly agitated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The Divine Shield is in your hands... It means that Mesta failed his mission... No wonder there was a delay in his arrival!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now things made sense to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The one who brainwashed the administrator and stole the Divine Shield was a subordinate of Malacus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You fu*ker! It was you! You are the jerk who stole my shield!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid became furious after discovering that Malacus was behind this.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pon shook as he heard the vulgar words coming from Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because he felt a strong excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Even Malacus is calling Grid a blacksmith.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was evidence that Grid’s identity was as Jishuka thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A blacksmith who can wear heavy armor and use that dagger, in addition to the sword dance...’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon thought about it and asked Jishuka to confirm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master. Perhaps Grid has a hidden class?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It looks that way, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka nodded.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pon’s tone increased in excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“In order to determine Grid’s identity, we have to finish this raid quickly. Right? Regas.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas emerged from a corner when called. His health and wounds had recovered with the help of his guild members.&nbsp;</span><span style>Confidence was written all over his expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I already know a strategy to attack Malacus, so I will finish it at once.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas who watched the battle from right beside Malacus!&nbsp;</span><span style>The one with pure combat skills asked Grid for help, not anyone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid, these dogs seem afraid of your shield, so I hope you will help us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All eyes concentrated on Grid at the words.&nbsp;</span><span style>Questioning, doubt, confusion, and expectation were in their eyes as Grid nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will help you if you promise to give me 50% of the items that Malacus drops.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner, who was sitting on one side and watching for the potion cooldown time to be over, shouted angrily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey! If you add the 17 of us and you alone, there is a total of 18 people. Therefore, the dropped items should be divided into 18 equal parts. Why should you take 50% alone? In the first place, isn’t Regas helping you for free? You are receiving free help but when you help, it is paid? Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You shouldn’t be counted as 17 people. Aren’t all 17 of you one organization? Shouldn’t an organization be counted as one person? In addition, Regas work with me is different. I was helped by Regas, but have you helped me? Why is this uncle acting so patronizing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What? Hey, you! This is the first time I’ve met someone worse than Pon! Hey! Who in the world would make calculations like this? If it wasn’t for us, wouldn’t you already be killed by Malacus? So shouldn’t you thank us? Isn’t this too unconscionable?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It is you who should thank me. Didn’t you get a chance to fight Malacus because of me? The raid was on the verge of failure, but you survived thanks to my shield.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop it Vantner.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon quickly determined that Grid wasn’t an ordinary person.&nbsp;</span><span style>He calmed Vantner and nodded at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are right. I will divide the items 5:5 according to the condition you have proposed. Please remember. We are unconditionally kind to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon was laying the groundwork to have Grid join the guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid had no knowledge of this and mistook it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They need the help of my Divine Shield to defeat Malacus. This shit.. I should’ve made the item allocation 7:3 instead of 5:5.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka invited Grid to the party.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid accepted with an unwilling expression and was surprised to see the list of party members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘More than level 200!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid knew that the Tzedakah Guild was a small and elite force.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he never imagined they would be at this level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Jishuka is level 251. Pon is 243... Regas 239... &nbsp;If this is the case, shouldn’t all three of them be in the top 20 of the unified rankings? The others can be in the top 100... What is this monster like group?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There are numerous guilds in Satisfy. Among the established guilds, there were a few belonging to the top 1,000 of the unified rankings. Each guild should have around five rankers at most.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yet all 17 members of the Tzedakah Guild were at least top 200 rankers.&nbsp;</span><span style>They might be few in numbers, but they were certainly one of the strongest guilds in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, subtle complex emotions crossed the faces of the guild members who checked Grid’s level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Level 95... Low.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is high for a blacksmith but... Isn’t he a hidden class like Master and Pon are suggesting, not a pure blacksmith?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Level 95 for a hidden class is...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If this is real... I can’t play games anymore.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? What is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid felt somewhat uncomfortable as the Tzedakah Guild members looked at him.&nbsp;</span><span style>But unlike the others, Regas just laughed and grabbed him.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Let's go!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Eh? W-Wait a minute...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas lifted Grid’s body. Then he threw the baffled Grid between Malacus and the hell’s keepers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aaaaack~~! Do you want to kill me? Wahhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh! My butt!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yip!</span></i> <i><span style>Yiiip!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As Grid and the Divine Shield fell from the sky, the hell’s keepers were frightened and scattered. But Malacus was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That shield, I will thankfully take it! Huh?”&nbsp;</span><span style>He was confused to see Regas appear in front of him. Then he laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style>“You want to face me head on? Kukuk! You must be crazy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas struck him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...Keok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood poured from Malacus’ mouth.&nbsp;</span><span style>The black shield, which boasted the absolute defense, collapsed in front of Regas’ fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Malacus didn’t make a mistake. He deployed the shield at the exact point of attack. But Regas’s fist wasn’t blocked by the shield and hit his abdomen unobstructed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Malacus couldn’t understand how.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then once again!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Malacus’ face was hit by Regas’ elbow.&nbsp;</span><span style>This time, Malacus was able to grasp the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This guy is able to change the trajectory of his attacks!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was correct.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a means of defeating Malacus’ defense, Regas adopted the simple method of changing the attack orbit in real time.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Kkeok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the fist aimed for the bottom of the chin, the shield was deployed there. However, the fist would stop along the way and hit the neck instead.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pakak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shield opened on the left side of the head, but the fist stopped in the middle and struck the jaw instead.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dadadadada!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Regas’ fists, which had a passive skill that ignored the enemy’s defense by 33%, hit Malacus at a speed that wasn’t visible.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeeeeonk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Malacus was hit cleanly in the chest and he flew back into the forest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ku tang tang tang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Malacus’ body pierced through a few trees before being stuck deeply in a large rock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“K... Keuok...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Malacus was broken and bloody all over as he emerged from the rock. But he recovered like all that damage was a lie.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an overwhelming recovery based on magic power.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, this meant an excessive consumption of magic power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Malacus exited the forest and spoke to Regas in an unconcerned manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are stupid. If you change the orbit in the middle of the attack, won’t your muscles tear apart? On the other hand, I can heal from all attacks. The more you hit me, the more you are damaging yourself. Even more...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas ignored the talking Malacus and once against wielded his fists. Malacus unfolded the shield to protect his whole body.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style>“If I use the shield like this, it doesn’t matter if your fist can change orbit. You will never touch my body!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. My fists are useless. But that...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style>Arrows flew towards Malacus.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The arrows penetrated through the shield and hit Malacus.&nbsp;</span><span style>Regas explained to Malacus who had fallen down.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I saw your shield becoming weaker as the range expanded. And your weakened shield can’t stop Master’s arrows.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Archers were special among the combat classes. Due to their poor defense, they were rated as one of the worst in close combat, along with magicians. Instead, they had an extremely high attack power.&nbsp;</span><span style>In all of Satisfy’s classes, few could do as much physical damage as archers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And Jishuka was at the peak of archers.&nbsp;</span><span style>The woman who was called the expert archer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas witnessed Malacus using three layers of shields against Pon’s Mach Spear and two layers against Jishuka’s arrows, so he developed the current strategy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y... You...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The wound was slow to heal because it was a fatal injury.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Tzedakah Guild poured attack skills towards the temporarily defenseless Malacus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuaaaaak! Divine Punishment!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwarururung!</span></i> <i><span style>Kwang kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Dozens of black lightning bolts fell from the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>Malacus sensed a crisis and used his best spell.&nbsp;</span><span style>It dealt catastrophic damage to the Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This enormous attack power...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban and Vantner managed to endure it. However, the other guild members were stunned and became defenseless. The guild members with weak magic resistance died instantly.&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite the fact that they raised their stats, including health and mana, with various buffs and potions, they suffered a crisis and were on the verge of annihilation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, Jishuka maintained a careful distance and was safe, while Grid was protected by the Divine Shield.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid sighed with relief when he saw the guild member’s health go down instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If it didn’t have the option of a rare chance of defeating dark magic, I would’ve died. Ku... I should buy the lottery ticket later on.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Malacus got up with great difficulty. Most of his injuries were healed, despite being a semi-corpse a moment ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is the last chance!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had to hit Malacus before he completed healed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka didn’t want the sacrifice of her guild members to be in vain, so she used her strongest attack skill that consumed 100% of her mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Phoenix Arrow!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Special Jaffa Arrow flew through the air and flames appeared around it in the shape of a huge phoenix. The phoenix burned everything around it and swallowed Malacus.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>An explosion that shook the earth!&nbsp;</span><span style>The Tzedakah Guild hoped that it was the end of Malacus, but no system messages appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>Malacus, who lost half his body, emerged from the flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ku...keok... Girl...! I...kill...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The remains of a five-layer shield were in front of Malacus.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka’s Phoenix Arrow was able to smash through Malacus’ five-layer shield and damage him.&nbsp;</span><span style>But as a result, Malacus survived.&nbsp;</span><span style>Indeed, a boss monster had enormous health.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban and Vantner went forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have to end him before he fully recovers!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban’s mace and Vantner’s twin axes aimed at Malacus’ body.&nbsp;</span><span style>But their attacks didn’t hurt Malacus or play a role in restraining his regenerative power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Regas and Pon lamented as they watched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The two of them are lacking attack power...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka reached her mental limit from exhausting her mana, so she didn’t try for another attack. With the exception of Toban and Vantner, everyone else was still in the stunned state.&nbsp;</span><span style>Malacus laughed as he dismissed Toban and Vantner’s attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuhahahaha! Okay! Okay! Hell's keepers! Eat those people!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Grrrung.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bark!</span></i> <i><span style>Bark bark!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This was the end.&nbsp;</span><span style>The raid failed.&nbsp;</span><span style>As everyone was watching the hell’s keepers desperately-</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma’s Swordsmanship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid, who was armed with a greatsword instead of a dagger, started to dance.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Buuuong.</span></i> <i><span style>Buuuong.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The greatsword was over 3m in length but it moved through the air to an invisible tune.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Malacus’ expression hardened.&nbsp;</span><span style>That familiar aura was being emitted from Grid again.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was killing intent.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was truly a perfect killing intent.&nbsp;</span><span style>The killing intent around Grid was compressed into the sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y-You... This is ridiculous!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Malacus had sacrificed thousands, tens of thousands of virgins as living sacrifices.&nbsp;</span><span style>He experienced all types of hatred and anger, but this was the first time he was threatened by a killing intent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was coming.&nbsp;</span><span style>Malacus wanted to prepare for it. But his body still wasn’t fully recovered, so he couldn’t act freely.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Grid’s sword dance ended.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After entering the party, Grid received the buff skills like the other members, causing his stats to rise!&nbsp;</span><span style>His maximum mana increased, allowing him to trigger Kill.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The greatsword filled with extreme killing intent pierced straight into Malacus’ heart.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then a notification window flashed in front of Grid.</span></p>
