 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>I was the same rank as Malacus. And as I beat more boss monsters, I became the richest man in the world.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were dozens of glamorous girls on my arms, including Jishuka and Laella. In addition, my first love Ahyoung...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why don’t you like Yura?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura was an unrealistically beautiful woman. Honestly, I have never seen a more beautiful woman than her, to the extent that everything else faded in her presence. Even Ahyoung, whom I had liked for 10 years, was nothing in comparison.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But she wasn’t glamorous. Her chest was slightly larger than average. If I considered that she might be wearing a pushup bra, her chest might be only average.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You aren’t glamorous so why are you here...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I asked and Yura’s face became cold as ice.&nbsp;</span><span style>It seems I had touched her sore spot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hiiik!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I begged for my life, but there was no mercy from the Blood Witch.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A dagger pierced into my heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh... Cough! Killing a person so casually... Truly the Blood Witch...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was a cruel woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Heeeeok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I opened my eyes to a familiar sight: the dirty ceiling as I laid down on the small and dirty bed in my room.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a happy dream where I was the richest man in the world and had the most beautiful women in my arms, but it was also a bad dream because I was killed by Yura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"... I might not have another chance for a raid like that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With one raid, I gained more than 40 million won in cash.&nbsp;</span><span style>The raid took a lot of time and money to invest in consumables, but it was easier to make money from raids than random items dropping.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, this was only limited to top raids.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tzedakah Guild...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Tzedakah Guild was already attempting the Guardian of the Forest raid when I saw them a few months ago. They, along with the top guild, gobbled up the profits from raids and accumulated an enormous amount of wealth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was different from the world I lived in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But I got involved with those guys... It was an amazing experience.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was hungry.&nbsp;</span><span style>I saw that it was 12 p.m.&nbsp;</span><span style>I only wore boxers and scratched my stomach as I headed into the living room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Sehee frowned from where she was preparing rice in the kitchen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t have a good body, so why do you keep exposing yourself? Why don’t you think about how other people feel? Look at the gauntness of your stomach. Don’t take off your clothes in front of other women.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"... Why are you home instead of at school at this time?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It is the anniversary of our school’s opening. Come eat lunch. No, eat breakfast.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Um.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Breakfast prepared by my little sister?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It looks like Sehee is ready to marry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I sat down at the table expectantly.&nbsp;</span><span style>But there were no side dishes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What? Where are the side dishes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You want side dishes? Our family still has a debt of 560 million won. There is also the interest to repay every month... Just be grateful that we can eat rice.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... This can’t be.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I stole the chopsticks from Sehee, who was about to put the food in her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee was shocked as I took the chopsticks away from her.&nbsp;</span><span style>I stood up and exclaimed.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Let's go! Go out and eat meat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My sister was growing so she couldn’t just eat rice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you continue to eat like this, your breasts won’t grow!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"... Aren’t I already pretty big? Why should we eat meat when we should be saving money?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huhu... Sehee, your brother earned 40 million won yesterday. So don't worry and let's go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh? 40 million won? Cash?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes! In one day! How is it? Isn’t it great? Now, let's go!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>I dragged the stunned Sehee out of the kitchen. Then I put on the blue sweats that had been my favorite for 10 years.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the meantime, Sehee dressed in a pretty outfit and seemed prepared to go out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are my sister, but you are indeed pretty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>How many years had it been since I bought her a meal?&nbsp;</span><span style>No, wasn’t this the first time?&nbsp;</span><span style>I was proud of myself and hummed as we left the room.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then we rode four stops on the bus.&nbsp;</span><span style>We arrived at a downtown area with many restaurants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>People watched Sehee walking next to me and spoke to each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, really pretty. Her ratio is amazing. Is she an idol trainee?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A perfect example of an innocent beauty. Was there someone like this in the neighborhood? But who is that scruffy guy next to her? Surely she isn’t dating a guy like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What nonsense are you talking? Do they look like they would be in the same group? They are probably just walking next to each other by chance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, something like that can happen. You are right!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A-A family member...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee was beautiful and I didn’t resemble her. Personally, I thought she was prettier and more lovely than Yura. She was smart and sociable, despite being cold to me, so she was the pride of our family.&nbsp;</span><span style>So I was reluctant to go anywhere with Sehee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It feels like I am harming her.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I started walking slower than Sehee. She would be embarrassed if she walked next to me.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Sehee grabbed my arm.&nbsp;</span><span style>"What are you doing? Why do you want to go alone?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Well, that... Please release my arm. Everyone is looking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>People looked at us with a lot of distrust.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was as if I was someone who was threatening Sehee.&nbsp;</span><span style>It felt like they would call the police at any moment!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee felt uncomfortable and pressed closer to me.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I hate walking alone because men keep trying to talk to me. This is a prevention method. It is also good that Oppa gives off a dirty impression.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then we arrived in front of a Hanwoo (most expensive beef in Korea) specialty store.&nbsp;</span><span style>If each person wasn’t willing to spend 250,000 won per person, it was best not to walk into a Hanwoo specialty store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I never thought I would come to a place like this.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was thanks to Satisfy. I played the game and managed to go to lunch at a place like this.&nbsp;</span><span style>I was thrilled to tears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee stopped me before we entered the store.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Surely, we aren’t going to eat here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Didn’t I say that I earned 40 million won in one day? I wasn’t joking. Don’t you believe me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe you. I am well aware that Oppa is doing well in Satisfy these days. But can you make 40 million won every day? No?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“O-Of course not. Sometimes I can’t even earn anything. But there might be days when I earn more than 40 million won. So this isn’t a burden. Go ahead and enter.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oppa. It isn’t certain when you will earn a good amount of money. It is more important to save at these times. And I like pork more than beef.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What are you talking about? When will you ever get to eat something like this? I always wished to eat here someday. Just believe in me for once. Come on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I held Sehee’s wrist and went inside the store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Welcome.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The employee greeted me politely. But his expression wasn’t so good. I looked old-fashioned and poor.&nbsp;</span><span style>But his expression changed after seeing Sehee’s bright appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Just the two of you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This way."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The employee guided me and Sehee to a room. On the way, there was a lit up hall with several people inside. It seemed like they were interviewing someone for a magician or TV show.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it a celebrity?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee sat in her seat and didn’t reply. She looked around at the elegant exterior and sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I would’ve liked to come to this place with our parents.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah, you are a good daughter. Don't worry. I will take our parents to a better place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh, aren’t you a good son?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee’s face lit up.&nbsp;</span><span style>On this day, the brother and sister ate the finest Hanwoo that melted in their mouth.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Then finally... People around the world are curious about this. Yura, is it true that you are the new Eighth Servant? Most people are convinced that Yura is the Eighth Servant.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Korea’s representative ranker, Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style>Right now, she was having an interview with Satisfy related media.&nbsp;</span><span style>She couldn’t focus because the interview place was a Hanwoo store, but was surprised when a couple entered the store.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because she knew the man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was the first one to defeat Yura, who was 5th on the unified rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style>After the incident at the Yatan Temple, Yura wanted to know who Grid was. She did her own research, but couldn’t find any clues.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yet she met him in reality in Korea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I never thought I would meet him again.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura’s cheeks turned red as she smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an intense encounter.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thus, the encounter was engraved in her mind.&nbsp;</span><span style>She dreamed of reuniting with the protagonist of that encounter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let’s move onto the next interview.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reporters and staff interviewing Yura were speechless due to her sudden alluring smile. Yura called for a break and left the restaurant.&nbsp;</span><span style>She contacted the informant she had been dealing with since starting Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sending my current location. I want you to investigate in detail a man who is dining here. His description...”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Pant pant... I can’t breathe because my stomach is so swollen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>We were on the bus heading home.&nbsp;</span><span style>I gasped as I held my swollen belly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then Sehee suggested.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Should we take a walk in the park to assist with digestion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh? What nonsense are you saying? Why do we need to digest the best Korean beef? It should stay in my stomach as long as possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Ah, yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? What? Why is your expression like that? You don’t look good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah, I’m okay. There’s just a strong garlic smell.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>An awkward silence flowed because Sehee seemed angry for some reason.&nbsp;</span><span style>Inside my pocket, the basic S cell phone started ringing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was this a debt reminder call?&nbsp;</span><span style>I had a lot of experience with Mother's Heart is Happy Financial Services, so I hesitated because it was a number I didn’t know.&nbsp;</span><span style>But I soon realized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’ve already paid off my debt.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, I wasn’t in debt. Of course, my father happened to become a debtor, but I didn’t have to be afraid of unknown phone numbers anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style>I answered the call with confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hello?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then I heard a voice that I would never forget.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Is this Shin Youngwoo’s phone?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>... Ahyoung.&nbsp;</span><span style>My first and only love, Kim Ahyoung.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I spoke in a trembling voice.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Yes... Are you perhaps Ahyoung?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The voice over the phone replied brightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Yes, that's right. You still remember my voice? Youngwoo is a detailed person. I like it.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>I could never forget this voice.&nbsp;</span><span style>The feelings were buzzing in my head. But in reality, I couldn’t speak properly because I was nervous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"T-that... What's going on?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ah! Why was I acting so pathetic?&nbsp;</span><span style>My first love was contacting me, so why was I asking a question instead of saying hello? Really stupid!&nbsp;</span><span style>As I was shaking, Ahyoung made a suggestion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[I was looking through our graduation album not long ago. While looking at the photos, I suddenly wanted to see you. After graduating from high school, haven’t we only met at the alumni meeting? How about it? Would you like to have a drink with me?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wanted to see me?&nbsp;</span><span style>My first love Ahyoung wanted to have a drink with me?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Does Ahyoung like me as well? Now she wants to confess her hidden heart?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I excitedly stood up.&nbsp;</span><span style>"When should we meet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bus stopped at that moment. I fell down and rolled, but I felt neither pain nor shame.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Now would be good. But did you drop something? What was that sound...?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, nothing. Nothing! You want to meet now? Ah, no! Why don’t we meet in the evening? I-Is that okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Yes, it is fine. Then at 7 p.m...]</span></p>
 <p><span style>We decided on a place to meet, then Ahyoung ended the call.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Ah...!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>I started making money in Satisfy and my life was changing rapidly.&nbsp;</span><span style>I no longer feared the creditors and was going to win my first love.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a dream-like situation, and I felt like I was floating amongst the clouds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Was that a girl just now?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee asked me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I didn’t look at Sehee as I hugged my phone and replied.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh... Are you going to meet her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hrmm..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, we didn’t talk anymore until we arrived home.&nbsp;</span><span style>I was completely excited at the thought of meeting Ahyoung, while Sehee kept her mouth shut.&nbsp;</span><span style>I showered as soon as I got home, then I asked Sehee.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sehee, recommend me some fashionable styles these days. No, come buy clothes with me right now. Please style me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have to study~”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“So cold-hearted.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee locked her door and focused on studying, so I was forced to go and buy clothes alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>With the help of the clerk, I bought the latest trendy clothes and went to a hair salon. Of course, I also got the latest trendy haircut.&nbsp;</span><span style>After that, I exited out onto the street and saw people dressed in the same style as me.</span></p>
