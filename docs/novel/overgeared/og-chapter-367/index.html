 <p><span style>Chapter 367</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style> ‘It isn’t bad to have one spear.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Spear Shot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a skill that used the concept of ‘throwing the spear,’ so it was somewhat tricky for general warriors to use. The slightest slip meant they could lose their weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were many ways for him to retrieve the thrown spear using the God Hands. He was confident that he could use Spear Shot properly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The test has finished!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Grid was feeling satisfied with his new skill, all of the reservists ended their test.&nbsp;</span><span style>The average score of the reservists was 50 points, and it took a full three minutes.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a level that was barely above the cut line. There were four people who failed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s score of 100 points in 1 minute and 23 seconds became even more outstanding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hrmm... Next is the swordsmanship test.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instructor Kaesul was still stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style>The sudden change and growth of Blue Falcon Grid was unbelievable, even when he saw it directly with his own eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>While Instructor Kaesul was feeling confused, Grid and the reservists followed the assistants. Each of them stood in front of a new scarecrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scarecrows had solid lines on them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The instructor explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you cut along the solid red line, you will get 5 points. If you stab it, you will lose 5 points. Stabbing the green dot will earn you 5 points, cutting it will lose you 5 points. Stabbing the blue line will earn you 10 points, cutting it will lose you 10 points. You will pass if you get 50 points in three minutes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a bit more complicated compared to the spearmanship test.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was lacking in the past and had barely gained any points from the three colored solid lines.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, the weapon that Grid normally used was a greatsword, and it wasn’t effective when it came to stabbing. This was the biggest cause of his low score.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, after becoming Pagma’s Descendant, Grid had used Kill hundreds of times.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now he could stab with a greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>The continuously intersecting solid lines and dots?&nbsp;</span><span style>Compared to Piaro and Kraugel’s movements, they were trivial enough to make him yawn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“G-Grid passed...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>100 points in 39 seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was like one with the sword as he obtained this score.&nbsp;</span><span style>Instructor Kaesul and the assistants’ mouths gaped open at the sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He has the makings of a knight!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>'He was just acting as a Blue Falcon until now!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t know why he was acting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Anyway, they had to admit it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had the best qualities.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Grid wasn’t feeling inspired at all.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had fought against countless strong enemies, so striking a scarecrow was just boring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have set a new record in Patrian’s reserve forces training Swordsmanship Test!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The rare skill ‘Continuous Stab’ has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Continuous Stab Lv. 1]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quickly stab the target 5 times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every stab that hits will deal 100%, 120%, 150%, 190%, and 240% of your attack power respectively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mana Consumption: 300</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: 3 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a multiple hits skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>It could be defended against or avoided, but it was useful against sluggish enemies, as it was a type of skill that contained explosive power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yes, it’s weaker than Kill.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a good substitute skill for when Kill was on cooldown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, he felt like it was hell. Now he was getting great rewards from the reservist training, so he wanted to dance with joy.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><i><span style>Shoot!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid and the reservists stood side by side with a target 10m in front of them.&nbsp;</span><span style>The archery test was about to begin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This test is to get 50 points with 10 arrows.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The target was divided into 10 points, 8 points, 6 points, 4 points and 2 points.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Tension filled Grid’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In the past, I couldn’t even hit the target with one arrow.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, he wasn’t very confident.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the absence of Bow Mastery, the hit rate of the arrows was proportional to agility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had watched Jishuka shoot for more than a year. He’d made hundreds of bows for Jishuka and the soldiers of Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m not a complete newbie to archery.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Believe in himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘10 meters. It is only 10 meters away. I can focus enough.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every time he made a bow and tested the performance, the target distance was 100 meters.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid took a deep breath and watched the center of the round target.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was aiming for 10 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will be sure to acquire a rare skill!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt hope as the distance to the target was too short. He could do it if he concentrated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was trying to reproduce Jishuka’s posture when he frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because the quality of the training arrows for the test was very low.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Did beginner level 3 or lower blacksmiths make this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shaft was twisted and the weight balance was off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Anyway, the reservist training environment is disappointing in reality and the game.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shaft should be leveled and the balance between the arrowhead and shaft adjusted. The weight of the arrowheads should also be balanced.&nbsp;</span><span style>An unbalanced arrow wouldn’t fly far, no matter how hard they were shot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A material with a heavy weight can cover it to some extent, but this arrow is made from the worst material.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The legendary blacksmith, Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>As Pagma’s Descendant, he had made over 100,000 arrows.&nbsp;</span><span style>He might’ve lost the Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship skill, but his eye for arrows hadn’t disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can win, even without the power of items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Determination flashed in Grid’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid, what is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instructor Kaesul’s attitude towards Grid had toned down. He didn’t call Grid ‘Blue Falcon’ or curse at him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid unabashedly demanded,&nbsp;</span><span style>"The arrows I’ve received are in a very bad state. Can I have a look at the ones in your hands?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instructor Kaesul was very embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look. The structure of the arrow is so simple that anyone can easily make it, but it doesn’t just depend on the arrow when being fired. A novice who doesn’t know anything touching them, of course the arrows will be bad. If the arrows are a problem, I will give you new arrows.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Instructor Kaesul gave a signal. Then an assistant brought new arrows to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the state of the arrows were just as bad.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It might be different if I had the Bow Mastery skill.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was determined and asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me handle the arrows myself."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Geez, he isn’t a blacksmith.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems he’s become arrogant just because he gained some skills.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The assistants complained. They were dissatisfied with Grid, who was slowing down their schedule.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the response of Instructor Kaesul was surprisingly favorable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I understand. If you can, then try it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reason why Instructor Kaesul felt contempt towards Grid before wasn’t just because he was incompetent. Grid didn’t try to overcome his incompetence and had an attitude of hating everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now Grid was overflowing with enthusiasm. The instructor didn’t want to pour cold water on that positive change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid left the group of reservists. While the other reservists did the test, Grid started to repair the arrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I would prefer to cut the shaft thinly and make it flatter.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid currently had 0 dexterity.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wasn’t able to exert his full ability just by relying on experience and theory alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I could break the shaft. Forget my greed and focus on the balance.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid picked up a stone that was three times smaller than the arrowhead. Then he tore a few branches and tied it to the back of the arrowhead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The arrows, which were so light they couldn’t go against wind resistance, now had a moderate weight. Grid smiled with delight and pulled some of the feathers behind the shaft.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an extreme measure to balance the left and right side of the shaft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s crude, but better than before.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>A notification window popped up as Grid tried to improve the curve of the shaft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The options of the ‘Reserve Troops’ Arrow’ has changed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Reserve Troops’ Arrow]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attack Power: 1~2 &nbsp;&nbsp;Accuracy: +2</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone saw what was wrong with the arrow and fixed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The workmanship is poor, but the performance of the arrows has improved. It will fly quite far when fired well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 0.01</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now it purely depends on my abilities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid spoke to an assistant and took deep breaths on the shooting range.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kkirik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He remained tense, but there was no hesitation in his actions.&nbsp;</span><span style>The bowstring was drawn back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Remember when I test the performance of my bows.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He followed the posture of an expert archer.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a posture he had seen from Jishuka since the days of the Malacus raid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would be able to hit a target 10 meters away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Now!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid stopped breathing and aimed the arrow tip.&nbsp;</span><span style>At that moment, the arrow burst out with a cheerful sound and flew away.&nbsp;</span><span style>It fell in a parabola and succeeded in penetrating the target.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was 6 points.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was aiming for the center, but it deviated to the right.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Then.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid aimed more to the left of the first shot.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he failed to read the wind direction in his rush.&nbsp;</span><span style>The direction of the wind changed and the arrows fell down. It was another 6 points.&nbsp;</span><span style>His opportunity to acquire a rare skill was flying away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Grid in the past would’ve cursed with irritation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s still okay.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was calm.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reservist training included sparring, so the level of the participants needed to be similar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, the power of the 50 reservists currently participating in the training were around level 20 like Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It would be difficult for them to hit the targets with all 10 arrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The record will be for the level 20 reservists in the past. It’s still possible.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t give up.&nbsp;</span><span style>This time, Grid raised his concentration to the maximum, read the wind direction, and fired the arrow.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>10 points.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was no difficulty after he got it once.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid completely grabbed the feeling and got 10 points eight times in a row.&nbsp;</span><span style>The result.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid has 92 points!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have set a new record in Patrian’s reserve forces training Archery Test!]</span></p>
