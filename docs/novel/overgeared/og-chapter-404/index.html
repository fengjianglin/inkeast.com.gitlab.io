 <p><span style>Chapter 404</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Lantier?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a familiar name to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Where did I hear it?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought about it, but nothing came to mind.&nbsp;</span><span style>He summoned Noe and Randy, placed the God Hands all over the place, took a defensive position and asked while drinking a potion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is Lantier?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Lantier isn’t an individual’s name.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eclipse, the strongest and and worst assassination group believed to have existed more than a thousand years ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Lantier is the name that has been passed down to the leaders over generations. But there is only one Lantier that I know.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suuuuoh.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The black smoke started to become thicker.&nbsp;</span><span style>As the black smoke became thicker until Grid couldn’t see in front of him anymore, Braham spoke shocking words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The legendary assassin.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Grid felt astonished.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>One of the God Hands protecting Grid was struck by a weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style>It couldn’t deal with the shock and went flying.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the first time that the God Hands had this strong reaction to an attack instead of stiffening. He could infer how high the enemy’s attack power was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid narrowly twisted his head to avoid the hand flying at his head.&nbsp;</span><span style>Noe hurriedly yelled as he looked at the God Hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Behind you! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Again?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>When it first appeared, it instantly moved from the front to the back.&nbsp;</span><span style>It seemed to have a troublesome skill to instantly appear behind the target.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Save me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once Grid commanded, the God Hands moved all at once and gathered behind Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the same time, it happened.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The dagger that flew like lightning and tried to pierce Grid’s neck collided with the God Hands instead.&nbsp;</span><span style>A shock wave occurred and cleared the smoke, allowing Grid to confirm Lantier’s appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Skeleton?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lantier wasn’t a human.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had died a long time ago, becoming a skeleton.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lantier was moving with such a body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>An enemy who competed with the four God Hands with the dagger held by thin finger bones.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was an aquamarine light shining eerily in their eye sockets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Undead...! This is why I couldn’t detect it with magic power!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>[No, the result would be the same even if Lantier was alive. It isn’t easy to find Lantier when he doesn’t want to be found.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The basics of an assassin was hiding. They had the ability to erase their presence.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lantier was a top assassin who got the title of a legend, so it wasn’t just at the level of erasing himself. He could deny his existence in the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hands, Grid’s Magic Detection was only at level 2.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was virtually impossible for the current Grid to find Lantier, let alone when he was undead.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sururuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The skeleton, Lantier, disappeared into the smoke again.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid tried to find him using his high insight and the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it was wishful thinking.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid lost Lantier and asked Braham.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why is he an undead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The answer was simple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Baal’s contractor has the ability of a necromancer. Pagma found Lantier’s body and turned him into a death knight.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words, Pagma was a legendary blacksmith, a great swordsman, and a necromancer?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s a scam.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He also helped neutralized the invasion of the great demons alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid felt desperate because of this.&nbsp;</span><span style>If the legendary assassin’s death knight emerged on the 61st island...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is likely that other legends will emerge on the 62nd~66th islands.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The difference between the power of the previous legends and the current legends was remarkable.&nbsp;</span><span style>The previous legends were regarded as complete, while the current legends were still growing.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s level was low and he hadn’t finished all his class quests yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How do I clear this place?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham gave hope to the frowning Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The undead legends are very weak compared to their complete state. On the other hand, you have me. If you rely on me and keep learning magic, one day you will be able to beat them.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagma might be a legendary blacksmith and necromancer, but Grid was a legendary blacksmith and magician.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was also qualified to become the strongest, and had the potential to overcome any trials.&nbsp;</span><span style>Just...</span></p>
 <p><span style>[I just question if you can even learn Fireball.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This situation wasn’t positive.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Braham whispered to the frustrated Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[He’s coming back.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was true.&nbsp;</span><span style>The God Hands that Grid scattered in all directions sensed the enemy and flinched. They were like a spider web.&nbsp;</span><span style>And a spider web was weak.&nbsp;</span><span style>A spider web might be strong enough to hold a small bird, but it was easily torn by beasts.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Syuk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lantier’s black cloak flapped as he appeared through the smoke.&nbsp;</span><span style>He easily shrugged off the God Hands flying from all directions and broke through Noe and Randy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Noe’s claws tried to slash it, but it seemed like the cloak had a high resistance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lantier’s dagger was then captured by Grid using the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Okay, I read the orbit!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the synergy between his high insight, the Slaughterer’s Eye Patch, and Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid moved quickly and successfully avoided it.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the problem occurred next.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pahat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lantier once again appeared behind Grid and stabbed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid wouldn’t suffer from this again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not an idiot who will fall for the same trick three times!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had already used the footwork of Revolve and planned to return Lantier’s strike back to him, causing 50,000 damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>Braham clicked his tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This obvious tactic is a trap.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lantier was blown away by Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid smiled with satisfaction as he looked through the scattered red afterglow, only for his eyes to widen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Fake?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lantier disappeared like an illusion after being hit by Revolve.&nbsp;</span><span style>He appeared to the side of Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid tasted a terrible pain the moment he realized.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[You have been hit by a lethal blow!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A legend doesn’t die easily. You can resist all attacks for 5 seconds with a minimum of health.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hat!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid could only laugh.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was only two blows and his immortality passive was activated. The strength of the opponent was too surreal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have inherited Pagma’s power, but this is reality. As you are now, you can’t even win against a creature made by Pagma.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why did Braham want Grid to realize his own powerlessness?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was simple.&nbsp;</span><span style>Braham wanted Grid to crave magic.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, he would want to grow as a magician now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why?&nbsp;</span><span style>Did Braham want to resurrect himself faster by raising Grid’s intelligence?&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, that was one reason.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rather, it was more because he believed that a magician was greater than a blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham thought it was better for Grid to grow as a magician.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid was a blacksmith to the bones.&nbsp;</span><span style>Right now, he was thinking from the perspective of a blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Lantier is strong for a reason. His basic abilities and skills are excellent, but he also has good items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dagger shone with a white light.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid just guessed, but it was probably made from adamantium.&nbsp;</span><span style>Assuming that the weapon was made by Pagma in his prime, the attack power of this dagger was probably far superior to Grid’s Greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The cloak also has high defense, so I can’t imagine the defense of the armor.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, his conclusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In order to beat this place, do I need stronger items?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike Braham’s intentions, Grid’s desire as a blacksmith was ignited as he activated Blackening and fought with Lantier for five seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style>The result was, of course, was a total failure.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lantier didn’t allow Grid to hit him once.&nbsp;</span><span style>Noe, Randy and the God Hands were obsolete in front of the legendary assassin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have died.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Returning to the 60th island.]</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“This game is truly about items.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level, stats, skills, and magic growth were just the basic premises.&nbsp;</span><span style>Later, when Grid once again challenged the Behen Archipelago, the most important thing to pay attention to was items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Let’s assume that the legends on the 62nd~66th islands are also undead.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He needed to make items that would be deadly to the undead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I also need to make items for Noe and Randy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In retrospect, Noe always used his claws to fight and Randy used the copied weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style>They would become much stronger if he equipped them with items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘As a bonus, I will learn magic.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>That would be the icing on the cake!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kukukuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[...]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid laughed because he had tasted failure and frustration many times.&nbsp;</span><span style>This point of view was quite different from what Braham predicted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Has he lost his pride after the fight?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham didn’t know anything about psychology and had this absurd thought. His anger soared into the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He considers magic a bonus.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham’s affinity for Grid fell by 2.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a result, Braham’s affinity for Grid was at 68 points.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>If the two of them were the opposite sex, it would be high enough for marriage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>It was an joyous day for Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Grid returned after a long time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Dear husband!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene, the heir to the best family in the kingdom and lady of Bairan, as well as Grid’s duchess.&nbsp;</span><span style>She rushed to the outskirts of the city and greeted Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was still bright, beautiful, and lovely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Irene.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Dear husband~!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene had become more aggressive after giving birth to Lord.&nbsp;</span><span style>She didn’t care about the residents and soldiers watching as she hugged and kissed Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was feeling embarrassed when Lauel sent him a whisper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>In order to raise Reidan’s fertility rate, you must set an example as the lord.</span></i> <i><span style>Please share your hot love even more where people are watching.</span></i></p>
