 <p><span style>Chapter 136</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>There was an old saying in games that ‘levels were bullies.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>That saying was also established in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Satisfy might’ve revolutionized the world by implementing the first virtual reality system, but it was a game at its core. In Satisfy, level was the most primitive and important concept.</span></p>
 <p><span style>10 stat points were gained every time the level increased, and users would become stronger as their stats increased. The higher their level, the stronger a user could become because they could wear good items or acquire powerful skills. It wasn’t just for these simple reasons. The higher the level, the more the unique functions of the stats showed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Let’s take the strength stat for example.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the user’s level was less than 100:&nbsp;</span><span style>The user had 0.1 attack power, 3 health points and the weight limit increased by 20 with every point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But if the user’s level was above 100, it would be 0.2 attack power, 5 health points and a weight limit increase of 30 points per every point in strength. Once the level was above 200, attack power increased by 0.3, health by 7 points and the weight limit by 40 per point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this way, the effect of the stats increased every 100 levels. This was called the stats awakening.&nbsp;</span><span style>The effect of the stats awakening was huge, so the higher the level, the better the effect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, that was almost unrelated to Grid, who had a legendary class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A mere level 170 was able to knock down four rankers over level 200 and kill dozens of griffons who were level 260. He easily hunted hundreds of griffons (thanks to Toban properly acting as bait), so he was a scammer who transcended the concept of level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The epic hidden classes are classified as powerhouses, and Grid is a legendary class... I’m speechless.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They camped in the griffon habitat and spent all day and night hunting.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban suddenly wondered,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Grid, how did you get a legendary class?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A lot of effort was needed to become a hidden class, so it was almost like winning the lotto.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was basic common sense, but Toban wanted to know the specifics.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wondered about the process Grid went through to become a legendary class. Listening to the story would be fun, and he could use it as a reference.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But these were never pleasant memories for Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t want to recall his worst memories of the several months of suffering, where he died dozens of times and lost most of his possessions. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t ask...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban verified Grid’s dark expression and gave up on listening to the story.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He is furious. He must’ve suffered. Indeed, getting a legendary class wouldn’t be easy... I would rather leave this place...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had been hunting in the griffon habitat for the past four days.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the meantime, Grid had gained 10 levels and reached level 180.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was the feeling that Grid wanted to reach level 200 here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it was hard for Toban to bear.&nbsp;</span><span style>For the past four days, he hadn’t acquired any experience or items.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was forced to wear Malacus’ Cloak and act as bait, while Grid reaped all the rewards.&nbsp;</span><span style>His number one position on the paladin rankings that he had firmly guarded for months might be taken away by the second ranked Damian.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban was nervous about this and prompted.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Grid, let’s stop hunting now. Don’t you have to clear your quest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hrmm...”&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was troubled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The griffon habitat gave a lot of experience, so he wanted to stay here until level 200.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The difference between level 180 and level 200 is huge...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it was an unreasonable decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It took four days to gain 10 levels. It will take at least eight days to gain 20 levels, but I am reluctant to delay it that long.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, he felt a little bit sorry for Toban.&nbsp;</span><span style>He treated Toban as a slave, but he started to feel some remorse after a day or two.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He’s a ranker so he can’t serve any longer for free... It will be good to end it here.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the day when he felt remorse for taking advantage of someone! He never even imagined it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I need to be tougher in order to survive in this harsh world...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why did God make him so naive and nice?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid felt some resentment towards God as he made preparations to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban exclaimed. He was relieved about finally being able to escape from acting as griffon bait.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now it was time to go to the Judar Church. Grid wanted to finish this quest quickly. Toban wanted to regain his freedom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the two people arrived at the Judar Sanctum in less than a day.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban paused in front of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Leader Pascal is aiming for the Holy Light set. Perhaps he will be hostile towards you. There might be a fight, but if so, I won’t be able to help you. Do you understand?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am used to fighting alone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wasn’t particularly worried.&nbsp;</span><span style>How could the leader of the Judar Church be stronger than the pope? He thought he would win if they fought.&nbsp;</span><span style>But before that, he had to check his status again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Know yourself before knowing the enemy. Status window!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Grid</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level: 180 (140,090/5,531,200)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Class: Pagma’s Descendant</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The probability of adding additional options when making items will increase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The probably of item enhancement will increase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* All equipment items can be worn unconditionally. However, there is a penalty depending on the rating of the item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: One who Became a Legend</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Abnormal conditions don’t work well on you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* You won’t die when health is at the minimum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Easily acknowledged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: First Unique Item Maker</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Dexterity +200</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: Only Legendary Item Maker</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Dexterity +350</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: Knight Slayer</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Stamina +100.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Strength +30</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: Apostle of Justice</span></p>
 <p><span style>* All stats +10.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The Apostle of Justice’s bravery is unmatched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Health: 29,560/29,560+7,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mana: 3,240/3,240</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strength: 1,584 &nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 962 &nbsp;&nbsp;Agility: 417 </span></p>
 <p><span style>Intelligence: 439 + 200 &nbsp;&nbsp;Dexterity: 984 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persistence: 498</span></p>
 <p><span style>Composure: 364 &nbsp;Indomitable: 414 &nbsp;&nbsp;Dignity: 364 &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Insight: 664 &nbsp;Courage: 308</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stat Points: 0</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 25,519/57,480</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Abilities Details]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Basic Attack Power: 325 &nbsp;&nbsp;Weapon Attack Power: 412~579</span></p>
 <p><span style>Additional Attack Power:</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Pagma’s Swordsmanship Lv.1 (Deactivated):20% additional attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* God Dominion’s Blessing: 15% additional attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Total Attack Power: 995~1220</span></p>
 <p><span style>Basic Magic Power: 220 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item Magic Power: 100</span></p>
 <p><span style>Additional Magic Power: None</span></p>
 <p><span style>Total Magic Power: 320</span></p>
 <p><span style>Basic Defense: 192 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item Defense: 539</span></p>
 <p><span style>Additional Defense:</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Holy Light Battle Gear Set: Defense +500</span></p>
 <p><span style>Total Defense: 1,231</span></p>
 <p><span style>At level 100, he gained 0.2 attack power per every point in strength and 0.5 magic power per every point in intelligence. In addition, stamina gave 0.2 defense per point.&nbsp;</span><span style>When summing up, he rounded off the decimal point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s base damage, magic power and defense were abnormally higher than users of the same level.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was because he’d acquired many stats through the production of items.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid wasn’t satisfied.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t like the damage and defense figures applied from the items he wore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The +5 Dainsleif’s attack power was 549~772, but due to the 25% penalty only 412~579 was applied. In addition, there was a 40~55% penalty for his armor, so the value wasted was too big. It caused a feeling of loss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Being able to wear all items is fraudulent, but the penalty system is really annoying. If I’m going to be a scammer, make me a scammer. Why is there the penalty system?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was okay for now.&nbsp;</span><span style>When he killed the pope, he was 30 levels lower and his defense was much worse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sigh... Okay!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought positively as he entered the Judar Sanctum. He handed the paladin blocking his path the letter of recommendation from Isabel and said,&nbsp;</span><span style>"I came to see Leader Pascal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The paladin checked Isabel’s introduction letter and quickly opened the way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Welcome Mister Grid. The leader is waiting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was hospitable?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was surprised by the unexpected response and looked back. Toban was hiding behind a pillar.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban sent him a whisper.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>-Grid, I'm sorry but I can’t enter with you.</span></i> <i><span style>I’m afraid that the leader will be angry if he sees me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘Coward...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Grid entered alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he faced all types of delicacies.&nbsp;</span><span style>The 11th leader of the Judar Church, Pascal warmly welcomed Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I am honored to meet the person who received the blessings of Goddess Rebecca and God Dominion!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal was an ambitious person. But his ability to read the situation was excellent.&nbsp;</span><span style>He heard that Grid defeated Malacus and was recognized by the Rebecca Church and Dominion Church, so he knew how foolish it was to be hostile to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Besides, there was no reason to feel hostile.&nbsp;</span><span style>If the pope’s position became vacant, Pascal was be the first candidate to become the next pope, even without the Holy Light set.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Rather, things have become easier.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the moment, there were few people in the Rebecca Church with the talent to become pope candidates. And the leader of the Dominion Church wasn’t a greedy person.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal was convinced that he would become pope. He felt strong gratitude towards Grid who caused all of this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I would like to hear your story about how you defeated the demon Malacus and the corrupt Pope Drevigo. Now, go ahead and sit. The food we prepared for you will become cold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>On this day, Grid increased his affinity with Pascal, a pope candidate. Then the pavranium safely received God Judar’s blessing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Golden Discs Made of Pavranium]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: Infinite</span></p>
 <p><span style>Golden discs made of pavranium, the strongest mineral produced by the collaboration between the legendary blacksmith Pagma and the legendary great magician Braham.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By default, they revolve around and protect their owner. They will also take other actions when given commands from their owner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* They have obtained healing skills due to Goddess Rebecca’s blessing. They will increase their owner’s health recovery speed by 300%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* They have obtained an attack buff skill due to God Dominion’s blessing. The owner’s attack power will increase by 15%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* They have obtained a defense buff skill due to God Judar’s blessing. The owner’s defense will increase by 15%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 3</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Good!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This long journey was finally heading towards the end.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now he just needed to receive the blessing of God Yatan and the quest would be complete.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal spoke to the excited Grid,&nbsp;</span><span style>"But Grid, it is virtually impossible to find the sanctum of the Yatan Church. They’re very secretive. so the location of their sanctum has never been exposed in history. You said that you need God Yatan’s blessing? It might become possible at some later date.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal’s words were true. Grid communicated with Toban afterwards, but they couldn’t figure out the location of the Yatan Sanctum.&nbsp;</span><span style>It seemed like it would take a long time before he could discover it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Grid was forced to return to Winston without achieving his goal.&nbsp;</span><span style>Winston was boisterous when he returned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? What is this event?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The users were excited.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the entrance to Winston, there were many famous NPCs and soldiers, including Phoenix. Even Lady Irene showed up.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Tzedakah Guild were also gathered, and it was rumored that they had gone under Lady Irene a while ago.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Perhaps the king is coming?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow, it must be. The king probably heard rumors about Winston’s development and is coming to inspect it directly.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t easy to see the king of a country. There was a rumor that just seeing a king could cause a positive effect on their stats.&nbsp;</span><span style>How spectacular would the procession be?&nbsp;</span><span style>Thousands of users were gathered like ants all over the walls and square as they watched the gates with anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then after a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, the gates opened and someone entered.&nbsp;</span><span style>The soldiers verified the identity and blew their trumpets once, then the knights drew their swords and saluted the person. Then people smiled brightly and blew pollen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they weren’t enthusiastically welcoming the king. No, it wasn’t even an NPC, let alone the king.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a scruffy user who looked like a beginner.&nbsp;</span><span style>The man had a hat to completely cover his face and ID, like he was expecting the attention. Then Lady Irene ran to the man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The users watching the situation simultaneously cried out.&nbsp;</span><span style>Irene was praised as the goddess of Winston due to her beauty and kind heart, making her loved by many male users. So why was she hugging this scruffy and suspicious looking man?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve missed you so much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene stared at the man with an expression of love.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an unbelievable sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why did such a beautiful and noble NPC like a user like this?&nbsp;</span><span style>While the users were feeling stunned, Jishuka, one of the most beautiful women in the world, also approached the man.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>She had a bright smile on her usually cold face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You came back safely. I was waiting anxiously.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keok...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The users were dumbfounded.&nbsp;</span><span style>Winston’s lady was from an influential NPC family and this mysterious man was also welcomed by the top ranker and beauty Jishuka.&nbsp;</span><span style>This scene became a huge issue and was reported to the media around the world. Of course, there was a hot debate on the Internet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh, I wonder who that man is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After dinner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee was sitting next to Youngwoo on the couch and showed interest in the mysterious man appearing on the news.&nbsp;</span><span style>Sehee had no direct experience with playing Satisfy, but she often watched it on TV, so she understood why it was such a big issue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He looks like a beginner and a fool at first glance, so why is he loved by such big shots?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee asked the question and the yawning Youngwoo explained,&nbsp;</span><span style>“That’s me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I was away for a while on a quest, so everyone was welcoming my return.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe... Don’t I have a lot of popularity?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwajijik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The TV remote control in Sehee’s hand made a strange breaking noise.&nbsp;</span><span style>Youngwoo clicked his tongue.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Wow... Even if the control is 10 years old, how can it break like this? Wow, the maker of this is really bad. We shouldn’t buy a TV from here again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sehee glared at her brother and went to her room. Once Youngwoo was left alone, he couldn’t endure the fatigue and dozed off on the couch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"... The first night... Huhuhu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of sly laughter echoed through the living room.</span></p>
