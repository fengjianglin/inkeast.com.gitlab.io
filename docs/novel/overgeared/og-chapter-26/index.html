 <p></p>
 <p><span style>I felt like a mountain after equipping the gold armor.&nbsp;</span><span style>With the giant sword in my hand, I felt brave enough to even cut at a dragon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gangsters were swinging their weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was no need for evasion.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwang!</span></i> <i><span style>Kwajajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>[The enemy’s damage has been neutralized.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The enemies’ attacks had a good momentum, but they couldn’t even deal a small scratch to my armor. My body didn’t feel any slight fluctuations.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rather, the weapons of the gangsters were damaged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is this...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gangsters lived in the lawless world so their warning instincts were unsurpassed.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this moment, the gangsters felt despair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T-This is ridiculous...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I grinned in a devilish manner at the confused gangsters.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Have you heard of the item effect?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Drugs? Skill?&nbsp;</span><span style>I didn’t need to rely on such things from the beginning.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were all types of battle gear piled up in the smithy, and as Pagma’s Descendant, I could use all of it!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Clink!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>I grabbed the handle of the greatsword with both hands and tightened my waist as much as possible before lifting it up with all of my strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>I didn’t need to use any techniques.&nbsp;</span><span style>I used just the momentum of the greatsword to wreak havoc to anything in its path.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There was a refreshing feeling in my chest as the sword cut through the enemies.&nbsp;</span><span style>With one strike, the bodies of the gangsters turned into grey light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have defeated Winston’s outlaw, Praga.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Reputation in Winston Village has increased by 60.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[4,300 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>

 <p><span style>[Affinity with Khan has risen to the maximum.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The tremendous rewarding sentences that kept appearing.&nbsp;</span><span style>I didn’t take the time to enjoy the pleasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This weapon and armor...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I immediately used the Legendary Blacksmith’s Appraisal skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The blacksmith who becomes a legend that appraises items with an excellent discerning eye. If a hidden feature exists in the target item, it will be found.]</span></p>

 <p><span style>It was acclaimed as a ‘masterpiece of human history’ by the founder of the Eternal Kingdom and king of the north, Loran.</span></p>

 <p><span style>[A hidden function doesn’t exist.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You still don’t have enough knowledge and experience to understand the materials, the production method and the intentions of the maker of Valhalla.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have no understanding of Valhalla.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“C-Cough...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>W-What were these amazing things?&nbsp;</span><span style>How did such amazing items show up in the smith of a village like this?&nbsp;</span><span style>As the two items shocked me speechless, Khan came up to me and firmly grasped my shoulders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he asked me in a trembling voice,&nbsp;</span><span style>"You... how can you use Dainsleif and Valhalla?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I couldn’t afford to answer Khan’s question right now. Rather, I was the one with questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Khan, why are such great items in a place like this? Huh? Where did you get this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Heok!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>H-How surprising.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan freaked out after listening to my question.&nbsp;</span><span style>I was surprised because it seemed like Khan’s eyes were going to pop out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Wow, this guy isn’t a frog so how can his eyes pop out like this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan’s eyes popped out of their sockets as he shook me.&nbsp;</span><span style>“You... Do you really know the value of these things?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isn’t it great just by looking at it? The creator is the great Albatino.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“H-Heok! You figured out who the maker is? P-Perhaps you are...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan’s face and neck turned red. Then he wobbled like he would collapse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What? Why is he in this state? Is it high blood pressure?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did I save him, only for him to die of high blood pressure? No! I can’t let that happen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey, hey, Old Man! Calm down, calm down! You have to be careful!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah! Kuoock...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Heok? F-Foam? Hey! Old Man. Hey! What is this? Don’t die! I succeeded the quest, right? Then why are you dying? If you have another quest, then give it to me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, wait. If Khan died then what would happen to Dainsleif and Vahalla?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Hey, Old Man. Are you well? Damn! You have to live. You must live.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After returning Dainsleif and Valhalla to their original locations, I carried the old man to the clinic.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The remote village of Winston.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, as the road was built and transportation developed, the village started to develop rapidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were hunting grounds of various levels everywhere, and Winston overflowed with high-quality specialty products and unique quests. These factors meant that its development was endless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nowadays, many people came and went.&nbsp;</span><span style>In a survey of new users that a broadcasting station conducted, it was in the top 10 of ‘New Village where I want to Start.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>People envied the residents of Winston after seeing the ever-evolving Winston.&nbsp;</span><span style>The land prices in Winston had increased by as much as 20 times, so it was expected that the residents would be rich.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was only an illusion for those who didn’t know the truth. The reality was quite different. The lives of the Winston residents weren’t better than ever.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was due to the Mero Company.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Mero Company had dominated the northern area of the Eternal Kingdom since a long time ago. Valmont, the leader of the Mero Company, predicted the potential of Winston more quickly than anyone else. When it was still a remote village, he bought the land and commercial areas of Winston at a cheap price from the residents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, most of Winston’s land and commercial areas were dominated by the Mero Company.&nbsp;</span><span style>It hadn’t officially been promoted to a city yet, but many of Winston’s signboards had the name ‘Mero’ on it. On the other hand, the residents lost their jobs and suffered from poverty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Mero Company’s monopoly of Winston.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a big jackpot for the Mero Company. It was possible to accumulate a huge amount of wealth. The lord wouldn’t do anything due to the higher taxes and bribes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Indeed, people must have insight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The owner of the Mero Company, Valmont was happy every day. Most of the profit from the village entered his pockets, so he enjoyed numerous luxuries.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, there was one thing that was raining on Valmont’s mood: the existence of the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to the decree of the king, cities and villages could only legally have one smithy. It was one of the government’s extreme measures to prevent local powers from building massive weapons and strengthening their military capabilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, there was one smithy in Winston and the owner of that smithy was a blacksmith called Khan, not the Mero Company.&nbsp;</span><span style>A business that was steady and gained a large amount of money as a weapons business was rare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Mero Company offered Khan an astronomical amount to sell the smithy, but he refused, saying it had been in his family for seven generations. It was no use even if Valmont used intimidation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Valmont had a headache. It was too regretful to give up on the smithy. So he thought hard and came up with an ingenious scheme to put pressure on Khan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Buy large quantities of quality weapons and farm equipment from the Taji Blacksmiths. Then sell it to the Winston residents and travelers at a cheap price. The profit? There is no need to worry about that. Sell it cheaply!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Due to Valmont’s order, Khan’s blacksmith store lost its competitiveness. The residents and travelers of Winston no longer went to Khan’s smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style>The weapons sold at the Mero Company were slightly lower in quality than those sold at Khan’s smithy, but they were more diverse and cheaper, causing people to buy from the Mero Company.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In addition, Valmont planned one more thing.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a plan to trick Khan by hiring an impostor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you increase the scale of the smith, it will instill more confidence in the customers and business will be well again. I will lend you the money at a low-interest rate, so invest your money and grow the scale of the smithy. Show the people of Winston and the Mero Company that you will be successful!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan foolishly believed the scammer. It was because the scammer was a long-time friend of Khan’s.&nbsp;</span><span style>Without imagining that his friend had been bribed by Valmont, Khan borrowed money without checking the contract. As a result, the debt snowballed into an amount that he couldn’t afford.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Valmont loved the feeling of watching Khan collapse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huhuhu, that smithy will be mine in the near future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The last thing Valmont did was hire a group of gangsters and he waited, believing that the smithy would soon be handed over to him.&nbsp;</span><span style>But was Khan as stubborn as a bull?&nbsp;</span><span style>When he saw that Khan never let go of the smithy despite being cornered, an even greater rage boiled up inside Valmont.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Where are they? I told those gangsters to be firmly prepared if they didn’t handle it this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He seriously warned them, so they were motivated to work harder.&nbsp;</span><span style>This time, the smithy would enter his hands...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What? They’re missing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, that’s right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Those damn bastards!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chachachang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Valmont overturned the table filled with delicacies at the unexpected report. Then he asked his closest subordinate, Rabbit.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Who recommended those gangsters?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Biel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Bring him here right now!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a few moments.&nbsp;</span><span style>Valmont quietly asked the trembling Biel,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Weren’t you the ones who recommended those gangsters? You said I could believe in them? Then what is this? Not only have they not come back with Khan’s smithy in the promised time period, but now they have run away. I even paid them an advance up front. How will you take responsibility for this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I-I'm really sorry. They are the most notorious people in the neighborhood so I recommended...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don’t need your apology. Give it to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? W-What...?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Biel asked because he couldn’t understand Valmont’s meaning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Valmonth was frustrated with Biel’s confusion and spoke bluntly.&nbsp;</span><span style>“You must be stupid if you don’t understand while working for a merchant company. Money. Give me money. You are responsible for the advance given to them as well as compensation for the failed commission.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y-Yes?! I-I don’t have that much money. Please give me one more chance...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Biel grabbed Valmont’s clothing and begged. But Valmont was relentless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you don’t have money then create it. Otherwise, I will sell you to the slave market. Then I will be compensated to some extent. Huhuhu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"M-Master! Please...please!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Remove this guy."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Biel had been with Valmont for 10 years. He always worked hard, like a dog.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Valmont didn’t tolerate even a single mistake.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a cruel decision but he didn’t care about morals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Proud and cruel.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit didn’t like this about Valmont’s nature. But he could earn big money if he worked under Valmont, so Rabbit never betrayed him.&nbsp;</span><span style>After Biel was dragged out, Rabbit was left alone with Valmont and opened his mouth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is hard to believe that the gangsters hired by Biel would run away. They live here in Winston. They can’t throw away their homes easily just for a little bit of money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If they didn’t run away then what is it? Were they hit by the old man?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For now, it is most appropriate to think so. Until this morning, they visited Khan’s smithy as normal. However, they were missing after that. It is certain that something happened in the smithy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Valmont asked after hearing the explanation.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Where is Khan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He has also disappeared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is ridiculous! What on earth happened in that smithy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We are investigating so you will know soon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was frustrating because he didn’t know the exact circumstances.&nbsp;</span><span style>Valmont and Rabbit were coming up with various assumptions and guesses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I've found Khan’s location!”&nbsp;</span><span style>An informant entered and reported.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Around two hours ago, there was a witness who saw a strange young man carrying Khan on his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Strange young man... He must be the culprit in this incident. Rabbit, I will leave the business of the smithy to you from now on. Take care of anyone who gets in your way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to someone’s evaluation of his personality, Valmont had talent as a merchant but he was harsh and violent.&nbsp;</span><span style>How was he able to grow the Mero Company to this extent?&nbsp;</span><span style>This was because he had Rabbit.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rabbit was a resourceful and skilled person who could cover Valmont’s deficiencies.&nbsp;</span><span style>He suppressed his emotions and made calm judgments to produce the best results.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now Rabbit was about to have an encounter with Grid.</span></p>
