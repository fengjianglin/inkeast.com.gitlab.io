 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was stunned at the lump of gold in front of him. In the meantime, someone’s shadow appeared from the box that was emitting smoke.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka detected it and reflexively attacked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Paang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She loaded an arrow in less than a second and fired.&nbsp;</span><span style>How would the presence reply to the rapid-fire attack?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka and Vantner were shocked.&nbsp;</span><span style>The shadow protruding from the box extended a finger and burned Jishuka’s arrow to ashes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[I’m not welcome in the world after 300 years? It’s sad.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shadow was a long-haired, handsome man. The eyes that could be seen through the flowing hair were sharp.&nbsp;</span><span style>He looked at Jishuka and Vantner in turn, before looking at Grid like he wasn’t interested in them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This man, he is strong. At minimum, he’s on the same level as Malacus.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had directly invalidated Jishuka’s quick fire attack.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka and Vantner were certain they would lose if they fought. They were relieved that he wasn’t interested in them.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid was different. He was unable to grasp the situation and shouted furiously at the one who tried to kill him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You jerk! Why are you trying to kill a person all of a sudden? You lousy bastard! How are you going to take responsibility for your actions? Huh? Heok?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid, who had pulled out Dainsleif, suddenly winced with fear and backed down.&nbsp;</span><span style>The man who appeared from the box had a transparent body and his feet were floating in the air.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was a ghost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"H-Hik...!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought a person with a flexible body had emerged from the small box, but it was actually a ghost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was an army soldier who dedicated himself to his country, but he was sadly weak against ghosts. He was filled with so much fear he thought he would urinate. His face was pale and stricken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I should’ve entered the marines!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was caught up in a belated regret when the ghost spoke to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You survived my magic traps. You opened all three boxes that had different types of locks. Since you were protected by the pavranium, are you Pagma's Descendant?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma's Descendant? What is that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shh. Grid’s quest seems to be progressing. Be quiet and don’t interrupt.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka withdrew to a corner and brought the bewildered Vantner with her.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her eyes were shining as she stared at Grid and the ghost talking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is an opportunity to find out exactly what Grid’s class is.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Grid started to recover from seeing a ghost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He mentioned Pagma's Descendant... Is the stagnant class quest going to proceed again?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s spirit had now completely recovered. He took a deep breath and replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right. I am Pagma’s Descendant. Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ghost man responded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[I was known as the Great Magician Braham. Did you come to the labyrinth that I designed for the minerals? If you are Pagma’s Descendant, you should’ve been interested in this place a long time ago. You don’t seem to have much curiosity and attachment to minerals, unlike Pagma.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>This ghost claimed to be the legendary great magician, Braham!&nbsp;</span><span style>If Grid interpreted what he was saying, the Golem’s Labyrinth seemed to be a place created for Pagma's Descendant.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a very attractive place to Grid because the golems were made of many minerals and the labyrinth itself was a mine. He was able to collect minerals from anywhere in the labyrinth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I would’ve come sooner if I heard about this place earlier... But...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was ludicrous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You made a place like this because you were waiting for me? No, what if I never came here in my whole life?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[I’ve created 27 more places like this across the continent. Even if it was delayed, I believed that one day there would be a meeting. Personally, I hoped that the meeting would be sooner.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...So why did you want to meet me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham pointed at the metal floating in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Its name is pavranium. It is the pinnacle of all minerals created with Pagma’s skill and my magic. It’s harder than the god’s metal adamantium, lighter than mithril, and has a good compatibility with magic power. It also has the outstanding elasticity of jaffa.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A mineral containing all the advantages of top-class minerals? If this was true, it could truly be called the peak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[...It can decide by itself and move with its own will. That is its only drawback.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A mineral made by Pagma...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid no longer heard Braham’s voice. He was lost in the richness and beauty of the pavranium that was floating in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could he handle a mineral made by Pagma? He would like to try, even if he failed. What would be the result if he made an item with this mineral? It was a chance to indirectly experience Pagma’s skill through the mineral he created.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Curiosity dominated Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Braham didn’t like that Grid wasn’t focusing on him. He pointed his narrow finger once more. Then </span><i><span style>ttak!</span></i><span style> Flames were generated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the fire that burned Jishuka’s arrow. The fireball flew towards Grid’s face and exploded.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Crazy..!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once again, the pavranium protected Grid. Grid was safe due to its fast actions, then he gritted his teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Why are you suddenly attacking me again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham’s gaze was directed towards the pavranium, not Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[That damn piece of metal... You’re still showing favoritism towards the blacksmith.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey! What was that? Eh? You are crazy! Why did you attack me all of a sudden?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was upset at being ignored. Braham’s gaze shifted back to him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Braham briefly explained why he attacked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Stay focused.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the attitude of an expensive tutor!&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t like it, but he focused in order to progress the quest. Then Braham started his explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The end of life... I hoped for Pagma to make me something. I only helped Pagma make pavranium so that my wish could be fulfilled. It took us 9 years and 11 months to complete pavranium. But there was a limit. Pagma, who was full of strength and health, died shortly after the completion of pavranium. Even someone who was revered as a legend couldn’t escape the years and died of old age.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>[It was in vain. Everything I hoped to accomplish seemed lost. I visited the dwarves and asked them to make something from the pavranium, but their tiny masses of muscle couldn’t even smelt it. I was desperate! I felt despair!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham screamed before coming closer to Grid. His eyes were filled with mixed emotions like anger, joy and even madness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[But now I met you! Pagma’s Descendant! I want you to achieve the last hope that Pagma couldn’t fulfill! Make it! The Vessel of the Soul! Reward all my efforts to protect the pavranium even after my death!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Vessel of the Soul?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then a notification window flashed in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Pagma’s Descendant]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Difficulty: Class quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You have surely inherited Pagma’s blacksmith skills, as well as his swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But you still don’t know who Pagma was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who was Pagma? If he was simply a blacksmith with good skills, his legends wouldn’t be scattered across the continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Follow the legends of Pagma. If you can collect all of the legends, you will truly understand Pagma and succeed his will.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a new legend will be born.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is no time limit for this class quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The legendary class quest has the power to transform Satisfy’s world, according to the result.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Class Quest Clear Conditions: Complete all linked quests successfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Class Quest Clear Reward: Unknown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Second Class Quest: [Great Magician’s Resurrection.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The legendary great magician Braham was a genius. He reigned as the best magician ever since he started learning magic. There was a myth that he survived against the fire dragon Trauka without dying.&nbsp;</span><span style>As he grew old, he started mourning the fact that he was a mortal. Mentally and physically, he had already transcended humanity. Therefore, he wanted to become immortal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After much research, he designed the ‘Vessel of the Soul’ that would regenerate his mortal soul into an immortal soul. But the Vessel of the Soul is an object that doesn’t exist in this world and is impossible to create.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He searched for an entirely new mineral that could be used as a material for the Vessel of the Soul and learned that his old friend Pagma was trying to create a mineral that wasn’t part of this world. He went to Pagma and assisted in the work.&nbsp;</span><span style>The two combined their power and created the mineral called pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham had no doubts that pavranium could be used to make the Vessel of the Soul. But the only blacksmith who could smelt pavranium was Pagma, who unfortunately died of old age.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Braham didn’t achieve his wish!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked forward to the day that Pagma’s Descendant would be born to create the Vessel of the Soul, creating 28 mines and setting up a maze all over the place before he died. Each labyrinth is full of minerals, and he believed that it would be enough to lure Pagma's Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now 300 years have passed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Out of 28 pieces of Braham’s soul that were sealed in 28 labyrinths, one has finally encountered you.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham wants you to make the Vessel of the Soul. Through the Vessel of the Soul, he will be resurrected with the soul and body of an immortal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Second Class Quest Clear Condition: Create the Vessel of the Soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Second Class Quest Clear Reward: A large amount of pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A large amount of pavranium? This isn’t all of the pavranium?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Didn’t I say that 27 more labyrinths are scattered across the continent? 27 more pavranium also exist. If you make the Vessel of the Soul with that pavranium, I will give you the rest.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Adamantium was said to be from the world of the gods. The human world only contained a very small amount, making it the rarest among all minerals.&nbsp;</span><span style>But a large amount of adamantium in the world of the gods couldn’t be ruled out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, pavranium was an artificially produced mineral. The method of creating it no longer existed in this world.&nbsp;</span><span style>The volume was more limited than adamantium.&nbsp;</span><span style>Not just that, the performance was also superior to adamantium.&nbsp;</span><span style>The opportunity to get such a valuable mineral wasn’t something that Grid could miss.&nbsp;</span><span style>He also had no reason to refuse the class quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid easily made a decision and nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay! I will make the Vessel of the Soul!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But there was one problem.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How do I make it? Can I just make a rice bowl?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Rice bowl?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Vessel of the Soul that would unite 28 torn pieces of soul and regenerate it into an immortal soul was likened to a rice bowl!&nbsp;</span><span style>The furious Braham wanted to kill Grid right now. But he suppressed it and barely managed to explain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The god of health and wisdom, Judar. The god of war, Dominion. The goddess of light, Rebecca. The god of darkness and pestilence, Yatan. Let them bless the pavranium. After that, use the divine pavranium to make whatever bowl you like, as long as it can hold something. Then bring it to me. Don’t be late.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid expressed his disapproval.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I have to get a blessing from the four gods? How can I do that? In particular, I have a hostile relationship with the Yatan Church.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[In the past, I forcefully overpowered each church and asked them to bless it... If that’s impossible, try to figure out another method. Flatter or beg them. Either way, you must do it by any means.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham seemed like he was going to kill Grid if it wasn’t done. Then his soul started to fade away.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was just one of 28 pieces of soul, so it was difficult to maintain this form for long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Th...en Pag...ma’s Des...cend...ant... I be...lieve in yo...u...]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was like watching a video.&nbsp;</span><span style>Braham used his strength to say final words before completely disappearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s thoughts became busy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Thanks to the Malacus raid, my affinity with the Rebecca, Dominion and Judar churches has risen. I don’t know whether this affinity is high or low, but at least I won’t be killed. Yes, the problem is the Yatan Church. Dammit! How can I receive a blessing from God Yatan?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Jishuka watched the event quietly and sent a whisper to Laella, the guild’s magician.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Do you know the magician called Braham?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Laella answered immediately.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>-Absolutely.</span></i> <i><span style>Braham is the strongest magician in history.</span></i> <i><span style>Most of the magic in Satisfy is created by Braham and he could be called the teacher of all magicians.</span></i> <i><span style>There is no magician who doesn’t know of Braham.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Heh...</span></i> <i><span style>He is that big?</span></i> <i><span style>Then what about Pagma?</span></i> <i><span style>Who is Pagma?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Pagma?</span></i> <i><span style>I’m not sure...</span></i> <i><span style>This is the first time I’ve heard of him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Pagma and Braham were the greatest blacksmith and magician of all time, with numerous legends about them.&nbsp;</span><span style>NPCs were familiar with historical people like Pagma and Braham because they had been studying Satisfy’s history from a young age.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it was different for users. Unlike NPCs, users only investigated their own interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka was an archer, so she didn’t know about Braham, while the magician Laella only knew about Braham and was completely unaware of Pagma.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka gave an order to Vantner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I want you to investigate who Pagma is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If they knew who Pagma was, they could naturally grasp the identity of Grid, who was Pagma’s Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I originally hadn’t planned to dig deeper...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was presumed to have a legendary hidden class. She couldn’t miss the chance to know what this class was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka’s eyes widened while she was lost in thought.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because Grid’s body had started to float in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah! The boots...! How is this possible?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner was shocked after discovering that Grid was using Braham’s Boots. Didn’t Braham’s Boots have a level limit of 240? Meanwhile, Grid was only level 114. Originally, Grid shouldn’t be able to wear this item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Actually, the cloak Grid is wearing is Malacus’ Cloak... I remember that Malacus’ Cloak has a level limit of 200.’&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka recalled how Grid was able to wield Ibellin’s Thorn of Deep Grievance.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘Maybe Grid can use all items, regardless of the conditions of use?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She kept being surprised the more she knew about Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Meanwhile, Grid flew to the ceiling of the collapsed underground space and said to the two of them.</span></p>
