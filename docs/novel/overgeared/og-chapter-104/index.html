 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaeeeeeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Through continuous engagements, the speed of the Gale Spear was maximized.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pon’s current attack speed couldn’t be followed by human eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>It felt like a dozen spears were thrusting at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zirkan followed it well, but he eventually reached his limit.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment he saw a gap, Pon flew through the air without missing this opportunity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"True Illusion!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepepeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The spear poured forward like a shower.&nbsp;</span><span style>The magnificent golden armor around Zirkan’s body was instantly turned into rags.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuu...ock!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Flop!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was an incredible sight.&nbsp;</span><span style>The first ranked swordsman, also known as the strongest person who led the five captains of the Giant Guild, fell to his knees.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon pointed a spear at his heart and said,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Pant pant... You’re still strong. Originally, I would’ve lost.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon was just as seriously injured as Zirkan. He had been completely overwhelmed at the beginning of the battle. But as the battle continued, he became stronger due to the option of the Gale Spear and was able to reverse the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That spear...”&nbsp;</span><span style>Zirkan smiled bitterly as he examined the splendid appearance of the blue and silver spear.&nbsp;</span><span style>“It is a really amazing spear. Is it an item produced by the unknown craftsman?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was defeated by that spear. Pon calmly confirmed it.&nbsp;</span><span style>“That’s correct. I’ve discovered the true power of items thanks to this spear made by him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huh..."&nbsp;</span><span style>Pon’s coolly accepting attitude meant that all of Zirkan’s bluster went away.&nbsp;</span><span style>Zirkan dropped his head,&nbsp;</span><span style>"End it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Thank you for the hard work.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Gale Spear pierced Zirkan’s heart.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pon warned Zirkan who was slowly changing into light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you are going to threaten our guild again, tell Chris to prepare a larger force.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After that, Pon headed straight to Khan’s smithy.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The power of skills! The power of stats! The power of items!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid currently had a perfect trinity, increasing his attack power to that of top rankers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Maksevun, who was considered one of the top five rankers in the guild, was forced to fall in front of Grid. What would happen if Grid, now more powerful than ever, used an AoE skill that dealt 1.5 times his current attack power?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Pagma’s Swordsmanship.’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a disaster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Wave]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unleash a violent sword dance like a high wave.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inflicts 155% of your attack power to all enemies within 1m, as well as reducing their speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment that Grid took action!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Blue waves emerged from Grid’s sword and spread all over the place.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Syuok!</span></i> <i><span style>Syu syu syu syu syuk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The sharp waves occurred dozens of times.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Giant Guild instinctively sensed danger and quickly escaped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Scatter!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Papapat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The Giant Guild scattered in all directions.&nbsp;</span><span style>They wanted to get away from the waves that had a fierce momentum.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, each wave launched by Grid chased after them, as if they had their own will. It was virtually impossible to escape because the speed of the attack skill was so fast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Is this a guided skill? What is this fraudulent skill?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, the Giant Guild stood at the crossroad of choice.&nbsp;</span><span style>They took defensive stances or raised their weapons to protect themselves.&nbsp;</span><span style>And then...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"Kuaaaaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hiik!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 10 Giant Guild members had been scattered all over the place.&nbsp;</span><span style>They tried to defend and the result was devastating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is impossible...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s attack power was too strong.&nbsp;</span><span style>Maksevun trembled as he witnessed what happened to his colleagues.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'An AOE skill can be so powerful...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>AOE skills could attack multiple enemies at the same time, but there was an inherent limitation in the weak attack power.&nbsp;</span><span style>Generally, a first advancement class’ AOE skills dealt 50~70% of their attack power or magic attack power.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then there was the second advancement class. In other words, the AOE skills of rankers above level 200 were capable of dealing 70~90% of their attack power or magic attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Grid’s skill seemed to exert more than 100% of his attack power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Maksevun wondered.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘Maybe it’s a rare skill?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rare skill!&nbsp;</span><span style>Rare skills could be acquired by completing special quests or achievements, acquiring a title and so on.&nbsp;</span><span style>For example, this was the skill Yura acquired after becoming the Eighth Servant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Divine Punishment]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Summons a lightning bolt that deals 15,000~23,000 damage within 10 meters.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Range of Damage: 3m radius around the target.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* If you use this skill to kill an enemy, your faith will rise by 50 points for each enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mana Consumption: 4,000</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: 1,200 seconds&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thus, the destructive value of rare skills wasn’t proportional to the attack power of the caster, but to a fixed amount of damage. Their power and function were the strongest in existence.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, there were limits to skills with fixed damage values.&nbsp;</span><span style>Once the levels and items of the users increased, and once their health climbed higher, the power of the fixed damage skills would decrease.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Pagma’s Swordsmanship was different.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was Pagma’s Swordsmanship a rare skill? No. It was a legendary skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>The stronger Grid got, the stronger Pagma’s Swordsmanship would become. In the future, it would evolve into the best skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, Maksevun and others on the street were witnessing the glory of one of Satisfy’s best skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ibellin was among them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What on earth is Grid’s class?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Tzedakah Guild knew that Grid had a hidden class. In other words, Grid was predicted to be one of the three known epic classes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Among the three classes, Agnus and Katz were known to have two. Therefore, it was reasonable to assume that Grid was the still unidentified epic class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But at this moment, Ibellin changed his way of thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid… Perhaps he has a unique hidden class?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Ibellin murmured, the Giant Guild members were trembling with fear after being torn to rags from one wide area skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is the equivalent of the five captains... No, maybe more than that. Where did the Tzedakah Guild find and obtain a monster like this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was obvious that the man with the bizarre skull helmet would become a great danger to the Giant Guild later on.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had to grasp his capabilities to help the guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The determined Grey Bear entered the party chat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Does everybody know? We will unconditionally die here. If we can’t avoid death anyway, we should fight properly. Then obtain as much information as possible and report it. How about it?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Okay... If we return from this failed mission with nothing, we’ll be scolded.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It is too unfair to die obediently. I will make him bring out all his special moves.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;ㅋㅋㅋHis deadly moves! I will make him use it quickly ㅋㅋㅋ! Let’s go! Anyway, won’t we just lose experience?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;If Grey Bear has bad luck then he will drop items~&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Don’t say such unlucky things.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Giant Guild members lying in various places starting getting up one by one. Then they prepared to fight.&nbsp;</span><span style>The spectators on the street were excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh! The Giant Guild is finally going to unleash their skills!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go! Show the skills that defeated Ibellin!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy had a video recording function.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Giant Guild VS the Tzedakah Guild!&nbsp;</span><span style>The onlookers in the street were recording the battle between the strongest guilds and relaying it to the Internet. Various broadcasting stations also dispatched people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, hundreds of millions of people around the world were watching Grid and the Giant Guild through the Internet and TV.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid wasn’t aware of this fact.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he was aware that he was on air for the first time in his life...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid would pose and say wonderful lines like the protagonist of movies that he dreamed of being.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These damn people... Why are you suddenly splitting up? Am I funny? Ah, right. From the beginning, I didn’t like scum like you. You shouldn’t have upset me... Kuk kuk! Okay! I will tear off your limbs and kill you as brutally as I can!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Charge of Anger!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Spirit Control!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Chain Binding!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Giant Guild wasn’t confident about facing Grid in a simple power struggle.&nbsp;</span><span style>Therefore, they focused on skills that would cause status conditions.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their battle plan was to attack every time Grid was affected by the status condition.&nbsp;</span><span style>But what was this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;What? Why isn’t he affected by the status conditions?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;It seems like the level difference is too much, so it’s useless. Or maybe he has immunity to all types of status conditions.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;What? This rotten person!&gt;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwajak!</span></i> <i><span style>Puchak!</span></i> <i><span style>Peok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was truly a one-sided slaughter.&nbsp;</span><span style>The black greatsword was turned red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Over the past few years.&nbsp;</span><span style>When Grid was weak, he met many strong people who ignored him or laughed at him. Now the Giant Guild members in front of him were like those strong people.&nbsp;</span><span style>The feeling of trampling on them caused a pleasure beyond imagination.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuahahaha!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person in the skull helmet brutally slaughtering the Giant Guild looked like a monster from a horror movie.&nbsp;</span><span style>The screen filled with blood, and the frightened screams of the Giant Guild members resounded, causing the mainstream stations to eventually stop broadcasting.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to that, the ratings of the cable broadcasting stations increased dramatically, causing a festive atmosphere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Headlines about the ‘Human Butcher’ appeared in various media around the world.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, Grid’s classmates, who were harassed by Grid at Kesan Canyon, shivered from fear in front of the TV.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s that bastard... I knew he was a psychopath...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Wow, he really is crazy. Acting like this in the middle of a city... What a scary guy...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For the next few days, the media had an in-depth discussion on ‘Satisfy’s psychopaths, can we neglect them?’&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, the position of the Tzedakah Guild rose further.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were able to block the 300-strong army from the Giant Guild with less than 20 people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuaaah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris released all his anger by hunting. There were no monsters left in the hunting grounds he was present at.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit! Shit! Shitttt!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The unknown craftsman was taken away by the Tzedakah Guild and he was publicly humiliated, so Chris was running wild with anger.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to take revenge immediately.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the mysterious person had joined the Tzedakah Guild...</span></p>
 <p><span style>In addition, that skull helmet was stuck in his mind and he couldn’t move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'The AOE skill showed on the air is proof that he has a hidden class above epic. Who is he? Perhaps... Agnus?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agnus obtained the second epic class and was seventh on the unified rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style>He disguised himself and enjoyed causing all types of incidents throughout the continent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris couldn’t rule out the possibility that Agnus was involved in this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Jishuka is definitely giving me a headache.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris made a guild announcement after a few days of thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"All external activities shall be prohibited! Just focus on leveling up! Let the anger in your hearts erupt when hunting. Become stronger! Become stronger and pay back this disgrace someday!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the Giant Guild decided to strengthen themselves, winds of change were also blowing in the Tzedakah Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>Through this incident, top rankers became aware of the Tzedakah Guild’s true strength and visited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy was different from L.T.S. There was a limit to what 18 people could do.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Tzedakah Guild, who had been considering the expansion of forces, conducted various tests and accepted new guild members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But there was a problem.&nbsp;</span><span style>Most of the people who passed the test weren’t normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Um... A crazy person attracts other crazy people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was Vantner’s opinion.&nbsp;</span><span style>People were attracted to Grid’s madness and came rushing to join the guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Tzedakah Guild gained seven new powerful colleagues, but they felt more anxious than pleased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And Grid was ready to attend his reunion.</span></p>
