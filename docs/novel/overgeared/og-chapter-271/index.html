 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Combat. In particular, replaying battles where one was defeated was a big help to their growth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan closed his eyes and replayed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘When Grid decided to stab me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>What if he didn’t defend, but decided to push forward instead?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I would still be hit. If Grid hit me from the side, the result would be the same.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>What if he backed off?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I would still be hit. At that time, Grid was already narrowing the distance between us with the maximum stride.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how he looked, defense was the best choice.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the problem was that Kamiyan’s swordsmanship couldn’t defend against it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It took an instant for the straight orbit to change into a circle.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The spear flying in a straight line changed to a circular orbit just before it his his sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Honestly, it gave Kamiyan goose bumps.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was able to feel that Grid was an expert with the spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I have to respond with a skill.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he used Super Armor, he could defend against the attack. Then he would be able to counterattack while Grid was being pushed back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Then I would’ve been the winner.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was hesitant to use his trump card in the first battle. He didn’t use the skill, so the result was a defeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dammit... I didn’t think it would hurt so much.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wore the Red Armor, but he couldn’t even survive one shot.&nbsp;</span><span style>The attack power of Lifael’s Spear was beyond imagination. It was truly a divine artifact.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It was a wrong fight from the beginning.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan hadn’t expected that Grid could use Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style>Therefore, he wasn’t vigilant and didn’t respond when Grid retrieved Lifael’s Spear. From there, the flow passed onto Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was unfair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Isn’t he a swordsman?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several members of the church had witnessed Grid fighting against Drevigo. There were also elders among them.&nbsp;</span><span style>The elders had explained what happened.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was said to use a greatsword.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then how could he use a spear?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘In addition, it’s Lifael’s Spear!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t Lifael’s Spear a weapon that could only be used by a few ‘women’ who received the goddess’ divine message?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s really annoying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The biggest cause of his defeat was ‘wrong information.’&nbsp;</span><span style>This error-prone information planted useless preconceptions and caused him to lose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I should’ve assumed that Grid could use Lifael’s Spear.’ </span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he wouldn’t have been hit so hard!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaduduk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan gritted his teeth. It was enough to drive him crazy.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was boiling with anger.&nbsp;</span><span style>The anger was unleashed through his sword, as he trained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid! Next time will be different! I will be alert! I will show you the true power of the Red Knights!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was evaluated by the enemies that the current Red Knights were weaker than they were in the past.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was inevitable.&nbsp;</span><span style>The former Red Knights had the great swordsman Piaro, so the current Red Knights without Piaro were judged to be one level lower.&nbsp;</span><span style>Duke Limit had never once won against Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>But that was a story of the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Lord Limit is now over Piaro.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was clear that the Red Knights who studied under Duke Limit had also surpassed him.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to prove it, the Red Knights had to be undefeated.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kamiyan was determined to beat Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You will see soon!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwajak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kamiyan’s sword was covered in aura and smashed the large rock.&nbsp;</span><span style>He became even stronger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The legendary blacksmith and the best swordsman after Sword Saint Muller.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was known to be able to handle all types of weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style>The same was true for Grid, who inherited his power.&nbsp;</span><span style>But to even be able to use the three divine artifacts of the church...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is very frustrating.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal needed to quickly determine Isabel’s successor.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal planned to raise his position by appointing a girl he secretly fostered as the new Rebecca’s Daughter.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the problem was that Grid would definitely not hand over Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Damian, that bastard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This must be Damian’s trick.&nbsp;</span><span style>He asked Grid to protect Lifael’s Spear in order to contain Pascal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t be hit by such a trick.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal went to meet the elders. He made them write an order for Grid to return Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Grid, even you can’t violate the official order of our church.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the command was broken?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Then it can’t be helped. You will be considered an enemy... Huh?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal held the order while heading towards the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Pascal?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damian!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal stumbled across Damian, who was campaigning.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian was raising the atmosphere with the help of that fellow called Huroi, who was like a charlatan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal was upset when he saw Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You! Lifael’s Spear is a divine artifact of our church! How could you give it to Grid illegally? You have to clear this up or you will be punished!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian didn’t understand.&nbsp;</span><span style>“What are you saying? The current owner of Lifael’s Spear is Isabel-chan. She is the one who left it directly to Grid...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shut up!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Isabel is already dead! So the ownership of Lifael’s Spear returned to the elders... Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pascal suddenly closed his mouth. He looked like he had seen a ghost.&nbsp;</span><span style>His complexion was worse than when he wondered if Grid was a woman.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because he saw a woman with brightly shining platinum hair approaching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the fuss?”&nbsp;</span><span style>The woman questioned.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Isabel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-What is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Isabel wasn’t dead?&nbsp;</span><span style>Rather than dying, her color was completely recovered and she was walking fine on her own?&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian asked the stunned Pascal,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Isabel-chan is dead? Have you finally become senile?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unbelievable!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>How did she suddenly recover her health after dying?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Things are going terribly wrong!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some unknown actions were occurring in a place that he couldn’t see.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was a serious problem.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal held his head as he tried to understand the situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he saw something dropping.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was hair.&nbsp;</span><span style>The stress that occurred since Grid appeared led to hair loss.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hwaduk.</span></i> <i><span style>Hwaduuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bunch of hair fell every time he touched his head, causing Pascal’s anger to escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gridddd!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This person.&nbsp;</span><span style>Things started to become twisted the moment he appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pascal could no longer tolerate Grid’s presence.&nbsp;</span><span style>He nervously tore up the order he just had written.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid! You are now my enemy!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was thoroughly decided.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian and Isabel felt a sense of catharsis after seeing Pascal’s state and clapped.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[Light Wheel]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Stabbing, hacking, cutting, etc.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Any type of attack will be linked to a circular attack. The target won’t be able to escape this irregular attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The hit rate is 100%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Contains the light attribute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This skill gave Lifael’s Spear a 100% hit rate.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was no resource consumption or cooldown time.&nbsp;</span><span style>This skill had a ‘high’ chance of activating during a general attack, and the power was really fraudulent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought it wasn’t good because there was no additional damage.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a miscalculation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to the extraordinary high base damage of Lifael’s Spear, the option of a 100% hit rate was huge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It was enough to knock down a famous Red Knight with one hit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an unexpected result even for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Lifael’s Spear. This is the majesty of a myth rated weapon.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But there was one regrettable thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A spear doesn’t fit with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pagma’s Swordsmanship Lv. 3&nbsp;</span><span style>When deactivated, it increased Grid’s attack power by 32%, the chance of a critical attack by 22% and the damage of a critical attack by 15%.&nbsp;</span><span style>When activated, it allowed him to use active skills such as Kill, Link and Transcend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this was on the condition that it was a sword type weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style>The skill wasn’t activated when weapons other than a sword type were equipped.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a sad fact for Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to give up on using Lifael’s Spear for myself.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he scheduled it to be included in Grid’s set.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was for Pon, the guild members, and the soldiers who used the spear as their main weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid planned for a day when the guild members and soldiers would wear Grid’s set.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kukukuk! Puhahahat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Overgeared Kingdom!&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid felt a thrill at the people who would praise the cool name, while the soldiers of his fantastic kingdom would wear the Grid set.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That person... Isn’t he scary?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right? I think so as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He doesn’t seem like a normal person...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The smithy inside the Vatican.&nbsp;</span><span style>The blacksmiths muttered as they felt an negative energy coming from Grid. Their eyes weren’t good as they looked at Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid didn’t care about the gaze of others.&nbsp;</span><span style>No. To be precise, there was no need to worry about it.&nbsp;</span><span style>His mind was solely focused on Lifael’s Spear.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lifael’s Spear was completely disassembled over two days.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid tried to figure out the hidden structure of the spear through the process of reassembly.&nbsp;</span><span style>He spent a few days studying the spear in the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The process of observation, disassembly and assembly were tirelessly repeated.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to his natural talents of ‘persistence’ and ‘concentration,’ Grid was able to immerse himself in the tedious process without ending it.&nbsp;</span><span style>The result...</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your understanding of Lifael’s Spear &nbsp;is now at 100%!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Blueprint: Lifael’s Spear has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Experiencing every detail of a myth rated weapon will raise your skills to the next level!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The level of all skills related to production will increase by one.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[(Witness of God’s Weapon) Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill has evolved into (Understanding of Gods’ Weapons) Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Including the time he spent with Isabel in her room, he achieved this in 11 days.&nbsp;</span><span style>The hidden abilities didn’t appear as he expected, but he grasped how to use the Goddess' Essence and various skills were strengthened.&nbsp;</span><span style>No, that wasn’t all.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had acquired the design of a myth rated item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was just as happy as when he obtained Piaro and Asmophel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First of all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right now, he had no material to make Lifael’s Spear.&nbsp;</span><span style>But...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid made a meaningful smile and grasped the hammer again.</span></p>
