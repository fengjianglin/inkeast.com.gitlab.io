 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The last day of the National Competition coincided with a national holiday.</span></p>
 <p><span style>9 a.m.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In spite of the early hour, chicken stores all over the country started to operate.&nbsp;</span><span style>The chicken store owners mobilized their whole family to fry the chickens.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ddrrrung!</span></i> <i><span style>Ddrrrung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The makers didn’t matter.&nbsp;</span><span style>The small neighbourhood chicken stores were flooded with orders for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Please bring me one chicken and three beers at 11 o’clock.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I want to reserve two chickens for 11 o’clock.</span></i> <i><span style>And I was busy during the last World Cup, so I will use all my coupons this time.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>One soju and beer.</span></i> <i><span style>And one roasted chicken.</span></i> <i><span style>Please!</span></i> <i><span style>Before 11 o’clock!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-I</span><i><span style> want...</span></i> <i><span style>What?</span></i> <i><span style>You ran out of chicken and there’s only salad left?</span></i> <i><span style>That’s okay!</span></i> <i><span style>I will order from another store!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At 11 a.m., the PvP tournament that the world had been waiting for finally opened.&nbsp;</span><span style>The chicken stores made more than 10 times their normal revenue during the National Competition!&nbsp;</span><span style>They shouted at the delivery drivers they hired specifically for this day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go deliver!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Buoong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Every city in the country.&nbsp;</span><span style>The foreign tourists who came to South Korea for the National Competition saw a remarkable sight.&nbsp;</span><span style>In many places, the roads were filled with bikes!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The delivery drivers’ bikes were equipped with a delivery crate and the chicken store sticker attached to them, making the foreigners stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don’t Koreans always eat rice?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It seems to have changed to chicken...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Koreans have good physiques despite eating a lot of meat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>And 11 o’clock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 The players are entering! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh! It has finally started!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Family, friends or lovers.&nbsp;</span><span style>They all excitedly sat around a TV at their homes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the people who caused a hot topic over the past three days, Grid and Hurent appeared at the Lion’s Castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I hope that Grid will win.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Honestly, considering the target processing, Grid seemed unlikely to win. But I hope he will do his best, even if he loses.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right, so let’s cheer him on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t care about the experts’ analysis. I am expecting Grid, who has a legendary class, to win.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ding dong~!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“The chicken has come!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh, right at 11 o’clock. They have no sense.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Houses with young families and mothers.&nbsp;</span><span style>Houses where friends gathered.&nbsp;</span><span style>Houses belonging to lovers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Now I will announce the opening of the PvP match! It has started! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>They ran to the porch as the commentator’s words were heard from the TV. They received the chicken from the delivery men then dropped their chicken at the ridiculous sight they were greeted with when they came back inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 H-Hurent has been logged out! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The showdown between the legendary class and the 8th ranked user.&nbsp;</span><span style>How many people predicted that the winner would be Grid?&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, how many believed that Grid would log out Hurent in 30 seconds as he declared?&nbsp;</span><span style>However...</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 5 seconds...! 』&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 In only 5 seconds! Grid has logged out the winning candidate, Hurent! 』&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The baffled commentator shouted belatedly, and hundreds of millions of people responded to the reality.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Waaahhhhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cheering Korean crowd and viewers!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t believe it...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shocked foreign crowd and viewers!&nbsp;</span><span style>The world was in chaos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[(Breaking) Grid won in 5 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Pagma's Descendant! The 8th ranked user was logged out in 5 seconds!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Grid, he fulfilled his 30 second promise!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The United States has received a big impact.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Will Grid earn yet another gold medal for South Korea?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The 5 second logout legend!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>5 seconds! 5 seconds! 5 seconds!&nbsp;</span><span style>The breaking news continued to highlight the 5 seconds.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Internet real time search terms were dominated by ‘5 seconds,’ ‘Grid,’ ‘Grid’s victory,’ ‘Grid is a scam,’ ‘Shin Youngwoo,’ ‘Korean’s possible gold medal.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The netizens were the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>G...God Grid.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>God Grid!</span></i> <i><span style>Forgive us who mocked and condemned you a few seconds ago !ㅠ0ㅠ</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>- </span><i><span style>Wow, what is this?</span></i> <i><span style>It isn’t a bug?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-The 8th ranked user was killed </span></i><span style>ㅡㅡ;;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Crazy...</span></i> <i><span style>I really got goosebumps.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>My family’s sign </span></i><span style>ㅇ0ㅇ</span></p>
 <p><span style>-ㅇ0ㅇ? </span><i><span style>What is that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>The American community must be buzzing right now ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>The Chinese forums are filled with words of envy. ㅋㅋ</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>The Japanese community is bombarded with conspiracy theories that this is a bug </span></i><span style>;;</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>So exciting!</span></i> <i><span style>That Yankee who tore the Korean flag must be shedding tears of blood. ㅋㅋㅋ Praise God Grid.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-3.2 times 4 million won. Congratulations ㅠㅠ</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Actually, I bet 6 million won too ㅋㅋㅋ...ㅠㅠ on Hurent...</span></i> <i><span style>That bastard.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I bet 3 million won on Hurent ;; ah, my salary.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Koreans should’ve cheered on a Korean... ^^ I bet 15 million won on God Grid... from now on, I will only have confidence in God Grid...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>You are a gambler ㅉㅉ</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I also bet 300,000 won so this is a jackpot ㅎㅎ</span></i> <i><span style>I’ve made enough to last me three months.</span></i> <i><span style>ㅎㅎㅎ</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The amount of tens, hundreds, thousands, millions of won were exchanged.&nbsp;</span><span style>It might be a very big amount to somebody.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it could be chewing gum for somebody else.&nbsp;</span><span style>For example, the owner of a big company, a successful freelancer or a Satisfy ranker.&nbsp;</span><span style>They gambled hundreds of million or billions of won.&nbsp;</span><span style>And there were many people who lost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I shouldn’t have believed in those damn experts...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Call my lawyer and prepare to sue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few of the rich people suffered losses that couldn’t be ignored.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuahahaha! Amazing! Amazing~!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Puhahaha! Grid! I love you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone’s misfortune was another person’s luck!&nbsp;</span><span style>The Tzedakah Guild, who’d already made billions of won from Satisfy, hit the jackpot.&nbsp;</span><span style>Those who believed in Grid’s victory bet not only their existing assets, but loans from financial institutions as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dividend was 3.2 times what they invested, so they became instant billionaires. Tens of billions of won were gained at once.&nbsp;</span><span style>They could buy yachts, private airplanes, travel with beautiful women, and enjoy the life of a movie star!</span></p>
 <p><span style>But they were Satisfy rankers.&nbsp;</span><span style>Satisfy was much more precious to them than reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe... I have to ask Grid to make me an item with this money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will continue to invest in Grid until he makes me a legendary item.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The gaming fools planned to buy one or two buildings for their future, but they would invest the rest of their funds into Grid.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>『 Not only is he a legendary class, he has one or two ultimate skills. That Kill skill is the ultimate skill of a legendary class. The power of that deadly blow can’t be endured. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Of course, the power of his skill is great, but I’m more interested in that blue greatsword. Looking back at the target processing, didn’t Grid use the blue greatsword to logout the rankers? It’s clear that the blue greatsword has an excellent performance among legendary items. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 I agree. It is the so called best weapon. It would be nice if Player Grid would reveal the details of the weapon. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The experts’ analysis was correct.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even though it was a legendary item, the weapons created by Pagma's Descendant were of a different dimension.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The +9 Failure had an attack power of 1,768~3,682.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was already the best weapon at +0, so after being increased to +9 with a 70% increase in attack power, it was fully OP (overpowered).</span></p>
 <p><span style>Let’s compare it to legendary weapons of the same level. The average attack power of a powerful two-handed weapon was around 1,000, so the maximum attack power of the +9 Failure was three times stronger than that.&nbsp;</span><span style>What if 1,800% of that attack power was added due to the level two Kill?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The users could never endure it. They would just die.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was inwardly surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘The boss monsters received hundreds of thousands of damage, but for Kill to only deal 68,000 damage to Hurent... He has a lot of defense. He wasn’t just bragging.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>An Aura Master didn’t need weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to that, Hurent was able to spend more money on armor compared to other users, and he had the highest ranked unique armor.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yet he died in one blow?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Heok...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The logged out Hurent jumped out of the capsule.&nbsp;</span><span style>His complexion was pale, like a person who just had a nightmare. His whole body was sweaty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What on earth happened?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel handed a towel to the confused Hurent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You lost."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent couldn’t believe it.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had no idea that he would lose to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He gazed absentmindedly and recalled the fight. Then he smiled bitterly.</span></p>
 <p><span style> “Yes... Indeed, that’s a legendary class.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His control had been helpless in front of that strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>What was that CC skill that completely restrained his body, despite maintaining a perfect distance of 5m?&nbsp;</span><span style>He wasn’t able to control himself and received a linked skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was crushed by strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yes, like a fly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Legendary skills...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was something he didn’t have yet.&nbsp;</span><span style>He needed to strengthen the rating of his aura to legendary more quickly through training.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent felt motivated instead of frustrated.&nbsp;</span><span style>His expression was refreshed as he wiped at his sweat with the towel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Since I have become the loser, the reporters won’t bother me for a while. I think I should abandon other activities and focus on hunting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would only become strong through training.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel gave his personal opinion. "</span><span style>The problem is the blue shark-shaped greatsword that Grid is using. Its performance transcends imagination.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent admitted it.&nbsp;</span><span style>No matter the skill rating, wasn’t the damage too high? It was useless without a basic high attack power.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s weapon was certainly high class.&nbsp;</span><span style>But why did Lauel say that?&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent was puzzled as he saw the Lauel looked determined.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You... Perhaps, are you going to follow Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel didn’t deny it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s correct.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was sick of the title of rookie.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to quickly jump to the top of the rankers.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he started too late. When he was level 1, the top rankers were already level 180. Talent alone couldn’t cover that gap.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to catch up with them...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I have seen the power of items through this match.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel was one of the 10 Rookies.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even now, Ibellin of the Tzedakah Guild has set Lauel as his rival.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will join the Tzedakah Guild.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>2nd on the unified rankings, Zibal.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had the ambition to occupy all the territories of Satisfy and become Satisfy’s ruler.&nbsp;</span><span style>But in order to do that, he needed the strongest players and at the moment, he was eyeing Lauel. He offered shocking treatment to Lauel when inviting him to the guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Lauel was going to turn him down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lauel, didn’t the Snake Guild promise you millions of gold? Is it worth rejecting such an astronomical sum to follow Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lauel nodded without hesitation.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Don’t you now know better than anyone else? You can’t ignore the fact that combat sense and control isn’t special. The most important aspect of a game is items.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Millions of gold?&nbsp;</span><span style>What would he do with that?&nbsp;</span><span style>No matter how much money he had, he couldn’t buy the strongest items.&nbsp;</span><span style>In Satisfy, Grid was the only one who could create the most powerful items.&nbsp;</span><span style>His power was necessary in order for Lauel to become a top ranked player. Basically, Lauel had a great liking towards Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Items rather than control... I’m envious of Grid, who made me realize the simplicity and greatness of it. I am fascinated by the strength that logged you out in just 5 seconds. I would like to play the game with him. How about you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zibal also invited Hurent to join his guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Hurent had high pride as a sword saint candidate and was reluctant to go under someone else.&nbsp;</span><span style>Therefore, he hadn’t responded to Zibal’s invitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He experienced Grid’s power directly and once he heard Lauel’s words, he started to move.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to become stronger, items were needed.&nbsp;</span><span style>In order to obtain those items...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There is no answer except for Grid.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>But his pride didn’t tolerate it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...I’m an Aura Master. The strongest items? They’re useless in front of me.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Later, his aura would become a legendary rating.&nbsp;</span><span style>“At that time, I will cut down Grid and his blue greatsword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The next time they met, he would logout Grid before Grid could even use a skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent vowed.&nbsp;</span><span style>He left the stadium and headed straight to Incheon International Airport.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was ready to return to the US and pour all his efforts into building up his strength.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Amazing."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The French representative, Bondre.&nbsp;</span><span style>The 11th ranked user considered Grid’s skills. No, he marvelled at them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Logging out Hurent in just 5 seconds?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He never even imagined it.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he didn’t feel threatened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The Restraint and Transcended Link skills are somewhat burdensome.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bondre’s class was an ice mystic.&nbsp;</span><span style>What if he froze the entire ground with overwhelming magic power?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s sword dances wouldn’t be able to be properly enacted.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pagma’s Swordsmanship needed at least four steps to be activated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could that guy dance properly on frozen ground? It would be lucky if he didn’t fall on his ass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Looking back at the Bairan battle, he has an artifact that can help him fly.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>What if Grid flew up to avoid the ice on the floor?&nbsp;</span><span style>Bondre would feel even more comfortable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The PvP stage was an island.&nbsp;</span><span style>The atmosphere was filled with moisture. If he froze all that moisture, Grid would be trapped in the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>The physical constraints of the ice webs meant they couldn’t be broken with CC immunity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘An island is the perfect stage for me. Grid, you can never beat me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Absolute Zero Lv.2 (76.0%)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Freezes the target and deals a fixed damage of 42,000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Mana consumption: 50% of your current mana.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Casting Time: 7 seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: 20 minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the ultimate skill he learned from an S-grade magic book.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura’s Divine Punishment that she showed in the target processing looked miserable compared to this. The casting time was incredibly long, so he didn’t have many opportunities to use it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it was different in a one-on-one duel. If he could completely restrain his opponent’s actions, he could use it as a winning card.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was superior in terms of damage compared to Divine Punishment because it was a single target skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was this Absolute Zero skill that made Yura and Hurent lose to Bondre.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Assuming that Grid is level 290, his health must be... No, it isn’t possible even when assuming the worst.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s health must be 35,000 or less.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This time you will be the one to die in one blow. Kukukuk...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bondre laughed with joy.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would meet with Grid in the round of 16.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would prove he was the strongest by completely overwhelming Grid, who logged Hurent out in five seconds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bondre was confident.&nbsp;</span><span style>Just like Hurent, a few minutes ago.</span></p>
