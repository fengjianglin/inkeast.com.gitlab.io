 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The peak of two billion users, Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hao had met him before.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was one year ago in Elgad Forest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elgad’s Forest.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the time, the users in the top 100 rankings had to form a party of at least seven rankers to hunt in the forest.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel was playing solo there.&nbsp;</span><span style>He slaughtered the killer spiders and butterflies in Elgad’s Forest alone, and Hao realized it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is a mountain that can’t be climbed.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The dimensions they were in were completely different.&nbsp;</span><span style>The battle sense that perfectly used the terrain, as well as the godly control skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hao couldn’t even think ‘I want to be like that.’&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel was an awe-inspiring figure and a wall that couldn’t be surpassed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hao was praised as a genius, and this was the first time he got a sense of inferiority.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was in Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>The mysterious farmer fighting Seuron.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hao could see it.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had repeated Kraugel’s moves that he saw one year ago over and over in his head.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was able to match Kraugel’s movements to the farmer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"White Light Sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A large-scale attack skill that caused blindness was triggered. Hao stood still as he closed his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he opened his eyes to see Seuron turn into a grey light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha... haha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hao could only laugh.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel easily handled Seuron, who was on the same level as Hao.&nbsp;</span><span style>Indeed, the sky above the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel was still strong. No, he became stronger.&nbsp;</span><span style>His legs trembled as he felt a thrill again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Run away.”&nbsp;</span><span style>He commanded the guild members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Invade Reidan?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was impossible.&nbsp;</span><span style>As long as Kraugel was here, it was an impregnable fortress.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Run away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Hades Guild retreated.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Should we just let them go?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel replied,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Then should we chase them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Um... There is no need.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no reason to pursue those running away.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were farmers, not Reidan’s guardian knights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>They just needed to protect the fields.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don’t need to fight.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>Reidan’s defense was left to Grid and the Overgeared Guild, not their problem.&nbsp;</span><span style>They became involved in the battle in the first place due to Piaro. Reidan was unharmed. It would’ve been big if they hadn’t moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Anyway, it’s okay now.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was also a bit proud at helping protect Grid’s estate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“By the way, who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian was well aware of Seuron’s fame.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was evaluated to be stronger than Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damien wondered about the identity of the farmer who easily defeated him. The straw hat that hadn’t been taken off over the past week was especially annoying today.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel smiled.&nbsp;</span><span style>"You aren’t the type of person who will be interested.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian didn’t deny it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian was only obsessed with Rebecca’s Daughters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit! You damn bastards! They’re running away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How rotten! I won’t step foot on this land again!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the Hades Guild quietly escaped from the farmer, the Golden Guild also started to run away. They knew they weren’t in a position to defend the guild’s honor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bland, who was eating his third rainbow potato, expressed his anxiety.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Isn’t dinner time over? Do we have to starve this evening?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian and Kraugel felt sorry for Bland.&nbsp;</span><span style>They heard he was from a prestigious noble family, but the stress of being taken hostage must be quite large.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Box, the Snake Guild’s chief of staff.&nbsp;</span><span style>The first ranked linker was the last survivor of the Snake Guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This ability is very interesting. It is really great that you can blend the skills of your colleagues, making them more powerful and efficient.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro complimented, but Box wasn’t glad.&nbsp;</span><span style>Many of his colleagues killed earlier were also highly praised. But they were eventually killed.&nbsp;</span><span style>In any case, he would die.&nbsp;</span><span style>Box tried a last hurrah. The linker’s ultimate skill, Puppet, was deployed as he tried to control Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it was useless.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro had grown further through this battle. He approached before Box could use the skill and overpowered him. Even if the skill was activated, he couldn’t be controlled by Box.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The hand plow was covered by a colourless qi and stuck in Box’s forehead.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘Dying by a hand plow!’ It was the moment when the 275th protagonist of the rumor was born.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“K... Kuock...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Box turned into grey light.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro’s eyes were as deep as the sea as he watched silently.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro had grown steadily since he began his field work in Reidan, and he gained enormous awareness based on today’s battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m not Muller.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right. He was Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noble of the Saharan Empire, Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Captain of the Red Knights, Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Traitor Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Swordsman Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Farmer Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro, friend of Grid, the Overgeared Guild, Kraugel, Damian, and Bland.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, he was Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was distinctly different from Muller.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was no need to follow Muller’s specter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am enough by myself.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Shaaaaaah.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The light from the two moons shining on Piaro’s body was reminiscent of the Milky Way.&nbsp;</span><span style>An intense and unsteady energy rose, causing the atmosphere to shake around Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this moment, Piaro became a legend.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was it the sword saint status he had been craving?</span></p>
 <p><span style>No.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro already deemed that a ‘sword’ wasn’t necessary.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was able to achieve a lot with a whole range of agricultural equipment such as a hand plow, sickle and hoe.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was no need to be obsessed with the title of sword saint.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A legendary farmer has been born!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Every farmer in the world will look up to him and praise him!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>The notification window about the birth of a new legend appeared in front of all the users connected to Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was breaking news in the international media.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Damian and Kraugel saw Piaro’s evolution directly and were confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why a farmer?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro was a swordsman.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he became a farmer...</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was shocking.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Piaro was happy.&nbsp;</span><span style>What did it matter if he was a farmer or sword saint?&nbsp;</span><span style>He was already enough.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was no need to discuss titles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pagma... Were you also like me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The great swordsman who became a legendary blacksmith, Pagma.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro smiled at the thought.&nbsp;</span><span style>A farmer was supreme.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he plowed the land, the land would become fertile.&nbsp;</span><span style>When he wielded the farming equipment, he could destroy hundreds of enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The new legends were a blacksmith and a farmer.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Pant pant... Shit, it’s hard to move.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The desert at night was cold enough to freeze their bones.&nbsp;</span><span style>The morale of the surviving Golden Guild was completely low as they crossed the desert.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘We were hit by a farmer.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Surely they won’t chase us?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The confusion and fear from the unrealistic experience became increasingly heavy.&nbsp;</span><span style>The endless desert made the Golden Guild nervous.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwaaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kyaooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Giant worms and desert toads constantly appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit...! If only Master was here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Golden Guild just barely managed to win against a giant worm. For those with an average level below 230, the western monsters were too strong.&nbsp;</span><span style>They once again realized how strong Seuron was.&nbsp;</span><span style>What type of monster was that farmer to kill Seuron...?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Pay attention! Or else we will be wiped out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Golden Guild were filled with a desire to live.&nbsp;</span><span style>They gritted their teeth and fought the monsters continuously.&nbsp;</span><span style>But there were some things that couldn’t be overcome by effort alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the end, there were less than 100 survivors of the Golden Guild remaining. Those who survived had almost all their health, mana and stamina gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Where did it go wrong?&nbsp;</span><span style>Why was one of the strongest guilds in Satisfy suffering like this?&nbsp;</span><span style>As all of them fell into deep despair, someone muttered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We shouldn’t touch Grid...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Golden Guild members hadn’t even seen Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid was the cause of all of this.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was expanding his forces, so the seven guilds felt the need to contain him and invaded Reidan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>The result was this.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were screwed.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their fear of Grid grew.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Golden Guild members were now sick of even seeing the initial G.&nbsp;</span><span style>They pledged several times that they wouldn’t step on Grid’s shadow in the future.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuooooh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Something huge was flying in the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>A red drake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Golden Guild members were exhausted to the limit, and now they were being troubled by a drake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Keep your formations!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aaaagh!"</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It lost some of its majesty after the advent of Noe, but the drake was still classified as the strongest pet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>As it shot out fire, the cooled down sand of the desert burned red.&nbsp;</span><span style>Three men appeared before the Golden Guild, who were screaming in the sea of fire.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were familiar people to the Golden Guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These bastards... Are they already going back after destroying Reidan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A distraught bald man flushed red.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He was extremely angry as he wielded his axe at the Golden Guild.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“V-Vantner...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first ranked guardian knight.&nbsp;</span><span style>A monster that boasted an overwhelming tanking ability and had the same strength as an ogre.&nbsp;</span><span style>He defended from the attacks of the Golden Guild with a shield, then slaughtered the members with twin axes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The destructive power of Beast Master Toon was even scarier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You guys dare do something to our city! Grid’s city!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The silver wristblades became bloody in an instant. It was the blood of the Golden Guild members.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Golden Guild members were falsely accused.&nbsp;</span><span style>They would’ve felt less wronged if they really had shattered Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>But they couldn’t even invade properly, let alone shatter Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were defeated by farmers and ran away before they could even enter Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the Golden Guild members were slaughtered because it was believed that they destroyed Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A savior was needed.&nbsp;</span><span style>The eyes of the Golden Guild rolled back and forth before finding one.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unlike Vantner and Toon, Huroi was watching the situation with a fairly calm expression.&nbsp;</span><span style>He seemed to be the only rational person here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Golden Guild members asked him for assistance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huroi! Please spare us! We didn’t do any damage to Reidan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We are greatly reflecting! Please calm those two people down!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi stared at them begging and crying before speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Your parents should live a long and happy life.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a line that shouldn’t be exceeded.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was to mention parents.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Golden Guild members abused by that spiteful tongue realized it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi was worse than Vantner and Toon.</span></p>
