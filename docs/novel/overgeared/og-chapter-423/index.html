 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Before Grid raided Russia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Grid predicted, Kraugel targeted South Korea.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because among the countries that remained, South Korea had the highest score.&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, he didn’t intend to fight to kill. He planned to keep Korea in check by preventing them from concentrating on the target processing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel wasn’t in a perfect state.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yes, he was like a car out of fuel.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the same as just after his confrontation with Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>What if he faced Grid now?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel was sure that the probability of his defeat was more than 80%.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was shocking if Kraugel was to be defeated by someone, but Kraugel knew.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wasn’t invincible.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, Grid was strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel stopped moving through the forest.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the sky above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>The golden hands holding weapons were handling the targets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘...The God Hands.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>South Korea’s score was slowly but steadily rising. Kraugel realized that it was thanks to the God Hands.&nbsp;</span><span style>He looked around and confirmed that there were no signs of Grid. He had to neutralize the God Hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>'Indeed, destroying them is impossible.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The God Hands were ridiculously durable.&nbsp;</span><span style>After being hard by White Fang, causing them to stiffen for 2~3 seconds was the limit.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bururu.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The God Hands’ protection system was activated. They started targeting Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The Sword Mastery skill is attached?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The God Hands had grown compared to when he faced them in Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were stronger and faster.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel guessed that the God Hands could hunt level 200 monsters alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were really great items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, it was the private item of Pagma's Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Will a sword saint have an item only for them?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel imagined it as he avoided the attacks of the God Hands in a relaxed manner.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was like a professional boxer facing four elementary school children.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the God Hands were drawn to him, South Korea’s score had completely stopped.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Kraugel jumped with surprise.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because Russia had been increasing the gap from South Korea, only for their score to suddenly stop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It can’t be!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel felt like he had been hit in the back of the head.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was clear that someone attacked Russia while he was away, and that someone was likely to be Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Go back.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel determined that it was impossible for Russia’s representatives to deal with Grid and was going to return.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tatang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Around 120 meters to the rear.&nbsp;</span><span style>A sniper shot came from behind a huge rock.&nbsp;</span><span style>A bullet made of magic power.&nbsp;</span><span style>Based on the direction of the sound and the wind, Kraugel predicted the point of impact.&nbsp;</span><span style>He moved his waist and avoided the magic bullet.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The tree behind Kraugel exploded, the shockwave causing Kraugel’s long ponytail to become a mess.&nbsp;</span><span style>It revealed his face that was as beautiful as a sculpture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 As expected from Kraugel! This is the control skill of the 1st ranked user! As long as it isn’t a definitive attack, he can avoid almost all of it! &nbsp;』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 I received some statistics just now. In this target processing match, Kraugel avoided a total of 502 out of 537 non-targeted skills... Heok, is this data wrong? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 He has gone beyond the realm of a human... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The former 5th ranked Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite her appearance and her hidden class, the world was only focused on Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura one of the most popular women in the world, was only a supporting figure when placed next to Kraugel, the peak of two billion users.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 How long will Yura grab Kraugel’s ankle? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Currently, Kraugel is in a tired state. Since she was the 5th ranked user, shouldn’t Yura be able to hold on for five minutes? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 No. Since the old days, Yura was vulnerable to close combat. She can only withstand for one minute. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the commentators and experts speculated, Kraugel rushed towards Yura with White Fang.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kruagel was convinced that Yura was a gunman, so he focused on narrowing the distance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura planned to buy time while running away, but...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Fast!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel’s speed was much faster than expected.&nbsp;</span><span style>The actual speed of movement was similar to Yura, but Kraugel grasped the forest terrain in an instant and minimized his movements, making it more efficient.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel caught up to Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this time, the God Hands had completely left Grid’s sphere of influence. Therefore, they no longer targeted Kraugel and were forced to return to Grid’s inventory.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel wielded White Fang without any hesitation.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura defended with Alex’s Magic Engineering Gun in rifle mode and shuddered.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel’s white sword had gone over the top of the barrel and stabbed into her heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A truth that everyone overlooked was that Kraugel’s greatest strength wasn’t his control skill, but his ridiculously high level.&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to the &nbsp;gap in level, there was a bonus to the attack power, defense resistance and accuracy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura had just reached level 260 and wasn’t able to cope with Kraugel who was level 343. She suffered great damage.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel was surprised by this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You, why is your level so low?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura was 5th on the unified rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style>Half a year ago, she had already crossed level 300.&nbsp;</span><span style>But looking at the damage that Yura received, she didn’t seem to have experienced her third stats awakening yet. She was just a paper body, despite the excellent condition of her armor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>What would make her level drop so drastically?&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel was feeling confused when Yura whispered in his ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe that one day you will know why.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel hurriedly moved back.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura’s magic gun suddenly transformed into a sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>The barrel divided into four and a blue blade emerged.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The aim was Kraugel’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style>The sword left a wound on his left eye, causing blood to flow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The owner of the second legendary class, Yura.&nbsp;</span><span style>Like a flower blossoming, the blue light of the sword illuminated the strong will in her eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel’s black eyes sank coldly while the commentators were extremely excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Yura has dealt a wound to Kraugel! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Yura’s strength can’t be ignored! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 What is Yura’s weapon? How did the magic gun turn into a sword? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>General magic engineering guns only supported rifle mode and pistol mode.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Yura’s magic gun changed into a sword, making the commentators feel disbelief.&nbsp;</span><span style>The experts speculated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 It’s a magic engineering gun made by dwarves. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 It’s likely that Yura has travelled to the dwarf city of Talima. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 However, this isn’t a card that will upset the battlefield. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura was presumed to have obtained the gunman hidden class. She didn’t possess the Sword Mastery skill. In the first place, swordsmanship was out of the question for a black magician.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was what the experts thought, but...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Chaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Surprisingly, Yura’s swordsmanship was at a good level.&nbsp;</span><span style>She fought back and directly received Kraugel’s counterattacks.&nbsp;</span><span style>The spectacular effects that occurred when the two people crossed swords dazzled the viewers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But this tense confrontation didn’t last long.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura’s swordsmanship wasn’t comparable to Kraugel, and above all, their level and stats difference was too great.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After throwing away Yura’s sword, Kraugel raised his sword vertically.&nbsp;</span><span style>He put his knee on Yura’s shoulder and held the handle of his sword.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the precursor of ‘Jajinmori.’ (TL: only thing I could find was related to music, basically the fastest tempo.)</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was kicked in the chest and Yura rushed away. Kraugel tried to hit her by throwing a secondary weapon.&nbsp;</span><span style>But at this time, he felt an intense energy from the rear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Yura grabbed Kraugel’s attention, Peak Sword aimed for a surprise attack from the rear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Draw Sword, Sudden.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Piing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Once Peak Sword’s sword was pulled out, there was a sharp burst of energy and it suddenly flew at Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Fast.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the first place, drawing sword techniques weren’t easy to avoid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Even Kraugel, with his keen senses and insight, wasn’t able to avoid the skill that was used with perfect timing.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Cough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sword penetrated Kraugel’s chest, causing him to cough up blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Dangerous.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment this thought crossed his mind, the figure of his mother appeared in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'...Stand up.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel was at the last of his strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura turned her weapon back into pistol mode and fired magic bullets at him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Pepepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel’s body was consecutively hit by magic bullets.&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword recovered his sword and prepared for his next attack.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Kraugel used ‘True Clouds’.&nbsp;</span><span style>A blue cloud-like haze covered the area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can’t see.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura and Peak Sword were nervous because they could see Kraugel within the clouds. They didn’t know when and where Kraugel would appear to attack them.&nbsp;</span><span style>After 20 seconds, Kraugel didn’t attack them and the clouds completely disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had run away.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because the continuous battles had pushed Kraugel’s stamina and mana to the depleted state.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel decided to survive and maintain Russia’s score, keeping the silver medal, rather than kill Yura and Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then 20 minutes later.&nbsp;</span><span style>South Korea scored 400 points and the target processing match was automatically stopped.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>『 The 2nd Satisfy National Competition, there was an upset from the very first event! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;The shocking drop of the United States and the rise of South Korea, Russia, and Japan.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Zibal is weak, Kraugel is strong. The gap between the 1st and 2nd ranked users is like the difference between heaven and earth?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;The tearful struggle of Russia’s only survivor, Kraugel... After keeping Canada in check, he won the silver medal.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Grid, an attack power and defense that surpassed the nerf.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;(Review) Let’s analyze Grid’s items in depth.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;(Column) Maybe the real strongest person is Damian?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;The Rebecca Church’s pope has deified Grid... I hope Goddess Rebecca’s jealousy won’t turn to Grid.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Is Damian really Korean instead of Japanese?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;The collapse of China, which was proud of being Asia’s strongest country.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Greece and Britain fought the entire time, and couldn’t even handle one target... The people of both countries are blaming Regas and Seuron.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Canada’s Vantner and Chris conflicted with each other, causing them to eventually miss the silver medal.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Bondre and Bubat are people of the past.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;Tarma had zero presence. Are the rumors exaggerated, or is Grid too strong?&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>&lt;(Column) The gap between second and third advancement classes is greater than expected.&gt;</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the opening day finished.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a brief press conference and the players returned to their rooms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shang X Lila Hotel.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Korean representatives were gathered in Grid’s room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Amazing! Amazing! Korea won the gold medal at a team event. No one would’ve imagined it!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword shouted excitedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is all thanks to Grid, Yura, and Peak Sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’m sorry that we were no help to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hah, we are useless. We were completely disruptive...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kyunghook, Sumin, and Jinhee couldn’t lift their heads. The proud people trembled from their helplessness.&nbsp;</span><span style>The atmosphere suddenly sank.&nbsp;</span><span style>Surprisingly, the one to encourage them wasn’t Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, this result is due to all of us. If all of you weren’t present, we wouldn’t have won the gold medal.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had been despised for incompetence his whole life.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s why he knew.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There are no worthless people in the world. Everyone has their own personality and talent. Always have pride in yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as a human saw themselves as unnecessary, their lives would be at risk.&nbsp;</span><span style>Their self-esteem would collapse and they couldn’t overcome misfortunes due to their misery.&nbsp;</span><span style>Just like the Grid of the past.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The smiling Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>As the protagonist of the gold medal, he wasn’t arrogant and shared his achievements with everyone. Yura felt that he had matured.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was interesting and pleasant to watch a man who was becoming an adult day by day.</span></p>
