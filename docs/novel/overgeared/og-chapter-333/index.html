 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>1st Prince Ren’s expedition to Reidan had to proceed in secret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Spreading the news would allow Grid time to respond.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ren secretly recruited his army by organizing small number of troops and moving through through the estates of the nobles.&nbsp;</span><span style>It took a lot of time due to that, but Ren didn’t hesitate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was right to be prudent.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The day before Grid’s son, Lord, was born.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a big disturbance in the fortified city of Patrian.&nbsp;</span><span style>1st Prince Ren visited the city with 7,000 troops.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I greet the prince.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Ashur greeted him.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had the strength to control the balance of the world, but he did his duty as someone loyal to the nation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Earl, you don’t need to do this. Get up. Come on."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Ren was uncomfortable.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even the prince of a kingdom couldn’t afford to go against a great magician. It was the same in the empire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Ashur asked him,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Why has the prince visited this place with an army?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Ren explained honestly. He intended to from the beginning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Unfortunately, the king’s life won’t last much longer. I feel like as part of my duty to the stability of the kingdom and the royal family, I have decided to strike at Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Ashur had also heard rumors about what Grid had said at the rewards ceremony after the golem invasion. He understood the feelings and position of Prince Ren.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he was confused.&nbsp;</span><span style>The wicked Grid was holding his son hostage.&nbsp;</span><span style>His son might be in danger if Reidan was invaded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Ren saw Earl Ashur’s worried face and opened his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'm well aware of your situation. Your son Bland is being held hostage in Reidan? Several months ago, Duke Grid used this weakness so that you would help him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Ashur couldn’t say anything.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was too proud to admit the fact that one of the continent’s 10 great magicians was in someone else’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Ren looked at him.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I will surely defeat Duke Grid and rescue Sir Bland. Trust me and cooperate with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you have a good plan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Ren was well aware of the strength of Grid’s forces.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then what was this confidence?&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Ashur showed interest and Prince Ren introduced a few people to him.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the Royal Knights commander, Chucksley, and other people, including Hurent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Ashur was amazed as he examined their faces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Prince Ren had such a network?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Recently, Chucksley was in the spotlight for shooting down three flying birds with one arrow.&nbsp;</span><span style>The kingdom’s influential figures were following Ren.&nbsp;</span><span style>Among them were users (those who received the blessing of God), such as Hurent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their power was hard for even Earl Ashur to gauge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ren explained to him,&nbsp;</span><span style>"The ideal thing would be for you to personally join my army, but... Duke Grid could hurt Bland. I can’t ask that of you, so please do me a favor. Teleport 3,000 of my soldiers to the Altes Mountains.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Altes Mountains!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strictly speaking, it was the territory of the Saharan Empire located to the west of Reidan. It was the exact opposite position to Patrian, which was to the east of Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A diversion?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, the 4,000 soldiers will cross the desert and draw Duke Grid’s eyes, while 3,000 soldiers will attack from the rear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reidan had many excellent talents, but there were only 1,000 soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style>A diversion was highly likely to work. It wasn’t bad.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Earl Ashur found it hard to answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Teleporting 3,000 people?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It might be possible for the legendary Braham, but it was hard for Earl Ashur.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘2,000 soldiers might be possible.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would consume all his magic power at once and would probably receive a serious injury.&nbsp;</span><span style>It would be difficult to use magic for at least a fortnight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Ren kneeled and looked up at Ashur.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I know that this is an unreasonable demand. But please, for the royal family. No, for the sake of this kingdom and Sir Bland.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The prince of a kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style>The heir to the throne was kneeling while thousands of soldiers watched on.&nbsp;</span><span style>If Earl Ashur rejected this, it was clear that his reputation would be the worst.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Ashur realized.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘1st Prince... He is quiet sly, unlike his pure and decent appearance.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now Earl Ashur realized how he could acquire so many talents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yes, he will be able to deal with that evil Grid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Earl Ashur laughed.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was elated by Prince Ren’s plan and answered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand. I will follow your will. However, my lowly ability can only teleport 2,000 troops.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That alone is good enough! Thank you!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Ren was thrilled to tears.&nbsp;</span><span style>Earl Ashur knew the tears were false, but the soldiers were different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Waaaaahhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hooray 1st Prince!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hooray Earl Ashur!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The morale of the army has risen. The stats of all soldiers will rise by 5% and the stamina consumption rate will decrease. This effect will continue as long as morale doesn’t fall.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was auspicious.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent smiled at the notification window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The great magician who grabbed the ankles of the seven guilds is helping me. How about it? Bunny Bunny. Do you feel the difference between me and the seven guilds?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would get revenge on Grid and get rid of his humiliation in front of the whole world.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent took Bunny Bunny, the best gaming BJ in the world, with him to fulfill that.&nbsp;</span><span style>Bunny Bunny, who had been recording the whole process with his camera, raised his thumb. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"I must admit that there is a clear difference.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, this situation was Prince Ren’s achievement, but Hurent ignored that.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent had the vision to recognize Prince Ren’s skill and accept the quest.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Karin</span></p>
 <p><span style>Age: 21 &nbsp;Gender: Female</span></p>
 <p><span style>Occupation: Soldier</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: Royman</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pseudonym used since she started pretending to be male. She really feels like a man, so her confidence increased and her strength increased by 5%. However, her charm is greatly reduced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: New Star of the West</span></p>
 <p><span style>A genius that represents the region. Her level and abilities will rise 20% faster than normal. In the ‘desert’ terrain, all stats will increase by 150%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Title: Watched by a Legend</span></p>
 <p><span style>She has attracted the attention of the legend Piaro. He has given her private lessons under the guise of military training. The rise in stats is very large and it is highly possible to acquire new skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strength: 630 (▲) &nbsp;&nbsp;Stamina: 331 (▲)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agility: 655 (▲) Intelligence: 99 (▲)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Belief: 10</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skills: Beginner Bow Mastery (F), Beginner Shield Mastery (F), Intermediate Sword Mastery (D), Farming (B), Prestigious Pedigree (A), Life Saving Sword (S)</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the days when Reidan was called the second capital, Karin was born the daughter of Reidan’s greatest warrior.&nbsp;</span><span style>She trained in swordsmanship for a long time and dreamed of becoming a knight like her brothers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But 10 years ago, Reidan became a desert, and her dreams were shattered.&nbsp;</span><span style>She lost her father to the monsters that constantly appeared, and her brothers disappeared in the vampire cities. Their status was unclear and her family fell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No, it is correct to say that all of Reidan fell.&nbsp;</span><span style>Since then, Karin has been living every day waiting for her brothers to return.&nbsp;</span><span style>She is truly grateful to Duke Grid for restoring Reidan and giving her time to wait for her brothers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She even abandoned her sex in order to do her best as a soldier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid trembled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s really amazing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A named NPC with no limit on how their stats could increase.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was very difficult to build a relationship with these people. He heard it was more likely to win the lottery.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, named NPCs kept appearing around Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘My luck is getting stronger!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid thought this, but it was hard to see it simply as luck.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was simple when considering Grid’s current status.&nbsp;</span><span style>A legendary blacksmith and duke of a kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style>The number of people he had was still small, but he had unshakable power.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was natural for talent to gather around this power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But to think she was a woman.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was quite pretty.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her skin was rough and her hair was short, but her thick lips and long eyelashes were attractive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Woman?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro expressed doubts about Grid’s words.&nbsp;</span><span style>Woman? Royman? That excellent soldier?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was ridiculous.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the moment Grid was about to explain to the disbelieving Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Right? She is...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duke Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royman fell to her knees. She looked up at Grid with mournful eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am a man! My dream is to become a knight and then a soldier, becoming a good man at your side!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>So please keep this a secret.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid understood the implications.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a joke, a joke. Rather, I have a gift for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid opened his inventory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the inventory, 31 sets of ‘Mass Production Grid Set’ were listed by type. In fact, he had over 100 sets but they were left in the warehouse due to their weight. Everything he put in the warehouse were normal~rare rated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, the Grid sets in his inventory had an average of an epic rating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Now, take this."</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gave Royman a unique rated set with the highest completion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"U-Unbelievable."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The duke was personally giving her battle gear?&nbsp;</span><span style>The emotional Royman accepted the battle gear. Grid looked at her tearful eyes and urged her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Go ahead and put it on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royman held the Grid set in her arms and ran into the barracks.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro didn’t like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That kid always changes his clothes secretly. It’s one of his few shortcomings.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid heard that Piaro had no experience with dating. It seemed like he didn’t have a sense for women and couldn’t distinguish a man from a woman.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid couldn’t say anything.&nbsp;</span><span style>He never would’ve thought Royman was a girl if he hadn’t checked her details.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is amazing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royman ran out in grey armor made of steel and black iron.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it good?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Not good, it’s great! I have never seen such great battle gear since I was born! Three times...! No, I feel four times stronger!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That is being overgeared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Overgeared...! I don’t know what that means, but it’s really amazing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Royman’s tone kept rising due to her excitement. She couldn’t hide her female tone and Piaro frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style>Piaro determined that it was a top priority to raise Royman’s masculinity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you are four time stronger, the intensity of your training should be increased by four times.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? A-Are you serious?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Have I ever spoken in vain?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was already working twice as hard as other soldiers and even had to do field work at dawn, now she was going to get more training? And by four times?&nbsp;</span><span style>Royman couldn’t help feeling afraid. She was like a frightened puppy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Piaro had no mercy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jump! Run straight up Altes Mountains!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A-Altes Mountains! It will take two days just getting there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>" We will be back by tomorrow morning!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“P-Piaro!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro was full of motivation and Royman started her suffering as she began to run.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was anxiety on Grid’s face as he looked at them moving away.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thinking about it again, didn’t Royman have the Farming skill?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Surely the special group doesn’t have something to do with farming?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No way.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had a bad thought.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid left this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, Altes Mountains.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pahat!</span></i> <i><span style>Pa pa pa pa pak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Thousands of rays of light fell.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent and Bunny Bunny were at the forefront of the 2,000 troops that appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The great Hurent’s play, I want you to capture it on camera.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe, please leave it to me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The humiliated Hurent getting revenge on Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>As long as he recorded this clearly and broadcasted it, Bunny Bunny could become rich overnight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I wish that there would be many cool scenes!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wanted to capture the brilliant battlefield where strong players fought and skills ran rampant.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Bunny Bunny’s desire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I hope you can clear the fields here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Piaro, why are you taking out a hand plow all of a sudden?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is part of the training. And while doing field work, take off your armor. Feel nature with your flesh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The spectacular sight of Hurent and Bunny Bunny’s army appeared in the distance.</span></p>
