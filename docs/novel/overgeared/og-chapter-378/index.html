 <p><span style>Chapter 378</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>There were 17 nations on the West Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the number of people and users from these 17 nations were added up, the population of the West Continent was in the billions.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lord was considered the foremost genius among them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lord’s learning ability, speed of development, and thinking power clearly went beyond common sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But blacksmithing wasn’t easy.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Dung!</span></i> <i><span style>Dung dung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been less than 100 days since Lord was born.&nbsp;</span><span style>Tapping minerals with a light hammer wouldn’t affect it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lord’s innate dexterity was high, but he had no experience and his strength was low.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Puhut.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who knew that his son could make such a face?&nbsp;</span><span style>Lord was sweating, but he couldn’t get any results from the hammering.&nbsp;</span><span style>Things didn’t go the way he wanted, so he puffed up his cheeks in a cute and lovely manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid stroked Lord’s dark hair that resembled his and called out to a blacksmith.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Bring me some clay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the command of Duke Grid, lord of Reidan and a legendary blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span style>The blacksmith immediately ran and grabbed some clay.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Abuuuu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His father looked wonderful when ordering people around.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lord looked at his father with eyes full of envy.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this moment, Lord was determined to learn how to speak as soon as possible.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t know this and handed his son the clay.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You don’t have to make anything useful right away. Hammer at this to figure out the form.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Bubu! Buuu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord started complaining at his father’s words.&nbsp;</span><span style>His ego was bruised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Bububu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m not a four or five year old child. I can’t play with clay!’ Grid was embarrassed by Lord’s attitude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you have a high pride like Irene?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had a noble lineage.&nbsp;</span><span style>Khan approached as Grid was clicking his tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huhu, isn’t it easy to teach the young lord?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The child has my natural dexterity, but as you can see, he’s too young to refine the minerals.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s natural. Genius doesn’t mean everything. The young lord won’t be able to deal with fire and minerals until he’s at least 12 years old. You have to teach him step by step.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Huff!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lord’s eyes twitched.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kasim glimpsed it from where he was hiding in the darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Heok... Lord is provoked.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kasim had been teaching Lord for over two months, so he fully saw through Lord’s character.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lord had a strong pride and was full of commitment to fulfill that desire.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lord never retreated from anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ba! Abubu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The excited Lord clamored at Grid and Khan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid and Khan didn’t understand Lord’s words, but Kasim understood exactly what he meant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Rather than 12 years old, you will become a blacksmith by 2 years old?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wait, then when will you practice my master, Lantier’s, techniques?&nbsp;</span><span style>Lord gazed at the worried Kasim.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would try his best to prevent any disruption to the existing schedule.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Hrmm... Lord might be able to do it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kasim didn’t place Lord in the category of a genius. He recognized Lord as a transcendent being beyond the realm of a human.&nbsp;</span><span style>Therefore, he didn’t see Lord’s determination as a bluff.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What does he keep saying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huhu, he is saying that he loves you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haha, is that it, Lord? I love you too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahh! Abuuuu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike Kasim, Grid and Khan spent less time with Lord.&nbsp;</span><span style>The two people didn’t understand what Lord meant, so they just thought he was cute.&nbsp;</span><span style>From this day onward, Lord’s special training began.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The usage of alchemy was categorized into five broad categories.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <ol>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style> Production of various potions.</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style> Raising the rating of minerals.</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style> Creation of weapon and armor enhancement stones.</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style> Making special items.</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <li><span style> Giving items extra options.</span></li>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
 </ol>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>It was truly amazing.&nbsp;</span><span style>Alchemy facilities seemed absolutely useful.&nbsp;</span><span style>But what was the reality?&nbsp;</span><span style>Most kingdoms on the West Continent didn’t invest funds in alchemy.&nbsp;</span><span style>It meant that the value of alchemy was low, and there was a reason for this.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Alchemy was a field where the possibility of ‘failure’ always needed to be kept in mind.&nbsp;</span><span style>When doing certain things with alchemy, there was always a higher chance of failure than success. It also applied to the creation of potions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Reidan’s Alchemy Facility]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level: Intermediate 8.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Superb quality health and mana recovery potions can be created.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-The success rate is 36%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Advanced buff potions can be created.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-The success rate is 14%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The lowest grade to low grade minerals can be upgraded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-The success rate is 14%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* One option can be given to items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-The success rate is 1%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>One year had passed since the beginning of Overgeared’s reign in Reidan, and the Overgeared Guild has poured an enormous amount of money into alchemy.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that the revenue from Raiden, Bairan, Cork Island and the individual members of the guild were invested in the alchemy facilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it was like this.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was natural that Grid’s reaction would be cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I was expecting a lot from giving items an option, but what is the probability of success? Only 1%?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Executive Rabbit explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"As I said before, once the level of the alchemy facility reaches the advanced level, the probability of the item options will increase dramatically. Before that, I want to test it out today..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hoh, the probability will jump dramatically? What percentage will it rise to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Around 5%...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“????”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style>The value of the alchemy facility that he and his guild members plunged a lot of money into seemed absurdly low.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It is no wonder why other kingdoms don’t invest a lot of money in alchemy facilities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was too blinded by the goal of making Reidan a second Talima.&nbsp;</span><span style>Honestly, he didn’t know if it was worth it. It was almost a scam.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rabbit sent Grid a meaningful smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But Reidan has yellow mithril.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yellow mithril.&nbsp;</span><span style>A mineral that could only be mined from the mine near Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the raw mineral of fairy dust, which dramatically increased the probability of success in alchemy.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the basis for Rabbit’s claim to develop alchemy in Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I have prepared fairy dust. I want to let my lord experience it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Fairy dust has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Fairy Dust]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A powder made by refining yellow mithril at an alchemy facility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Increases the success rate of alchemy by 20%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 0.1</span></p>
 <p><span style>'20 percent...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was still a low probability.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was so regretful that he wanted to turn back the time that he invested into the alchemy facility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is true that the probability increased dramatically.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the success rate of other alchemists stayed in the single digits, Reidan had at least a 20% chance of success.&nbsp;</span><span style>Reidan was the only city on the West Continent that could demonstrate the value of alchemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were setting their feet in an area that other kingdoms couldn’t even see.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid tried to think as positively as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, I will try it once. How great will an option given to an item be?”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The best alchemist on the continent, Silverun.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had been involved in alchemy since he was a young man and poured his life into alchemy for the last 50 years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the science of alchemy wasn’t recognized anywhere, meaning Silverun couldn’t receive the environment and funds to utilize alchemy.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was like an invisible man whose existence wasn’t acknowledged by the world.&nbsp;</span><span style>Unfortunately, Silverun couldn’t find an opportunity to unfold his knowledge and talents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then one day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duke Grid of the Eternal Kingdom has heard rumors about you and is personally sending you an invitation. Duke Grid doesn’t doubt your alchemy skills. Why not spread out your wings with his support?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit came to Silverun and introduced himself as the administrator of Reidan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silverun.&nbsp;</span><span style>The best alchemist on the continent who wasn’t recognized by anyone.&nbsp;</span><span style>He lived in lonely poverty, so Duke Grid was a very special person to him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Silverun vowed.&nbsp;</span><span style>For Duke Grid’s sake, he would show the value of alchemy to the world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>...Grid didn’t know this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I greet Duke Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Reidan’s alchemy facility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silverun greeted Grid, who visited there after a long time.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a truly exaggerated greeting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Who is this person?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rabbit whispered to the puzzled Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I picked him up for My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt like this whenever he met up with Lauel and Rabbit. It truly was convenient to be with smart people.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid, who acquired another loyal person without knowing, reached out to Silverun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh...!! Ohh!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The great duke who acknowledged alchemy was holding out a hand to him?&nbsp;</span><span style>Silverun grasped Grid’s hand with his trembling fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It is so inspiring that the duke himself will visit here. I’m in tears.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was very burdensome.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid turned away from the tearful Silverun and looked around the alchemy facility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I want to give this sword a new option.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sword that Grid took out was Iyarugt.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a growth type item that could increase to the legendary rank, an ego sword that had the soul of a demon in it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Would the effect of alchemy work on special items like this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silverun gave a positive answer to the dubious Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s possible for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silverun had the best ability in this field. He was filled with confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But you should know that the level of options given to an item with intermediate alchemy ranges from a minimum of F grade to a maximum of A grade. In addition, as you know, alchemy is a discipline that always has a possibility of failure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If the option fails, will the inherent performance of the item fall?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There is no such thing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Okay, let’s try it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will guide you there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a chance to repay the grace of the master who acknowledged alchemy and Silverun.&nbsp;</span><span style>Silverun was filled with enthusiasm and showed Grid to one side of the facility.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a room that was filled with many equipment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Silverun placed Iyarugt on an altar that was located in the center.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I will start.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>An intense blue light filled the room the moment Silverun gave a signal.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the midst of this light, a notification window popped up in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You are attempting to grant a new option to Iyarugt.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Congratulations! A new option has successfully been granted.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttiring~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s face became baffled as he checked the option.</span></p>
