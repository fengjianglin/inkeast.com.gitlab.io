 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"I’m stuck at the last wall blocking my ultimate goal. I’m asking for a spar with you in order to break that wall.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hoh, the ultimate goal you are aiming at. The goal must be...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were meaningful words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro asked carefully,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Is it becoming a sword saint?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel didn’t deny it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sword Saint.&nbsp;</span><span style>It meant a saint of the sword.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>A person who reached the extremes of swordsmanship and received enlightenment was always the strongest in history.&nbsp;</span><span style>Muller, who managed to suppress and seal the bodies of the great demons like Hell Gao, Drasion, Morax, Astaroth, and Purpu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Muller, no sword saint had been born in the last 100 years.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now Kraugel was close to reaching a level that even Piaro couldn’t achieve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He has enough talent.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro had been very amazed when he first met Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because Kraugel’s talent was higher than the person who was praised as the strongest swordsman on the continent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yes, Piaro had seen through him from the beginning.&nbsp;</span><span style>If there was a person who would surpass him one day, it would surely be Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt strangely irritated after seeing Kraugel’s growth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I never even saw the threshold...’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Duguen.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Duguen!</span></i> <i><span style>Duguen!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>His heart beat wildly.&nbsp;</span><span style>The fighting spirit that had been lost since becoming a farmer was currently wriggling. This uncontrollable fighting spirit made his blood become hot like lava.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Are you qualified?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was he qualified to achieve something that even Piaro, a legend, couldn’t do?&nbsp;</span><span style>Kraugel read Piaro’s feelings from his provocative question and made a serious expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Please check it for yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Piaro was always the strongest, Kraugel was the same.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was always aware of his position as the peak of two billion users. He didn’t consider himself inferior to others, and was filled with passion and pride.&nbsp;</span><span style>For him, Piaro was a good friend as well as a mountain that must be surpassed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will apply for a spar. Do you accept?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro nodded.&nbsp;</span><span style>This would allow Kraugel to achieve the quest prerequisites.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Sword Saint]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Difficulty: SSS</span></p>
 <p><span style>Win against a legend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a simple and clear quest, assuming that he could meet a legend.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the degree of difficulty was high enough to be described as absurd.&nbsp;</span><span style>A person who wasn’t a legend had to win over a legend?&nbsp;</span><span style>This was indeed...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Interesting.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rather than grumbling or being disgusted like a regular person, he felt delighted.&nbsp;</span><span style>New challenges were necessary to increase his passion.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Hurent doubted his ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Sword saint? A sword saint! It can’t be!’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were only one other person who was a candidate for a sword saint.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent stared at the man in the straw hat.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to look at the skill of a sword saint candidate.&nbsp;</span><span style>He left the field and followed after Piaro and the man.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Stab.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hiyap!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cut.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haap!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chop.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Huriyat~!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The war 10 days ago had awakened Reidan’s soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style>Reidan’s soldiers no longer wasted time complaining during the practical training.&nbsp;</span><span style>They needed strength to protect their family, home, lover, and friends!</span></p>
 <p><span style>They couldn’t be lazy because they felt the importance of it through the war. Now, even if Asmophel didn’t force them, the soldiers enthusiastically immersed themselves in training and wanted to increase its intensity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their grudge against Grid melted away. They felt greater loyalty than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He trained them in anticipation of the enemy’s invasion, showed them a great dance on the battlefield and gave them the most powerful ‘Mass Produced Grid Set,’ so the soldiers felt respect and thanks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about it, young lord? These brave young men are soldiers of Duke Grid. Aren’t they really reliable?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asmophel asked with a confident expression.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lord sighed as he watched the soldiers’ training from within Ruby’s arms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Abu... Bububu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asmophel was stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lord’s attitude and disgruntled expression seemed like he was saying, ‘The level of the soldiers is poor.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young lord could understand his words and answered them?&nbsp;</span><span style>Furthermore, he could see the strength of the trained soldiers?&nbsp;</span><span style>No, how could a baby sigh in the first place?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘...Was I dreaming for a moment?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asmophel wasn’t convinced and felt confused in many ways. Ruby smiled at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It hasn’t even been a month since my nephew was born. How can he understand your words? Don’t pay attention to the baby’s reactions.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, he was interpreting it in the wrong way.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asmophel nodded at Ruby’s words, while Lord pointed elsewhere with his fingers.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the direction of the magic tower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Oh my, does this mean you want to see where the magicians are?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ruby asked and Lord nodded.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asmophel saw him and was terrified.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘You really are aware of our words!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He heard that Lord was a genius, but he thought it was exaggerated.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now it turned out that the rumor actually downplayed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Being able to communicate with adults less than a month after being born... There is no doubt that he will be an outstanding scholar or magician in the future.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was understandable that he should think so.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lord didn’t respond to the strong soldiers of Reidan because he didn’t have the knowledge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He was born with intelligence, not the eyes to see martial arts.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Asmophel thought this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I want to use this place, so can you ask the soldiers to leave?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro, a long-time friend and commander of Reidan, visited and asked for help.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was supposed to be doing field work at this time, so Asmophel questioned him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What will you be doing?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro pointed to the man in the straw hat who came with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I am going to spar with this friend.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asmophel detected Kraugel’s strength with one glance and expressed interest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He’s difficult to measure.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the first time he had seen this since Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asmophel checked the schedule and ordered the soldiers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Go around the desert once.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The desert around Reidan was vast, but Asmophel spoke it easily.&nbsp;</span><span style>Frankly, it was a tall order. Yet the soldiers replied enthusiastically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They would run until they died.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the current attitude of the Reidan soldiers.&nbsp;</span><span style>The soldiers got ready and left the training grounds at noon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the huge training grounds that could accommodate thousands of people only contained Piaro, Kraugel, Asmophel, Ruby, and Lord. There was a total of six people if Hurent was included.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought he had gone unnoticed, but Hurent had been caught from the beginning.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asmophel approached him as he watched from behind a huge tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Outsiders aren’t allowed in this place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent was startled.&nbsp;</span><span style>He hid himself as much as possible using aura, but he was still found in an instant?&nbsp;</span><span style>This person called Asmophel, he definitely had great skills like Piaro.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Where did Grid collect all these monsters?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent was a famous ranker, but he didn’t have much experience with named NPCs.&nbsp;</span><span style>Acquiring named NPCs as subordinates?&nbsp;</span><span style>He never even imagined it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Named NPCs had a strong influence on Satisfy’s world and each one had a distinct personality, making it hard to become friends with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent was admiring Grid when Asmophel urged him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you going to leave?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hrmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent didn’t want to step back.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to peek at the skills of the man in the straw hat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Can’t I just watch a little bit?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asmophel glanced coldly at Hurent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why should I do such a favor for an outsider?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He disliked repeating the same words.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent shrank back at his pressure. A heat spread through his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘When did I become an aura master?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>After being defeated by Grid in the 1st National Competition in five seconds, he hunted and trained repeatedly, raising his aura to the unique rating. He believed he was the strongest.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was sure he could beat the famous Kraugel and Agnus. His confidence soared into the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, his confidence crashed down after he met Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>A legendary farmer had oppressed him with three blows from a hand plow, so he had to question his own abilities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will back off...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hurent decided to retreat.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the first time in his life that he had acted as a mild sheep.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hurent swallowed down his shame and left the training ground.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t help wondering.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had always reigned as the strongest except for the 5 second event, so why was he so weak here?</span></p>
 <p><span style>This Reidan, it was extraordinary.&nbsp;</span><span style>It felt like Alice in Wonderland.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Saintess Ruby.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s sister and a high school student.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her goal was to aim for a prestigious university, so there was little time to play the game. She played for 30 minutes a day.&nbsp;</span><span style>That’s why her level was still low, despite changing to a hidden class alongside Yerim. She was a real light user.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But she had changed recently.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was since Lord was born.&nbsp;</span><span style>He might be a child in the game, but he was her cute and pretty nephew. Ruby looked at Lord and became fascinated by him.&nbsp;</span><span style>She recently spent more than an hour a day connecting to Satisfy and spending time with Lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the same today.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was enjoying a peaceful time while holding Lord in her arms.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lord was very happy to spend time with his beautiful aunt.&nbsp;</span><span style>He enjoyed his aunt’s soft and nice scent.&nbsp;</span><span style>But there was a limit for babies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hrmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord started to yawn.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the signal that it was nap time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I must go back now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was time to return to reality.&nbsp;</span><span style>It happened when Ruby was about to leave the training ground and log out.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel and Piaro clashed with each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Abu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sleepiness suddenly fled from Lord’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Abu! Abuuuu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord shouted excitedly, waving his short arms.&nbsp;</span><span style>His blue eyes shone as he watched the confrontation between Kraugel and Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asmophel was astonished when he saw it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'The young lord...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t see Reidan’s soldiers as ‘poor’ because he didn’t have the ability to see martial arts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It is because his vision was too high!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man in the straw hat wielded his sword at Piaro. And the legendary Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>The two people caught Lord’s interest.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asmophel trembled.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was difficult for him to figure out what Lord’s character would grow into later on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Abuoo-!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord was touched by the confrontation between the two people and gradually grew.&nbsp;</span><span style>The child could instinctively feel it.&nbsp;</span><span style>The fact that one of his future seven mentors was in front of him.&nbsp;</span></p>
