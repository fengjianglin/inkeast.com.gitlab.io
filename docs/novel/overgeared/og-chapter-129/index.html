 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Box discovered Toban and greeted him with a smile,&nbsp;</span><span style>"You’ve already arrived.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Box was an extremely handsome man.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had clear skin, a flattering jawline, and eyes that were sharp enough to capture a woman’s heart.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had long black hair tied up, and the harmony of his appearance and hairstyle made him seem like a young master in the oriental paintings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But there was a saying to look beyond face value. He played around too much with women.&nbsp;</span><span style>His nickname was Octopus Prince. There were rumors that he had several women on the hook at the same time. So many women had a grudge against him that female users launched a group called ‘Box Killing Group.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You’re on time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban, who was nervous after talking to the spy, welcomed Box.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he greeted Black Teddy and Asuka as well.&nbsp;</span><span style>But they lacked sociability, unlike Box. They ignored Toban’s greeting and urged immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Teddy was a man in his 40’s who was around 2m tall. Not only did he have a good physique, but he also gave off a tough impression with his eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, he always carried a cute teddy bear in his arms that didn’t fit his appearance or age.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban had met him several times, but it was still difficult to adapt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘That teddy bear...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, it was hard to look at. A large hairy hand was touching the bear’s head.&nbsp;</span><span style>The mole whispered to Toban, who was frowning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Toban, the person who knocked down the pope... He’s wearing the Holy Light Armor. I think it’s right to punish him, for the sake of our church.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The contents of the quest ‘Franz' Descendant’ has changed.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban’s expression changed as he confirmed the new contents of the quest.&nbsp;</span><span style>He explained the situation to Box’s group,&nbsp;</span><span style>"The treasures I have to recover are no longer in the Vatican. A user has intercepted them, so we have track him down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Box looked troubled.&nbsp;</span><span style>“User? Ah, I’m sure it’ll cost a lot of money. I don’t know who he is, but nobody will give away quest items for free. He will likely ask for a lot of money.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban shook his head,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Money isn’t a problem. We must fight that person. The altered quest is telling me to kill him. It seems like the treasures will drop if he is killed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Box’s color returned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? It’s good that it’s so simple.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The four people gathered here were top rankers.&nbsp;</span><span style>With their combined strength, it would be easy to defeat a user.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’ll track him down quickly.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Box was confident. Black Teddy and Asuka were sniffing like this was trivial.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban felt the need to make them more cautious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Despite the quest contents being changed to fight a user, the difficulty is still SS. This means the opponent is strong, so we should be alert. Share the quest information.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban’s quest information appeared in front of the three of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Franz' Descendant (2)]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Difficulty Level: SS</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to the information from a spy, an enigmatic figure killed the pope alone and obtained Franz’ treasures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, he seems to be wearing Franz’ treasures.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only Franz’ descendant can wear his treasures, so Pascal’s plan to prove his authenticity is slowly fading away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Track him down and kill him!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then take away Franz’ treasures!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Conditions: Kill the enigmatic figure and reclaim the Holy Light Crown, Armor and Gloves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Clear Reward: Level +5. The Sword of Wisdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quest Failure: Pascal’s plan to become pope will be wasted. You will be hated by Pascal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Box’s expression stiffened.&nbsp;</span><span style>Black Teddy also hesitated while stroking the teddy bear.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a moment of silence.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Asuka opened her mouth for the first time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Even I can’t kill the pope alone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asuka was 28th on the unified rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style>The guild often compared her combat capabilities to Pon or Regas.&nbsp;</span><span style>In fact, she had the experience of killing a boss monster in the low 200’s by herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>But according to the information they had, the pope was at least level 330.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>She would never dare try to kill him alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the enigmatic figure described in the quest contents was said to kill the pope alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Someone capable enough to defeat the pope... They must be at least in the top 10 of the unified rankings and have a hidden class. Perhaps it was Agnus?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>7th on the unified rankings, Agnus!&nbsp;</span><span style>He was one of the three epic hidden classes. He had countless unbelievable sagas.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Box sounded excited,&nbsp;</span><span style>“If it’s him, this will be fun. It’s a chance to figure out what his hidden class might be.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Black Teddy disagreed,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Isn’t the opponent too strong? Maybe we’ll all die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asuka hissed at him.&nbsp;</span><span style>"If you are scared then leave. I will fight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Lady...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asuka was the daughter of the chairman of a global conglomerate. And Black Teddy was her attendant. &nbsp;Black Teddy started Satisfy due to her command. Asuka needed an attendant in Satisfy and chose Black Teddy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first, Black Teddy didn’t know the game he was supposed to play. But as he played Satisfy with Asuka, he became a ranker. Now, as a genuine gamer, there were times when he forgot his duty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then I’m out. I don’t want to lose experience... It’s hard to gain levels...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, is that so? Will you really leave? I understand. Instead, you're fired. I don’t need an attendant who doesn’t follow their master.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It was a joke. I will fight with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Teddy was the main breadwinner who supported his old parents and his terminally ill brother. He needed Asuka’s huge paycheck for the cost of living as well as his brother’s medical bills. So, he couldn’t leave her.&nbsp;</span><span style>In fact, it wasn’t just because of money. He had been around Asuka since she was five years old, so he was attached to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you’re determined, let’s depart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group to hunt the enigmatic figure who killed the pope was formed.&nbsp;</span><span style>They received the guidance of the spy and started to track the path of the enigmatic figure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then after three hours?&nbsp;</span><span style>In the dark woods that were like night, thanks to the thick trees blocking the sunlight, Toban was able to find a single man walking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban signalled his companions to stop. Then they hid as much as possible in the bushes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is that him?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Box asked as he watched the black-haired man walking approximately 100m in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban nodded,&nbsp;</span><span style>"That's right. The system is telling me that it is him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Box was puzzled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is he doing with a shabby cloak like that? Doesn’t he look too poor? Is he really the target?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban replied,&nbsp;</span><span style>“High level users don’t always arm themselves with the best items. Some don’t like to be noticed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cloak the black-haired man was wearing was somewhat familiar to Toban. But the cloak didn’t have any special design on it. Therefore, he didn’t think much about it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Asuka silently glanced at Black Teddy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Black Teddy had served her for nearly 20 years, so he could read the meaning in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I understand. I will test his skills.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Black Teddy used a skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Summon Black Bear.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaaaaah! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The largest bear on Earth was the grizzly bear.&nbsp;</span><span style>The males had a body length that was around 3m and weighed more than 600kg. They were like a compact car.&nbsp;</span><span style>The black bear that Black Teddy summoned was around 1.5 times bigger and heavier than a grizzly bear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bear roared and started charging towards the black-haired man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man who was peacefully humming stopped at the commotion. Then he turned his head.&nbsp;</span><span style>As soon as his face was revealed, the ID ‘Grid’ appeared over his head.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban’s eyes widened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Eh? Grid?’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaaaaah! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>While Toban was feeling confused, the black bear swung its front paw precisely at Grid’s face.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban belatedly recovered his spirit and cried out urgently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“S-Stop! Stop that bear now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What? What are you saying all of a sudden?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment that Black Teddy was feeling puzzled.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pipit!</span></i> <i><span style>Pipipipit!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The huge black bear’s body was hacked by dozens of sharp slashes. Then it turned into grey light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Strong!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Box admired it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The black-haired man held a small dagger and took care of a level 200 summons in the blink of an eye. Tremendous damage. Box knew of only two people who could exert such physical damage, Jishuka and the one in the skull helmet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Yes, he is strong enough to defeat the pope. But I am unfamiliar with anyone called Grid...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t a ranker?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>How could he be so strong without being a ranker?&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Does he have a hidden class?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Box was making guesses, Black Teddy was furious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You mean bastard...! How dare you cut the cute bear without even a change in expression!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“H-Hey! Just wait a minute!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban tried to calm the situation down, but it was useless.&nbsp;</span><span style>Black Teddy loved bears, and once his rage was out of control, only Asuka could control him.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Asuka let him rampage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Summon Brown Bear Knights!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three browns bears, twice as small as the black bear, but armed with helmets, armor, swords and shields were summoned.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were level 240!&nbsp;</span><span style>Black Teddy commanded them,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Get revenge on the slaughterer of your own kind!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwaaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The bears were influenced by their master’s psychological state and angrily flocked to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>They started to put pressure on Grid with their swordsmanship.&nbsp;</span><span style>But their momentum was brief. Grid avoided the brown bears’ attacks and countered by stabbing his dagger in a gap of a brown bear’s armor.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, summons didn’t know pain. They kept swinging their swords at Grid, despite suffering from huge injuries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid clicked his tongue.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Why are you so strong?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pepepeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid threw a dart at a bear knight. Then poison mist emerged from the dart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaaaaah! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The poisoned knights started to bleed and stumble.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid used this gap to deal the fatal blows, then turned his gaze towards the forest where Toban’s group was hiding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What are these bears? Did they come from the circus?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban realized as he looked at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It isn’t a system error... Grid really did defeat the pope.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Black Teddy was 1st on the summoner rankings.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the guild membership test, he summoned the bear knights and showed great skills against Faker.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now those powerful bear knights were taken care of by Grid in just two minutes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘When did he become this strong?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was presumed to have a legendary hidden class.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the strongest class rating that could be obtained in Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid’s level was still low. When he checked the guild information window two weeks ago, Grid was only in the low 100’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Anyway, it’s good.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban had many questions, but he could ask them slowly.&nbsp;</span><span style>Toban would ask Grid to cooperate with his quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the situation went wrong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey Grid...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I won’t forgive you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Toban was able to raise his body to say hello to Grid!&nbsp;</span><span style>Black Teddy pushed his way out of the bushes and summoned new pets.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, Asuka was exchanging blows with Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban made a mistake.&nbsp;</span><span style>Come to think of it, Grid had never met the new guild members. So they didn’t know each other.&nbsp;</span><span style>They might’ve seen each other’s IDs in the guild information window or chat window, but they might’ve forgotten it since it was insignificant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey, all of you wait a minute... We are part of the same guild...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban tried to calm the situation down, but it was useless.&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to Black Teddy and Asuka’s pincer attack, Grid had pulled out his greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Isn’t this a pretty interesting situation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Box figured out Grid’s identity after seeing the greatsword and smiled meaningfully. Then he used the puppet magic that was the symbol of linkers and started to control Toban’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style>The situation was worsening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Toban felt like crying.</span></p>
