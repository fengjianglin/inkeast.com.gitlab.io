 <p><span style>Chapter 422</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Hao was able to guess what had happened when the scoreboards of Korea and Russia, who were first and second, stopped at almost the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Korea and Russia were confronting each other.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then after a while, Russia’s score would move again while Korea’s score would stop forever.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hao believed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The result was the exact opposite.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It can’t be... Don’t tell me Grid defeated Kraugel?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hao was confused.&nbsp;</span><span style>The words that Lauel spoke during the Reidan invasion rang in his ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Watch Grid’s path. You will soon know that he is the only sky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an obvious lie, so Hao just snorted.&nbsp;</span><span style>But.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is this?’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Stagger.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Hao's body lost its balance. He leaned back against a tree and could barely stand because of dizziness.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hao had received a huge mental shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Kraugel.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only one who brought frustration to Hao, who had believed he was the most gifted person in the world.&nbsp;</span><span style>No matter how Hao tried, he could never reach that sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>That high sky was being collapsed by another person, not him?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He was bested by Grid?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have to confirm it... I must see it with my own eyes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Until then, he couldn’t understand.&nbsp;</span><span style>Like a man possessed by a ghost, Hao tried to escape the battlefield.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian blocked his way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t let you go. If I let you go, I will be misunderstood by people again. This time, I might be called Chinese.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You aren’t qualified to decide if I go or not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hao didn’t understand what Damian was talking about, but he opened his true power.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>There was an intense wave of energy.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jjejeok!</span></i> <i><span style>Jjejejeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Hao’s muscles rapidly swelled, while the skin of his chest, back, shoulders, abdomen, thighs and other parts of the body cracked.&nbsp;</span><span style>What appeared in the cracks of the skin?&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t flesh, muscles, or blood vessels.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was red scales.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Flap.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A pair of wings emerged from Hao’s back and spread wide. They resembled the wings of a dragon.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kudu!</span></i> <i><span style>Kududuk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>10 black fingernails protruded like blades, while the white pupils tinged with gold froze the heart of anyone who looked in them.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Hot breath emerged like flames.&nbsp;</span><span style>The facial features were close to that of a human, but Hao also had partial features that were similar to a dragon.&nbsp;</span><span style>Currently, Hao’s half-draconian form was level 2.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It increased his strength, agility, health, and resistance by 15%. He also got an incomplete flying ability, fire ability, and stamina regeneration ability.&nbsp;</span><span style>The disadvantage was that he couldn’t use most of the skills available to humans, but the draconian Hao was less likely to rely on skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had the ultimate physical form, so he relied on this and secondary weapons to win.&nbsp;</span><span style>The transformation into a draconian maximized his combat power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get lost!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuwaaaang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A breath spewed out.&nbsp;</span><span style>His feelings about Kraugel were close to pure longing.&nbsp;</span><span style>One day, in the process of gazing at Kraugel with a desire to overcome him, he became a passionate follower of Kraugel.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kraugel didn’t know Hao, but Hao’s route in life was closely related to Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reason why he participated in this National Competition was because he heard Kraugel was participating.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Damian used a shield to block the fired breath and Hao approached Damian. Then he wielded his sharp claws.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was once against defended by Damian’s shield.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hwaruruk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was burned by the influence of the flames around Hao’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian didn’t feel great pain.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was the first paladin of the Rebecca Church, obtained the the first unique class Goddess' Agent and was now the pope.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His swordsmanship was taught by Piaro and was comparable to Grid’s level.&nbsp;</span><span style>He boasted an overwhelming defense and endured Hao’s flames.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sakak-!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t dream of being a great swordsman, but he fought Hao with skills that could match a great swordsman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hao shook.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He’s even good with the sword?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hao knew that the pope was the ultimate priest. He was far different from the paladins that used swords and blunt weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Damian had the various buff skills, healing skills and wide area attack skills of a pope, as well as the swordsmanship of a paladin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian was a fraudulent character with the potential to become the greatest pope ever. He was really top class.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The moment Damian tried to slash at him, Hao spun to minimize damage and counterattack by kicking at Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style>Using the rebound, he opened the distance and used chains to restrain Damian’s wrists.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kkirik!</span></i> <i><span style>Kik.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Damian’s wrists were bound and he couldn’t use a sword or shield.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hao looked at his confused expression and spread open his wings as widely as possible.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he flapped once.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Hao’s body accelerated and he shot towards Damian like a lightning bolt.&nbsp;</span><span style>It would be hard for Damian to cope.&nbsp;</span><span style>The wrists restrained by chains were pulled to the left and right, and he was forced to stand with his arms wide open like a crucified Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style>The moment Hao was about to stab his claws into Damian’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Goddess’ Wrath.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Damian showed off the power of the pope.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chiiiiiing!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Two huge magic circles, around 3m in diameter, were quickly created behind Damian’s back.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeeeeong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Two huge pillars of light, which erased everything in a straight line, emerged from the circles and penetrated Hao’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style>The momentum was so enormous that it caused an upheaval in the earth.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to this, Hao flew far away and the chains binding Damian were loosened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After releasing the chains, Damian wiped the sweat off his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If this was before I became the pope, I wouldn’t have been able to deal with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hao angrily replied to Damian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s the same now that you’re the pope. I admit that you’re strong, but you can’t beat me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wide area magic had limits.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, the current state of the battle was the National Competition, where PvP damage was only at 50%.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hao wasn’t affected by Goddess’ Wrath. He was just knocked back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hao regained his posture and rushed to Damian again.&nbsp;</span><span style>He freely took advantage of the momentary acceleration caused by flapping his wings, showing off dazzling movements.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian’s defenses were exquisitely shredded and his counterattacks avoided.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the battle progressed, Damian suffered one-sided damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re really strong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian spoke honestly.&nbsp;</span><span style>Damian had lost one-third of his health, while Hao’s health had recovered.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hao was really strong.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was difficult to hit him because his movements were so great.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m going to show this skill to someone other than Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He used the ultimate skill of the Goddess' Agent, Light's Blessing.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the manifestation of the highest buff skill that was comparable to the pope’s Goddess’ Blessing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Light’s Blessing will increase the defense attack power and accuracy of you and your party members by 80% for 3 minutes.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was ridiculous.&nbsp;</span><span style>The downside of this skill was the somewhat long cooldown time and high mana cost.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the case of the Goddess' Agent, the maximum mana wasn’t high. Therefore, if a slight mistake was made with controlling mana, the skill couldn’t be used at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now Damian was the pope.&nbsp;</span><span style>His mana was at least 10 times higher than it was before, so he was able to use this buff skill without any burden.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seokeok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hit rate of Damian’s sword suddenly increased. He read the orbit and moved like his body was a magnet.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hao was upset.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A buff that dramatically increases hit rate...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>High accuracy was the ‘system’ that disrupted control based evasion.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the reason why rankers valued accuracy highly.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, items or skills that increased accuracy were rare. Therefore, it was hard to find a ranker with a level of accuracy that would make Hao’s control skills ineffective.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That person showed himself now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to the buff, even his damage and defense greatly increased.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i> <i><span style>Chaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The flow started to reverse.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hao went on the defensive.&nbsp;</span><span style>More importantly, the Japanese representatives started to overwhelm the Chinese side.&nbsp;</span><span style>After a while, Hao, the only survivor of China, was isolated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sight shocked Asia.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 C-China...! Asia’s strongest country has been defeated by Japan! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Damian’s abilities are far too great. He’s fighting one-on-one with Hao and isn’t pushed back at all. He also multiplied his party’s abilities several times with buffs... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Maybe Japan will cause the biggest upset of the tournament? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 It wouldn’t be strange if Japan became the champion this year. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The stir created by Damian was even greater than that caused by Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand, Hao asked a final question before he was logged out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Despite having this much power, why do you value Grid so much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Damian replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The one who made me who I am now is Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The defeat of the fallen pope Drevigo, the conversion to Goddess’ Agent, and the defeat of pope candidate Pascal was all thanks to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Damian’s abilities alone, he would’ve been limited to just being the Rebecca Church’s first paladin.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was only thanks to Grid that Damian could grow and save Rebecca’s Daughters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid is my god. It’s natural that he’s much greater than me."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Currently, Damien had the attention of the world.&nbsp;</span><span style>Hundreds of cameras were filming Damian and transmitting it to every country in real time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Whether they understood or not.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to Damian deifying Grid, the world was turned upside down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The world’s curiosity and enthusiasm for Grid deepened further.</span></p>
