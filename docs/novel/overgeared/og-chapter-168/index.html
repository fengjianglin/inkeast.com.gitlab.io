 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Reality and Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 16th ranked Peak Sword had built a successful life in both worlds. </span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There is someone who actually treats me like this... Grid, you’re the first man since I went to the army 17 years ago.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword couldn’t adapt to Grid’s treatment of him. But he didn’t feel bad.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was ecstatic on the drug called patriotism and Grid seemed beautiful, no matter how he acted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Were there any good items?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Not at all."&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid pulled out an egg.&nbsp;</span><span style>"This is the only thing that dropped. I didn’t even get one silver.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A bean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s an egg.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? That’s an egg?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword was surprised.&nbsp;</span><span style>The size was two times smaller than a quail egg, and it looked more like a bean or small bead.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid shared the details of Memphis’ Egg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Memphis’s Egg]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Memphis’ egg.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah... It’s really an egg? If so, is this a pet egg?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hell Gao, the master of hellfire was a formidable adversary. The item he dropped couldn’t be ordinary.&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword didn’t doubt that a monster with the name of Memphis would hatch.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid thought differently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you know what a memphis is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No? It’s the first time I’ve heard of it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look. It’s impossible to grasp what type of pet it is.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy’s pets gave their owners various effects.&nbsp;</span><span style>In rare cases, there were pets that increased the amount of experience or drop rate of items, so the users’ interest in pets was very high.&nbsp;</span><span style>South Korea broadcasted several Satisfy pet related programs, so Grid knew the basic information about pets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the name Memphis was unfamiliar.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If this is a pet, there should be a hatching method in the item description.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had a point.&nbsp;</span><span style>All pets had a brief explanation of the hatching method.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Memphis’ Egg didn’t describe how to hatch it. Rather, it only had a short description of ‘Memphis’ egg.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if you are right that it is a pet, it’s useless if I don’t know how to hatch it.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword agreed,&nbsp;</span><span style>“That’s right. Even if that bean is an egg, it looks like you’ll never see what is inside.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid frowned and put Memphis’ Egg back into his inventory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll ask the guild members to research the identity of the egg.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will also use my network to find out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t have any expectations.&nbsp;</span><span style>This egg was more likely to be a cooking ingredient than a pet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Considering that Hell Gao is such a strong guy... Eating it might be similar to an elixir that permanently raises my stats.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>For ordinary users, elixirs that permanently raised stats were very rare.&nbsp;</span><span style>But in the case of production class users like Grid, they didn’t feel a huge need for elixirs because producing items raised their stats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'That damn Hell Gao. He should’ve dropped equipment instead of this.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Didn’t the pope drop three legendary items, despite being much weaker than Hell Gao?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had been hoping that Hell Gao would drop legendary items. But the reality was the worst, so he felt down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don’t know exactly what the item is, so I can’t sell it.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he lay on the floor and looked up at the ceiling, Peak Sword held out a hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Get up. I want to invite you to my castle. You can eat delicious food and rest there.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid questioned him,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Why are you acting so favorable towards me? Are you hoping for something? I didn’t lie about the item dropped by Hell Gao. I can’t give you anything.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t want anything. Didn’t you save my life? I’m just grateful for that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But didn’t I steal your guild’s prey as a result? You must be angry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"In the first place, it was a battle that we couldn’t have succeeded with our strength. So I don’t feel like it was taken away. It’s true that you walked into an area controlled by our guild, but aren’t you a Korean? I am happy and grateful to have discovered that the first legendary class is a Korean.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smiled and grabbed Peak Sword’s hand.&nbsp;</span><span style>At that moment, Peak Sword made a cold expression.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Did he really have ulterior motives?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Logout!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you saying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Sakura Guild is attacking!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The resurrection point of the Silver Knights members was at Cork Castle.&nbsp;</span><span style>Therefore, the guild members wiped out by Hell Gao resurrected at Cork Castle. Peak Sword had commanded them to wait there and not come back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But was someone a mole?&nbsp;</span><span style>The guild discovered that the Sakura Guild somehow knew the situation and came here, where only a minimum of troops guarded the entry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>They had already reached the 2nd floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Those guys received information that we were challenging the Hell Gao raid today and waited.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is the Sakura Guild?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a power in Satisfy that Grid had no clue about.&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword gave a brief description.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They are one of the three guilds that represents Japan. Unlike the other two guilds, they are nationalists who are very malicious. Even the Japanese users avoid them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They have a grudge against your guild and came here to hurt you, is that right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword nodded and placed a hand on the sword at his waist. He took a fighting posture and declared.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Log out first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What about you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will never run away from guys like that. The guild members are coming, so I will hold on until then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword denounced the Sakura Guild as nationalists, but he also seemed quite nationalistic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am tired.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid tried to logout.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The remnants of the great demon Hell Gao’s magic power is scattered into the atmosphere. It is impossible to logout due to this disturbance.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Shit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This damn monster was screwing with him even after death.&nbsp;</span><span style>A chill went down Grid’s spine.&nbsp;</span><span style>His stamina was depleted after Linked Kill, and only 60 points had been recovered. With 60 stamina, he couldn’t fight for even one minute.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was a huge crisis, because stamina was a different concept from health.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘My invincible passive might activate, but if my stamina is zero, I can’t move a single finger and will eventually die.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Potions to restore stamina didn’t exist. Only rest was required to restore stamina, but that was slow. The speed could be slightly increased by eating.&nbsp;</span><span style>In other words, this was bad.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid hardly ever felt the constraints of stamina thanks to his unusually high persistence stat, making this crisis unfamiliar to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He urgently shoved beef jerky into his mouth as he asked,&nbsp;</span><span style>“What is the Sakura Guild’s power? What is the level of their strongest users? How many minutes can you hold on by yourself? When will your guild members arrive?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword had encountered countless crises while playing Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was able to explain calmly, in contrast to the agitated Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Sakura Guild has 180 people. Their master Yoshimura is 2nd in the archer rankings and 98th on the unified rankings. Apart from him, there are eight more rankers in the top 300.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Isn’t this formidable?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s expression stiffened.&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword made a grim prediction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The guild members will take 15 minutes to get here and the amount of time I can hold up alone... If I am being generous, it’s seven minutes.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwaduduk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword finished his explanation and shouted to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t think about helping! It is a matter that doesn’t have anything to do with you! Go ahead and logout!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...I can’t logout.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, it was impossible to logout in raid rooms. But that was only when the boss was present. There were few cases where a user couldn’t logout after the boss had died.&nbsp;</span><span style>So Peak Sword misunderstood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid... Do you want to help me because I’m also Korean? While you aren’t in a perfect state? Hah, you are a true Korean...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, don’t talk such nonsense! What drivel are you saying when I really can’t logout? I can’t logout! I really can’t!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, the Sakura Guild came pouring down the stairs.&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword gulped and continued to babble nonsense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I would like to encourage you to logout. Don’t worry. It isn’t shameful to logout in front of enemies.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Why? Ah, this really sucks.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t know.&nbsp;</span><span style>The man Peak Sword admired since childhood was Admiral Yi Sunshin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How dare you guys! I will turn you into a river of blood today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bah! Peak Sword! You’re the one who will shed blood on this earth today, not us! I’ll pay you back for taking Takeshima from us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A small man emerged from among the Sakura Guild members and shouted.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was Yoshimura, the best archer after Jishuka and 98th on the unified rankings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s like a drama.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was able to grasp the atmosphere of the two people with one glance.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Silver Knights Guild and the Sakura Guild.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was clear that the two people enjoyed the Korea-Japan war in Satisfy more than anyone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yoshimura declared,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Since you’re alive, I guess you succeeded in the Hell Gao raid? You, I don’t know the jackpot you received, but that joy is short-lived. I will take away everything you obtained.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword yelled.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Try it! And this is Cork Island, so stop calling it Takeshima!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bah! You still can’t grasp the situation!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yoshimura made a sly smile, like someone from a Japanese historical drama!&nbsp;</span><span style>He pointed fingers covered in calluses as he commanded his men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill that damn Korean person.” (TL: The word Yoshimura uses is actually more like Joseon person, with Joseon being a name for a Korean kingdom in the past. It basically means Korean person but it was first used by the Japanese during the Japanese colonial period of Japan. It isn’t exactly derogatory, but it is a term only used by Japanese and Koreans don’t like it because of the context.)</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several months ago, at the time of the contest over Cork Island.&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword had caused terrible agony to the Sakura Guild. It was due to Peak Sword that they lost Cork Island, and many guild members died and lost experience.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was a perfect chance to pay back the grudge of that time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword was ‘alone’ so their morale skyrocketed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword pulled out his sword from the sheath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Draw Sword, annihilate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Multiple lights flashed.&nbsp;</span><span style>The eight knights of the Sakura Guild, who had been rushing at the front, vomited and collapsed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your skills haven’t gone rusty!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the dignity of the 16th rank that made level 150 knights fall into a critical state with one blow.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yoshimura truly admired it. But there wasn’t the slightest bit of tension in his expression.&nbsp;</span><span style>Only eight out of the 180 guild members were injured, so the situation didn’t change.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Grid hadn’t seen Peak Sword’s swordsmanship and was amazed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then he heard a strange voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Hungry.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>-I want to eat.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the voice of a young boy or girl.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t a hallucination.&nbsp;</span><span style>Where did this voice, filled with a strong greed, come from?&nbsp;</span><span style>Then a notification window flashed in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A memphis, the first demonic beast of hell, has hatched due to his greed for human souls.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You are the first user in Satisfy to become the master of a demonic beast from hell!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Title, ‘Man who has Touched Hell’ has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Health has increased by 3,000 points.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Demonic power stat has opened.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid made a surprised noise at the notification windows and Yoshimura was surprised to hear it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-What? That guy?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this point, all of his followers except for him were struggling with Peak Sword 10m ahead.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yoshimura was nervous when he suddenly heard someone else’s voice near him. Then he flinched.&nbsp;</span><span style>A long tail suddenly protruded from empty space! There was an enormous gaping mouth?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“H-Hik?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yoshimura reflexively tried to shoot his bow, but it was already too late. His body was swallowed by that huge mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have lost a part of your soul to the memphis.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You are more likely to be affected by status conditions.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[There will be a 50% decline in your main stats for 3 seconds.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Yoshimura was spat out after being swallowed, and saw the image of a cat.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a typical Persian cat.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, it was black, had a small horn on its forehead and small devil wings on its back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cat licked its paws and winked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cat with a horn and wings was talking? In particular, the color of its fur was attractive. It was black all over, except for its four paws which were white as snow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“K-Kawaii...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yoshimura was a cat lover, so he couldn’t help feeling thrilled. He wanted to bring this cat into reality and raise it at home.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the cat revealed its canines.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Delicious!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Y-You?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yoshimura’s face turned pale.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was due to the appearance of an person behind the cat.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was no one there a little while ago, but he appeared like he always existed and naturally stabbed with a black greatsword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a surprise attack.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yoshimura’s agility was decreased by 50% so he was slow to move, while his opponent was too fast.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yoshimura lost two-thirds of his health from a single strike and fell into a confused state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sakura Guild noticed the crisis of their master and belatedly shifted their gaze.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>They were able to see it.&nbsp;</span><span style>A flying cat demon.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then a black-haired man in red armor and a gold tail was cutting down their guild master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“T-This is ridiculous...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was it so easy to kill someone that was ranked 98th on the unified rankings?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was hard just going against Peak Sword. How could they deal with that monster as well?&nbsp;</span><span style>The Sakura Guild lost their willpower and retreated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid and Peak Sword didn’t chase after them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Meanwhile, the cat with an enlarged belly walked around Grid and rejoiced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"My master is a killer ~~ my master is a killer ~~ killer~~ nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cat singing the eerie song innocently was the first demonic beast of hell, memphis.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the worst pet that stole some of the stats from the souls he ate and temporarily gave them to his master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid faced an unfamiliar notification window after killing Yoshimura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your demonic power has increased by one.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Demonic Power]</span></p>
 <p><span style>You can communicate with demonic beasts. The higher the number, the more likely you are to enter hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Stat points can’t be distributed to this stat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I want to go to heaven."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The word ‘hell’ wasn’t very good.</span></p>
