 <p><span style>Chapter 289</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"Humans dare enter my city! Polluting the air!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members were appalled the moment the blond man appeared.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ominous notification windows consecutively appeared in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[For the next five minutes, you can’t use ‘Wind Curtain,’ ‘Black Mace,’ and ‘Storm of Eternity.’]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[For the next five minutes, you can’t use ‘Shield Throw,’ ‘Damage Break,’ and ‘Guardian's Power.’]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[For the next five minutes, you can’t use ‘Multi-shot,’ and ‘Red Flame Arrows.’]</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>...</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the exception of Grid, all of them had at least two or three skills sealed off. Those who unfortunately had their main skills sealed were particularly disappointed.&nbsp;</span><span style>But that wasn't the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[All speed will decrease by 30% for the next five minutes.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a very strong oppression.&nbsp;</span><span style>If just attack speed or movement speed was reduced, the user wouldn’t be able to exercise their true ability.&nbsp;</span><span style>This level of oppression was tremendous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid! Avoid it!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faker hurriedly exclaimed.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it was too late.&nbsp;</span><span style>The vampire earl, Elfin Stone.&nbsp;</span><span style>The furious master of the city was already attacking Grid.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puhahahak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A bloody curtain swallowed up Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elfin Stone was convinced that Grid had died.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kukukuk, I will come back in awhile. I will kill another person, and then another one the time after that! This will be repeated again and again. I will show you the extreme taste of fear!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suruk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone assimilated with darkness and disappeared like a mirage.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members didn’t even think about chasing him. They were grateful that he left.&nbsp;</span><span style>Elfin Stone’s presence was that overwhelming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a few moments of silence.&nbsp;</span><span style>The curtain of blood lifted and Grid frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What the hell is this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid only had one point of health left.&nbsp;</span><span style>This wasn’t the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>His whole body was bloody and most of his defense equipment, excluding the Holy Light Armor, was in rags.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid! Are you okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The members came running. Anxiety was on their faces. In particular, Jishuka was deathly pale.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was a reminder that her heart was thinking of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As you can see, I’m not okay.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gulp gulp.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘Shit.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tears formed as the potion poured down his throat.&nbsp;</span><span style>Super Health Recovery Potion.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a potion made by the alchemists of Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>The price of this top grade potion which restored 15,000 health was worth 10 gold.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he drank three bottles of this, he could buy two chickens in reality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword sighed with relief.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Phew, it’s fortunate. Surviving with only one point of health left, isn’t this a complete miracle? It is unbelievable despite seeing it with my own eyes. It’s surprising.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword didn’t know about Grid’s invincible passive.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid explained to him.&nbsp;</span><span style>He thought Peak Sword needed to know if they were to be trusted colleagues.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have an invincible passive. If I die, my health will be fixed at one point and I will be immune to all damage for five seconds. The cooldown time is 24 hours.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite the long cooldown, it prevented Grid from dying? It was like having two lives!&nbsp;</span><span style>A complete scam. A legendary class was truly different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid laughed at the envious Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"So always keep this in mind. In the worst situation, I will stand in front.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid emphasized this.&nbsp;</span><span style>If a stranger heard this, they would think he purposely had Elfin Stone aim at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey Regas. Elfin Stone never appeared earlier when you were explaining?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, this is the first time I’ve seen him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right. We explored for a month and never encountered him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then you were lucky.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mood became serious.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was because the strength of the city’s boss transcended the scope of the Overgeared members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid is the one with the highest health, but even his invincible passive was invoked. This means that we shouldn’t give him a chance to use the skill. However, the casting time is short and it’s difficult to prepare since we can’t detect when he will appear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"This means we will die one by one whenever he appears.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Should we do a full-scale attack rather than being wiped out one by one?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The result is that we will likely be wiped out. We can’t rule out the possibility that our main skills will be sealed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Five minutes was a long time in a struggle with a strong enemy. Having their skills sealed for five minutes was huge and beyond imagination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What should we…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no answer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a completely depressed mood.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid heard this and quietly muttered,&nbsp;</span><span style>"It wouldn’t be so desperate if I had more time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yes, time to raise his level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'If I reach level 300...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone was obviously strong. It was around the same as Hell Gao when he had all his fire stones.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, the ability to erase skills was the best.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s insight showed him the worst situation.&nbsp;</span><span style>But what if he achieved level 300 and his stats were awakened to the third level?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It will be possible to read when he appears and counterattack.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he could fight back with Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Revolve, he could cause fatal damage to him.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would be able to hold on for five minutes while his colleagues’ combat power was reduced.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Then the chances of this raid succeeding will dramatically increase.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Grid was only level 296.&nbsp;</span><span style>Since entering here, he had gained a lot of experience and could reach level 297. However, reaching level 300 wasn’t possible in a day or two.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was only possible if he drank an experience potion and swept away all the vampires in the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Dammit."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elfin Stone said he would come back later.&nbsp;</span><span style>It might be in five minutes, or maybe ten minutes. Grid had no time.&nbsp;</span><span style>The conclusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This expedition will fail.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s expression darkened.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were 15 vampire cities to clear, but he was already stuck at the first one. It was frustrating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dammit! The quest difficulty is too high!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was furious at the thought of losing 15 pavranium.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members also looked desperate.&nbsp;</span><span style>They all realized that the expedition was likely to fail, so they couldn’t comfort Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Jishuka was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prior to Satisfy opening, she was one of the best players in the MMORPG ‘L.T.S.’ so she came up with an analysis that gave hope to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The time it takes for Elfin Stone to reappear might be longer than we think. I don’t think the cooldown will be short when looking at the power of this skill.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The monster’s rhythm usually followed the skill reuse time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Just like the Fusers of Skeleton Island.&nbsp;</span><span style>They appeared after exactly seven minutes, spat acid and ran away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If the period before he returns is long, there’s hope for us. Let’s raise Grid to level 300.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Run away and give the experience to Grid. Given the amount of experience these monsters give, Grid can achieve level 300 in at least a week.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Once Grid reaches level 300, there is a higher chance to defeat Elfin Stone. But how should we deal with Elfin Stone who keeps appearing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"We can only hold out against his skill as long as possible. The first few times won’t be possible, so we will have to sacrifice ourselves. We might find a way to handle it eventually."</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no method other than the one Jishuka proposed.&nbsp;</span><span style>All the members agreed to the Grid-building project.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid felt ashamed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’m sorry for putting you at risk due to my personal quest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you are sorry, work hard. Please try and reach level 300.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would surely do so.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid nodded and opened the Reputation Store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I need to save even one of these people.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He needed to reach level 300 as soon as possible. Thus, he needed the experience potion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This time I will draw it!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid stood in front of the ‘Draw! Draw! Draw Everything!’ machine.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had 28,013 reputation.&nbsp;</span><span style>One try consumed 999 reputation, so he had a total of 28 attempts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'I should at least get one out of 28 attempts. I will certainly do it. It is strange if I don’t get one.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Rattle.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid pulled the machine.&nbsp;</span><span style>The result...</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This! You have failed! Unfortunately, please look for the next opportunity.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This! You have failed! Unfortunately, please look for the next opportunity.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crazy!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two successive failures!&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s heart sank.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>If possible, he wanted to return to the time before he started drawing items.&nbsp;</span><span style>His reputation vanished for nothing.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, reality was cold and temptation was terrible.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t turn back time or stop the drawing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Draw!&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past, it was the worst gambling system that plagued many gamers’ wallets and bloated the game producers. Now it was causing great pain to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shit! Yes! Let’s try it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, Grid cursed and started the machine again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Congratulations! The best chocolate has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This! You have failed! Unfortunately, please look for the next opportunity.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Congratulations! Block Toys to Help a Child’s Development has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This! You have failed! Unfortunately, please look for the next opportunity.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This! You have failed! Unfortunately, please look for the next opportunity.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ah! Why were the odds so low the more he drew?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s nervousness reached its peak as his reputation dropped below 10,000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Putting aside the experience potion, why isn’t anything useful coming out?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>His head hurt and he was dizzy.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to stop now, but his hand was turning the machine continuously.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to get his money’s worth somehow.&nbsp;</span><span style>His remaining reputation dropped to 6,000.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Congratulations! An Experience Increase Potion has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Experience Increase Potion]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Increases experience gained by 20% for the next three days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 0.1</span></p>
 <p><span style>“F-finally...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was happy. He was happy, so why was his chest so sore?&nbsp;</span><span style>He felt like a loser because most of the reputation he earned over the past year was gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sigh... At least it appeared.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid disciplined his mind and pulled Malacus’ Cloak out of the inventory.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the moment when the cloak, which easily attracted monsters because of the bloody smell, was revealed after a long time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid passed it to Vantner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Put it on.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What could be done to speed up Grid’s experience gain?&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner’s vision darkened as he was discussing it with the group.</span></p>
