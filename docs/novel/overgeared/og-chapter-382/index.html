 <p></p>
 <p><span style>What items should he make in order to quickly raise the level of Bow Mastery?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid listened to Khan and Piaro’s advice and came to a conclusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to make a bow that is hard to handle.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If a weapon was used in the worst condition, the faster the skill proficiency would go up!&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid look at his list of item production methods.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid received the commission of items from the Overgeared members, so there were already hundreds of items in his items production method list.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hrmm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bow production methods that Jishuka collected with much difficulty.&nbsp;</span><span style>Among them, Grid looked at the ones with the highest level limit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'The fire attribute bows that Jishuka favors aren’t compatible with me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t have any fire related skills. He avoided the bows that strengthened the fire attribute instead of the basic performance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Pass on the greatbow.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Its speed was slow, but it had high accuracy rate and attack power.&nbsp;</span><span style>The problem was that the accuracy was high.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid wanted to produce a bow that had bad conditions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I need a low accuracy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an obvious story, but Grid always tried to make the best items.&nbsp;</span><span style>He never had the experience of making failed items.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was that why?</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ssik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was having a lot of fun at this moment. It was fun to think differently about items with disadvantages, rather than advantages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘People troll for a reason.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid realized this as he looked at two production methods.</span></p>

 <p><span style>A bow with a resilient bowstring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is optimized for fast shooting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>User Restriction: Level 300 or higher. Advanced Bow Mastery level 2 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will make the Quick Fire Bow.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The basic conditions for raising the mastery level was to use it quickly. The faster the firing speed, the better it was for Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid settled in front of a furnace.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hwaruruk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The perfect senses of a legendary blacksmith controlled the furnace’s temperature to the ideal level.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He perfectly controlled the power at which he hammered at the molten metal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Duke Grid!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young blacksmiths in the smithy admired it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid’s skill was amazing every time they saw it.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the shape of the finished product was a bit odd.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The balance of the bow made by Grid was off.&nbsp;</span><span style>To be honest, the young blacksmiths thought that the bow had a very poor quality.&nbsp;</span><span style>But wasn’t Grid a legendary blacksmith?&nbsp;</span><span style>No matter how bad the bow looked, it was made by Grid, so the young blacksmiths tried to think positively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was similar to the evaluation of works by renowned painters who just put dots on a piece of paper, and it would sell for millions.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid completed one bow.</span></p>

 <p><span style>* It is unknown where the arrows will fly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bow made by the legendary blacksmith Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The structure of the bow is good, but the balance is off. Therefore, the power and accuracy is very low.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is unknown where the arrows will fly, making it the worst.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If you use this bow, you might attack the same side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is the stain of Grid’s life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Conditions of Use: None. It is advised not to use this weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had the level 7 (Understanding of Gods’ Weapons) Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill.&nbsp;</span><span style>It meant that all the items made by Grid would receive at least 20% more stats than what was specified in the production method.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the shape was like this.&nbsp;</span><span style>The power of the completed Quick Fire Bow was too terrible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Maybe I should go against the production method.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The way to make an item was to 100% follow the production method.&nbsp;</span><span style>He made an item with a unique look and performance despite following the production method.&nbsp;</span><span style>What if he didn’t make it according to the production method?&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t know what obstacles would occur.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But I don’t want to use the Item Creation skill for a troll item.’</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwack!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid once again started hammering.&nbsp;</span><span style>This time, he started to make a new bow, planning to improve the balance slightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The result.</span></p>

 <p><span style>‘This time it is slightly better.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it wasn’t enough.&nbsp;</span><span style>Obviously, Grid wanted a bow with a low hit rate.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, it didn’t make sense to not know where the arrows would fly.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t want to be someone who killed his team members, so he started carefully hammering again.</span></p>

 <p><span style>Additional mastery skill experience!&nbsp;</span><span style>He finally got the option that he wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A little bit more.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid made a determined expression and started hammering again.&nbsp;</span><span style>On the other hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Abubu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to be recognized by his father, Lord visited the smithy today.&nbsp;</span><span style>He identified that his father was making bows and grabbed one of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Abubu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was Lord saying?&nbsp;</span><span style>The bows made by his father were wonderful. He seemed to be saying.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the darkness, Kasim whispered to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well done. I should teach you archery as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A bow made by a legendary blacksmith so be easy to use and have a high accuracy rate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Although, it is a bit strange.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kasim felt doubts as he pulled out an arrow and handed it to Lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now, shoot an arrow.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>None of the people currently in the smithy were paying attention to Lord.&nbsp;</span><span style>Khan and the 100 young blacksmiths were watching Grid, while Grid was dedicated to making items.&nbsp;</span><span style>There seemed to be no problem if Lord shot an arrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Abuuuu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord nodded vigorously.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kasim confirmed it with a proud face and showed him how to shoot the bow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Consequently, Lord pulled the bow.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kiririk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, now is the time. Pull the bowstring.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kasim looked at Lord’s posture and breath before giving a signal.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tatang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kasim was astonished as soon as the arrow left the bow.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lord was aiming at the wall of the smithy, but why did the arrow fly in the opposite direction?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is ridiculous!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kasim was currently the strongest assassin.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had very high agility and excellent skills.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had hardly ever been hit by an arrow.&nbsp;</span><span style>However.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An arrow was stuck to Kasim’s ass.&nbsp;</span><span style>The arrow flew in a trajectory that couldn’t be seen with the eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Kasim was thrilled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It can’t be...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was Lord the second coming of Povia, the legendary archer?&nbsp;</span><span style>In the midst of this deepening misunderstanding...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Abu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The beginner ‘Bow Mastery’ skill has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord grew quickly because his arrow had hit Kasim, who was over level 360.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Abuuuu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord rejoiced as he held the Extremely Disgraceful Quick Fire Bow in his hand.</span></p>

 <p><span style>“All of Grid’s subordinates are talented.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Looking at just their talent, the Overgeared members currently challenging the Behen Archipelago were so powerful that they could become legends.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were the ones who would write a new history with their own strength.</span></p>
