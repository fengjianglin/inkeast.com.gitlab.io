 <p><span style>Chapter 145</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Grid started appraising the items he acquired after the struggle with the awakened guardian.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Blue Orichalcum]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Orichalcum is a mineral born with the power of moonlight and the Guardian of the Forest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is impossible to erode the Guardian of the Forest’s magic power, but it has the best hardness and strength among all minerals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is lightweight and becomes much stronger in darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Advanced blacksmith skills are required to smelt it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 3</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Purple Orichalcum]</span></p>
 <p><span style>A mineral that can only be obtained when the Guardian of the Forest has awakened under two full moons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It holds a unique magic power that boosts attack power and magic power. But unlike the blue orichalcum, its strength is extremely poor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It isn’t suitable as a raw material for battle gear. However, it is a good material to use for making accessories.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The blacksmith skill must be mastered to smelt it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 1</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Amethyst Shield]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Epic</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 200 &nbsp;Defense: 200 &nbsp;Magic Resistance: 200</span></p>
 <p><span style>A beautiful shield that shines purple, red or black depending on the angle. It is a symbolic piece that is awarded only to the head of the Red Knights.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is an item lost three years ago when Piaro, who was framed as a traitor by Asmophel, fled to the Eternal Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The third prince of the Saharan Empire is looking for this shield. It is recommended that you bring it to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Conditions of Use: Red Knights Leader.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 350</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A hidden function doesn’t exist.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m getting goosebumps.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid noted that the awakened guardian dropped exactly 14 blue orichalcum.&nbsp;</span><span style>He shuddered at the thought.&nbsp;</span><span style>A total of 15 blue orichalcum ores were needed to make Failure. However, only 14 blue orichalcum ores were dropped, as if someone knew this and wanted to mess with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I would rather it give a lot less than 15 than to be teased like this and missing just one ore of blue orichalcum..”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What if he hadn’t obtained three blue orichalcum from Administrator Valdi a few months ago?&nbsp;</span><span style>Wouldn’t he be lacking just one material to make Failure?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It is enormous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid calmed his agitated heart and turned to the purple orihalcum.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Accessories...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid currently had two accessories.&nbsp;</span><span style>One was Doran’s Ring, while the other was the Ring of Pledge obtained from his marriage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Ring of Pledge.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style>A token of eternal love.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You will be in a ‘happy’ state when you are with your spouse. Movement speed will increase by 8% and all stats will increase by 30 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Depending on your spouse’s liking, the emotion when you are with your spouse will change. Happiness, joy, contentment, normal, dissatisfaction, depression and hate. There are a total of seven emotions, and the Ring of Pledge can have different effects depending on the emotions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If you spend a hot night with your partner while wearing this ring, the experience of all skills will rise by 10%.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* A hot night is only available once a month.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When wearing the ring, the affinity of all NPCs of the opposite sex other than your spouse won’t easily increase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If you are caught by your spouse not wearing the ring, your spouse’s liking will fall by 90% and their chances of becoming pregnant will decrease dramatically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 0.1</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doran’s Ring had proven its effectiveness several times and was certainly a fraudulent accessory. But the Ring of Pledge was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The additional effects were only applied when he was with his spouse, and the increase in skills experience was only available once a month. It also wasn’t easy to accumulate affinity with NPCs of the opposite sex if he wore this ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To be honest, he didn’t need to wear it unless he was with Irene.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid had no intention of taking it off.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t want to take the risk, since Irene’s liking would drop significantly if she discovered it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was usually an unlucky person, even if his luck had increased these days. Let’s not take the ring off.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rather, the NPC could get pregnant?&nbsp;</span><span style>Satisfy went this far with the simulation?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid thought it would be fun in many ways.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Discovering my child’s talents, educating them and helping them grow...?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>But it took more than a decade to raise a child. Considering the disparity of female users, the second generation system didn’t seem to play a very important role.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Um... I should create a necklace with the purple orichalcum.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could wear multiple rings, but only one necklace. Therefore, the performance of necklaces was overall better than rings.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid easily made a decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Okay, okay. A necklace is good.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would need the help of a jeweler to make the accessory. He decided to ask Khan for a recommendation, then he looked over at the Amethyst Shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is a quest item.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the thing he was most nervous about.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid remembered when he met Piaro in Kesan Canyon after obtaining Pagma’s Swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'He wanted to punish Asmophel, who framed him as a traitor.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asmophel was in the Saharan Empire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Someday, I will visit the third prince in the Saharan Empire... At that time, I will meet Piaro and proceed with the Asmophel quest.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Saharan Empire was very far away. It couldn’t be reached easily, so Grid placed the Amethyst Shield in a corner of his inventory for the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Romeo and the soldiers approached.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you okay?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were worried. They witnessed with their own eyes that Grid was hit by a powerful flash before the awakened guardian died.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had expected Grid to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid assured them of his safety.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you forgotten that I received the blessing from god? I can’t die.”&nbsp;</span><span style>After his simple and clear answer, he patted Romeo’s shoulder with a sad expression.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Deck’s death was a shame. I’m sorry I couldn’t protect him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid sincerely meant it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>He was friends with Khan and his wife was Irene, so NPCs were like humans to Grid. Deck was a promising young knight, so it was tragic that he died here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Romeo was in tears,&nbsp;</span><span style>"His bravery will be remembered by everyone here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Deck had saved the lives of many soldiers on the way here.&nbsp;</span><span style>The soldiers silently promised that they would never forget him.&nbsp;</span><span style>At that moment, the sharp cry of a beast was heard from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is this?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>“G-Gargoyle?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge shape could be seen in the night sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>The flapping sound of the wings seemed like a griffon or gargoyle at first. Then the red body was revealed by the moonlight.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a drake.&nbsp;</span><span style>An adult drake could grow up to 4m and they were rare monsters so strong that the griffons and gargoyles couldn’t be compared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>They was a lower branch of dragons that even had the nickname of King of the Sky.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a surprising figure on its back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My Liege, have you been well in the meantime?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Huroi, who obtained a second class thanks to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a heavy wind as he landed. Then Grid greeted him,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Hasn’t it been a while? You have grown a lot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid eyed Huroi’s combat power.&nbsp;</span><span style>10,000.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was 2,000 more than Knight Romeo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He is over level 200.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was ahead of others despite having the non-combat class of orator.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Despite his excellent gaming talent, he was affected by the limitations of his class. Now that he had his second class, he was able to stare at the position of ranker.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is all thanks to My Liege.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, Grid hated Huroi. But not anymore. His perception changed after the two-man raid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid smiled at him,&nbsp;</span><span style>“I’m glad that you didn’t forget about me. You should repay my grace by serving me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, it was a reunion after a long time.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was around 4~5 months in Satisfy time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi wanted to talk to Grid about what they had been doing in the meantime.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to explain how he got the drake and his fantastic adventures. He also wanted to hear about how Grid became the husband of a noble lady.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Grid wasn’t interested in talking.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were only around 100 users among the two billion in Satisfy who could control a drake, the strongest pets.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go hunt the frostlight orcs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why did he need to go hunt mobs?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid explained the reason to the confused Huroi,</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t they drop sylphid scales? I need you to gather at least 28. While the drop rate is low, you should be able to collect it if you hunt for 10 days or so.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid planned to make the invisibility cloak.&nbsp;</span><span style>The correct name was Hooded Zip Up.&nbsp;</span><span style>It required 20 sylphid scales in order to produce it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Before obtaining Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Grid hunted for sylphid scales but had to give up after only obtaining 12.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While he had to give up, now Huroi had come.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I will create two: one for my use and one to sell to others.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huroi recalled the hellish memory of being held in Winston’s dungeon for almost 200 hours.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid showed up when I was in despair and offered me the hand of salvation.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He also recalled the frostlight orc chief raid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I was stunned and about to be hit by the orc chief, then he protected me.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more he looked, the bigger Grid’s help was. He would be pleased to repay the favor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I will go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a tremendous bleeding to be tied to one hunting ground for 10 days when he was aiming to be a ranker. Therefore, Huroi was ready to leave with no delays.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid stopped him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Walk instead of flying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid pointed to Romeo and the soldiers,&nbsp;</span><span style>“If you fly, they won’t be able to follow you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Take these people and train them while hunting.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t want to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, he was forced to walk on the ground despite having a drake. It would waste a considerable amount of time. Was that all? He was also supposed to be the soldiers’ babysitter.&nbsp;</span><span style>But there was nothing he could do.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had sworn to repay all that Grid had done for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The descendants of Blue Wolf didn’t take oaths lightly.&nbsp;</span><span style>Huroi intended to faithfully carry out Grid’s orders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He has good timing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid hummed as Huroi and the soldiers left.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wanted to make the Hooded Zip Up, but the drop rate was so low there wasn’t much merit in hunting them directly. It would waste too much time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was grateful that Huroi appeared when he did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Sooner or later, I will make you a good item. So don’t be too upset.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had a lot of room to spare after getting rid of his debt, so he was much less selfish than before.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had no intention of one-sidedly having Huroi do everything for him. Sooner or later, Grid was planning to give him a surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now... First of all, I need to make Failure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s body rose in the air. It was much slower than the drake, but his flying speed was still fast. The destination was Khan’s smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A few hours later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A man appeared in the deepest part of the Grey Forest.&nbsp;</span><span style>He looked at the place where the traces of battle still hadn’t disappeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? The Awakened Guardian of the Forest isn’t at a level that the Tzedakah Guild can defeat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Had someone within the top 5 of the unified rankings arrived here before him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Tsk, I wasted my time thanks to this. I can’t come here every four months, so I missed my chance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man who disappeared into the forest had the ID of ‘Agnus’ above his head.</span></p>
