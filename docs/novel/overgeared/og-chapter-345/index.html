 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Grid accepted Lauel’s advice and nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I’m convinced.</span></i> <i><span style>Then let’s handle Prince Ren.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s black eyes that were filled with anger slowly calmed down.&nbsp;</span><span style>He learned from watching Huroi and Lauel.&nbsp;</span><span style>He thought carefully before opening his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Prince Ren, let me ask you one thing. The fact that you invaded Reidan means that something happened to the king?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He is too clever.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid saw through his tricks and neutralized them.&nbsp;</span><span style>Those black eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>They gave the illusion that they could see through everything.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was hard to believe that Grid didn’t come from noble birth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Ren felt awe as he gulped and nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes. The life of the king is running out and I had to strike at you in order to safely succeed the throne."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Ren replied.&nbsp;</span><span style>His face once again distorted with rage and resentment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You...! If you had just pledged allegiance to the royal family and not just the king on that day! I wouldn’t have chosen such an extreme method!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t a simple matter of transferring responsibility.&nbsp;</span><span style>Prince Ren exposed himself to Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The position that Prince Ren was in, it was all as Lauel intended.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel had a wicked smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Your extreme choice has weakened the royal family’s power and raised Grid’s position.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘That Lauel.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid got goosebumps at Lauel’s smiling face.&nbsp;</span><span style>Smart guys were too frightening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hrmm... As you said, I swore allegiance to the king.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid read the wider political perspective. He suppressed his trivial rage towards Prince Ren.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I, Grid Reidan du Steim have decided. Prince Ren tried to shake my foundation by invading, but Prince Ren is also the king’s successor and the pillar of the Eternal Kingdom. As your servant, I will forgive the prince’s sins.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eyes of Prince Ren and the royal army widened.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was treating the prince with disrespect, but that wasn’t the problem right now.&nbsp;</span><span style>Forgive the sins.&nbsp;</span><span style>This meant no responsibility would be held.&nbsp;</span><span style>Such great mercy was unheard of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Ren couldn’t believe it and asked again,&nbsp;</span><span style>"Just before, you gave me the death penalty...! Why are you suddenly eliminating my sin? What absurd thing are you trying to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s eyes became flat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why are you having a conniption when I’m giving you a break?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid eventually revealed his true nature due to Prince Ren’s attitude.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lauel shook his head and glanced at Bunny Bunny.&nbsp;</span><span style>This scene was meant to be edited. The quick-witted Bunny Bunny immediately nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid spoke again,&nbsp;</span><span style>“I’ll let it go. You’re the successor to the king who I swore allegiance to. In order to maintain my loyalty to the king and to suppress chaos in the Eternal Kingdom, I will let it go, you jerk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why…? Why would you make such a decision...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Ren was thrilled after realizing that Grid’s heart was as wide as the sea. He felt guilty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Whatever the reason, I tried to destroy Duke Grid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fact that he was forgiven...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Ren was deeply moved as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I, 1st Prince Ren of the Eternal Kingdom, make this pledge. Duke Grid, sacrificing yourself to forgive this sinner for the sake of the kingdom... I will never forget this and spend the rest of my life paying it back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t stab me in the back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid grumbled and rose from his seat.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the 1,000 Reidan troops and 500 surviving northern troops stood on his left and right.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was truly spectacular.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was certainly one of the top users among the two billion users.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Everyone starts the game on equal terms.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, while some people were still wrestling with orcs, Grid became the duke of a kingdom and reigned over thousands of soldiers. He was truly a great person. Bunny Bunny’s gaze was filled with envy as he looked at Grid...</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Now I see that he is a good person.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>After using Blackening, Grid’s eyes became completely black and he turned pale. The distinct tones gave him the illusion of being handsome. He appeared very well on the screen.&nbsp;</span><span style>Still, it was no comparison to the ‘white-haired Grid version,’ which once made women around the world feel thrilled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I will leave now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bunny Bunny captured Grid’s image.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had no regrets.&nbsp;</span><span style>The army withdrew from the barracks and returned to Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>The last thing he saw before leaving was Chucksley, who was mixed in among the royal army survivors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chucksley vowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A hero of the kingdom who has a wide range of skills.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was deeply grateful that his prince was forgiven.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I swear that the Lokan family will honor you and your family forever.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It originally should be like this.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was the kingdom’s hero.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Prince Ren and Chucksley forgot this fact while they were busy being defensive, so they truly felt guilty.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“I am thankful that my life is spared, but... It’s bittersweet. Now I’m completely out of the line of succession.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There weren’t even 1,000 royal troops left.&nbsp;</span><span style>Out of 7,000 troops, he lost more than 6,000.&nbsp;</span><span style>In addition, he lost 24 Silver Dragons, 39 knights, Ferrell, and Andu.&nbsp;</span><span style>Due to this war, the forces supporting the royal family were hit hard, so he couldn’t avoid taking responsibility.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would be pushed down the line of succession and probably disciplined.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The blood of the royal family is more precious than any other gem. Your Highness was able to keep your life, so that’s enough. In addition, it’s a big achievement that you confirmed Duke Grid’s loyalty to the royal family.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chucksley reassured him as much as possible.&nbsp;</span><span style>Prince Ren was grateful that he always served the royal family with a great heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s hurry. I have to stay by Father’s side when it is the end.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Wiesbaden had less than a week left to live.&nbsp;</span><span style>Prince Ren’s sin would be heavier if he wasn’t by his father’s side.&nbsp;</span><span style>Prince Ren and Chucksley hastened their pace with an impatient mind, when two men appeared in front of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One was Eternal’s 2nd Prince, Aslan, while the other one was covered in robes and unidentified.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aslan? Why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Ren was confused by his brother’s unexpected appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I was sure that Brother would be defeated. Did you really think you could defeat the legendary Duke Grid with just an army of 7,000? A legend isn’t someone who can be hurt by a soldier. The royal family doesn’t yet have the power to oppose Duke Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...I’m sorry. I was overwhelmed by my anxiety, dealing a big blow to the royal family.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No. You don’t have to apologize to me. Rather, I’m thankful to Brother. Why do you think I didn’t stop you, despite foreseeing your defeat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aslan was originally a reticent prince. He didn’t open his mouth easily and even when he spoke, he thought about it at least 10 times.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ren might be his brother, but he’d rarely heard Aslan’s voice in the last 30 years.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Aslan was speaking without hesitation, with a provocative expression. The contents were also disturbing.&nbsp;</span><span style>Prince Ren’s expression distorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Aslan, don’t tell me that you...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A wide smile spread on Aslan’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Did you notice? I wanted Brother to self-destruct. In that sense, the current result is a little unfortunate. It would’ve been ideal if you lost your life to Duke Grid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Prince Aslan! That’s too much!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chucksley was someone who had sworn allegiance to the royal family itself, not to Prince Ren.&nbsp;</span><span style>He prayed for the well-being of the royal family. He didn’t want disagreements between the princes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Aslan reached out Chucksley, who was trying to calm down the mood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Sir Chucksley, come. I will take the life of my big brother here, and I hope that you won’t be swept away by it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What...!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chucksley doubted his ears.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t move easily as Aslan spoke to the robed man with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please spare Sir Chucksley, if possible. He’s the treasure of our kingdom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The silent robed man nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Flap.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The unidentified man threw his robe into the sky, making Prince Ren look away for a moment.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Teong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The man who took off his robe suddenly approached Prince Ren.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chucksley hurriedly moved.&nbsp;</span><span style>He did his best to block the sword that was about to stab Prince Ren.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the man’s swordsmanship was at a level that Chucksley couldn’t go against. It avoided Chucksley’s sword and moved across Prince Ren’s body in a diagonal line.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ke...heok!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Ren coughed up blood as the sword went through his armor.&nbsp;</span><span style>The hot blood quickly soaked the cold desert sand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Prince!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had to live!&nbsp;</span><span style>Chucksley was filled with that conviction and rushed to Prince Ren. Somehow, they had to leave this place and do first aid.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the unidentified man Aslan brought blocked Chucksley’s way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who the hell are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was a great swordsman. One of the strongest swordsman on the continent.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now there was a swordsman who surpassed him?&nbsp;</span><span style>The unidentified man replied to the confused Chucksley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am called the 9th knight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chucksley belatedly examined the man.&nbsp;</span><span style>The man was wearing red armor that symbolized the Red Knights.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A single number knight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The strongest knights of the Saharan Empire who dominated the continent for hundreds of years.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was said that their reputation was known even on the East Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I am a great swordsman!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>If a singly number knight was the strongest knight in the empire, he was the strongest swordsman on the continent.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was normal for him to be upset.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Then why?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 9th knight shrugged at the confused Chucksley.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A mere 100 years ago, Great Swordsman wasn’t the title for the strongest swordsman. A sword saint was the best."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But in the last 100 years, nobody with the qualifications to become a sword saint has emerged. A great swordsman appears once every 20 years.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You might’ve perceived yourself to be the strongest, but there are many talented people born with the qualities of a sword saint. If you look at it, a great swordsman is common.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are also a great swordsman!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Indeed. But I am much closer to becoming a sword saint than you.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A strange sword with a Y-shaped end.&nbsp;</span><span style>It bounced off Chucksley’s sword and pierced Prince Ren’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Highness!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The body of Prince Ren in his arms was rapidly cooling down.&nbsp;</span><span style>Chucksley despaired as he sensed this, while Prince Aslan took care of the soldiers with the 9th knight.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, 20 members of the Silver Dragons came to kidnap Irene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were held captive by a potato enthusiast who might be a swordsman, magician, or farmer, and thought they would be killed.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the potato enthusiast unexpectedly gave them mercy.&nbsp;</span><span style>Rather than taking their lives, he removed the magic power detectors controlling their bodies and minds?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There must be a reason you guys wanted to do something so bad. Anyway, now you’re free. I don’t want to defile my body and soul by killing you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were orphans and then forced to become assassins.&nbsp;</span><span style>Now he gave freedom to those who had always lived in hell?&nbsp;</span><span style>The Silver Dragons were impressed. They were grateful to the potato enthusiast whose name they didn’t know. The problem was that they now had no place to go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We want to follow you with a sincere heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was annoying for the potato enthusiast, Bland. He didn’t need the help of these weak assassins.&nbsp;</span><span style>But they would be helpful to someone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You are just a nuisance to me. However, if you want to do something, protect Duchess Irene.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Silver Dragons moved immediately.&nbsp;</span><span style>At this time, Irene was in Lord’s room.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the realm of Kasim, king of shadows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Heok!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was someone whose presence they couldn’t detect?&nbsp;</span><span style>Kasim examined the Silver Dragons who appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hoh, that is Daluka’s breathing method? You guys are learning something pretty interesting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lord Steim, who would be the continent’s future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the day when the foundation of the strongest assassin group, ‘Overgeared Shadows’ was set.</span></p>
