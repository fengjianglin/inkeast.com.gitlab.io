 <p><span style>Chapter 325</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The 31 year old Kim Doohyun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A male actor from South Korea who boasted a warm appearance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Three months ago, he became popular as a world star in the Hollywood movie, ‘The Diary of a Murderer.’ Over the last three months, he had shot 15 CFs, and his popularity rose.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During a time when Satisfy’s rankers were crowding the CF market, Kim Doohyun’s breakthrough had given hope to other actors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You want to cancel a shoot to attend a festival? Hey, Doohyun. Why are you doing something so stupid? Are you trying to cause a stir?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The representative of the company tried to persuade him, but it was useless.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a look in Doohyun’s eyes that couldn’t be read.&nbsp;</span><span style>He exuded a mysterious charm as he looked out the window and spoke firmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There is something more important than immediate money and popularity. I will attend the Young Ladies High School festival.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The expression of the representative darkened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t tell me that the rumors are true?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What rumors?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You are... There’s a rumor that you are a high school girl killer.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doohyun remained silent. He had a reticent personality and he didn’t feel there was any value in answering this question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The representative could only sigh. He worried that if a scandal broke out after touching a high school girl, it would be fatal to Doohyun’s popularity.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"I’ve come to ask you to repair the sword.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The master of the Giant Guid, Chris, now had to often visit Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was troublesome and tedious, but it couldn’t be helped.&nbsp;</span><span style>The only person who could repair Grid’s Greatsword was Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t too bad? While hunting the desert monsters on your way, you can get experience and items.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I won’t deny it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris hunted in the basilisk area on the way to and from Reidan. The desert basilisks usually moved in groups of three, so rankers were unable to hunt them alone. However, Chris was third on the unified rankings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He utilized his abilities and know-how to hunt basilisks alone, earning great profits.&nbsp;</span><span style>And above all, Piaro was in Reidan. Every time he sparred with Piaro, his skills grew steadily, making Chris want to stay in Reidan all the time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Today I will give you a discount of four gold. It’s 599 gold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid spoke like he hadn’t overpriced it in the first place. It was frustrating. But it was a little cheaper since it was less than 600 gold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘...No, it’s expensive! I shouldn’t be swayed!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris regained his spirit and paid the repairing fee with trembling hands. He was about to leave when he suddenly stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The Blood Carnival’s celebrity hunting has recently been going too far. You should be careful.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Blood Carnival?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members often told him to pay attention to the person called Agnus.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid thought that the Blood Carnival was related to Agnus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is that the group that Agnus belongs to?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris sighed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Your information is too weak, despite having Faker as a subordinate. Or are you just not interested in the situation? Agnus has no affiliation with the Blood Carnival. The Blood Carnival are a group of unofficial rankers.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are they strong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not only are they strong, they’re bloodthirsty. You won’t be safe if you become their target. They are just as dangerous as Agnus. So be careful. It will be troublesome if you get caught when repairing my weapon.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hrmm... I will keep it in mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris’ tone wasn’t sweet. But it was true that he was doing Grid a favor.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid smiled and accompanied Chris outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Go well and relax in the future. This isn’t a historical drama, so there’s no need to act like it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I understand. I’m not saying this because I like it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris said goodbye to Grid and went to find Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>He applied for a spar and then asked,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Is there a big difference between my skills and Zibal’s?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to the rumors circulating among the seven guilds, Zibal was said to have been narrowly defeated by Piaro.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then what about Chris?&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t deal a small wound to Piaro, meaning he was much worse than Zibal!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro asked Chris,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Zibal? Who’s that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heok.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t even remember Zibal’s name?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Then does Piaro remember me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris was mistaken and became greatly frustrated. He was leaving with powerless footsteps when Piaro spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I don’t know who Zibal is so I can’t predict the difference between him and you, but I can tell you one thing. You are the third strongest person I have seen recently. You should have great pride in yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chris’ eyes widened.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was he thrilled by Piaro’s words?&nbsp;</span><span style>No. It was an unpleasant feeling and a big shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Last time, I was the second strongest!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t mistaken. He had definitely heard this from Piaro on the first day. At that time, he was second. Now he was third?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I know that you sparred with Duke Grid recently. Is Duke Grid stronger than me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro nodded without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then... The other person who is stronger than me. Who is stronger, him or Duke Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Piaro thought about it a little bit this time. Then he answered with an uncomfortable expression.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"My Lord is not yet his opponent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...I see.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zibal, when did he become so strong?&nbsp;</span><span style>Chris was amazed by Zibal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He truly is 2nd on the unified rankings. You must be the next strongest after Kraugel and Agnus.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>His evaluation of Zibal was rising every day.&nbsp;</span><span style>Zibal didn’t know why, but he couldn’t help feeling good.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>One of the best benefits about God Hands was the automatic hunting.&nbsp;</span><span style>If the hands were still within 30m of Grid when the monster was killed, Grid would gain the experience without having to do anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid wanted to make better use of this advantage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Should I create a portable furnace?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only doing blacksmithing at the smithy, or doing it while letting the God Hands hunt.&nbsp;</span><span style>Which one would be more beneficial?&nbsp;</span><span style>Of course, it was the latter.&nbsp;</span><span style>He would be able to acquire experience and items through hunting, while making items at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It could also be the reverse.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid could hunt while the God Hands made items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Am I a genius?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn't a joke. Grid was serious. He truly admired himself for coming up with such a brilliant idea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s try it once.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid used Item Creation to try and design a portable furnace.&nbsp;</span><span style>The result was successful.&nbsp;</span><span style>His knowledge as a legendary blacksmith meant he perfectly understood the structure of a furnace, making it easy for Grid to produce the desired item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[’Blueprint: Portable Furnace’ has been acquired!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Portable Furnace]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Unique</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is a furnace that can be used anytime and anywhere, as long as there is enough firewood and adequate space.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it is impossible to smelt large quantities of minerals at the same time because of its small size.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Item creation speed is 60% lower than when using a normal furnace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 7,390</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was excited.&nbsp;</span><span style>It might be slower, but he was happy about being able to smelt minerals and modify items anytime and anywhere. It felt like he had grown wings on his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge smile!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid started to produce the portable furnace.</span></p>

 <p><span style>An interesting sight was taking place in the desert near Reidan Castle’s wall.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was sitting at an anvil in front of a small blade furnace and making items with a hammer, while four golden hands and two cats flew around hunting monsters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The four golden hands were the God Hands, while the two cats were Noe and Randy, who had copied his appearance.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid actively utilized his hands and pets to hunt, while earning profit through item making.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The giant worm died and left a shell! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I got the tongue of the desert toad! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leave it there.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid kept hammering.&nbsp;</span><span style>Loot was piled up like a mountain on the side.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was thanks to the hands, Noe and Randy were gathering the items dropped from the monsters they hunted.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was an amazing, absurd, and fraudulent sight, as Grid earned experience and money while sitting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow... Is it possible for Grid to raise his level to 5th on the unified rankings?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Setting aside Noe and Randy, now he has the hands as well? He can nap while the God Hands hunt and raise his level.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Macro...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The legendary class exclusive items were truly great.&nbsp;</span><span style>The Overgeared members were envious of Grid.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"I heard that Kim Doohyun has decided to visit Ruby’s school festival?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It happened while Grid was distributing the ‘Mass Production Grid Set’ to the soldiers of Reidan.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to the hands, he made items and earned experience for free.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was confused.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Who is Kim Doohyun?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword thought it was absurd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow... You don’t know Kim Doohyun?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don't know. Who is he?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword explained to Grid who asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"His Hollywood movie ranked first in the North American and Korean box office for five consecutive weeks, he is the protagonist of a ‘Diary of a Murderer.’ He’s the pride of the Korean cinema, and the Korean Patriotic Association has awarded him two medals.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...Did you give permission to give him the medal?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why is permission needed for the medal? It’s based on the person’s achievements.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-Is that so? I didn’t know since I have never received it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Anyway, there is one area where Kim Doohyun is lacking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is it?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Two years ago, there was a rumor that he was dating a minor, a 17 year old idol.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How old is Kim Doohyun?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"31.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hmm, well. Age doesn’t matter when it comes to love... Heok! Don't tell me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s face suddenly distorted. He felt an ominous feeling.&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword snapped his fingers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right! Isn’t Ruby pretty? A girl who is completely different from you and praised as the second Yura! I am worried that Kim Doohyun might try to approach Ruby.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was hoping that his sister Sehee would meet a good man that he could be friends with. But he didn’t like it if the other person was a celebrity.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because he encountered the ugly side of the entertainment industry when he did the broadcasts after the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A good actor would have a lot of females who like him.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was okay if he was a playboy, but Grid couldn’t tolerate a playboy flirting with his sister.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid hurriedly got up. He checked the time and saw that the festival would start in two hours.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was about to log out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...That reminds me, I have to be afraid of the people at the festival.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>How terrible would it be if he was surrounded by anti-fans?&nbsp;</span><span style>Peak Sword saw Grid’s expression and misunderstood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Truly God Grid! As the protagonist of the 5th Hallyu Wave, he is so popular that it is a burden to go alone!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword suggested,&nbsp;</span><span style>“I will go with you! I will act as your manager!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was unwilling. He would become more noticeable if he went together with Peak Sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But isn’t it safer than being alone?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Peak Sword was a Taekwondo black belt holder and his appearance was quite threatening. Grid determined that he was sufficient as a bodyguard and nodded.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>‘I can finally meet Noe.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>World star Kim Doohyun was a quiet man. He was mistaken as a cold city man because he was a man of few words.&nbsp;</span><span style>But what was the truth?&nbsp;</span><span style>Kim Doohyun was from the countryside, and he was a warm man who loved animals.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rumor about him being a schoolgirl killer was untrue. The idol who confessed to him started the rumor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I want to touch Noe’s padded feet.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doohyun liked all animals, but he especially loved cats.&nbsp;</span><span style>He thought cats were perfect.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had a cute unexpected charm, and always made him smile.&nbsp;</span><span style>Among them, Noe was at the peak.&nbsp;</span><span style>The shining black fur and eyes, the small horns and tail, all of it was very cute. The pink soles and small wings on the back were also impressive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Kim Doohyun was a fan of Noe. He was one of the top 10 members of the Noe fan cafe, which had nearly five million members. It was a sign that he participated more than anyone else when it came to the cafe activities.</span></p>
