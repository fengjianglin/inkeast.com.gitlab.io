 <p><span style>Chapter 27</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>"Lululala~”</p>
 <p><span style>I naturally hummed a song, and as soon as I got out of the capsule, I sat on the toilet seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lululululu~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I then headed to the kitchen and drank cold water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lalalalala~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I lay back on the couch and watched TV.&nbsp;</span><span style>The humming didn’t stop, and laughter even started to emerge.&nbsp;</span><span style>I was so happy!&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to the hidden quest, I obtained a combat buff skill and cleared the quest safely, opening the path to a linked quest. I also gained a lot of levels in a short amount of time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I killed a few gangsters and got to level 21, isn’t this a really big jackpot? Why is my luck so good these days?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hidden quests weren’t easily obtained.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was the first time in my one year of playing Satisfy. Among the billions of people currently playing Satisfy, only a handful would’ve obtained a hidden quest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many things had gone well since I became Pagma’s Descendant.&nbsp;</span><span style>It really was an incredible class.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There was a reason for my misfortune. It was a divine revelation after years of enduring misfortune. Ahahahahat~!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What type of quest would Blacksmith Khan give me? And the reward?&nbsp;</span><span style>Maybe the enormous reward would be a unique item that I could use for a while...</span></p>
 <p><span style>If so!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I can become a billionaire! Kuahahaha!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The performance of Dainsleif and Valhalla was almost the same as the unique rated ‘Failure’ that I designed.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, since the usage conditions were very normal, it was possible to have an astronomical value when dealing with users.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘They are items that remind me of why Failure is a failure.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Albatino was a great blacksmith. He was probably the blacksmith who gave inspiration to Pagma...</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Such a great person wasn’t a legendary blacksmith, while I stumbled across the legendary blacksmith class during a quest... Well, this is the world.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I once again felt gratitude towards the legendary class that I obtained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hrmm.”&nbsp;</span><span style>I gazed at my watch with a yawn and saw that it had been two hours since I left the capsule.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Eight hours have passed in the world of Satisfy. Won’t Khan wake up soon?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to the doctor, Khan’s health was severe to excessive drinking and stress.&nbsp;</span><span style>But if I followed the quest story, Khan would overcome the alcoholism and his health would be restored. So I didn’t have to worry about it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I connected to Satisfy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Log in."</span></p>
 <p><span style>My vision darkened before giving way to a warm light as I opened both eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...This is the clinic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The last place I logged out of was the clinic where Khan was hospitalized.&nbsp;</span><span style>I immediately went to find the doctor called Simon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is the old man’s status?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Simon smiled kindly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I thought it was dangerous because of the sudden increase in blood pressure in his weakened state. However, his condition is better than expected. He can soon be discharged from the hospital. God has blessed him...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’m glad to hear that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He will be healthier if he stays away from drinking in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I headed to Khan’s room with Simon.&nbsp;</span><span style>After a while, Khan smiled as he saw me.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Ohh, welcome. I owe a lot to you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I responded with a smile,&nbsp;</span><span style>“Those in difficult circumstances should help each other. Now, you can leave the hospital. You just need to pay for the treatment fee.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why wasn’t Khan answering?&nbsp;</span><span style>I couldn’t help feeling uncomfortable.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then Khan’s words were like a lightning bolt from the clear sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry... I currently don’t...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>T-This...!&nbsp;</span><span style>It was like a lightning bolt struck my mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don’t tell me... you won’t pay the bill?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t that I won’t pay, but I can’t. I don’t have the money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what are you going to do? Does this clinic accept credit?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I stared at Simon. His kind expression that had always been present was gone. Then Simon spoke with a very business-like expression.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Credit isn’t possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I wanted to leave this old man alone, but then I wouldn’t be able to get the quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damm..it! My bad luck was waiting! Luck is truly the worst!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I had to pay one gold for Khan’s treatment cost.&nbsp;</span><span style>I was afraid to calculate how much I had spent today.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan’s smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Thank you once again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as Khan arrived at his smithy, he turned to me and bowed 90 degrees, expressing his sincere gratitude.&nbsp;</span><span style>Fortunately, he had a conscience. He thanked the person who paid one gold for his medical bill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Thank you. Thank you very much. I was able to feel hope again because of you. I was able to maintain the business that has been in my family for seven generations, that I almost lost due to my ignorance. I don’t know how to repay you...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan started crying. Unlike young people, elderly people really had a lot of tears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old Man...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I grabbed Khan’s rough hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a common action that the ‘main character’ of dramas would do. ‘Isn’t it natural to help a neighbor in trouble? This was nothing, Old Man. There is no need to feel sorry. I don’t need anything in return for my help.’ Such unrealistic words would be spoken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But I wasn’t a protagonist of a drama! I was a loser of the cruel, relentless modern society that was close to the natural laws of the Serengeti. I want a reward!</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you really appreciate it, give me something. Come on."</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Yes, that's right. Of course, I have to pay you back. Your grace was too big, I don’t know what type of reward to give you."</span></p>
 <p><span style>I just noticed, was this old man really simple? Didn’t he notice the words I use?&nbsp;</span><span style>I stayed focused. I couldn’t think about anything else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Old Man, you were almost robbed of this smithy by those gangsters. If you keep drinking, your health will worsen and you will eventually die.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Um, that’s right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"When you collapsed from high blood pressure, you could’ve died. Didn’t you live because I took you to the clinic and paid for your treatment fee?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Then aren’t I the savior of your life?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I spoke logically.&nbsp;</span><span style>"To the savior of your life, you should give me a precious treasure equivalent to your life!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan stopped crying and looked very sorry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A precious treasure equivalent to my life... I don’t have such a thing. What should I do? Ugh...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don’t look so sad. I am very nice so I don’t want treasures that are equivalent to your life. Over there, there.”&nbsp;</span><span style>I pointed to the second floor with my finger.&nbsp;</span><span style>"If you give me Dainsleif and Valhalla, that is enough of a reward.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>My heart was beating excitedly.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because I was filled with expectation at receiving the items as a gift.&nbsp;</span><span style>But this was me.&nbsp;</span><span style>The world never went my way so easily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"They are the heirlooms that have been passed down in my family for many generations. It is a treasure that my life can’t be compared to. I will give my life to you, but I can’t give you those items.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a flat refusal.&nbsp;</span><span style>If he wasn’t going to give it, why bother being so earnest?&nbsp;</span><span style>As a frown appeared on my face, Khan coughed with shame and explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"These are treasures that my ancestor, Albatino dedicated his soul to. The treasures of his soul can’t be handled by his descendant. I am obliged to keep these heirlooms until the day I die. But there’s an exception.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan was Albatino’s descendant? He couldn’t fake his blood. Did that mean he would display advanced blacksmith skills once his alcohol addiction was healed? And what was the exception?</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is the exception?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan’s gaze became serious.&nbsp;</span><span style>“There is something I want to ask you. How were you able to use the treasures? And how did you know its value at a glance?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan explained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Dainsleif and Valhalla are unlucky battle gear. Their performance transcends imagination, but due to the usage requirements, it has been hundreds of years since an owner showed up. No hero could use them. It’s been like that for the past few centuries. Due to that, they have disappeared in the history records. Now no one knows about their existence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan and I went upstairs. We stood facing Dainsleif and Valhalla.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan touched them and beckoned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am sad since I want the world to know the value of Dainsleif and Valhalla. So I placed it in this prominent place. But in order to fully understand such an extremely good work, the person needs the same level of insight as the creator. Despite having displayed it for decades, no one has understood its value.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan faced me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you showed up here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The long story began.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"There is a legend that is passed down in my family. Around 130 years ago, a man called Pagma came here. He found Dainsleif and Valhalla accumulated dust in a corner of the store. He saw it at first glance. The value of Dainsleif and Valhalla...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan’s eyes flashed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Pagma admired the work of Dainsleif and Valhalla. It is said that he showed off his swordsmanship wearing Dainsleif, which has never been used by any hero. The beauty of it was unbelievable, and the swordsmanship seemed to pierce the sky, creating lightning.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I was amazed.&nbsp;</span><span style>An absurd but exciting fairy tale!&nbsp;</span><span style>Did he read the interest in my eyes?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan became more immersed in the story.&nbsp;</span><span style>"My ancestor, who witnessed the swordsmanship, fell to his knees in front of Pagma and begged. ‘Please take Dainsleif and Valhalla. That would be what my ancestor wanted.’”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ohh! It became bigger! So? Did Pagma agree?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No. If Pagma agreed then Dainsleif and Valhalla wouldn’t be here right now. This was Pagma’s reply. ‘These works are filled with Albatino’s soul. I will refuse because they are so powerful, they shouldn’t be wasted on a small bowl like myself.’ Pagma was obstinate and my ancestor finally had to give up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I really didn’t understand the man called Pagma. No, why would he refuse something that was free? I would accept and sell them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Ah, Pagma must’ve been a really rich person. So he wasn’t greedy.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>My story continued while I was thinking this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Pagma said this before he left here. ‘There are currently no heroes who can handle this armor. However, when the time comes, many heroes will emerge and all of them will be qualified to become masters of that armor.’”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I interpreted Pagma’s words. The many heroes he spoke of referred to the users.&nbsp;</span><span style>The growth of users was fast and infinite. There would soon be rankers who could use Dainsleif and Valhalla.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I don’t want the items to be taken by them.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I asked Khan straight away.&nbsp;</span><span style>"So what is the reason for the lengthy explanation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Khan replied without hesitation.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I want to know your identity.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Do you think I am one of the heroes that Pagma talked about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right. Didn’t I say there was an exception? If you can prove that you are the hero Pagma talked about, I am willing to give you Dainsleif and Valhalla.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were strong expectations in Khan’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>I couldn’t know.&nbsp;</span><span style>The link with an ancient quest was approaching.</span></p>
