 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Agnus...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was ranked 6th after Yura disappeared from the rankings list.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was originally thought to have an epic class, but now it was known that he had a hidden growth class.&nbsp;</span><span style>He never showed up in public. However, a few top rankers knew his strength.&nbsp;</span><span style>They often bumped into him at the hunting grounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hey, Overgeared noobs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka, Peak Sword, Pon, Regas, Faker, Vantner and Zednos.&nbsp;</span><span style>Agnus didn’t shrink back despite facing the party of eight. Rather, he poked fun at them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’ve been looking for that lich for 11 months. Don’t touch my prey or I’ll kill you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You bastard!”&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner cried out furiously towards Agnus.&nbsp;</span><span style>“If you don’t want to die, don’t make fun of us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agnus shrugged.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Bald Vantner. You’re really stupid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner’s face turned red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I'm not stupid or bald! This is a shaved head! Aren’t you the one interfering? We found this place first!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So what? Are you going to fight that lich?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kukuk! Aren’t you funny? You look tired, probably from defeating the master of this city? Mumud was close to being a legendary magician. Now that he’s beyond death, he’s even stronger. He isn’t something you guys can go against.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You bastard! Yet you want to raid him alone...? Oof! Oof!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Relax. Our purpose isn’t to raid the lich.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka blocked Vantner’s mouth. Then she suggested to Agnus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will give you that lich. We won’t get involved in the raid. Instead, we have something separate to do. Can you not restrain us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will think about it if you kneel down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You should act in moderation, Agnus.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kukuk, yes, yes. I understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style> Jishuka was surprisingly passive towards Agnus.&nbsp;</span><span style>This was also a good development for the Overgeared members.&nbsp;</span><span style>Agnus would get the lich and they could concentrate on securing the pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner couldn’t accept it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Are you going to just let him go? Why are we leaving it alone when he is treating us like this?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner was the lowest ranking member of the party.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had no experience with Agnus.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, the other members were different. They all had at least one hunting ground overlap with Agnus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{It’s better to avoid Agnus.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sky above the sky, Kraugel.&nbsp;</span><span style>Pon acknowledged Kraugel as this.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, that was just in a one-on-one fight.&nbsp;</span><span style>Agnus was king of the dead and could rule over hundreds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{He’s a man who absolutely shouldn’t be our enemy.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner didn’t understand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>{All of you have been saying that he’s great for a long time, but I honestly don’t know. Is he so strong that we have to flee, despite there being eight of us?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{We aren’t running away. We are just avoiding him?}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{That is the same thing! Ah, damn! I’m sorry towards Grid! Ignoring the Overgeared Guild is no different from ignoring Grid!}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{...Speaking of Grid. If the two people meet, they will fight.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{Their personalities are similar. Grid and Agnus absolutely shouldn’t meet.}</span></p>
 <p><span style>{We need to find the pavranium before Grid arrives.}</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Papat!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The determined Overgeared members scatter all over the cave.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner was left staring at Agnus alone, and eventually had to follow his party members.&nbsp;</span><span style>Agnus looked at them and muttered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't rush. I have to test the performance against you if I get Mumud.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Braham shouted at Agnus, who was smiling in a disgusted manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Why do things keep on getting twisted? Who are you?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Me?"&nbsp;</span><span style>Agnus’ gaze shifted towards Braham’s soul.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I am someone looking for your body.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwajik!</span></i> <i><span style>Kwajijik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The ground around Agnus split apart and hundreds of skeletons popped out.&nbsp;</span><span style>Death knights and a lich were included.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Third advancement necromancers could obtain death knights, but liches were different. There was no lich summoning in the skill tree of the third advancement necromancer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the first place, liches were originally human.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even the great magician Braham couldn’t fully control Lich Mumud. He took advantage of the coffin for vampires.&nbsp;</span><span style>Braham identified the lich summoned by Agnus and was astonished.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You...! You are Baal’s Contractor!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Don't bring up that damn name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agnus frowned and waved his hand.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then the death knights and hundreds of skeletons hit Lich Mumud.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kiyaaaaaah!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Mumud fired off magic power.&nbsp;</span><span style>The flash of light shot forward in a straight line, turning the skeletons in front to powder. It was like a dark dragon’s breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hoh.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Agnus didn’t shake despite losing dozens of skeletons at once. Rather, he was pleased.&nbsp;</span><span style>"As expected."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now, become his.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuahahaha!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agnus burst out laughing.&nbsp;</span><span style>In response, the death knights, lich and skeletons’ eyes turned red.&nbsp;</span><span style>Braham’s soul shook like a lamp in front of the wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[This dog...!]</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t lose Mumud.&nbsp;</span><span style>Braham only had a handful of souls left, so Mumud was almost his only support.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Baal’s Contractor showed no mercy.&nbsp;</span><span style>The powers of the death knights and lich strengthened the skeleton soldiers, gradually driving Mumud on the defensive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Indeed, you were chosen by Baal for a reason...!]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The death knight’s sword struck Braham’s soul fragment.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the same time, Braham’s voice stopped.&nbsp;</span><span style>It took a few more minutes before Lich Mumud was under control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sigh.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agnus made a tired expression. His dark circles had noticeably become thicker.&nbsp;</span><span style>He sighed and swept away his matted hair. Then he approached the captured Lich Mumud and drew an unidentified sigil on the skull.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a sigil of absolute domination, that could only be used three times in total.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kyaak!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lich Mumud screamed. It was strange, since the undead couldn’t feel pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kukuk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lich Mumud stood next to Agnus.&nbsp;</span><span style>Agnus stroked his skull like he was cute and looked around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members had already left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I took too long.</span> <span style>Well, it’s okay. This has brought me closer to my heart’s desire. I’ve become the owner of two liches.</span> <span style>The third and final one will be saved for you, Braham.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would surely find out where Braham was buried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kukukuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agnus laughed and left the cave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Overgeared members appeared one by one in a corner of the empty cave.&nbsp;</span><span style>They wore the invisibility cloaks and received a huge shock as they watched Agnus.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner was sweating as he asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Agnus is a necromancer with a lich? I can understand the death knights and skeleton soldiers, but how can he summon a lich? Even Braham can’t...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A lich and three death knights.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a power that could be considered an army. It was a level that could wreck a nation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon looked troubled.&nbsp;</span><span style>“His strength is on a completely different dimension compared to when I saw him last year. This is making me anxious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t good for such a crazy person to gain such power.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"The entrance is open."</span></p>
 <p><span style>The 13th vampire city.&nbsp;</span><span style>The entrance that was like an ant hill was wide open.&nbsp;</span><span style>The city’s master Elfin Stone was defeated, so the entrance was released.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are they?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was waiting with Huroi and Yura, and eventually sent a whisper to Jishuka.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>We just arrived at the city’s entrance.</span></i> <i><span style>Where are you?</span></i> <i><span style>Have you found the pavranium yet?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka hurriedly replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>We found it!</span></i> <i><span style>We will leave here soon, so head towards the 14th city first.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Why do we need to go first?</span></i> <i><span style>We’ll wait at the entrance.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-No, just go ahead!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>‘What is this?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was strange.&nbsp;</span><span style>A thought crossed Grid’s mind as he frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Perhaps...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could they be in danger?&nbsp;</span><span style>They were considerate and didn’t want him to get caught up in it?&nbsp;</span><span style>It was quite possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How useless.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was no longer a person to be protected. It was the opposite.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid turned a cold gaze towards Yura and Huroi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you ready to fight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Of course, My Lord.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’m always ready.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, then let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s group went through the entrance.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agnus popped out of the ant hill.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was exquisite timing that allowed Grid’s party to barely avoid him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Was I mistaken?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought he felt something when he warped through the doorway, but he wasn’t sure.&nbsp;</span><span style>In any case, his work here was over, so Agnus looked at his schedule.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Next is the Sword Grave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The legendary blacksmith, Pagma.&nbsp;</span><span style>At the end of his life, he allegedly made and destroyed thousands of swords.&nbsp;</span><span style>According to the history records acquired through quests, Braham often visited it...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agnus sent a whisper.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Veradin, have you located the Sword Grave?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I’m sorry.</span></i> <i><span style>I mobilized all of my resources, but couldn’t find it.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>Really worthless.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I’m sorry.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>-Find it quickly.</span></i> <i><span style>I’ll head to the next one.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>-</span><i><span style>I will keep that in mind.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Agnus clicked his tongue and started to cross the desert.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t shed a single drop of sweat, despite the boiling heat.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? You’re safe?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Around 10 minutes after entering the 13th vampire city.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid reunited with the Pavranium Expedition.&nbsp;</span><span style>Jishuka examined the puzzled looking Grid and asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you okay? You're not injured? You weren’t bitten by a crazy dog?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka told Grid to head to the 14th city first because she was worried that he would face Agnus.&nbsp;</span><span style>Fortunately, it didn’t seem like that happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why would there be a dog in the desert?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid responded like it was absurd.&nbsp;</span><span style>A relieved Jishuka handed him presents.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then take this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were the items dropped by Elfin Stone, various minerals, and pavranium.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everyone has suffered.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid bowed in thanks to Jishuka and his companions.&nbsp;</span><span style>The party members smiled brightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It was you who suffered the most.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strictly speaking, it wasn’t the case.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid got a bus ride from them. If they hadn’t given up the experience, he wouldn’t have reached level 300 and they would’ve failed to clear the city. Securing the pavranium? He couldn’t even dream of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid vowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Once this expedition is over, I will give all of you the best items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Are you talking about the Grid set you mentioned before?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment that the party members were becoming excited.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Why is this girl here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jishuka belatedly discovered Yura with Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura calmly replied,&nbsp;</span><span style>“You still speak in such a violent manner. I’m afraid that it will have an adverse effect on Youngwoo-ssi’s feelings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Youngwoo-ssi? He’s Duke Grid. Can’t you distinguish between reality and the game?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will call him what I like. It’s none of your business.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pajijik!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Sparks flew as the two women’s gazes crossed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Beauties are fighting over Grid...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Grid already has Irene...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The party members were jealous of Grid. They were truly envious.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Grid didn’t pay attention to them.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was busy identifying the newly acquired items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Three pieces of ??? have been collected.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[The information about the ??? Pieces has been updated.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s eyes widened.</span></p>
