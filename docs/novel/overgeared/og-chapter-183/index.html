 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Dragons created creatures that vaguely resembled them for fun.&nbsp;</span><span style>Those creatures were the drakes.&nbsp;</span><span style>Drakes had much lower intelligence and physical abilities than the dragons.&nbsp;</span><span style>Compared to dragons that were dozens of meters long, a drake was small, and their bodies were only 3m long, excluding the tail.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But they couldn’t be ignored.&nbsp;</span><span style>The blood of a dragon flowed through them, so drakes were the strongest monsters.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had a minimum level of 260 and were two times faster and stronger than griffons. Their maximum speed was up to 120km and they could even shoot out breaths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That’s right.&nbsp;</span><span style>Drakes were considered as the best pets.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had no faults at all, except that they were very difficult to tame.&nbsp;</span><span style>Drakes had different personalities depending on their attributes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hundreds of millions of viewers were looking forward to seeing how many different types of drakes they could see through this pet marathon.&nbsp;</span><span style>They paid particular attention to Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Grid, perhaps he tamed a dark drake?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"A dark attribute drake? Was there something like that? This is the first time I’ve heard of it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not surprised. There are less than 100 users in Satisfy who’ve tamed drakes as pets, so there are only one or two who tamed dark drakes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What is good about drakes with the dark attribute?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Like bone dragons, their body is made of bone. To be precise, they are undead. Their stamina is infinite.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wow... Does that mean they don’t get tired? Isn’t it a scam? Can’t you travel anywhere on the continent with a dark drake?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That doesn’t mean there are no restrictions. The bones in the body must be replaced from time to time because their durability is worn down. And they have a chronic weakness. They are significantly less intelligent than other drakes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dark drakes were so dumb that they couldn’t carry out complex orders. So in terms of battle, they were weak.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the amazing thing was that their stamina was infinite.&nbsp;</span><span style>This pet marathon.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a simple contest about who would reach the goal first.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>No matter how stupid a dark drake was, they could participate in the simple pet marathon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...He might have a dark drake.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>People had high expectations.&nbsp;</span><span style>The target processing and PvP.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid had showed shocking appearances since he first emerged in the National Competition, so it wouldn’t be strange for him to tame a dark drake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The creature that Grid summoned wasn’t the strongest pet, but a small cat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, what...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The expressions of the spectators and viewers instantly became disappointed.&nbsp;</span><span style>But that only lasted for a short time.&nbsp;</span><span style>People started laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gwiyeopda.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Cute...!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kawaii~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Mignon!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Niedlich~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Carino!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Lindo...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bellus~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Korean, English, Japanese, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Latin and so on.&nbsp;</span><span style>The word for cute in different languages simultaneously emerged.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even people who weren’t usually interested in cats were excited.&nbsp;</span><span style>In particular, the children and girls who loved cute things started to flock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mother! Buy me that!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Honey~ let’s raise a cat. Yes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The cat that Grid summoned.&nbsp;</span><span style>It had the typical appearance of a Persian cat.&nbsp;</span><span style>Together with the color of its fur, it was very unique and attractive.&nbsp;</span><span style>Only the paws were white, while the rest of the cat was completely black.&nbsp;</span><span style>If they saw it in the middle of the night, it would look like four white paws floating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Furthermore, it had little devil wings.&nbsp;</span><span style>It flapped its wings and flew around Grid, looking very mysterious. It was like something from a fairy tale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The commentators were captivated by the cute appearance for a while before asking the pet experts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 What is that winged cat? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 ... 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>None of the four famous pet experts could open their mouths.&nbsp;</span><span style>All of them were unfamiliar with the winged cat.&nbsp;</span><span style>But they were able to be sure of one thing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 That cat will become the prey of the drakes. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was something that no one could deny.&nbsp;</span><span style>A cat couldn’t go against the strongest monster, a drake.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was a huge difference in size.&nbsp;</span><span style>A drake was 3m long, while the cat was only 40cm.&nbsp;</span><span style>The drakes would eat this cat! Swallow it in one gulp! It was edible enough to be swallowed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That cute cat is so pitiful...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>People felt sad.&nbsp;</span><span style>Meanwhile, the pet marathon participants were laughing at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cat? Haha! I thought a legendary class would have the best pet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pet taming isn’t an easy thing to do. He must have no talent, no talent. Kilkil.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"How good would it be if he could create an item to assist with pet taming? Right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"But it’s too much. That cat is too much. I know that South Korea is a country without any drakes, but... No matter what, he intends to enter with a cat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"That's right. Shouldn’t it at least be a griffon? Griffons are called the prey of drakes. But at least a griffon would be better against the drakes than a cat.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Originally, South Korea was a country that should’ve come last in the National Competition.&nbsp;</span><span style>But thanks to Grid, they became ranked third.&nbsp;</span><span style>The foreign players wanted to relieve their grudge, so they sneered at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid snorted.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Enjoy your babbling while you can.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe.&nbsp;</span><span style>A memphis wasn’t a cat.&nbsp;</span><span style>His appearance was incredibly cute, but in fact, he was fearsome.&nbsp;</span><span style>He even had the ‘strongest in hell’ attached to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These ridiculous things.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid laughed at the participants before glancing at Noe.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, Noe was a little strange.&nbsp;</span><span style>The brave cat he saw the other day was currently shaking for some reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid detected Noe’s anxiety and checked the status window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Name: Noe</span></p>
 <p><span style>Species: Memphis</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level: 1 (0/200)</span></p>
 <p><span style>Affinity: 5/100</span></p>
 <p><span style>Health: 5,000/5,000</span></p>
 <p><span style>Physical Attack Power: 60 &nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Attack Power: 30</span></p>
 <p><span style>Defense: 50 &nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Resistance: 80</span></p>
 <p><span style>Attribute: Dark</span></p>
 <p><span style>Status: Fearful</span></p>
 <p><span style>(What is this, nyang? Why are there so many dragons, nyang? Kyak! Crazy Master is trying to feed me to dragons! Nyang! Save me, nyang!)</span></p>
 <p><span style>A memphis was cleverer and stronger than many demonkin, making it beloved by the great demons.&nbsp;</span><span style>Indeed, there were no shortage of demonic beasts in hell.&nbsp;</span><span style>They had high pride and it was rare for them to be intimidated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the story was different when it came to dragons.&nbsp;</span><span style>Dragons were the strongest creature in all of hell and on the earth.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were the only things a memphis was afraid of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"D-Dragons are scary! Nyang!”&nbsp;</span><span style>Noe mistook the smell of the drakes for the dragons, so he jumped into Grid’s arms. Then Noe shook his head with closed eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>“This evil master! Are you going to throw me towards dragon as food? Nyang! You will go to hell when you die! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe grumbled with resentment.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was baffled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This is hell’s strongest demonic beast. Yet he’s afraid of drakes?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was completely disappointing.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid clicked his tongue and grabbed Noe. However, Noe immediately struggled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Save Noe! Save me! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe cried out loudly with a protruding stomach!&nbsp;</span><span style>His short legs were moving and it was tearful at the frightening thought that Grid would thrown him to the dragons.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a pathetic appearance, but Grid was indifferent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you want to live, fly hard and avoid the drakes. You will be safe once you arrive at your destination.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the strongest demonic beast in hell.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid trusted Noe. This guy was still a baby, but Grid was sure that he was better than the drakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Go!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid forcefully pushed Noe at the enemies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This evil bastard! Remove your hand! Nyang! Save Noe! Nyang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand.&nbsp;</span><span style>People were indignant.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was because the appearance of Grid and Noe was caught on screen for all to see.</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Oh my... That cat is really terrified. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 It is amazing that a cat has wings. Then calling it Slave... Is Slave the name of the cat? 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 This is a truly sad sight! It isn’t enough that Grid treats his pet as a slave, but now he is abusing it when the whole world is watching? This is too much! 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>『 Even if this is virtual reality, it is too much to abuse an animal. It’s clear that the animal protection groups will be in an uproar. In particular, this is a scene that will adversely affect young children’s emotional development. Any parents should cover their children’s eyes at this moment. 』</span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd was booing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Grid, you bastard! Don’t bother the cat!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Making such a cute cat participate in the pet marathon, he’s a sick man!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We can’t show our daughter the sight of a cat being eaten by the drakes! The competition’s committee members should have Grid leave immediately!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Treating a small animal as a slave! What a demon!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"The frightened cat is so pitiful... Sob sob...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Mother, that cat, is it going to be eaten by the drakes?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhh! Scary!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young children even started to cry. In their eyes, Grid looked like a demon.&nbsp;</span><span style>There was great confusion.&nbsp;</span><span style>The committee members were worried about whether they should really leave Grid alone.&nbsp;</span><span style>But the players logged into Satisfy had no idea of the circumstances.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tatang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The commentator confirmed the time and fired a magic bullet.&nbsp;</span><span style>Regardless of the outside situation, the pet marathon started.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Nyang?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe had mistaken the smell of a drake for a dragon.&nbsp;</span><span style>As he was being troubled by Grid, he heard the sound of the magic bullet and his spirit cleared.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then his emerald eyes looked at the drakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...You aren’t a dragon, nyang?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Noe regained his mind.&nbsp;</span><span style>“These lizard bastards tricked me! Kyaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noe wasn’t nervous anymore.&nbsp;</span><span style>His status changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Status: Angry</span></p>
 <p><span style>(What are these lizards? Nyang! I thought they were dragons, but they are actually food! Nyang! Daring to deceive a great demonic beast of hell! Nyang! I won’t forgive them! Nyang nyang!)</span></p>
 <p><span style>The great demon Hell Gao compared the speed of the pavranium to a memphis.&nbsp;</span><span style>But to be precise, a memphis was much faster than the pavranium.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the fastest creature in hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kyaak!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment the pet marathon started, an amazing sight unfolded.&nbsp;</span><span style>Noe’s small mouth opened to a gigantic size and swallowed the body of a drake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“U-Uhh...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The master of the swallowed drake was frightened.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then an absurd notification window appeared in his vision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your drake Johnson’s movement speed has dropped by 50%.] &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Numerous notification windows popped up in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Your memphis Noe’s movement speed has increased by 50%.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Soul Ingestion Lv. 1]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Has the ability to take away half of the target’s highest stats and transfer it to your master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Skill Cooldown Time: Your own decision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the moment when the effect of ‘transferring to your master’ from Soul Ingestion was activated.</span></p>
