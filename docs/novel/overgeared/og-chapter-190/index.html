 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>One and a half years ago in Satisfy time.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a story when Grid was still level 21 after becoming Pagma’s Descendant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘How about an item production game over the smithy?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Mero Company was exploiting the residents of Winston, when Rabbit came to Khan and made a suggestion.&nbsp;</span><span style>From Khan’s point of view, accepting the offer and winning the game was the only way to keep the smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Khan was an alcoholic and not in a position to play. He couldn’t fully demonstrate his abilities as a blacksmith.&nbsp;</span><span style>So Khan asked Grid to participate in the game for him. Grid was blinded by the compensation and readily accepted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He competed with Euphemina, who was hired by the Mero Company, to make an item.&nbsp;</span><span style>The result was Grid’s loss.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid would’ve won if the contest was normal, but due to the tyranny of the Mero Company, he was arrested during the contest and locked in prison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The situation was desperate.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was unlucky enough to fail the quest and was fuming in prison. He was completely out of his mind, screaming that the game gods had cursed him.&nbsp;</span><span style>But then an unexpected savior appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Euphemina.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to her help, Grid was able to regain the Ideal Dagger, rescue Huroi, and gain the title ‘Apostle of Justice.’&nbsp;</span><span style>Strictly speaking, Euphemina was Grid’s savior.&nbsp;</span><span style>But.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m not pleased at all.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was uncomfortable reuniting with Euphemina. He was reminded of old memories and positive sentiment was unwelcome.&nbsp;</span><span style>It wasn’t because he had bad feelings towards Euphemina.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was just scared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I can’t produce a unique rated orb... what will she do?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid didn’t know about the disadvantages of the Duplicator class, and he thought Euphemina was the best OP. He was suspicious of anyone stronger than him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Euphemina wanted at least a unique rated orb in exchange for returning the Ideal Dagger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What if he didn’t meet her expectations?&nbsp;</span><span style>Would she PK him if he completed a normal or rare rated orb?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was really scared.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t afford to endure the bombardment of Euphemina’s best spells.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s been a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other hand, Euphemina was very glad to see Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the past, Grid deliberately (?) acted foolish, but he actually had a legendary class.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was glad about the fact that the famous Pagma's Descendant would make her an item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I watched your great performance in the National Competition on TV. You were really cool.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina greeted him with charming eyes, and boasted an outstanding beauty that attracted people’s attention.&nbsp;</span><span style>The onlookers made a fuss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Who’s that girl?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Seriously adorable. I want to put her in my pocket.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn Grid... He already has Yura and Jishuka, now there’s this girl. I’m seriously envious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Beauties always follow the heroes. God Grid deserves to be king of the harem."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina had a short height of 150cm and a small figure. The innocent face was cute and stimulated a protective instinct. Some men were filled with desire towards her.&nbsp;</span><span style>But she didn’t suit Grid’s taste. Grid favoured a mature body more than Euphemina’s childish one.&nbsp;</span><span style>Therefore, Grid could be calm without being swayed by Euphemina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are many eyes watching. Let’s talk after moving.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>'That attitude is still present.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was like this the last time they met. He was indifferent to her beauty. No matter how lovely her eyes, he never noticed it. She even suspected if he was gay or impotent.&nbsp;</span><span style>But he got into a scandal with Yura and Jishuka during the National Competition.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina’s pride was hurt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Are Yura and Jishuka better than me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She ran after Grid’s party with puffed up cheeks and they soon arrived at Winston Castle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Welcome!"</span></p>
 <p><span style>The soldiers saluted Grid and hurriedly opened the gates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"You worked hard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid naturally greeted the soldiers and entered.&nbsp;</span><span style>Euphemina admired him.&nbsp;</span><span style>"You seem to have become a noble?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the overall level of users increased in rec ent years, quite a few rankers had become nobles.&nbsp;</span><span style>Experts speculated that there were at least 15 rankers who were awarded the title of a baron.&nbsp;</span><span style>Euphemina also wanted to become a baron. As expected, a legendary class was truly great.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then the boy with the ID of Lauel said unexpectedly.&nbsp;</span><span style>"He is a viscount. In addition, he is the husband of Lady Winston.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina was stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wasn’t a baron, but a viscount?&nbsp;</span><span style>He was at the same level as masters of large guilds like Zibal and Chris?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘And Lady Winston...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Irene.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was the only successor of Earl Steim, one of the supreme powers in the Eternal Kingdom.&nbsp;</span><span style>Her marriage was significant enough to cause an uproar in the world.&nbsp;</span><span style>But her undisclosed marriage partner was a user, not a noble NPC?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It was Grid...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t get married to a noble just because he had a legendary class.&nbsp;</span><span style>The relationship between Grid and Irene was obviously deeper than anyone imagined. That type of bond couldn’t be gained by accident.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Euphemina misunderstood that Grid intentionally approached Irene to marry her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Marrying a female NPC, he is playing a completely different game from others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was like the dating simulation games that girls liked to play.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Amazing.’&nbsp;</span><span style>Euphemina’s eyes shone brightly like lanterns as she watched Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>‘The first legendary class person transcends common sense.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was the first person whose skills couldn’t be duplicated by Euphemina.&nbsp;</span><span style>Therefore, she tended to overestimate Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>During the National Competition, people ignored Grid for his lacking control. But she thought differently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There is no need for control, as he can just roughly use his skills.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was proven right by Grid’s overwhelming actions in PvP.&nbsp;</span><span style>It might be a fate that started badly, but Euphemina was proud that she knew Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid didn’t know her inner thoughts. He had no interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Did you obtain all the materials needed to make the orb?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Winston Castle’s smithy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid asked in a blunt voice as he lit the furnace.&nbsp;</span><span style>Euphemina felt unhappy at his continued apathetic attitude and responded with a sullen face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Of course. It took me a year to get the orb production method and then six months to obtain all the ingredients listed. My preparation is perfect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘One year? Half a year?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Was she crazy?&nbsp;</span><span style>Investing a year and a half just to make a single item?&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid thought Euphemina was a fool.&nbsp;</span><span style>But in reality, Euphemina was extremely normal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Users played the game with specific goals.&nbsp;</span><span style>The characteristic of heavy game users was doing their best to achieve that goal, no matter how long it took, while light game users gave up when it became difficult.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina was a level 283 private ranker, so of course she was a heavy user.&nbsp;</span><span style>She didn’t think it was strange to invest a year and a half to obtaining the best orb. It was just the way she enjoyed the game.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the past, Grid was also like her.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was someone who discovered Pagma’s Rare Book after a few months of hard work without giving up.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid had changed.&nbsp;</span><span style>He forgot how to enjoy playing the game because he considered it as a means of making money.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was impossible for the current Grid to understand Euphemina.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'She truly is scary.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t upset her.&nbsp;</span><span style>He didn’t want to imagine what type of terrible things would happen if he broke Euphemina’s year and a half of hard work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'It must be at least a unique rating.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid pledged.&nbsp;</span><span style>He prayed to the gods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'God, Buddha, Goddess Rebecca, God Judar, God Dominion, please protect my experience.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid might not be religious, but he didn’t reject the existence of a god.&nbsp;</span><span style>He sincerely prayed to the popular gods in reality and Satisfy.&nbsp;</span><span style>He begged them to help him make a unique rated orb.&nbsp;</span><span style>After a short prayer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s begin.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid braced his heart and cut to the chase.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’m asking you, the legendary blacksmith.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina handed Grid the production method that she took a year to obtain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[’Mumud’s Orb Production Method’ has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘...Mumud?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The name of the most powerful orb was truly terrible. He was disappointed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s like Dainsleif.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid had no idea who Mumud was. So he was surprised when he opened the production method.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Mumud’s Orb Production Method]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Learning Conditions:</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mastered the Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship skill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Or have Dwarven Blacksmith’s Craftmanship skill level 5 or higher.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Mumud’s Orb</span></p>
 <p><span style>An orb designed by the dwarven craftsman Milepeu, who taught Pagma before he became a legend.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was widely known as Mumud’s Orb because Braham’s disciple, Mumud, loved this orb all of his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It needed the blacksmith craftsmanship skill to be mastered?&nbsp;</span><span style>The learning conditions were unusually high. It was the highest level among all the production methods that Grid had acquired so far.&nbsp;</span><span style>Even Albatino, who was called the greatest blacksmith before Pagma’s appearance, wouldn’t be able to make this orb.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In other words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘This orb, it’s an item of a higher rank than Dainsleif.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a precious production method he got for free, without having to pay for it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Euphemina hadn’t wasted the year and half that she invested in this.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid thanked Euphemina. He felt appreciation towards her for the first time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Euphemina.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina was surprised when Grid called her name for the first time.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid promised her,&nbsp;</span><span style>"I will do my best."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The reunion after one and a half years.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid never paid attention to Euphemina even once.&nbsp;</span><span style>But his attitude changed at this moment.&nbsp;</span><span style>He gazed at her with calm eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style>His facial expression made him look like an entirely different man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Euphemina felt confident in him and smiled brightly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Thank you."</span></p>
 <p><span style>A notification window appeared in front of Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[’Mumud’s Orb Production Method’ has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Interesting.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a rare opportunity to create the best item.&nbsp;</span><span style>As a blacksmith, Grid was very motivated.</span></p>
