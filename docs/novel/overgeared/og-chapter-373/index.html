 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>'I haven’t grown enough.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s total health in his blackened state was slightly less than 30,000. Tiramet could kill him in just 3~4 hits.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid had endured it.&nbsp;</span><span style>The attacks with a relatively easy orbit were directly blocked and avoided, while he relied on the God Hands and Randy for the attacks that were difficult to cope with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid’s self-evaluation of his control and ability to use items.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘There’s still a long way to go.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wasn’t satisfied.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was a fact that the enemies he would face in the future would continue to be strong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Is there a definitive way to become stronger? No matter how much control I develop, it’s impossible to not get hit at all during a battle.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>What if he made an item that received hits?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A simple example is a damage reflective item.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Or,</span> <span style>‘Armor with a black hole? I will drag the enemies that hit me to another dimension.’&nbsp;</span><span style>It was fun to imagine fanciful things.&nbsp;</span><span style>For Grid, imagination was a type of power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Why?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have the Item Creation skill.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were many items in Satisfy that had functions that Grid didn’t know yet. Grid’s imagination meant he had infinite possibilities.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid believed in his own potential and grasped the Rune of Darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Rune of Darkness]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bound Item</span></p>
 <p><span style>It is permanently preserved in your inventory. Trading, dropping, or destroying it is impossible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>-Usage Effect: Demonic power state will rise in exchange for its use.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Normal attacks and skill attacks will deal an addition 20% dark damage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unique Lasting Effect: When dealing with named demonkin and demons, you can absorb unique attributes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* Tiramet’s Power: If your health drops below 10%, health will be restored to 30% in an instant. Cooldown Time: 12 hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘My survivability is getting higher.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid observed the Rune of Darkness and came up with one idea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It would be ideal to be a pure tanker.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were many damage dealers in Overgeared, but few tankers.&nbsp;</span><span style>The only tankers to be relied on were Vantner and Toban.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If I become a tanker, the synergy with the guild will explode...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>He imagined himself armed with heavy armor and shields.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he frowned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'...Then Pagma’s Swordsmanship will be useless.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid was someone with the strongest attack skills. It was a waste of talent to turn into a pure tanker.&nbsp;</span><span style>But when he thought about it more, it wasn’t the case.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘No, can’t I swap between items?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>What if he had an offensive set and defensive set that could be swapped if necessary?</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It would be easier to cope with a sudden situation like the Tiramet raid.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The appearance of the concentrating Grid was mature and gentle.&nbsp;</span><span style>Yura’s gem-like eyes were wet as she watched him.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>"It’s dirty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s been a long time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The east side of the first floor of the castle, where towering pillars spread out like a forest.&nbsp;</span><span style>The irritation of Pon and Vantner were soaring.&nbsp;</span><span style>They were angry at the tricks of Ran, the vampire baron who attacked through the darkness and the pillars.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The terrain is too much of a disadvantage. I would rather break it all down.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Crunch.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Pon greatly twisted the arm holding the spear.&nbsp;</span><span style>His muscles swelled up as he gathered his strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Crasher Spear.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It destroyed everything in its path.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style>It was a powerful attack that would even make the allies afraid.&nbsp;</span><span style>The spear cut from top to bottom, causing the towers to collapse. Then the shadow hiding behind the pillars came into view.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner didn’t miss this opportunity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sun Guard!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fla~sh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner’s shield shone like the sun and drove away the darkness.&nbsp;</span><span style>The light rays were so bright that it was reminiscent of a nightclub.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ran no longer had a place to hide and fired magic bullets at the two people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It isn’t a big deal!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The magic was laughable compared to Elfin Stone.&nbsp;</span><span style>Vantner blocked the magic bullets with his shield, while Pon flew through the dust and tried to aim his spear...&nbsp;</span><span style>But Vantner ran ahead and interfered with Pon’s path.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You damn pig!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon staggered as he was hit by Vantner’s massive body. Vantner also cried out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You idiot! There is a path in front of you. Why run towards me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why do I need to explain each reason individually? You ignorant bastard.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon and Vantner growled at each other.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to this, Ran passed the crisis and was able to escape through the pillars in the rear that hadn’t yet collapsed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I’m glad that their teamwork is a mess.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ran thought with relief and fired magic from behind a pillar.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jiing.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The red flash broke the ceiling and the falling debris restrained Pon and Vantner’s actions.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ran moved back through the darkness and aimed sharp nails at Pon’s neck.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The blood red nails pierced a hole in Pon’s neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Puhaha! You were hit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Vantner laughed and taunted Pon.&nbsp;</span><span style>The journey of the two people was long and harsh.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>[The blacksmith who became a legend can appraise items with an excellent discerning eye. If a hidden feature exists in the target item, it will be found.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[A hidden function doesn’t exist.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid appraised Alex’s gun.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was somewhat disappointed with the results and moved quickly with Yura, Sticks, and Bini.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Over there is the closest.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sticks borrowed the power of the earth and wind elementals to figure out where a battle was occurring.&nbsp;</span><span style>He also allowed Grid to enter the vampire city, so he was helpful in many ways.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘But he didn’t give me an item...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yura got Alex’s gun for free. Grid couldn’t help feeling a bit jealous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... Eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid moved through the door that Sticks indicated and made an absurd expression. It was the same for Yura who followed behind him.&nbsp;</span><span style>The reason?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You useless octopus head!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I would’ve died earlier if I wasn’t a tanker!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you weren’t there, the vampire baron would be killed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was evidence of destruction through the room.&nbsp;</span><span style>There were still dozens of pillars left and Pon and Vantner were fighting each other.&nbsp;</span><span style>It was in front of the enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hohohohut!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kuk!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How rotten!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because they were grabbing each other’s collars, Pon and Vantner weren’t free.&nbsp;</span><span style>The two men allowed the female vampire to attack and retreat behind the pillars, causing Grid to feel anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I won’t say anything about the personal relationship between the two of you. But...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Step, step.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid moved and used Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Restraint.&nbsp;</span><span style>Ran, who was flying to the new target Grid like a moth to the fire, stopped in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ran’s body started sweating as Grid activated Pagma’s Swordsmanship, Pinnacle, then followed up with Kill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Kyaaak!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ran let out a terrible scream and rushed towards Pon and Vantner.&nbsp;</span><span style>She was released from Restraint and attempted to hide in the darkness, but Yura didn’t allow it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Purification Bullet."</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tatatang!</span></i> <i><span style>Tang tang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The bullets made from blue mana turned Ran’s body into a beehive.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Linked Kill.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puok!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Grid neatly finished it off.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Vampire Baron Ran has been destroyed.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[525,810,470 experience has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Two Blessed Weapon Enhancement Stones have been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Seven weapon enhancement stones have been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Skillbook: Dark Fairy Tale has been acquired.]</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Swaaah.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Blood poured out and a black smoke rose.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the meantime, Grid sent a very sharp and intimidating look towards Pon and Vantner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"In the future, fight in the appropriate time and place. Think about the pain that your colleagues are going through while you unnecessarily waste time here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t an exaggeration.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid ran here from the Behen Archipelago for his colleagues.&nbsp;</span><span style>He couldn’t stand Pon and Vantner, who ignored their colleagues because of personal feelings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...I'm sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will be careful in the future."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon and Vantner bowed and apologized.&nbsp;</span><span style>They understood the reason why Grid was angry and acknowledged their mistakes, and were also aware of Grid as their leader.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid reached out to the two people who couldn’t lift their heads.&nbsp;</span><span style>Was it an offer to shake hands so that they weren’t too discouraged?&nbsp;</span><span style>Pon and Vantner interpreted Grid’s gesture in this way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lend me a spear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Grid made an unpredictable demand.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>A large hall on the first floor of the castle.&nbsp;</span><span style>Faker was struggling in a place where chandeliers hung like ornaments.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kuuong!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The vampire baron, Mountain.&nbsp;</span><span style>He wore unusually heavy armor and used a heavy weapon for a vampire. The ground shook every time he moved, threatening Faker’s sense of balance.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chaaeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Faker, whose posture collapsed and was slow to react, blocked the mace with his dagger.&nbsp;</span><span style>Faker used the recoil that occurred when the weapons collided to float in the air like a feather, while Mountain reached out a hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blood Binding.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kwarururung!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Blood chains rose up and surrounded Faker’s body.&nbsp;</span><span style>But it was merely Faker’s clone.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The chains exploded and the remnants of Faker’s clone filled the air.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Suuk.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Faker took advantage of the swiftness of his class and appeared behind Mountain.&nbsp;</span><span style>He swung at Mountain’s thick neck.&nbsp;</span><span style>Faker aimed precisely at the gap in the armor joints.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Puk puk!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As the number of hits increase, the damage built up.&nbsp;</span><span style>The blow, that caused a deadly blow to Elfin Stone, pierced Mountain’s neck in succession.&nbsp;</span><span style>No emotions appeared in Faker’s eyes as blood soaked his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You rat bastard..!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mountain shook from the shock and released magic power in every direction.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to that, Faker flew back.&nbsp;</span><span style>A large axe flew at him as he tried to regain his balance in the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘I have to allow this.’ </span></p>
 <p><span style>If he used ‘Flash’ here, his mana and skills linkage would become twisted.&nbsp;</span><span style>It happened when Faker was preparing for the shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Spear Shot.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Kurururu!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Peeng!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A silver-white spear flew from the entrance and penetrated Mountain’s head.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to that, Faker was able to avoid the large axe whose obit was changed, and he moved his face towards the entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, Pon... Grid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He never imagined that Grid would be the person who saved him.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid waved at Faker, who had a rare look of shock in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"To be driven on the defensive, isn’t this too bad?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faker was someone who was often beside Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>He was reminded of this and shrugged at Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"...But with you, I can be extraordinary.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a signal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These damn humans!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mountain’s aggro shifted to Grid and Grid handled it as always.&nbsp;</span><span style>Thanks to him blocking Mountain, Faker could move like he had wings on his back. Once Vantner and Yura stepped in, Mountain quickly became scarred.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My spear. My spear...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pon was busy reclaiming his spear.</span></p>
