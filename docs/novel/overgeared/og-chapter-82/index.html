 <p><span style> ‘Okay...!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I rejoiced as the production method for the Divine Shield entered my hands and the administrator urged me.&nbsp;</span><span style>“There’s no time! There’s a smithy in the castle, so make the shield there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I couldn’t even waste time going back and forth from Khan’s smithy?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I need to buy the materials needed to make it, so I have to stop by the market.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I will give you a servant to do all the menial work.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"If you say so...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I headed straight to the smithy in the castle.&nbsp;</span><span style>The level of the blacksmith was much lower than Khan, but the facilities were comparable to Khan’s smithy.&nbsp;</span><span style>I opened the scroll.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Do you want to learn how to make the Divine Shield?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[You have learned how to make the Divine Shield.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Divine Shield]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rating: Rare ~ Legendary</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rare Rating Information:</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 360/360 &nbsp;Defense: 189 &nbsp;Magic Resistance: 150</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a rare chance of completely resisting dark spells.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Epic Rating Information:</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 430/430 &nbsp;Defense: 230 &nbsp;Magic Resistance: 181</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a certain probability of completely resisting dark spells.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unique Rating Information:</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 510/510 &nbsp;Defense: 295 &nbsp;Magic Resistance: 238</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a certain probability of completely resisting dark spells.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The skill ‘Divine Light’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Legendary Rating Information:</span></p>
 <p><span style>Durability: 680/680 &nbsp;Defense: 370 &nbsp;Magic Resistance: 280</span></p>
 <p><span style>* There is a high chance of completely resisting dark spells.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The skill ‘Divine Light’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>* The skill ‘Divine Favor’ will be generated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A shield that contains the power of Rebecca, the goddess of Light. Due to its strength against dark magic, all followers of demons and the Yatan Church will suffer when facing this shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Conditions of Use: &nbsp;Level 190 or more. More than 500 strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>More than 1,000 divine power. A member of the Rebecca Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Weight: 800&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘The minimum rating is rare...’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I checked the details of the Divine Shield and the list of materials required.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘A magic stone is in the centre and will be the medium to inject the divine power. Mithril will be used for the skeleton then covered in steel. And gold plating? I need gold?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rebecca, the goddess of light, had two symbols. One was the sun and the second was gold.&nbsp;</span><span style>It meant a large amount of gold was required to make the Divine Shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Magic stones, mithril and gold. The value of the materials is great. This is truly a luxury item.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The main ingredients needed to make the shield were one top grade magic stone, 2kg of mithril ore, 15kg of iron ore and 400g of gold.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>I had the helper that the administrator lent me a list of materials needed to make two shields.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while.&nbsp;</span><span style>The helper came with the ingredients and submitted a receipt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The total purchase cost is 16,935 gold and 20 silver.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I needed this much money to make just two shields! This was close to my entire fortune!</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Even if it is guaranteed to be finished with at least the rare rating... if the materials cost is too high, I will receive damage if it ends up with just a rare rating.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>The administrator needed a Divine Shield that had at least the epic rating. In the worst case, if only rare shields were created, I would have to sell it elsewhere. However, the terms of use meant it was limited to the Rebecca Church.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Ah, this is shit.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was ominous. I didn’t like it.&nbsp;</span><span style>I thought about giving up the quest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'But even if the materials are expensive...the profits will be higher if an epic rating emerges.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two shields, one of which must have at least the epic rating!&nbsp;</span><span style>After a long period of thinking, I made a decision and took out a hammer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will make it.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ttang!</span></i> <i><span style>Ttang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The quest duration was only two days.&nbsp;</span><span style>I immediately began smelting steel and mithril. Suddenly, I was surprised to see Cassus standing quietly at the wall behind me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'What? He’s still here?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cassus seemed to have followed me from the administrator’s office. But he didn’t have any presence, so I wasn’t aware he was behind me.&nbsp;</span><span style>An expressionless face! Pale skin! Those rotten eyes!&nbsp;</span><span style>It was the pious appearance of a priest of the goddess of light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Excuse me, Mr. Cassus?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Why don’t you go rest? Your turn won’t be for a while.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cassus shook his head.&nbsp;</span><span style>"I appreciate the courtesy, but I can’t. You can’t suffer alone. I will pray to Goddess Rebecca while watching. It will be a prayer to help you produce a great shield.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unlike my first impression, he was a good person. But it wasn’t all good.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Don’t you know that I don’t want to see that ghastly face?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I suppressed the words I wanted to say and devoted myself to the production.&nbsp;</span><span style>How much time passed?&nbsp;</span><span style>As the night deepened, the other blacksmith fell asleep.&nbsp;</span><span style>I finally finished smelting the mithril, which was quite a struggle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, mithril is a tricky material.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The moment I took a break to take out bread and water...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hiik!</span></p>
 <p><span style>I freaked out as I heard a voice behind me. I turned around to see Cassus holding cheese in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Y-You! Have you been standing there the whole time?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cassus nodded and replied with an expressionless face.&nbsp;</span><span style>“Yes. I have been praying.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"No, to be honest, praying doesn’t help anything so just go and relax...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cassus’ face changed for the first time. He lightly frowned.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Rebecca is the goddess of light. This light encompasses all positive energy, including good luck. My prayer will surely invoke your good luck.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When I thought about it, I made a mistake disparaging prayer in front of a religious person. I didn’t want such a frightening person to have a grudge against me.&nbsp;</span><span style>I nodded.&nbsp;</span><span style>“I see. I am ignorant about faith and made a mistake. I’m sorry. Then please continue to pray.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.”&nbsp;</span><span style>Cassus immediately joined his hands together, closed his eyes and started praying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He is a very active person.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I started work again after eating the bread and cheese from Cassus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Then one hour later.&nbsp;</span><span style>I fixed the magic stone to the mithril skeleton and called out to the praying Cassus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Now it is your turn. Infuse it with divine power.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cassus stepped forward silently. He fell to his knees in front of the magic stone and started praying to Goddess Rebecca.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh~! In the name of Goddess Rebecca!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Blah blah.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He started an even longer prayer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘He didn’t sit down and prayed all night, but he still has this much stamina... Amazing.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I became drowsy.&nbsp;</span><span style>I fell asleep and woke up when I heard Cassus’ gentle voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Grid, the divine power infusion is over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hiik!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as I opened my eyes, I saw Cassus’ pale face and dark eyes. This bastard, he was a priest but he looked more like a demon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"What's wrong?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>Did he have to ask? Has he looked in the mirror?&nbsp;</span><span style>I wanted to confront Cassus, but I refrained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It is nothing. Now shall I begin?"</span></p>
 <p><span style>I continued to make the shield until the sun came up.&nbsp;</span><span style>I spent 23 hours making the shield.&nbsp;</span><span style>I usually invested 20 hours when making an item, but this time was different. I didn’t willingly invested 23 hours to make one. I needed 23 hours to make it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It’s difficult.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dealing with mithril and the magic stone was very difficult. It would be different if my experience was higher, but it was hard for the current me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘It requires Advanced Blacksmith Mastery level 3 or higher, so isn’t it a difficult item to make? Experience also plays an important role.'</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy pursued realism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Even if a user had the same level and skill, the user who had more experience with the skill would use it more efficiently.&nbsp;</span><span style>Item production was similar.&nbsp;</span><span style>As Pagma's Descendant, I knew how to smelt mithril. However, since I had never actually smelted mithril, I needed to spend a lot of time smelting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>'Well, now that I’ve accumulated some experience, I can make the next shield faster.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I embarked on the production of the second shield.&nbsp;</span><span style>The blacksmith watching from the side questioned me.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Haven’t you made one shield up to the stage just before completion? You only have the gold plating left, so why are you working on a new shield instead of finishing it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>"I want to complete both at the same time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>I told the blacksmith the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘If the first shield I complete has a rare rating, my motivation will completely fall. It is better not knowing the rating until it is over.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>I only had enough materials to make two shields. So I was going to complete both at the same time and wish that one of them would be above the epic rating.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style>***</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Lim Cheolho, the CEO of the S.A Group and developer of Satisfy, was rumored to work 20 out of 24 hours. People thought that Lim Cheolho only took a break to sleep.&nbsp;</span><span style>But that was somewhat exaggerated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lim Cheolho also had a separate rest time.&nbsp;</span><span style>He lay comfortably on the office sofa for one hour a day to monitor Satisfy’s users.&nbsp;</span><span style>In the last few days, Lim Cheolho was intensively monitoring Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Hoh, indeed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lim Cheolho kept exclaiming. His eyes were shining, like a child watching an exciting cartoon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How interesting.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He meant it.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lim Cheolho was greatly interested in Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid didn’t play the game efficiently, unlike most users. Nor did he use any shortcuts. He played simply and honestly. Whenever he made an item, he invested 20 hours of Satisfy time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wasn’t this too pure?&nbsp;</span><span style>Lim Cheolho liked this type of pureness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha! This is ridiculous! He defeated a level 188 knight in such a lucky manner! Ohh, he received a partnership offer from a NPC? How refreshing. Huh, Grid’s works achieved the highest auction prices. Oh my...it is too much to sell a legendary item to a NPC. But it is really fun watching such a user. Um? He didn’t recognize Doran’s ring that Irene is holding? Isn’t this a pity? If he did, his relationship with Irene would grow. Hoh, creating a transparent cloak is a smart choice. Um? In the end, he isn’t even trying to make the invisibility cloak? Well, he’ll be able to make it someday. Ohh! A two-man raid! Hrmm, he got a lot of levels and some items, but I would’ve liked it if he focused more on finding Pagma’s Swordsmanship. Okay, he finally found Pagma’s Swordsmanship. No? Hahaha! Imitating the murals for hours! What a masterpiece!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sometimes Lim Cheolho was complimentary, sometimes he was regretful, sometimes admiring and sometimes excited when he watched Grid.&nbsp;</span><span style>Then he got angry for the first time at a certain part.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No! Why did he turn down Piaro’s quest? It would’ve been a good result!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Asmophel, who Piaro asked to be punished, was now severely ill. Grid would be able to clear the quest. Then he would receive a great reward.&nbsp;</span><span style>But Grid was overly cautious and missed the golden opportunity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"He has changed since Kesan Canyon. At first, he acted in an unplanned and impromptu manner, but now he has his own plans. But he is still inexperienced and immature...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Director Yoon Sangmin called Grid a fool. It was because Grid couldn’t properly exert the efficiency of a legendary class.&nbsp;</span><span style>Lim Cheolho had laughed, but as he watched, it felt like he understood a little bit of Yoon Sangmin’s frustration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One day, Yoon Sangmin had said this:</span></p>
 <p><span style>'If I was Grid, I would’ve joined a guild. No matter how low my level, I would be able to sign up to a top level guild just because I have a legendary class. Then I would grow with the support of the guild. They would support the cost of items and help with quests. Wouldn’t he clear the class quest sooner if he had the support of a guild? By now, I would’ve moved with a larger goal! But he doesn’t have the capacity and is trying to do everything alone. He doesn’t move with any great plans. He is just staying in a smithy and making items.’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was true.&nbsp;</span><span style>Most people would probably think like Yoon Sangmin. He was confident that he could do better if he was Grid.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Lim Cheolho questioned it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is it fun to play like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Satisfy was already recognized as another reality. People who considered Satisfy a mere game were rare.&nbsp;</span><span style>Success in Satisfy would equal success in reality. Therefore, users who played Satisfy only pursued efficiency.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Satisfy was essentially a game. Lim Cheolho produced Satisfy for it to be enjoyed by people. So users should enjoy playing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Those who played like others might soon lose interest in the game.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lim Cheolho didn’t want that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"It isn’t obliged to have an obsession with Satisfy. Grid should play as he likes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Lim Cheolho overlooked one thing.&nbsp;</span><span style>While watching Grid, Lim Cheolho thought that Grid was a user who simply enjoyed playing the game. However, the reality was quite different.&nbsp;</span><span style>Grid was playing Satisfy with the hopes of succeeding. He just didn’t have the ability!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”&nbsp;</span><span style>Lim Cheolho saw the administrator of Winston Castle commission Grid to make the shield, as well as the priest of the Rebecca Church.&nbsp;</span><span style>“This...?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lim Cheolho brought his wristwatch to his mouth and spoke.&nbsp;</span><span style>"Morpheus."</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a moment, a voice was heard from Lim Cheolho’s watch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>[Did you call me?]</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Please search the list of NPCs currently in G-HFO6C1E. Is Isabel among them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>[No.]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Doubt appeared on Lim Cheolho’s face.</span></p>
